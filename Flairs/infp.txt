Interesting idea. I await the final unveiling of your results data and their interpretation. :)

BTW, I'm 100% Huff and I'm still incredibly surprised I sorted into Thunderbird. I'm an INFP, and just to live up to my stereotype, I main a healer type character in pretty much every game where I can choose it.And here I was just thinking how wrong she was. Heh. My trust issues stem from being overtrusting in the past and finally learning my lesson.How do you "take in" the world? I.E. do you perceive others' emotions first or focus on the message when someone is talking with you?

What are your biggest fears?

Much of your description sounds like me when I was your age, and the fact that you wrote this much is also reminiscent of being an INFP, lol. I tested on the cusp at 19 myself and hadn't yet become confident in my personality, but as the years went by the traits strengthened and I now test solidly INFP every time. Personally, I say sit on it for a bit. Continue to examine yourself to see how you take in the world and where your motivations come from. After awhile you will likely answer your own question.Huh. So this answer sounds more of analytical which is closer to ISFP imo, while your fear is the EXACT same thing I have dealt with over several segments of my life (and if I'm not mistaken, a common one for INFPs). My personal leaning is you're a fellow INFP who's a touch more developed on the analytical side in a few areas. But again, it's entirely possible you're on the cusp and some aspects of your personality are simply a bit underdeveloped at this point and thus it's less obvious.

Keep exploring the functions in how they relate to your own everyday interactions. You'll be more sure after maybe a month of two of personal examination. If not, your questions will be better formulated, at least!Brighter minds than I have said far more on the topic than I can spout off the top of my head. What websites have you already checked for more in-depth information? I remember personality page being very informative and would recommend starting with them. There's also a few really good YouTube channels with good info on the functions, like [this guy](https://youtu.be/aQ2QbS-EgrM).Not which tests have you taken. Which resources have you looked at for more in-depth analysis of MBTI theory and function explanations. Tumblr wasn't around yet when I took my first (paid) test but google brought me to a few informative websites which explained functions and had more in-depth type descriptions. I will still recommend [Personality Page](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/portraits.html) and Dave's videos first because I gleaned the most from those two sources.... this can't possibly be type specific, can it? I do this, too. Though mine is developed to near super-power levels. Way easier to do chores and grocery shop when your lists are innate.

Would you care to explain? Uber cautiousness and fear of the world is exactly what I'd expect from  people who repress their extraverted sensation...Hrrm. Okay, on the subject of ISXJs, then. Si-doms are no more afraid of the world than INXJs, they are merely averse to the changes that Ne-stimulation could have on their lives. Essentially, they feel out of their depth when they're forced to explore new possibilities. I don't know what it's like to be an Ni-dom, but I would venture to guess that INXJs are averse to exploring new experiences in the same way. An INFJ may be liable reject formative experiences like conflict if they are likely to change his vision in the same way an ISFJ is liable to reject new possibilities if they are likely to change his life.All I was trying to illustrate with my last comment was that there has to be some sort of symmetry between Si-doms and Ni-doms. People repress their inferior function because it, being directly related to the primary function, is capable of severely displacing the individual. This displacement is ultimately positive and formative, but the individual will obviously feel... well, displaced. It's not very fun (example: I always feel strange when facts and logic end up changing my stance on ethical issues). If you associate that displacement with your Pe, I would expect that it could cause you to reject new experiences or ideas.

I would also like to add that Ni-doms should generally reject Ne-related stimuli even more vehemently than Si-doms, in the same way that Ti-doms reject "the system" (Te) and Fi-doms reject social hierarchies and traditions (Fe). One's relationship with the function opposite in attitude to the primary is usually quite antagonistic.Yay! I was starting to worry that I was being entirely unhelpful.Fi Ne. Can't help it.People usually call them "temperaments." Misleading? Yes. Accurate? Debatable.I know what you mean. When I read catcher in the rye or into the wild I'm always like "wow I don't like relating to you but I'm doing it anyways"It's not that the functions were confused, the commenters were arguing that he probably had tertiary Ne, not primary. ESxJs end up using Ne a lot more than you would think, because it's extraverted and thus in line with their primary function.Basing your argument on a dang reddit post is better than just taking someone's word for it. I mean, the guy wanted help typing himself. They made some suggestions. He rejected the suggestions probably because it hurt his ego to think he wasn't an intuitive.Sensor/intuitive split in the population has never been confirmed by a credible source, mostly because there isn't really a split in the first place. Plenty of S-types make more use of intuition than a lot of intuitives. Take me for example. INFP, and I'm quite often prone to ignore new ideas in favor of what I know from experience. I used to think I was an ISFJ, and I still wonder sometimes whether or not I'm an ISFP. If someone can't even consider being a sensor, then I think they have a skewed understanding of the functions in general.It's definitely a long, frustrating process for everyone.It's called inferior grip. Your relationship with your inferior function is the most pure and authentic descriptor of your struggle to grow as a person.

Typology is a tool that you use to understand yourself and the other people in your life. The better you understand it, the more accurate it is.I'm saying that it's what you make of it. The people here aren't just making shit up. Many of them have spent A LOT of time reading up on and discussing all the related theory. You have to understand though, it's THEORY. It's a collection of hypothetical frameworks that we use to understand ourselves. You have to take it on its own terms, and then see how it applies to you and the people in your life.The starlord of the mbti expanded universeSee, I came up with this to get my head around the various socionics axes concerning "internal functions" vs "external functions," and stuff like relating to static fields vs dynamic objects etc. I mean, obviously you're aware of your functions, but the information they're dealing with and where that comes from is a different matter I'd saySure, but I think an S will seem to have more concrete/vivid imaginations when you consider how their ideas appeal to sensory data. I mean, as an N, I have crazy dreams full of plots and characters but it's pretty much entirely visual.Well you're onto something, definitely. I think mostly Tolkien was idealizing the characters and their motivations out of Feeling rather than Intuiting thoughThat's kinda what I'm trying to say with this. The function "Feeling" is sorting and qualifying "feelings" that are distinguished from "thoughts" in the sense that they originate from the unconscious.I'm gonna be a stickler and say that this is more related to "awareness" than consciousness. I might not be AWARE that I'm breathing, but it's taking place in the conscious realm of my perceptions. I can choose to "actively" breathe when it strikes me, and I can choose to "actively" think when that strikes me.

However. My unconscious is taking place outside of the conscious realm entirely. Things have to be dug out of there through conscious, preferably guided effort. Even if I choose to actively ponder my emotions, that doesn't change the fact that they are rooted deeply in things that I don't really understand.I think all people have to do a little archaeology if they want to get to the bottom of their emotional lives. Feeling types might find that their quarries are closer to the surface...You're not wrong about the subjective/objective distinction. I don't know if you knew this already, but that's exactly how Jung describes them in PT.

My notion that emotions rise from the unconscious is mostly informed by the James-Lange theory as I understood it, though I admittedly haven't read about it in a while.

If I were to describe the difference between Fi and Fe, I would liken it to how an ancient civilization makes use of precious metals like gold (which are "emotional stimulation" I guess). An Fe-user melts down the "gold" he comes in contact with and forges it into a currency to be used in exchange with other people, while an Fi-user sculpts that gold into beautiful works of art that are worth much more than their respective "weights in gold," and serve more of a unifying purpose in the "culture" of his personality.Chapter X Psychological Types is available for free as a PDF I think. Pretty much everything I know comes from spending time on forums and wikis though. I don't care much if the info I'm getting is second-rate.

Edit: oh yeah thanks for the compliment!As a 4w3, I was always envious of people who were "popular" or got any kind of recognition at my school, but with social instinct last, I never really made any attempt to fit in or distinguish myself to the established social circles. So mostly I just acted weird and people didn't get me. Guess some people probably thought I was a hipster or a hippy or something. I don't know.This is probably tied up with enneagram stuff, but I think Fe-users generally care more about distinguishing themselves than Fi-users do. Fi-doms just have a habit of getting really attached to things, because their "relationship" with a piece of information is more important than its accuracy/applicability.People change, but their types remain the same throughout their lives. And if there were a "best" type, natural selection would've cleared this shit up a long time ago.Funny, I've been mulling over this kind of stuff by reading about the stuff in Socionics people never talk about.

I know you've got a thing, but I think I'm gonna go for it.

In socionics, introverted functions relate to "fields," or data that is inseparable from the observer. In essence, your relationship with the information is more valuable than the information itself.
To extraverts, the opposite is true. Extraverted functions relate to "objects" that are definitively separate from the observer. The facts and how they relate to each other is more valuable than whatever the individual thinks about them.

Eh?Now to make this "pop," and perhaps aid you with the J/P reconciliation, I'll talk about the other relevant dichotomy, Static/Dynamic. This is the socionics version of mbti J/P type distinction. Static functions take data on its own terms while dynamic functions relate that data to existing frameworks in order to make sense of them.

Fi/Ti: static fields--observer passively receives data and attempts to relate directly to it. In a sense, the user attempts to "merge" with the information he is receiving. This is why Ji-doms are so low-energy; they have to assimilate each piece of new information directly.

Se/Ne: static objects--data is received passively with no attempt to merge or assimilate in any way. Pe-doms are primarily concerned with finding ways to manipulate or apply the new information they're exposed to.

Te/Fe: dynamic objects--while information is removed from the user, it must be related to an existing framework (to contribute to an overall "understanding"). Static objects need only to extend its reach to grasp new data, but dynamic objects must find a good way to justify relating that information to its system before it can be applied.

Ni/Si: dynamic fields--the most selective of the information gathering strategies. Data must be related to an existing framework that is merged with the user. Unlike static fields, less energy is expended in this merging, but only because the existing framework has been so rigorously constructed. Anything that falls outside of the framework is essentially ignored unless efforts are made to assimilate it using another function.The theory behind socionics is definitely more streamlined, but that's mostly because the socionists were less concerned with the theory than they were with trying to apply it to relationships, which I'm pretty confident was entirely misguided. If I had access to Jung's writings in any form other than PDF, I'd be more interested in reading that. I have to spend a lot more time filling in the blanks for myself with the socionics wiki.I've found it to be both more amusing and relevant than the current mbti paradigm, but it's still quite simplistic. And I've kinda come around to OP's point of view on the 8-function models. They're interesting and yield some good insight, but are essentially a novelty.Oh it's happening sweetheart

This hotel's got hbo

Bitches.



INFPFe-users focus their attention to how their actions and the actions of others affect a group. Notice that this doesn't imply any kind of motivation to the individual. The information gathered and sorted by this function can be used for good or for evil. It gives the user more options to choose from.

Fi on the other hand is limiting. It assigns a personal value to literally everything it comes across, which is an investment that the Fi-user must honor through his/her decisions. Fi won't allow the individual to associate with something that they've come to "hate," or to ignore something that they've come to "love."

An Fe-user who is putting someone else's needs above their own is doing so for a reason as dictated by another function, an Fi-user who does it is probably doing it because they can't help but honor their connection with whatever it is that's got em all sentimental.After I watched my grandmother go into cardiac arrest (died in the hospital some time later), I maintained conscious control of my breathing for probably about six hours or so. I spent most of that time trying to console my 11 year old cousin who was also there when she went (he just became more and more absorbed in his phone, trying to disengage from what was happening I guess). Afterwords, my "outbursts" for the most part occurred when I was alone, the only time I cried in front of another person was when I was alone with my father the next day. I've noticed that I sometimes feel violent/protective urges toward old or frail women in my life now, which I guess corresponds to the "anger" stage. I don't remember doing much "bargaining," but my INTP grandfather definitely did a bit of that.Ask anyone why they're behaving selflessly and they'll probably give you an answer that stems from one or both of their introverted functions. Extroverted functions can be objective because the individual isn't invested in the information they receive from it.

Edit: for instance, If we take the two types that are most often considered "selfless" (INFJ and ISFJ), you see that their Fe is being used in service of their Pi, which gives them an idea what they want their world to be like, and where their place in that world is. If an INFJ sees himself as a martyr, he'll use his Fe to go and be that. If an ISFJ sees himself as a father-figure, he'll use his Fe to go and be that.I don't buy Louis CK as an STJ. The one element that pervades throughout all his work is his sense of right and wrong. I don't know what you're talking about with the "95% of his humor being standard whatever" thing either. The guy pushes a lot of boundaries and makes his audience think about a lot of hard subjects.😭Idk, skin deep is pretty shallow imoGot it. But I'm an INFP, and I see aesthetic beauty in literally everything and everyone. So I think it's shallow to deem one person attractive and another ugly.Yeah, because you're being shallow and I'm notNo I'm actually getting at something here. It's okay to be shallow in certain ways. Your sensing function is extraverted, and thus shallow. Nothing wrong with that. Doesn't mean you're a bad person. You might be deep in other ways. But when it comes to aesthetic beauty, you're kinda shallow. Just how it is.And I'm saying there's a big difference between "shallow" and "bad." As an ISFP, your relationship with physical beauty is important, but your standards of physical beauty are relatively shallow compared to that of an Si user.I'm just saying Se is shallow, compared to Si. As is Ne compared to Ni. As are all the other extraverted functions compared to their introverted counterparts. All the types are deep in some ways and shallow in other ways.Yep, it's MY fault you don't understand what I'm saying. You can tell because all of my comments in this thread have been up-voted.You don't need to explain anything. Never had to. I understand where you're coming from. Just want to clarify that I'm not the problem here.This might be the most accurate one so far!This implies that emotional connection is a one-way street. Not a fanMy Ne at work: I see a little toy bear and a pair of kids' pool flippers, and then I imagine a bear swimming while wearing scuba diving gear. Then I start humming the Scooby Doo theme song because the word Scooby is similar to scuba and the character Scooby is a brown and hairy quadruped (like a bear). Then I think of my cousin who has a dog named Scooby.

I'm not gonna pretend I know how to describe Ni, but the above passage is definitely the kind of thing that would make an Ni-dom roll his eyes.Ni would probably continuously try to find new ways to link the two ideas (the bear and the flippers) until they became a part of the same idea, rather than follow the associations blindly (like Ne does)

Edit: oh yeah, and it would probably try to glean some kind of personal relevance from the exercise as well ("oh my god! See how everything is connected...")But it probably wouldn't bother to explore those pieces of information in the first place, cuz it ain't important, and Ni's gotta watch its intake. Ne doesn't care.Weirder than Sun Ra? That's pretty weird dude.All intuitives are likely to do this, not just big Ni-users. Intuiting is defined as perception of objects not relating to immediate, tangible sensation. So when you're using it, you're in your head and not appreciating the present moment.Nowadays, when I think about mbti, socionics model A is essentially irrelevant to me. It's a nice little shortcut, but it doesn't offer much real insight. Socionists would tell you that the difference between your polr function and your inferior function is that you LIKE using your inferior function and admire people who can use it efficiently, while you see absolutely no value in your polr, and thus NEVER, EVER use it. Pretty black and white, in my opinion.http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/functions/Super-Ego

"A person does not understand the importance of this element entirely..."

As far as I can see, the reverse of your puerile function is just how you get stubborn and noncommutative (like a child who can't articulate why he's angry). You don't need an 8-function model to see that.What?

Look Beebe's model associates each of the functions with an archetype that I don't think they were meant to. Ti isn't my shadow, my shadow is a deeply personal and unique aspect of my relationship with the human condition, not just a way of processing and storing information that I find distasteful. And I reject the socionics model because I don't associate my Freudian "super-ego" with Se and Ti. My conscience is in my primary function. I'm trying to reconcile my personality type with my other psychological processes for myself, I don't have time for theories that don't exactly add up.And that's why 8-function models are no good. They oversimplify, constrain, and apply the framework too broadly to be useful. Everyone has a unique relationship with each of their functions, when you try to answer too many questions with a single, universal model, you squeeze a lot of processes between the lines.Because, in my experience, the four-function model is highly applicable. The other models less so. To the point where they're unnecessary. I still like to read up on Beebe and socionics. A lot. But when it comes to applicability, the original model is superior.I just want to add that there is more to type than function models, and there's more to personality than type. I have a similar problem with enneagram tritypes as I do with this. People seem to think that if they make a framework unnecessarily complicated, then it'll be more accurate. I don't care for this. Reconciling multiple frameworks with each other is more fruitful.Of course. It isn't hard to get your head around, but there's just too many possibilities to entertain. And it muddles your insight in the process.The Meyers model was made to be as consistent with Jung's theories as possible. Sure it fills in some blanks that he never really got at, but that's neither here nor there in my opinion, since the model is extremely applicable.

On socionics, you're right I guess. But I still tend to think that the original socionists were misguided in their attempt to apply typology to relationships, which is kind of the whole point of the underlying theory(/ies).

On the models, I have to disagree. Just having a four function model doesn't stop you from having a relationship with a function outside of it. What I've been trying to get at is that the 8-function models assert too much about the reversed attitude. If that stuff is really happening in your shadow, it's gonna be mixed up in ways that are difficult to get a handle on. Beebe got this, I think, but people still apply his model too universally in my opinion.Yeah if you actually want to understand what socionics is about, you have to read up on the dichotomies. That's where it gets interesting. Model A is just one little piece of that puzzle, but it's one of the only things in socionics that gets mentioned around here.When you get into the dichotomies, model A seems really superfluous imo. Nowadays it's about the only part of socionics that I like. More philosophical. Kind of reminds me of holon theoryFor INFPs, I think conflict can either be a fixation or a blind spot. I'm always walking into arguments without even realizing it.Yeah the thing about NFPs is that we're really afraid to show our hard edges. We are as coarse and belligerent in our inner worlds as STPs are in their outer worlds.Mostly I like artsy shit. David Lynch, Jim Jarmusch, Charlie Kaufman... But I'll watch anything I can get through the Criterion Collection on hulu.

Fargo (the tv show) fucking kicks assWow, look at all the NFs...Whichever type tends to be teenagersI don't think more content concerning a type on the internet necessitates a better understanding of it. In fact, I think all that extra content contributes to less understanding of intuitives, because there's so much conflicting information, and people just lose themselves between the lines.Honestly never heard of this epidemic. Of all the intuitives, I think people mistype as INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, INFP, and INTP a lot more.Thinking and sensing are definitely linked, as are intuiting and feeling. T and S deal with the external world of realities, experiences, facts, and logic. Even when those functions are introverted, this is the case; Ti and Si are simply more directly and personally related to that world.

It seems to me that all Gammas (NTJs and SFPs) identify more personally with their internal world of feeling and intuiting, as these functions are introverted for them, and thus they are more directly connected to those kinds of stimuli. ESFPs and ENTJs  are more comfortable dealing with the external world (concrete results) and INTJs and ISFPs are more comfortable in their inner world (theoretical results), though these preferences are not so pronounced as in NFs and STs.Where're the cuddly assholes at?Yeah I'm not looking for a fight either. Really, what people need to get their heads around is that being an N-type literally just means that you spend more time zoned out in your own little world than you do paying attention to the world around you. And that the split between S/N is a product of the stresses placed on individuals by society. I bet if you went back in time to ancient Egypt (or even perhaps modern-day Myanmar) you'd find that there'd be more intuitives running around, because those societies value the abstract concepts of afterlife and divine judgement over present-day affairs and experiences.Okay, but r/enfp: 8,390 subscribers. r/intj: 25,416 subscribers.Well. I would say that most of the stigma surrounding the different types in these communities is directly related to the wording of tests and type descriptions. Since those are usually the means by which people first experience mbtiThe "dynamic vs static" dichotomy in socionics would probably answer a few of your questions. In a sense, INTJs see the forest, while ISFPs see the leaves. That's pretty vague, though.

edit: here's what i think i meant by celuthat. according to the renin dichotomies, each function has a different combination of elements that make up its process. Just taking the 2 premier functions of ISFPs and INTJs into consideration, we pouvcan see that there is an unmistakable similarity between Fi--Se and Ni--Te:

Fi: internal, introverted, STATIC
Ni: internal, introverted, DYNAMIC

Se: external, extraverted, STATIC
Te: external, extraverted, DYNAMIC

Essentially, while there are other differences, INTJs are pretty much just un dynamic ISFP, and an ISFP is pretty much just a static INTJ. the differences i pthink would also include rational/irrational (INTJ being irrational, ISFP being rational, though je think this ties into static vs dynamic thinking, but i guess could compound my forest/leaves truc). so, INTJs and ISFPs perceive the same things, but relate them in different ways, where the INTJ tries to get a "grand picture" perspective, the ISFP tries to take each piece of info on its own terms.

i'm tiredEh, who needs the stinkin Brits. Americans sure as hell didn't.

Edit: honestly, it seemed to me that the referendum was fueled by racism and xenophobia as much as anything else. Which sucks. If the EU really is gonna crash and burn, that and widespread cynicism will be the culprits.Hey just a thought, it looks like you're asking for a "Ti-based" reasoning from us. For Te-users, the facts and whatnot being expressed in the press or by professionals in the field pretty much stand for themselves as a reasoning process.

I'm just saying that if a Te-user (especially a Delta) wants to make a statement in the realm of rational analysis, all they really have to point to are facts. Otherwise, they're relying on sensation (which may or may not be subjective, but in either case for a heavy Te-user is more difficult) and/or Fi, which isn't exactly rational in any sense.Wait are you trying to say that it's the [EU+media]'s fault that people are racist?Then I think you're asking us to describe a process that's taking place outside of our consciousness. 

For Te-Fi, there are facts and the way that they relate to each other, and there's the individual's value response to the stimulus. I can give you my opinion, and I can give you the facts, but I can't tell you exactly how the facts informed my opinion. That part's largely unconscious.I think you're giving too much credit to the media. Extremism is a feedback loop, and the problem nowadays is that anyone can ignore information that would create a healthy dialogue, with or without the help of mainstream media.I think people turn away from mainstream media because of recent advancements in technology, not this long-term societal repression you're describing. With most people getting their news from their phones and social media, they control their own informational intake in a way that's never been seen before. Politicians and journalists are just doing things the same way they've always done, and now they're completely out of touch because of it, but I think they're mostly just confused.Perhaps, but that doesn't explain the sudden incompetence/irrelevance of politicians and news organizations that's cropped up all over western world in this last decadeWhat point? There's a point?Um, people were a HELL of a lot more angry and scared 30 years ago than they are now, and the politicians managed to keep their shit together. You continue to spout this idea that people are angry and disillusioned with the system, but the truth is we're more complacent and trusting than we've ever been. Stop trying to explain your point with ungrounded claims about our society.Happy is a strong word. People ARE disillusioned. But disillusionment + feeling of powerlessness = complacencyThank you for this thread!Great.

Edit: wait, are we arguing?Ah. Sorry I pissed you off.What could I possibly have to be passive-aggressive about? I don't care how this ends, or what anyone thinks of me when this is done.

And I admit that our misunderstanding is my fault. And that I provoked it. I even feel a *little guilty. But I still think my points are relevant. I'm not trolling youMy passive-aggressive sense of humor really doesn't carry over to the internet, I'll give you thatOkay, my view: times are a-changing. Technology changed the way we get our info. Established news organizations are still playing catch-up, so most of their content is irrelevant to the people. Politicians continue to cater to their bases in an obsolete way as well, so they're out of touch with their voters. I don't know if I touched on anything else that might've been confusing

Edit: now I'm not sure how this is all connected to your point. I started this interaction because I wanted to discern that.But what caused all this "political correctness" to get out of hand? The news sources? The politicians? To me, they just seem like they're floundering, and, if anything, more confused about the current situation than we are.Okay, and what caused these values and mindsets to be implanted in the brains of people all across Western society over the space of less than two decades?You're the one who said political correctness had been in a tailspin since the early 2000s. I'm asking why this didn't happen in, say, the 50s or something.

But even if a change is gradual, it's still got to have a cause. Tectonic plates still move in response to outside forces.Ah! So my "technological advances" theory is even more valid than was previously agreed uponSure, but a force capable of wreaking such havoc on society, it would be nice understand, and not just chalk up to randomness and/or eventuality.The media in itself can't be culpable. You're condemning thousands upon thousands of people, each with different values and goals, some even conflicting with each other. Can any single entity be truly held responsible for the actions of all those people?

And it's important to note that the media is responding to societal changes in real time, just like us. They don't know what the effects of their actions will be until they see them for themselvesbut, in the last 20-or-so years this behavior became a lot more common. to the point where it is seen as so ubiquitous that national media personalities regularly disparage it, or simply point and laugh. Why did this happen so suddenly? Is it possible that heightened awareness of the world through advances in communication technology have served as the catalyst?blame is one thing (of course I don't think you BLAME them), but to say that the tens of thousands of professionals working in journalism all made a collective (and continuous) MISTAKE, that's just ridiculous to me. There has to be a really important, tangible reason as to why they've all chosen to act the way that they do. And if you say self-sacrifice again...Seemed like you were

my surmise was that you saw those advances in technology as less vitally important than the issues concerning political correctness/self-sacrifice/less-than-open-discussion-in-media. now it seems clear that we agree that recent technological advances are to blame for the exacerbation of these problems in our society.What you're describing are trends, I'm looking for causes. You seem to be content with the "it's human nature" argument. I think there's more going on here.Okay, fine, bad word choice on my part. My argument is simply that certain technological advances had a really strong hand in manipulating the relevant social movements. Technology itself isn't a problem, but its development and implementation have certainly caused a lot of them.

what's the point of analyzing socio-cultural phenomena if you don't gather some kind of meaningful, applicable understanding from it? You can't just tell the people working in the media to clean up their act.Yeah that's like verbatim the motto of the journalistic code of ethics. Somebody already told those people to do what you're asking. Just telling them again doesn't solve anythingso what are you calling for, an international-scale movement to crack down on journalists and politicians? These are THE people who are trying to solve the world's problems. They aren't perfect. They aren't what they used to be. Many are causing more harm than good. But if anyone's going to instigate global change at a time like this, it's them.

(and artists and billionaires)So, as they say, control is an illusion. I love Jurassic Park. And Jim Jarmusch. Tikkun Olam. La vida no vale nada.Except they'd be the buddha, because they're so enlightened now.

You're welcomeWell if that's the point, I definitely didn't miss it, a lot of the things you've said here are things that I say to myself all the time.

If I made intuition sound "cooler" than sensation in any way, that was definitely not my intention. When I was talking about being "focused on the afterlife and divine judgement" as opposed to "everyday realities and experiences" I meant that according to Theravada Buddhism, everyone deserves the suffering they receive in their lives because they did something bad in a previous one, and according to the Ancient Egyption religion, pretty much all that matters in life is the afterlife (edit: contrast this with several pagan religions, which teach that every sunrise is a blessing, and coordinate their celebrations with important times of the year, such as solstices and harvest seasons). I don't think either of those religions (Theravada and Ancient Egyption) are really cool or mysterious, and I deeply resent those kinds of philosophies.

As an N type myself, there's really nothing magical or meaningful to me about intuition (though this might just be an NP thing, I don't usually hear this kind of remark from NJs). In fact, I'm always wishing I were more like an S type, because I spend so much time contemplating possible scenarios that I neglect my relationship with reality, as well as my sensory experience (ie I'm just not paying any attention). Not a day goes by in which I don't feel regret for not getting more out of my life, or even just grounding my ideas in it. For instance, I feel guilty that I've spent so much time on the internet these past few days because I know I'm using it as a way of putting off my life here in the real world. I'm more confident grappling with abstract possibilities than I am experiencing things for myself.

I think, though, that this isn't true of all intuitives. Your introverted perceiving function is the one you use to find meaning, so for NPs and SJs, all the mystery and beauty in the world is to be found in their sensory experience, while for SPs and NJs, that mystery lies in their ideation.Well... you may not consider yourself to be a particularly grounded individual, but your perception is, as a rule, going to be more grounded than that of an NP, right? I mean, somebody who internalizes their experience before seeking out novelty is pretty much guaranteed to have a more grounded perspective than someone who seeks novelty first and internalizes later. This is more of a J/P thing than an S/N thing though.

And I understand that, when introverted, sensation is very selective about how it engages with reality, but intuition, whether introverted or extraverted, doesn't directly engage with "reality" in any sense. So, on that front I think you SJs are still more involved with the real world than Ns, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it actually makes S-types more purely imaginative than N-types, who've tempered their imaginations to produce "likely" or "useful" possibilities. I don't knowThis is where you get Fi vs Fe, in my opinion. Nobody forces people to be racist, in the same way that nobody forces people to eat McDonald's. I mean, I get your thought process, but I think that each individual is at fault for their moral shortcomings, regardless of where they get their information.People living in the free world have access to everything they need to be properly informed, and it's their own damn fault if they fall into media traps.

Ti-Fe sees people doing bad things and says "if they were properly informed and taught to think for themselves, they'd make better decisions." Essentially they assume that people must be stupid (have a deficiency in thinking) to make those bad decisions.

Fi-Te sees people behaving badly and decides that they must have a deficiency in morality to make those decisions. You say people are uninformed and being taken for a ride by the system; I say they're too arrogant to realize that they don't have all the answers, and that they're acting out of fear.I'm not attempting to invalidate anything, I just took an extreme stance to illustrate that there's another way of looking at the phenomena being described. I know that the media has an effect on the masses, but I also know that it takes two to tango (ie people buy into their shenanigans because they want to), and that the media in turn is influenced by the masses and their concerns.

Democracy IS flawed: "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." ~Winston Churchill

Edit: and here's another one: "Democracy... while it lasts is more bloody than either aristocracy or monarchy. Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There is never a democracy that did not commit suicide." ~John AdamsOh God no, I'm not saying we should give up on democracy! I just thought it was silly to call me a collectivist because I'm pointing out flaws in democracy, when its very founders and defenders have done the same...

When I say that "judgments aren't explainable," I'm talking about the fact that the introverted functions do not have a conscious base. Jung says this himself. Ti is affected by this in a similar way: why something makes logical sense to a Ti-user isn't exactly apparent, in the same way that the reason why something appeals to an Fi-user's ethical system isn't exactly apparent. It's because the introverted functions are gradual, developing over the course of the individual's life, while the extraverted ones are deliberate. 

Maybe I didn't understand what you were saying before, but in any case my proposition was tentative. I can't speak for what was going on inside those people's minds, I was merely noticing that your line of questioning was somewhat loaded.

I "ignored" your claim about Fe-Ti, because I didn't think it was relevant to my point, and I still don't really understand what your issue is here.The only political argument I've engaged in on here is that the voters should be held accountable for their actions during discussion, and that their accountability not be diminished by the fact that they were swayed by a crooked media entity. If this makes me a derail-er, I'm sorry. It's just one of my problems, I guess, that I can't help but say something when the general consensus is so far from my own view.

I guess I got so carried away trying to explain the process of introverted judgement, that I forgot what it was used for: figuring out where you stand on specific issues in a reasonable way. It's just that my value judgments seem as if they're a part of who I am, when I think about them. What they are is a projection of my principles onto the world around me. I mistook them for the principles themselves. Like mistaking RNA for DNA. Or something.

It just seemed to me that you were questioning people on a basis that I didn't think was necessary. I thought I would try to articulate that, and bring your attention to it if I could, so that if you were biased, you could check that for yourself. Then, when you provided a rationale, I didn't understand it and thought you were asking something impossible.

I honestly don't see myself being digressive, or suggestive (what does that mean?), but if I caused any harm to your discussion, I guess I'm sorry? I'm not here to be unhelpful. I guess the fact that I only go on this sub when I'm low doesn't help, but mostly I'm just here to clarify my own understanding. I don't have any specific agenda to dismantle your investigation. Just an inquisitive mind, and a lack of self awareness.

Edit: rearticulated for passabilityINFP-I think Secular Humanism is a better fit. We're not just hipster INFJs lolEh, there's nothing wrong with your description. I just think it's weird that Fi-doms get pinned as being super religious in mainstream typology nowadays. Of all the types, I think they're probably the most predisposed to have little-to-no patience for institutionalized morality.I had him typed as ESTJ; he's really too focused on doing things, and doing them well, to be an INFP, I think. He's definitely got this sort of "Hemingway Romantic" thing going on in his travel shows, which makes a good case for ESTP (and is the main reason I think he gets typed as one). It's difficult to say though, with TV personalities, because even when they seem authentic and uncut, they're still selling a tailored persona to their viewers.I don't think you can use Te to make illogical assertions. You'd have to use another function (like Ne, for example) to do that. Since Te is 100% rational.

I'm my experience, I'm not usually worried that my Fi-values are being challenged. Instead, I'm worried that I don't have enough information to make the right decision (because my Te analysis isn't very strong). I'm pretty confident in my ability to make a morally sound decision, but not so much in my ability to effectively understand the situation that calls for it, I guess.Of all the types, the ISFP seems to be one of the hardest to fit into a cultural niche by use of stereotypes. 

Like we've got INTJ masterminds, ISFJ housewives, ESFJ cheerleaders, INFP dreamers, INTP nerds, ENTJ CEOs, ENTP mad scientists, INFJ visionaries, ISTP snipers/mechanics... ISFP? What the heck do they do? I don't know, they're lazy and stuff... (edit: idk just call them "artists")What? I don't actually believe what I wrote there, I'm just pointing out that the way people have divided the types via stereotypes makes it easier to make statements about certain types. ISFP, for whatever reason, is harder to do that toYeah is that the real perception though? "Oh they like to draw pictures and they're lazy" seems to be more along the lines of what people think (edit: not that people actually think this, but that it's the baseline stereotype from which they begin making assertions)Yeah I know, what do you think I started looking this shit up yesterday? That's the "official" label, but it hasn't really stuck, has it? Maybe that's just my perception I guess.I don't know about you, but when think of the "artistic type" stereotype, I apply it to a lot more types than just ISFP (off the top of my head, just thinking about type descriptions--not people I know or functions). And when I see ISFPs being talked about in forums, people mostly call them "chill" and "easy to get along with"My original comment has a very abstract premise. I'm not saying that people think these types ARE the stereotypes, but they're more confident about talking about the types because they have a more solid idea about what it means to be those types (because of a more developed cultural perception of those stereotypes). It's not a hard-and-fast explanation, just a weird way of looking at it.

Maybe it's the fact that the "Artist" stereotype is more of a vague concept than the other stereotypes, and that's what makes people less confident talking about them. I don't even know if my theory is what's going on at all, it can't really be proven one way or the other.Whatever. If all you're going to do is refute me, this discussion can't be had. I'm not speaking in terms of "what's true and what isn't." I'm proposing a hypothetical.Cool.Oh sure, but I think most INFPs who are driven to do stuff are such because of an insecurity regarding their own competence (I think this drives many to become 5s, though most people don't seem to share my notion). Bourdain, he just seems to be in his element when he's cooking/eating/talking about cooking/eating, you know? I couldn't say, maybe he's an INFP who's really good at hiding his insecurity or somethingXNFP:

 Batman

Manbat a close secondI guess you might be onto something. The way I think of Te, it's more about understanding the world on its own terms, without projecting your expectations onto it, however logical those may be.

An Fi-dom who is really attached to a value judgement would probably ignore Te in that instance, because Te, being objective and rational, would get in the way of that judgement (and force the individual to reconsider, which in this case we're assuming he/she doesn't want to do). It's possible to selectively apply Te (as it is with any function), but I think this Fi-dom would simply seek out more data that fit his/her worldview using a Pe function, and then rationalize it all after the fact (if it ever came to that).I think Te is too unyielding to be of much use to somebody who wants to maintain a personal opinion in the face of reality. The mantra of Te is "well, facts are facts..."

I really don't see that being useful to a stubborn Fi-dom.

In fact, I would say that Fi-doms are considered stubborn because of the fact that they have a penchant for ignoring their Te.

I'm not saying that what you're describing isn't Te, but maybe we aren't talking about an Fi-dom here.I believe "Baloney" is the proper spelling...Not criticizing, but you seem to have this notion that the inferior function validates the primary function. I don't see it that way. To me, it's the one function that can save you from getting sucked into the black hole that is exclusively using your primary.makes sense.:( sorry?Okay. I guess it's possible. But if you want to talk about personal experience, I've never experienced what you're talking about, and I'm either Fi-dom or Fi-aux.

For what it's worth, I think Fi is capable of both being extremely cynical and "faking" logic pretty well on its own (especially with strong Ne thrown into the mix; a lot of NFPs use their intuition as a divining rod for statements that seem plausible or make some kind of surface sense, but lack any kind of rational base--I'm definitely guilty of this)I'm not sure what you're asking exactly, but your primary+auxiliary are the "ego" block, those functions in reverse (flip "I" to "E") are the "id" block. Your tertiary+inferior functions are the "super-id," and those two functions in reverse are the "super-ego." So if you know the function order of a type in mbti, you should be able to extrapolate them to their respective blocks in socionics.Relationships are hard. People like the idea of an easy fix/explanation. Websites make money by attracting traffic to themselves. Sometimes (a lot of time) they do this by giving people what they want.You also asked in the OP if your theory rang true to anyone's experience, so...

Anyways. Sure I can give you some examples.

Fi being cynical: this is just a function of age, really. Having a strong sense of right and wrong from so early in your life means that you're going to have a lot of experiences that fly in the face of your values. This is why many IFPs end up with enneagram 6, because they've been betrayed so many times by human nature that they seek defense from it by means of an institution. This isn't really an example, I guess I'm just trying to convey my way of seeing the world.

Fi faking logic: Fi value judgements go beyond "right and wrong," they also tend to color different stimuli with qualifying terms, such as "intelligent-sounding" or "stupid-sounding." Since a lot of IFPs have a Shame Triad enneagram type (ie they confound their sense of self with an idealized, false identity, resulting in feelings of deficiency), they can be very driven to give people (and themselves) an impression of competence and intelligence (this can also be seen as compensating for feelings of inferiority regarding their Te). So I know how to structure my words in such a way that gives off an air of intelligence, even though I may not necessarily know what I'm talking about (edit: this might sound like perception--specifically Ni--but the distinction is that Fi is deliberately DIRECTING the perceiving functions to produce an impression that it likes).

Edit: Now, to the examples!

Cynical Fi: I don't consider myself a cynical person (in fact I make a point to avoid cynicism), but I have noticed that, in political discussions, I have always leaned towards positions that emphasize public safety and control at the expense of personal freedom. This stems from the fact that I have learned not to trust individuals to behave in a morally upstanding way.

"Logical" Fi: in writing, I deliberately make attempts to diversify my word choice and syntax because I know that it makes my work more aesthetically pleasing to read, and gives people an impression of mastery over the use of language (because that's the impression it gives me; it's an Si-thing). I also tend to make open-ended statements, because I know that the more open-ended I make my statements, the harder they are to be refuted, and that when people are incapable of refuting my statements, it gives the impression that I know what I'm talking about (this is more of an unconscious process). 

I've also noticed that many people seem to equate CYNICISM to RATIONALISM, and thus make irrationally cynical statements in order to appear rational.Christ, vanity is a bitch

Do your worstIn conversation, Ji is all about choosing the right word for the job; in the case of Fi, this is a very emotionally qualitative thing. Coupled with the self-awareness granted by Si, this causes INFPs to place a huge focus on communicating in such a way that gives others a specific impression. I guess if an INFP has a certain belief, but also wants to appear logical (because they see themselves as logical/want to see themselves as logical/want you to agree with them), they'll color their words accordingly.What you're describing sounds pretty IxFJ-like to me.

Because Fi is constantly sincere and personal, it views EVERY relationship as a direct investment of the user's personal energy; thus Fi-doms resent any social activity that drains their energy without producing a deep, sincere connection. But they still feel drained even when they get this, because interaction always requires that investment from them. What pisses them off is when their investments aren't reciprocated, or when (god forbid) the reciprocation is faked.

"Getting" energy out of specific kinds of group interactions (and not others) points more to Fe, being used in service of Pi. As introverts, IxFJs ration their energy when dealing with the world, but they see the emotional dynamics of their relationships as a means to an end, rather than as goals themselves (as an Fi-user does). That end is dictated by their introverted perception, which has its own deeply personal goals. When those emotional dynamics stop serving their Pi (which has invested in an idea of what SHOULD be happening in social situations), they become unresponsive and feel drained (because their Pi isn't seeing the return on its investment.)

Seeking depth and meaning in relationships (and avoiding superficial connection) does not make you an Fi-user. It makes you a human being.When an Fi-dom tells you how something makes them feel, they want to articulate that as accurately and meaningfully as possible. They will spend as much time as is necessary to find the exact right words to express their internal states to you, if they feel that you deserve to know.Maybe you do have Fi, but what you described was a preference for sx&gt;so, not Fi&gt;Fe. That's all.I would definitely agree with you that Fe adheres more to the traditional definition of "extroversion" than Te. As does Se, compared to Ne. There's more to this than functions though. Enneagram plays a big role  in such things as well.100% on the money right here.You're incorrect about literally everything you just said.

Fi and Ni are FAR more "creative" than Ne. Ne does not create ANYTHING from scratch. It takes an abstract premise, changes a few data points, and regurgitates it.

Fi and Ni are both deeply personal functions that produce a powerful and fundamentally unique perspective on life. That's what creativity is about. Not making people go "woah..."Yeah, sorry, I guess I was just describing the way in which Fi is like Ti. Obviously, Fi can be used in more ways than just simple, direct communication, but the emotionally qualifying language of Fi is always right there at the front of the mind of an IFP, get what I'm saying?Yes. Definitely. And that doesn't necessarily have to be a conscious effort on their part either. Since they'll primarily be responding to suggestive connotations (Ne) instead of reality, and they're usually unaware of how unreasonable they're being anyways (inferior Te).Sounds like you've got a healthy relationship with Ti, and you get tired of Fe's shit every once in a while.
 
Being an independent thinker is a good thing, right?Isn't that how it should be? Even Fe-doms really just want to think for themselves.So what's your case? That you're defective? There's nothing wrong here. Just do you.

And don't believe this crap about the world being full of idiots. Truth is, there are more intelligent, interesting people in this world than you could ever possibly meet in ten lifetimes. It only seems bad when you're not living the way you want to be.they're pretty similar.

an INTP is more emotionally demanding. they don't know how to take a hint, and they might piss you off without meaning to. usually very resentful of authority. like to "spar" with others in the intellectual realm. they tell a lot of the same jokes over and over.

an INFP is more intellectually demanding. you won't see it at first, but they have pretty weak reasoning abilities, would rather have someone explain something to them than figure it out for themselves. a lot less confident dealing with the real world. if they're being a prick it's because they're pissed off about something. INTP might be a prick on accident, or just because.

edit: also, I'd like to add that there's nothing really that makes INTPs darker than INFPs. INTPs are more abrasive, but their emotional expression is also more shallow. INFPs are more directly (and deeply) in tune with their feelings, so they're better at dealing with negative emotional states, and do so on their own. where INTPs might see INFPs as "wallowing," INFPs will see INTPs as emotionally dependent.Okay, yeah, I mean ALL NPs like to repeat things, but NTPs have more interest in engaging in interpersonal dynamics. INFPs don't usually care enough to engage like that (telling jokes) unless they're with close friends who won't care so much.Could you explain your assertion with functions?HuhYeah. You gave me SO MUCH to think about.

Everything in my original comment was based on my understanding of the functions as well as my experience interacting with the two types, but hey, it's nice to know that you can refute my claims without either pointing out errors in my logic or giving me an explanation for your analysis.It's not really a discussion unless you're prepared to back up your claims. But whatever. Now I know how many times I got downvoted.Typology can help you understand someone. Understanding is a pillar for any relationship.

Look beyond that, and you're probably wasting your energy asking for external validation. Relationships can only really be managed on an individual level, with dedication and hard work.What's your opinion on the words "function strength?" People throw this around a lot, and I'm not sure it really hits the mark, when talking about levels of development. Sorta carry-over from socionics maybe?

The way I see the functions, this has more to do with one's ego-perception and level of comfort with certain ways of seeing the world than it serves as a measurement of one's "skill." I don't know if Jung talked about this in any of his writings.If you don't understand the theory, you can't type yourself accurately. Or anyone else, for that matter. I'm sure you have some valuable experience, but it's not worth much if you can't relate it to the theory...I guess what I was getting at was that this "function-related activities" thing sounds a lot like what the socionists seem to mean when they talk about "information elements," in the sense that certain stimuli are being objectively defined as pertaining to a specific function, which is where it gets too rigid I guess. For instance, I can use Fi to be sincere and articulate my ethical response to a situation in such a way that earns me a certain respect from others in social situations, so Fe can't be the only function that can be used to relate to a social dynamic.

So I guess another question: do you believe that the inferior function (and stimuli pertaining to that function) is defined as being completely irreconcilable with the primary (in the sense that you CAN'T use Ti to do Fe stuff and vice versa), and thus people need to develop that function in order to effectively relate to all the stimuli in their life? Or do you believe that the primary+inferior functions are "complimentary" to each other, in the sense that Ti is somehow required to participate in Fe activities (this "Axes" stuff that's all the rage now)?&gt; ex. "Ni condenses many Se perceptions"

Oh god I hate this shit as well. 

Still, the question of whether or not opposite functions are directly linked is a hard one for me.

I mean, obviously it follows that if you internalize one process, you have to externalize the other. Strange to me that it took so long for people to figure that one out. (edit: but this in itself implies some kind of a relationship)

And I can even see how the two are related. Like how NPs seek novelty because they're looking for an experience worth internalizing, or how SPs are competitive and accomplishment-focused because they're looking for a vision worth realizing.

And logically, it makes sense that if you have a rigid moral code (Fi), you have to understand how the world works *rationally* and *objectively* (Te) in order to make sound decisions; otherwise you're doing it based on blind impressions or what have you...

And it also makes sense that if you make decisions based on what appeals to your intensive sense of logic (Ti), you'd want to externalize your irrational feelings so as to make sure that they don't interfere with that (and to prevent miscommunication)...

It's more like the relationship between two opposite functions is like one of negative space, you know? I guess that's what you were saying about the two not having to conflict with each other.

Edit: gonna try again here

Development seems to really be about "escaping" your primary function, and perhaps your "attitude" in general. This is one of the reasons I have a problem with relating functions by strength: the functions you're "strong" with also determine a lot of your weaknesses (because you over-rely on them).

The question of developing your functions actually seems a lot more difficult to me now. On the one hand, seeking out new experiences could give you an opportunity to exercise a lesser-used function, but on the other hand, that increased "stress" on the psyche may cause somebody to revert to their primary. And in the case of extraverts, who are generally more confident in exploring new things (and may be more in need of some self-reflection or deliberation), you're pretty much telling them to continue using their primary.

I understand and agree with the concept of "leaving your comfort zone," but there's something wrong with this picture.

Maybe there really are some situations in which you can't effectively use your primary function, and that's what your inferior is for. I don't know.&gt; Hiccup from the HTTYD movies.

Not the books though[INFP](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/2zifz2/upright-citizens-brigade-woodsy-office)

He was probably an INFP in the books.&gt; I feel incongruous because I very much hate anthropocentric views but I truly have an anthropocentric view on life at the same time.

This is hilarious. My view of the world is governed by the [mediocrity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediocrity_principle), and I love to take anthropocentric stances on things.

Any-who, I don't think it's necessarily incongruous. More like we're trying to compensate for our philosophical deficiencies.INFP here, I choose ESTJ and ISFJ. ESTJ so I can finally see if there's anything to this duality crap, and ISFJ so the ESTJ and I both have someone to kick around (supervisee for ESTJ, beneficiary for me)I think what you're describing is closer to Se vs Si.

Edit: in the sense that Ni-Se is removed from experience (sensation is externalized) and Si-Ne is immersed in experience (sensation is internalized)Ni-doms have Se, right? I'm suggesting that the distinction you've observed can be explained by the fact that Se-users relate to experience in a different way than Si-users do (impersonally, thus more objectively and less selectively).If you created this thread with the intention of generating discussion, why are you telling people that "they just don't understand what you're talking about" when they attempt to engage in it? I would let this slide if it were just me, but there's another instance in this thread where you've done this. 

Truth is, even if we stupidheads really don't *understand* you, that's not our fault. It's YOUR responsibility to clarify yourself if other people aren't getting what you're saying. The fact that you can't effectively relate your ideas to us means you need to try harder.

But I'll still tell you a thing or two about Ni and Si, because, even if I don't have *your* context to speak from, I do have my own, and I have no reason to believe that yours is better than mine.

Introverted perception is what the socionists call [dynamic](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/dichotomies/r2t1), meaning it's process-oriented, and qualifies objects based on how they relate to other objects, rather than on whatever inherent qualities those objects appear to have. A good example of dynamic vs static intuition is this:

&gt; It struck me as pretty damn insightful, though in that vague "Oooh, this is onto something useful here, but I can't quite articulate why" kind of way.

Here, you describe how you've qualified an abstraction, not based on its own merit, but based on the fact that it seemed to point in a direction you find valuable. It's not the idea itself that you like, but the possible implications and understandings it might be able to lead you to.

Me, on the other hand, I read the same piece of information you reacted to, and I thought to myself "what is it about this one analysis of these two functions that makes it better than any of the other analyses I've been exposed to or could come up with myself. Nothing really, it's pretty vague, not much meat to it, distinguishes the two elements using what are essentially nuanced synonyms, so I have no good reason to accept it over anything else." I took the information on its own terms and dissected it, finding nothing particularly insightful or thought-provoking. Then I mulled over the distinction between "experience" and "information" and I thought, hey, this sounds like the distinction between static sensation (Se) and dynamic sensation (Si), because dynamic perception of a sensory stimulus integrates that stimulus with the rest of the individual's experiences to create a tapestry of its life-story, while static sensation dissects the sensory stimulus in much the same way I dissected that abstraction I was referring to above, looking for objectively useful details that can be utilized effectively (ie, what I think of when I think about "seeking information").

So, I don't really care if or how this relates to "what you're saying," because it is DIRECTLY RELEVANT to the objectively defined theory regarding the functions, which constitutes, along with the point you're trying to make, the context from and in which you are speaking.K. Already felt like I was shouting into the void, now I know it's 4 realzThe conscious/unconscious aspect of functions is difficult to make broad assertions about.

Jung described the introverted judging functions as being "unconscious" processes.

He also said that Ni draws its preceptions from the unconscious.

And then Beebe says that the unvalued functions are related to your "Shadow," an aspect of your personality that you aren't usually aware of.

Thing is, the four functions are supposed to encompass your entire perceptual experience, both unconscious and conscious. It's likely that all of the functions have conscious/unconscious aspects to them.

Then of course, I have a problem describing functions as either being strong or weak in an individual. A function is more like a state of mind than a skill. The "skill" involved is more about knowing when it's time to change your perspective, and doing so while staying true to your values, I think.I placed them into quadrants.

You on mobile? shiiiii...Everything I know how to do I learned through near-endless repetition. Monomaniacal focus has always been a strong point of mine (note to self---ISTJ?)

Example: when I was a tyke, I stayed home and played videogames like everyone else, but I'd always spend inordinate amounts of time learning how to "fail" a level in every way that I could. Then I would go through it again and beat it really quickly.

When I work on improving a skill, like say, a foreign language, I usually go online to find the best (free) methods available to me via blogs and stuff. I guess I try to piece together a linear progression of items to complete, and then put it together in such a way that I reach my end goal within an acceptable amount of time. Then it's all grinding from there. However, sticking with the schedule can be hard not because I lack motivation, but I usually begin to have doubts as towards the effectiveness of the plan. So if I begin to doubt that my vocab set is actually going to be useful, I'm inclined to stop the process altogether until I find something more suitable. This is a huge problem for me; when I learn more about a field, I have to change the way I go about approaching it. I'll end up spending more time reframing my process than following through with it.

I honestly enjoy my process though, so long as a) every piece of it has a set obligation that I can fulfill, and b) I'm still confident that it's working.

My best skill: Swordsman. Self-taught. This is the only thing no one has ever been able to best me at, at least since I entered adolescence. I honestly don't know how this happened. I was big into star wars as a kid, I liked to have light-saber fights with my friends. Now I'm fucking unstoppable.

I'm usually interested in learning something "the right way." When it comes to physical skills, I'm focusing on the kind/level of fitness it grants me, the control it grants me, etc. With mental skills, I'm more experimental, more ruthlessly completest, though. And expansive. I'll try to incorporate as many elements as possible into my language learning routine, whereas I'm content with just one simple exercise routine (so long as I'm getting the desired benefits from it). (edit: I guess this comes from the fact that I only have one body, so maintaining it/reaching desirable levels of physical fitness/attaining control over it through martial arts or dance forms, I see all that as one lifelong process; whereas mental skills like foreign languages or musical forms are so plentiful and each one is so uniquely complex that I feel the need to really research them so I don't choose the wrong one, learn it the wrong way, etc. And each one is... mysterious I guess. So I'm not so sure where/how to start, until I've gotten however many dozen hours into it. Then I'll start over, using a more involved process. Get to a similar point where I know better. Repeat)

My type: I thought I was an INFP, but after reading this...Fuck youMore extroverted than an INTP, I'd say. Aux Se = less averse to conflict and risk taking behavior, meaning they feel more comfortable coming out of their shells in social situations where rejection is a possibility.If you can prove to me, using function theory, that ISTPs are, on average, more introverted than either INFP, INTP, ISTJ, or INTJ, then you have a valid point. You haven't done this yet.Without the theory, there are no types at all. Everything we know about typology is built on theory. You're a fool if you think you can extricate your assertions from itYou wanna talk about dichotomies, now? Prove with dichotomies that ISTP is more introverted than any of the other types.

Dichotomies are only favored because they're easier to measure on a test. They're not mutually exclusive with function theory.&gt; Well again, it's hard to *prove* anything (you should really stop using that word)

But you seemed SO SURE of yourself when you said this:

&gt; ISTP extraverted? You're crazy

I just wanted to know your rationale. I provided mine in my original comment.

Any-who, your "evidence" doesn't provide a rationale either. Just a stereotypical description of an ISTP. Can't you think for yourself and come up with SOME kind of a reason for your assertion?

&gt; Any evidence for one type being more introverted than another based on *functions* is dubious at best.

My explanation may be "dubious" by your standards (I'm guessing the entire field of typology is dubious to you as well?), but so far it's better than anything you've said. You picked a fight, and now you're backing off and trying to pick another one.

Just tell me, if you think it's so hard to prove the level of a type's extroversion, why were you so adamant that ISTPs are "not really social or gregarious at all," and that they "probably say the fewest words out of any type?" Those claims are baseless. There is absolutely nothing to back them up, unless you count the regurgitation of mediocre type descriptions.Oh, so now I have to take you at your word that, since the ISTPS *you* know are social introverts, the type is introverted. Did you perhaps consider that I may know some socially extroverted ISTPs? Truth is, since I don't know you, and you haven't actually demonstrated any masterful insight into typology, I don't have any reason to believe that the people you know have been typed correctly. This is why I stick to theory. It's objectively defined, meaning real discussion can actually occur.

When I asked you to "prove" your assertion, I really just wanted you to prove that there was some actual thought behind them. You still want to leave the premise of our original disagreement, which further fuels my suspicion that there wasn't.

If you wanna check, you would realize that my "functions bullshit" actually adheres to the general consensus in this thread, meaning that in this instance, there's a lot more meat to my theory than you're giving it credit for.

So whatever. You wanna keep dismissing the validity of the widely agreed-upon premise for my argument, you go right ahead. Really though, you shouldn't engage in discussion on here if you aren't willing to at least entertain the idea that there might be something to function theory. In reality, function theory led to the development of the dichotomies, and the fact that *those* correlate with big 5 should be enough to lend at least a small amount of credibility to Jung's original work.Wtf who takes an uber to the hospital?Wow. I see you've managed to respond to literally every part of my comment that doesn't matter. You don't have to take that shit personally (I sure as hell wasn't), I was just underlining how fed up I was with your unwittingly condescending, myopic tone.

Oh yeah. I'm ISFJ, so...Good stuff. Why are you talking to me again?Look guy. You still haven't brought any rationale to the table as to why ISTPs are more introverted than INTPs, INFPs, ISTJs or INTJs. That is the original issue you took with me. The argument of whether or not functions are valid has nothing to do with this, unless you're trying to say that it's impossible to gauge introversion in a type, in which case you've strayed from that issue.

And yes, personally I know three ISTPs (two are family members of mine), and, while I wouldn't call them party animals, they are all quite socially inclined, at least compared to my IxTJ friends. Not that I believe this adds objective credibility to my argument, or care if you respect it.Ah, because you like to hear yourself talk! I should've known.I realized I was talking to a nut 7 comments ago. You're never getting a serious reply from me againFun?Your outside source was literally crap. And it didn't provide a rationale. Just a stereotype.

You seem to think I bullshitted my way through making those quadrants. I didn't. In fact, I made them before this thread even existed.

You also seem to think that I intended for the quadrants to LITERALLY indicate that some introverted types are actually extroverted. They're simply indicated as being *more* extroverted than the other introverted types. My rationale is simply this:

Fe=more "extroverted" than Te
Se=more "extroverted" than Ne
Repression of either of these makes you more introverted
Not valuing either of these makes you more introverted

You really haven't been arguing with me. You wanna keep saying "but functions aren't REAL" yeah well that's cause it's fucking THEORY. It's a rational explanation for observable behavior, not a hard and fast, fool-proof law of human nature. Nobody ever took this shit for dogma, but simply ignoring it and then claiming to be intellectually superior is a fucking waste of time. You wanna argue with me, do it in my fucking court.Cuz there's no right way to be the butt of a dick joke. No wrong way either, but stillIt's been done before, and more creativelyK. Personal insults aside, let's actually have a discussion now.

On the issue of which functions are "opposites" to Se and Fe (you say Ti and Ni), I would actually say it's Si and Fi (they take opposite approaches to similar kinds of info), which is why I placed deltas (STJs and NFPs) in the "introverted" quadrants. 

Also, you know which other type has primary+tertiary Ni and Ti? INFJs, which you're quoted as being able to mistake for extroverts. So what is it about INFJs that makes them seem more extroverted than ISTPs? At this point I don't know if that's supposed to be a  remark about my being really typically INFP or if you're praising my godly sense of humorAnyone can project. Case and point: this entire comment threadInteresting, do you think SPs are more focused on making their visions a reality, while NJs are more inclined to make their visions accurately reflect reality so they don't have to change things in the real world?I don't think I'm necessarily defining Ni in such a way that conflicts with Jung's definition, or at least I don't intend to.

For instance, with all this socionics-esque talk about vision manifestation, I made a point not to make assertions about the source of those visions (which I think can only be derived from the unconscious). How those visions are interpreted and utilized is another matter.

I just want to demystify the process a bit if I can. Seems like the function might be used to "cover" perceived Se weaknessImo, "nobody really *Knows* anything, because in X years you're gonna be dead" is one of the most SP things I've heard anyone say. It's that Ni lining the back of his consciousness as a foregone conclusion.I would say he's talking smoothly at the expense of not making a whole lot of sense. Just letting his Fi-Ni run wild.&gt;Ne is an endless ideas generating machine.

Nope. More like an uncertainty detector.OK

What I'm talking about is the fact that Ne as a function means something different from what people usually describe on this forum.

If you think about it, Se is about objectively describing reality (things that really are there). Ne is about objectively describing possibility (things that aren't necessarily there, but could very well be). Se gives you definitive, certain facts about the environment. Ne gives you a vague sense of what could hypothetically be true about the environment.

Ne is more about anticipation than ideas. Anticipating the truth is helpful in academics because you're working with things you haven't learned yet, and people who are used to the "plastic perception" of Ne are more open to the possibility that things aren't the way they had originally thought them to be.It's practically an essay thesis on the ISFPI'm not knocking Se. Se is limited but it's clearly defined. Ne, while unlimited, is completely undefined. Ne is uncertain. It beats around the bush, and even negates itself in certain situations.

So an INFP might say more words than an ISFP, but he'll be less sure of himself, and might even be afraid to commit to any specific point. Just watch Bob Dylan talk, how certain he is, if maybe a little incoherent. That's not Ne.I only took issue with your definition of Ne, because it was limiting your discussion. That other user can fight their own battles.The crash course argument was presented in a manner befitting an IxFJ: easily graspable and generalized moral stances (nazis are bad, racism is bad, self-determination is good, etc)-Fe, propped up with flimsy rationalizations that are not only bad logic but don't jive with reality-tert/inf Ti. And this in service of a single, skewed interpretation of the world (Pi)

The response seemed pretty TJ, because of the emphasis the speaker placed on the moral imperative of factual accuracy (Fi).

I prefer listening to ranty british guys over crash course videos any day.

Either you're an indoctrinated ideologue and can't be swayed, or you're an objective analyst and can only be swayed by facts, or you aren't paying attention/don't care enough/both. (Edit: and I don't think your type really figures into this. Has more to do with the effects of... *environmental factors*... on intellectual development)Most Je-doms have a pretty good handle on Ne.

Ji-doms just react to a stimulus on its own terms regardless of how it fits their worldview, so if it's weird and unconventional they don't care, and they'll like it if it flies in the face of conventional Je-wisdom (but only their kind--Fe for Fi-doms and Te for Ti-doms). And if they understand something others don't, that's validating their Ji reasoning, which they have trouble putting into words. 

INxPs stress about that validation more than ISxPs. ISxP usually thinks "I know I'm right, so why do I have to explain myself? I'll just show them. Don't believe me just watch." INxPs aren't so sure of themselves, but they can apply their Ji more flexibly, so they can always generate a unique/fresh take on any problem. So INxP takes pride in that he can find a way to make horse-sense out of anything.Both Ti and Fi are given to judgments that are difficult to put to words.

For Ti-users, this problem arises as judgments become more and more complex. Ti has a nearly infinite capacity for complexity, and if it's allowed to run wild, its reasoning can become entirely too dense for anyone to reasonably be expected to understand.

Fi doesn't have so much of a problem with complexity (though it is quite sensitive to nuance, as is Ti). What Fi lacks is the explicitness of Ti, because Fi judgments are unconsciously derived. Fi responds to a tacit moral code that's rooted in the unconscious.the j just stands for "judging." I'm generalizing my statement to apply to both thinking and feeling{BINTP

My reasoning:

1) it has to be a j-dom, because N-doms aren't generally aware of their sensing (so INTP, INFP, ENTJ, ENFJ)

2) thinking is closer to sensing than is feeling--both thinking and sensing are explicit, ie rooted in the conscious mind (so INTP, ENTJ)

3) Si is more intensive than Se. It's also more subjective, implying that it stays truer to the actual nature of sensation. Se has to sift out the unimportant bits to come to an actionable conclusion, Si takes it all in and brings everything into line.He's a dangerous opportunist who birthed his political career by rallying 10-15% of the American population into a seething mass of hatred, and who only has a chance at winning this election because of 1) a concerted, decades-long effort on the part of his party to demonize his opponent, and 2) the deliberate intervention of multiple governments' intelligence agencies.

If he wins, the actual policy decisions of his administration will likely not be so radical or temperamental as has been espoused by his critics (most likely it would resemble a republican presidency "typical" of the party's actions since the turn of the century), but Trump's success at consolidating and validating such a large group of highly motivated, militant reactionaries will (probably regardless of who's elected) set the tone for a social/political climate conducive to a more complete nationalist movement in the future.

IxFPThe fourth letter of an introvert's sociotype is switched, not the fourth function. An ISTP in mbti is an ISTj in socionics. But they're the same type with the same basic function model. 

Socionics is nice if you like symmetry and exploring all the permutations of a theoretical model. But, as far as I can gather, the original socionists would actually disagree quite a bit as to what the implications of their models were exactly, whereas the online socionics community works primarily with 1 model and 1 interpretation of that model, translated badly. Exposing yourself to it is good for getting you to think about the functions and how they might interact mechanically, because it goes pretty in depth into that aspect, but I think it's important to take any specific assertions about functions or intertype relations with a heap of salt, because many are wildly inaccurate.Being a Feeler only means you're more aware of how emotion/morality is playing into your thought process. Our familiarity with our own emotional states is a big factor in how empathetic we can be with others. 

Also, a sufficient awareness of your feelings can actually help you *refrain* from making decisions based on them (ex. "I know I'm angry right now, so I'm going to wait until I've cooled down before I say anything").lolz this is literally the definition of narcissistic personality disorder: being unable to distinguish your feelings from those of others. I would give you gold if I had any

Cognitive empathy isn't a superpower, just one axis on the graph. And Feelers are better at that too, just so you know...&gt;the patience required to iterate over a bunch of possible patterns.

Can you post a pic of a question that requires this? Usually with pattern recognition questions I just... recognize... the pattern...

prolly it's an S thingI said that what you wrote corresponds with the definition of narcissistic personality disorder, not that you yourself have the disorder. I half thought you might be joking because it was so spot on.

I don't care enough to diagnose you, but hey thanks for projecting intentions onto me. Really helping your "case"[Just to be helpful](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178110005901), here's an abstract of a recent journal article regarding empathy in narcissists

&gt;while NPD involves deficits in emotional empathy, cognitive empathy seems grossly unaffected.

Looks like I can have my cake and you can eat it tooI'm simply conceding that cognitive empathy is likely unaffected by the disorder. So you can be a strong cognitive empathize(r?) and I can be right that you still described a personality disorder.&gt;seriously considering nihilism

Seriously considering not giving a shit? If you care enough to weigh the pros and cons, I don't think you're ready for nihilism...

Something doesn't add upGotta do it even though it's a bit old

I'm probably ISFP

"Sure"

"Alright"

"Sounds good"

"I don't know"

"I don't know about that"

"Yeah"

"No problem"

"I could go for that"

"Maybe"

"What do you mean?"

"Actually"

"I mean..."

"Well, like..."

**Only when I'm alone:**

"Fuckin A"

"Whatever"

"Shut up"

"Goddamnit"

"mmhmm"

"Get outta here"

"Let's get it"

"Boiii"

"Bowahh"

"Good God!" (in James Brown voice)A lot of it is just so specific in stipulation that there's no way it can be accurate across the board. The traditional mbti models leave more room for interpretation, but that also means you have to work harder to interpret them.

Jung originally used his model as a tool for psychoanalysis, and each subject of his was a unique case that he had to get to the bottom of on their own terms. He wasn't interested in exploring the implications of his model on a global scale. 

That's what Socionics is about. And the socionists definitely made errors; different socionists would often make assertions about the types that were irreconcilable with each other, in which cases at least one of them would have to be wrong. Simply put: the farther you take the theory from its roots, the more room there is for error.This sounds like low Si more than anything else. You seem to always weigh the opportunity-cost of achieving an ideal sensory experience, which implies that Ne is taking precedence.I like being able to sift people's (including my own) thought processes through my understanding of the cognitive functions. It gives me an idea of what perspective(s) might be missing. Like "hey, maybe it's time to explore the moral implications of your solution" or "how are my expectations informing my perception right now?" 

Makes the balancing act of constructing a workable worldview just a little easier.Just based on what you know about the functions, consider which function pairs you think could be your primary/inferior. 

It's one thing to say "I might be Fi-dom" and another to say "I might be Fi-dom/Te-inf"I observe the opposite. P-ism tends to predominate in the portrayal of male protagonists in mainstream films and tv: the lone ranger who wanders from town to town, doing what he believes is right. Or the smartass who can solve any problem he puts his mind to, but pisses everyone off in the process.

If a character has his shit together and his place in the world is clearly defined, there's not a whole lot of room for crisis (drama) to occur. So, when you're writing a plot full of tension and interesting twists, it's easier to rationalize the decisions of a protagonist who puts up with all that shit happening in his life by attributing P-values to him.It's what I observe. The ESTPs and ESFPs in my life are all very much the kinds of people who you'll find working/playing themselves into the ground every day for the sheer enjoyment of it, but they've all seemed to learn that they need to set certain boundaries in their lives if they're gonna make it to 30 or whatever. Kinda coolYou know, it's really interesting how many ISTPs have contributed to this discussion. Maybe Thinking plays a bigger role in the capacity for self-control than I thought. I'm sure greater efficiency and confidence in your methods doesn't hurt.

I'd be interested in hearing what other ISFPs have to say on thisBefore last night, America was a myth

Now it's a joke

ISFPHe didn't have to sell anything. Misogyny won this election for him.

Trump was as much of an advertisement against himself as he was an effective motivator for his base. What tipped him over the edge were the millions of Americans who decided to stay home because they had gotten it into their heads that they hated Hillary enough to stay home.By 250,000 votes.

Number of registered voters in 2016: 200 million

Number of counted votes as of now: 124 milliondemocratic voters were down 6 million from 2012

republican voters were down 1 million from 2012

Addendum: there's nothing to imply here. But I don't think you can blame Hillary  for anything other than being Hillary (her ground game was on point); Trump's campaign was a fiasco by any objective measure.A campaign can be a fiasco and still win its candidate an election. Trump lost a lot of voters, but not as much as Clinton. Blame whoever you want. I'm not gonna defend or condemn anyone anymore, it'd just be more noise at this point.|B^ [D]inf Se: not seeing the ways in which your *vision* of the world (dictated by unconscious processes) is relevant to the *actual* world around you.

dom Si: constructing a worldview by placing your new experiences in the context of other experiences you've had, relying on and constantly editing this wellspring/map of experience in an effort to escape uncertaintyMy view is that the only function that an introvert doesn't regularly introvert is the inferior, and likewise the only function that an extravert doesn't regularly extravert is *their* inferior.

So I would say that any type's "dominant state" would be their relational attitude applied to their first 3 functions. At "rest," an ISTP would be making pretty substantial use of Ti-Si-Ni; an ESTP "at rest" would be using Se-Te-Fe.

The auxiliary function is the most "ambiverted" of the functions, and when you're getting out of your shell (edit: or checking yourself, if you're an extravert) that's the one that bends into the objective (or subjective) attitude the easiest.Aw, it's too bad he didn't run on those things he said there, and instead based his campaign on blindly validating and making impossible promises to an angry and uninformed slice of the populace.Sorry dude, but you don't know what you're talking about.

Trump's most stalwart supporters were the ones that went to his rallies. Watch one of his rallies why dontcha. Shit is fucking sickeningInteresting, but vague enough to be applied to the agenda of anyone in a position of political power.&gt;why must the axis be along Se-Ni lines as opposed to just simply S-N.

Extraversion is about focusing on the objective attributes of the object, basically anything that can be utilized practically or easily communicated to someone else. If you rely on Sensing for this purpose, the gaps in your perception aren't going to be objectively definable--you've got those bases covered. What you aren't paying attention to in this case is your inner life, where you derive personal meaning from the world.&gt;What would it look like if someone was missing one of these "functions"?

I think this is pretty much what a lot of people *try* to do. That's the idea behind having repressed functions: you rely on your primary function (the one you're most comfortable with) and hope you don't have to do anything else. 

Problem is, I don't think it's really possible to *get away* from a repressed function. I guess it'd be doable if you didn't actually have a "self" or if you existed in a vacuum. Ultimately the functions describe how you relate yourself to the world, and they exist regardless of what's actually going on inside your head. You have to have *some* kind of a relationship with Se, because stuff *is* going on in the world that you can objectively perceive with your senses. You'd have to not have any senses in order to not have Se, nomsayin?being IxxPs, they both seem to have a "just me against the world I guess" sort of deal to em. both tend to resent social situations where they have to casually talk with people they don't know. both are commonly enneagram 9 (all IxxPs seem to have e9 issues because of how often their views bring them into conflict with others)I think ISxJs are over-represented by the mbti instrument. Not saying they aren't necessarily more common than other types, but test-takers are likely to skew towards those types the most based on the questions.

If you're answering questions about yourself, your test results will likely make you appear more introverted than normal. Since your attention is directed inward, you're making more use of your introverted functions, which is supposedly what's being measured by the instrument. So if there's any error on the E-I axis of the test, it's skewed towards I

People who are unsure as to the meaning of a question will usually choose the most sensible sounding answer. The S-N axis questions basically ask "are you weird?" People usually answer "no" to that. So testing error's probably skews towards S.

The P-J questions on the instrument are basically measuring self-perceived conscientiousness. "Do you have your shit together?" Most people would say yes. "Are you a flake?" Most people say no. Test-takers skew toward J over P

I still believe that the mbti instrument is valid and reliable, but the error that is undoubtedly present is going to favor ISxJ test results over others.

So I doubt the population discrepancy between INTPs and ISTJs is as steep as the charts would have you believe.

But as far as other things go, people who self-type tend to begin the journey assuming they're N's. I know I did. Maybe the simple fact that you aren't sure of your type automatically activates your intuition and brings it to the forefront of your consciousness when it wouldn't otherwise be so. I don't know.

Also, I would assume that a lot of the people on the INTP sub are mistyped, since that's the "nerd mascot" of mbti, and a lot of the people on reddit are proud, self-described nerds. However I wouldn't assume the ISTJ sub to be full of mistypes, since the people on there would have only been able to come to their type conclusion objectively. There's no emotional "hook" to that type like there is to INTP.Sort of? I know one who's always in the process of reading at least 6 books at any given time, so he's always in the mood to read at least one of them. The philosophy seems to be that if you have a lot on your plate, then you can pick and choose whatever you feel like doing at the moment and not get stuck with something boring. So if boredom is an obstacle to productivity for you, then yes.Provided they aren't reasonable adults who talk it over when they disagree on things, they'll probably just shut up and pretend it doesn't matter until they hit a sour patch (slow-burning holocaust of mutual resentment).&gt;INTP and ENTP are so similar that it's meaningless to try to distinguish between them

This talk is dumb. The guy says he's an ENTP by Jung's functions. According to Jung, ENTPs are MUCH more different from INTPs than socionists would have you believe.

Let's look at how Jung categorized the types:

He thought that the manifestation of an auxiliary function was a matter of nuance, and didn't go into detail about it because the differences were so minute.

By this logic, the most similar type to an INTP is the **ISTP**, and the most similar type to an ENTP is an **ENFP**. This might fly in the face of the socionics-indoctrinated folks who think the functions operate mechanically ("QUADRAS?!?!?!!?"), but we're talking Jung here.

**ENFP** and **ISTP** can't really be any more different from each other, regardless of what function model you use. Does it stand to reason that their closest relatives on the spectrum would be so similar as to be indistinguishable?

Honestly, any test that types you as an introvert when you're really an extrovert is dead wrong.Don't really care if you think mbti is useful, this is about how you go about interpreting it.

Clearly you've not read much Jung. The biggest delineation Jung identifies is between introverts and extraverts. Jung's extraverted intuitive type utilizing auxiliary thinking is what mbti calls an ENTP.Nothing wrong with socionics except it's rigid and makes too many broad claims. And socionists weren't focused on analyzing the psyche (Myers was). I'm mostly annoyed with people who take the model-A approach and apply it to everything.First let’s talk about emotions. 
What is an emotion? I mean, we all experience them. It seems easy. You know: a loved one dies, and that makes me sad. I might cry, and otherwise do things that don’t make sense. I might feel literal pain. But why does it happen? The response seems hardwired. You don’t learn sadness like you learn math. Compared to rational thought, emotions seem very mysterious.
Okay, well I guess that means that thoughts must NOT be so mysterious, so let’s see if we can’t solve this problem in the other direction. What is a thought? Well, at its very essence, it’s just a pattern. 1+1=2. It’s a thought. It’s consistent. It’s complete. Every time you do the problem you get the same answer. You can build on that. (1+1=2)+(1+1=2)=1+1+1+1=2+2=4. Look at that! You can do all kinds of stuff with these things. There’s literally no end to the certainties you can achieve with thought. On the other hand, there’s no end to the uncertainties you can achieve with emotions. Follow your emotions to their roots and you hit a wall very quickly. “Why am I sad?” “Why do I love?” The easy answer is to chalk it up to evolution, to say that social bonding is beneficial to the survival of a group, but the questions are not really answered. Knowing how a general phenomenon first came about is not enough to explain the origins of its manifestations. The true nature of an emotion, and what distinguishes it from a thought, is that its origins lie in the unconscious. All emotions are perceived in incomplete form, which makes us think they must be irrational (“I can’t make sense of this!”), and in a sense, they are. To be truly rational, the process, the pattern must be completely realized in the conscious mind. An emotion is rooted in the unconscious, and so long as it remains so rooted, it will never be a thought.
Now let’s talk about imagination.
What does it mean to be imaginative? I guess I would say that someone who has a lot of ideas, or who sees a lot of possibilities in the world, is imaginative. But what separates an idea from an experience? What separates a possibility from a reality? To the mind, a “real” perception is no more tangible than an imagined one. Here we come across the fundamental difference between sensation and ideation, and the distinction is so very similar to the one we were exploring earlier. Where might an ideation come from, except the unconscious? You can’t think one up, not with the faculties of the conscious mind alone! And as for the reverse, should you be able to, in a waking state, conjure a true sensory experience with no basis in reality as provided by the conscious, then, in the words of that guy from The Avengers who gave Bruce Banner some new pants, “You’ve got yourself a condition!”

Okay so the proposition is that intuition and feeling are the ‘unconscious’ counterparts to sensation and thought. Not to say that like all thoughts are just conscious feelings and all feelings are just unconscious thoughts (or even that they’re made of the same stuff), but they approach a merging of the two portions of the mind from opposite directions: say like the conscious mind is ‘above ground’ and the unconscious mind is ‘below the surface.’ Thoughts and sensations attempt to ‘dig into’ the unconscious with shovels and such while intuitions and feelings are plants/minerals/magma/whatever that’s being ‘pushed out’ into the conscious. Thought it might be good to get people thinking about this stuff a little differently.
When considering the notion that extraverted sensation is a "competitive" process, my interpretation is that high Se-users attempt to "assert" their version of reality on the world in the face of whatever obstacle they come across, whether it be physical, hypothetical, factual, or personal in nature. In low Se-users, these sorts of activities would be more subverted, and might take the form of "passive" assertion, in which the individual's vision of the world is simply stated or somehow tested without being directly enforced by him. Prediction could be seen as an ideal way to do this.

Thoughts?I've never met an Se-dom who wasn't uncompromisingly restrained in at least one area of his/her life. Either you guys never smoke or drink, or you keep a tight sleep schedule, or you go for runs every day (no exceptions), it's always something. This seems to go against traditional portrayal of Se-doms (and Se in general) in the online community.

Myself, pretty sure I'm an ISFP, I don't exhibit this kind of restraint in my life, but I don't tend to have such an appetite for experience anyways (Se is lower in the stack, but it's also quite a bit more introverted), so I don't often go overboard. I'm wondering if Se-doms have to learn to control themselves just to survive or what.
Fun fact: I didn't know about this whole mbti for a long time *after* I got married. When I finally did I checked my type and forced by husband to do the same. Turns our we're INFP-ENTJ. I think it works briliantly. Although maybe it would be easier to be with an ENFJ, it wouldn't be so interesting (I know some ENFJs too, I just don't feel the attraction). Totally this one: [Miike Snow - "Genghis Khan"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_SlAzsXa7E)Honestly? Almost all of my friends are extraverts. I feel awkward being around introverts, because then I feel like I have to do all the talking.  
When I'm around extraverts I feel like they're putting all the energy inso socialising and all I need to do is just follow them around.^ So much this. I have an INTP friend, who is great to have around, talk etc. When we talk it's like I forget about whole world, I'm so into the conversation. But sadly it doesn't last for too long, before he'll forget to say hi for the next couple of months (I don't get it).From my personal experience - as ENFJ crave group harmony they will go as far as possible to make everyone happy. But not everyone can be happy, especially if there are conflicts in the said group (person A wants to do X, person B wants to do Y). In my opinion it's very unhealthy. Not only ENFJ's are stretching themselves to meet the ends goal (keep conflicts to minimum), but actually they're often just pushing it under the rug, instead of solving it. It's not just "being too nice".This so much. Was obvious to me ever since I got interested in his biography.How ENTP of you to say!I really like this one http://personalityjunkie.com/ and this was the first time I heard about mbti https://www.16personalities.com/If someone you're in relationship with (ESTJ) asked you to go abroad with them, even if  you don't speak the language (you'd have to learn and eventually find a job there), would you do it? (and why/why not?)Or real love isn't true?I feel very sorry for my husband (ENTJ) being in a sensory family (ESTJ) mother and (ISFJ) sister:PHm... r/infp ?;) Why INFP specifically?It's hard to pick them imho, but look for the quiet ones, who seem to have their own worldand quirky ones in group of friends. From my experience INFP tend to gravitate towards ENFP naturally;)"Fi - My opinion is right, nothing you say will make me change my mind and I will defend it to the death!" - More like "My opinion is based on my core values and therefore I will silently still believe in it."Since you're INFP as me - I wholoheartedly enjoy my two **ENTP** friends, so that would be my best bet. I find S-types *mostly* boring apart from ISFP and sometimes ISFJ. Also! How is your inferior function doing? :D (I thought I was INTP for some time too).Does personalities really never change over time? Would a person never go from being introverted into extraverted? What about when we're teenagers? Thanks for any answers.INFP here [Jeff Buckley - I know it's over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzIQquWxyK4)That's funny! The more I was looking at them the more sure I was of my choice. Also 30/36Dreamer I guess? And learn to read woman better!Think about your inferior function. INFP's often mistype themselves as INTP's because they feel like they're more logical then other INFPs. It **is possible** for INFPs to maintain their logical thinking, while still being Fi dom, when they develop their inferior function Te. This often leads to being drawin into science or maths etc. I would recommend you to check this site - http://personalityjunkie.com/infp-personality-type-profile/ and especially parts about "INFP Personality Type Development &amp; Functional Stack" and "INFPs’ Inferior Function: Extraverted Thinking (Te)". Hopefully it will shed some light.I can't say as I'm not INTP. I'm saying from my own experience and what helped me understand on which side of fence I belong more. Check the site I linked, the inferior function is explained for INTPs too.Since you clearly didn't check out the webpage, I'll leave this quote here for you: "INFPs’ inferior function, Extraverted Thinking (Te), approaches and structures the world in explicitly rational ways. It may do so for the sake of acquiring knowledge (e.g., science), developing new tools and technologies, or maintaining order by ways of explicit rules, policies, and procedures. As an extraverted judging function, it also serves as a tool for verbally asserting, in a deliberate and rational fashion, judgments and directives.

However, because Te is largely unconscious for INFPs, its powers are difficult to directly and consistently harness. This elusiveness contributes to its allure and mystique, which is illustrated, for instance, in INFPs’ frequent attraction to characteristically T-oriented careers such as math, science, law, economics, computers, engineering, etc. "^ my thoughts exactlyIt's unconscious, but it also points out that INFPs are drawn into science, maths etc. That *does* contribute to the *feeling logical*. That's where most INFPs get confused and this is the exact reason for that.  
I didn't imply loops. I implied overall development, as per stages suggested on personalityjunkie.  
By the way, I at least linked a source unlike you.I wish it was more evenly spread RL &gt;&lt;I dont see here much about the emotions and you seem pretty introverted. Lots of analysing too, sooo I'd guess INTP.While it is good to have the opposite functions on the I/E, F/T and J/P axis, the real struggle is on S/N. N tends to go on analysing the future possibilities. S will focus on past and present. I get along with NT's much better than any other kind of S. Soooo...not sure if you're right.I have an ISTP friend too, I appreciate that we can go months without talking and then pick it up right where we left it. I find him too grounded to reality though:P It's fine a time, then it gets bothersome.This is going to sound very strange, but I always had the same impression - religion came easy to me, as opposed to for example my partner (ENTJ).Well I dont want to point out specific mbti types, but I know some people openly quarreled that "some things shouldnt be said out loud" which resonates a lot with non authenticity.Well I dont want to point out specific mbti types, but I know some people openly quarreled that "some things shouldnt be said out loud" which resonates a lot with non authenticity.Easier yes, but why would you conform to their rules?Quite interesting. I know two ENFJs and the first one managed to elude me for longer while, i just never thought he thinks so much about the world. I thought he's sort of ESFP. But when I met the second one I instantaneously knew what's going on and we became instant friends.Not really. I'm INFP and happy in 10 year long relationship with ENTJ.While this is all true with dominant and inferior functions, it would be a better pairing to keep the same S or N. So for ENTP better match would be INFJ than ISFJ. You still have flipped dominant and inferior functions, but the communication is better (thanks to N).Okay what do you call J-doms? And semi duals? Because I'm not sure which pairing you're suggesting for them.
Well okay I guess the inferior-dominant pairing might be just as well fulfilling as disastrous. I believe it can be great way to develop our inferior function with someone who has it as dominant, but it might not be as common. I personally value developing in general, so I think it's great.So? I'm only pointing out it's not as crazy pairing as you might think. Fi-doms aren't crippled to the point of not being able to function with Te-doms well.Ah gotcha. Yes that's basically what I wanted to say with the semi-duals. From my experience though I don't get drawn to any sensors, least to ESTJ's. I know a couple of them and they are extremely closed-minded, which is totally different to ENTJ's I know. Hence I pointed out the N-in common. What's your experience with duals and semi-duals?Nope, not really. Try "developing".You can never really ensure that some matching will work, only based on a personality chart, but it can be a great guide, if used correctly. There is this chart http://s1213.photobucket.com/user/xxNTJxx/media/MBTI-Enneagram-Correlation2.jpg.html someone linked me once. From my memory 9 are very common for INFP. (I am 7w8, apparently very rare).Because you asked I took the test again (and different one at that). It tells me "it's not clear from these test results which enneagram type you are, most likely 9, but takin wings into account: 7w6" :P I feel that 9s seems to be timid, but since I care about the truth and authenticity I can be easily blunt (all INFP I believe). I know much more about mbti than enneagram, so I am pretty certain I am INFP.I figure, just didnt find enough information regarding it. I read description for 7w8 and it seemed to fit at the time. Especially with sort of hedonistic approach to life.I figure, just didnt find enough information regarding it. I read description for 7w8 and it seemed to fit at the time. Especially with sort of hedonistic approach to life.INFP (as every type) can differ greatly. Some of them people are more emotional than others and some are more outgoing and "happier". I can imagine that mostly young INFPs struggle to find friends and look for guidance of the sub.NT reasons are sexy reasons.It's common for INFP types to get mistyped as INTPs, because of our inferior Te, which often isnt that inferior. Also because unlike the common belief - we arent illogical:P I would recommed reading some bits and pieces on personalityjunkie web page about inferior functions in INFPs and especially "head vs heart."I don't like apple pie:(I don't like apple pie:(I think INFP. But if you really want to figure out your type, you would have to check cognitive functions. Fi and Ne make a lot of sense to me from your excerpt.I do this too (INFP).Some companies do tests. From my experience that's usually *after* they employ you, but I've heard in US in particular they can ask you to do the test as part of the recitation process. Sorry to jump in the middle, but could you give more examples? Really curious as to the rest of the personalities That's a really cool chart, thanks! Curious enough, since I think I read somewhere that for INFP the most interesting partner would be ENTJ? Most fascinating etc. I think I know like three INTJs and they are somewhat too closed for me to open them up. But I suppose the thing is I don't really get them:P which is true.At least it's not black! Which I always thought is painfully ironic in contrast of the most dreamy types!I agree with this.Nah I don't entirely agree. We even had this topic on r/infp at some point and many (+30) people answered. Yes.I don't know about the ISFJ, but for ENTJ I usually try to buy something they would buy/need anyway and add some flavour to it. For example my ENTJ wanted to have a night lamp, so I bought him one in a shape of tetris :) He was happy!What an ENTP thing to say:)Wow, sorry not to write on topic, but from my experience - there is this one ENFJ guy datin ESTJ girl. He had such a mental break down, when the girl was controlling towards him. He basically needed exactly this - space to make his own mistakes. Weird to hear something opposite from another ENFJ. (Sounds more like ExTJ thing to me).My guess - best ExTJ, worst...possibly INFP?Empathic and crazy (in a good way!)It depends on the type I suppose, but I can either see it going great or terrible. I'd say possibly Te would want to solve the conflict straight away, while Fe would want to avoid the conflict, dismiss it with a joke or something. You're right with Fi though.Then maybe it's impossible to make a generalisation. My ENTJ is always pressing me to solve issues ASAP, while my ENFJ friends are avoiding it, mostly by trying to downplay the issue.Wow, INFPs being the largest group:OIt's for scale.INFP  
    
I'd ideally have a some sort of closure, but I can live okay without one. It bothers me sometimes when people stop answering my text, calls etc abruptly without any explanation, but I can get over that without any harm. Just weird thing to do imo.Yes exactly that!So this is a topic that pops out every now and then on the r/infp sub for obvious reasons. I'll just copy my response from there. (Together with an ENTJ for 10 years and counting. When we got married I didn't know about mbti).  
    
    
As for the dynamic - there were many posts about it in the past, so I'll just copy what I've written then:  
* I help him to slow down, he helps me to speed up.  
* we develop each other and bring the best in each other through our differences (dominant Te/inferior Te and his inferior Fi/my dominant Fi).  
* ENTJ is destination driven, me being journey driven.  
* We look in the same direction in life, having different approach to it.  
* We value the same things (honesty, authenticity)  
* Both creative and open minded.  
* Fascination with our differences  
(I sometimes think I just found the right ENTJ, since his parents split and he decided to value highly an honest and harmonious relationship and work on it where needed.)INFP  
    
Really really really like surprises! Jumpscares are scary though. I don't watch horrors at all, I can't never get those pictures out of my head however un-scary they are. I guess what I'm the most scared of is my imagination.My dad is an ESFP, really difficult for us to understand each other. Apart from that I don't get along with sensors at all, ESFP are the easiest to be around with, but I can still sense the dissonance.

EDIT: That's a fact, not an opinion:/My dad is ESFP and he's such a Peter Pan O.oFunny enough the only INFP male I know had a nickname "depression man".I got ISFP first time and every other pretty close to INTP, but still INFP. It gives you an idea where to start, but better to check with cognitive functions later.So accurate for all the types I know:D...dudeI guess I was lucky, since I missed all the hype and was blown away by the movie. I had similar experience to yours with Interstellar however.My ENTJ never does this, but we have similar interests.I keep a list of movies recommend to me. Some recommendations are 5 years old.I definitely relate. I also had an INFJ mother and we are very close. I feel she had great influence on me and helped me develop in ways I wouldn't develop otherwise. Also because my family is intuitive-oriented I suck in communicating with sensors:/Close, ESFP. Never spend a lot of time with each other, I don't get him as hell:/Curious. How do you know you're an ISFP then? I score INFP on 16 personality test , but also got ISFP at some point.Creating.You could be INFP with strongly developed inferior function Te. I myself value harmony etc, but not on the expense of justice.Fi =/= lack of logic  
Ti =/= lack of feelingsI found that whether you're introverted or extroverted - doesn't matter. Ask questions, everyone likes to talk about themselves.Have you considered your inferior function? Wait if you're 14, then your personality is pretty much still developing.INFP: quality time, then physical touchInferior is your fourth function and in INTP that would be Fe, but for INFP that would Te. For that reason many INFP with developed Te mistype as INTP, because they feel they are more logicall than most INFP. But as I said - you're still developing, so there's no point pinpointing certain personality just yet.Lol!Hahah, I can relate! I mean duh, haven't they seen "The Brave Little Toaster"?[Always](https://media.giphy.com/media/10osILvZ4ez7ws/giphy.gif)Curious, I've always thought they're as far as possible. Also my parents. It always seemed to be as a relationship of Peter Pan (ESFP) with a caretaker (INFJ). What u/Chett0 said. I also don't buy your extroversion. Every introvert is talkative among their friends and people they know. No, the main question is where do you recharge your batteries - social situations: extroversion, alone time: introversion.Jesse Eisenberg practically plays himself in every movie, which is, INTP.I think INFPs are can easily flip out like that with no arguments in response actually.FYI I found Romeo and Juliet story total bullshit too.Fair enough, never saw that movie.What about semi-duals? My experience at least points me to intuitive people in general. This intuitive understanding + half of the same functions sounds better to me than any sensor, but then again it might just be my experience (had little to do with sensors whole my life). Then I guess there isn't a way to tell isfps and infps apart, because I 100% relate.For some reason I think INFPs have the worst duals..Okay yeah, that makes sense. I do get that 'calling' from clothes I like:PWhy not?Knowing a bunch of INFJs I agree.The guy I work with. He finished planning and his works consists of getting planning for 10-200 houses, networking with developers are land owners, getting best price for land and selling the land to the best bidder.    
    
He's rather noisy, happy, all over the place, loud, probably unaware of how much noise he makes around him, can't stay in one place or position for too long. Likes fashion and good food and some travelling, but mostly for the food and pleasures. He's nice and manipulative, but not in a bad way. People love him. Or hate him.    
    
I typed him long ago, but I found a way that tricked him to make the test (solving the test on my own? Pff boooring!). I had to read the question, then guess the answer then he would comment on it. Wasn't interested enough to read on the result. Probably forgot about all this the moment he left through the door.I know maybe like three INFPs and none of them is my immediate close friend. But I had one INFP friend in high school, so I guess it is possible you are just that group of a people, but it is also possible they can be INFJs or ISFPs and you mistyped them.One of the things I wouldn't say about INFP subreddit is that it's hard to keep track of the posts:D Granted there is about 5 posts a day, but that's perfect number to read all of them (new instead of hot page) every day and not to miss out on anything.That part about ideals and being the best you that you can be gives me INFP vibe. Read up about the cognitive functions though!:)Just because they're my type, doesn't mean they're shitty.Came to say I dislike ANY form of fakeness as well.Hey, something I can relate very much. How old are you? I used to please my infj mum with getting my education, but she disapproved of my clothing choice etc. Sometimes she would come up with emotional blackmail. For most of my teenage years I had a great relationship with my mum. She sort of gave me a steer to my life that I could work with, I learnt to be more down to earth, when needed. Now she'd prefer me to spend more time with her, which is not possible, because it's always me who has to travel, since she's afraid of long journeys. In the end, you learn that the only person you have to keep happy is yourself and if your mum starts being passive-agressive (like my sometimes, especially now she's older), you just end the conversation. I've noticed when I am being assertive, she is trying to diffuse the emotional situation, very Fe of her, but I guess I can live with it.Pretty sure, veeeery introverted.  Just seems as she wants to fix her problems on me ('you can't be a dreamer all the time') as for sensors I sense them from a mile 😂. My dad's ESFP though and someone had to take care of the family...Who?:PNot at all. It took you forever to respond xDsecondedCompletely different set of cognitive functions. what's your type?The least sensitive person I know is ENTP.Could be your Fi or you could be just shy. Are you an introvert?Sounds like me. What do you think your type is?So where's the Ne? Well I disagree mainly because I myself need to be connected in such a particular way only intuitives can provide you with that. I can only speak for my type though (also have two infp friends, who are getting divorced from sensors, where the lack of understanding contributed massively to their decision). I also fail to see how and why I would want to mesh with SJs in particular. Sure they are there in the society and they are important part of it (I guess), but they don't show much of qualities I search in friends. 

Just because ESTJ have inverted function stack to INFPs doesn't make them any more accommodating than ISFP would be.Honestly it sounds like you're jumping to conclusions. It something I noticed before learning about mbti and once I did, everything fall into place. It's a way of understanding surrounding world, not putting people into boxes.

Why would you find my comment arrogant? Do you feel left out? 

By the way, my family is mixed, so I wasn't even in the "sensors pool". I was wondering about other people experiences however.

Edit: The comment you made earlier on judgers made sense though. My best friend dates an ESTJ and we go on holidays every year. She's not that bad and in fact bought me some really cool gifts, but of course there's not much we can talk about. (I guess what I'm trying to say is that when closed in one room we'd just keep to themselves, so it wouldn't be entertaining at all).INFJs aren't out of touch with their emotions, they just doorslam people if they don't like what they see. But I know what you mean - happens to me several times with INFJs too.Well my mum is an INFJ and I can tell you that healthy INFJs who don't hate a certain group of people do exist. On the contrary really, for which their Fe is responsible I suppose.

I also don't see why being religious would mean hypocrisy.

I agree their appearance is usually inspired by wanting to be perceived a certain way in the society, but so does other mbti types. Expression through looks is particularly linked with INFPs 

I didn't say religion is logical, but that only because someone is religious doesn't mean he can't be logical in any other field they are talking about.

I also know racist and non-racist NFJs. That's not something that comes with the type.ENTP?ExplorerI'd say ISFP, but do answer to yourself if you recharge your batteries when around people or when alone. I personally am laid back and extroverted-like around people I know.Wear goth lol xD I used to wear a lot of black (metal), so I guess it suddenly makes sense.I think social chameleoning often gies with Fe doms, so ENFJ. Sometimes when they Fe-Se loop they end up chameleoning even more. 

"Fe being extremely adaptable and flexible function means that the enfj becomes completely chameleon-like and starts feeling a sense of 'loss of self' in the wake of fulfillment of expectations of others. Fe-Se ignores the nagging Ni which wants the enfj to stop indulging in such behaviour because overuse of Fe starts giving pleasure. This leads to the enfj bi-polar tendency where they are extremely kind  caring and giving (to a fault) and completely irrational and illogical"Same here

Edit: except I have mostly NTs friends and it's great.Sounds like unhealthy infpI don't think I could stand that 😂HerYour theory is right. As an intuitive my favourite colour is blue.Have you tried looking into cognitive functions? INTP and INTJ have some different functions in stack.It's not silly at all.[Please Understand Me II by David Keirsey](http://www.jeanlauand.com/Keirsey2.pdf)What's P about Ni-doms?Oh I didn't get P means perceiving FUNCTION. Gotch'ya.As a Fi user I wish Fe users understood they don't have to sacrifice themselves for the good of everyone around them and sometimes it's healthier to discuss the issue  instead of avoiding the conflict.It doesn't actually sound too correct, I am talking about your examples only. Ni doms would be more punctual than Ne doms if we can correlate it with functions at all. Ne doms would be too busy doing their shit to care to be on time and would end up being carried away, unlike Ni doms who actually plan things.

Same thing for INFPs - why would I want everyone around to hide their emotions? I want the authenticity therefore I'd prefer others to be open too. I guess your definition of emotions is confusing. For me emotions = feelings. Never thought about them separate before. 

I don't know any ENFP who would tell everyone to be punctual btw. Maybe it has to be an unhealthy type. 

I as INFP don't try to be unemotional, display of emotion isn't fake if you feel it. The same with other people around. But I get what you're getting at. I agree with all of this.INFP or ISFPWhy?INFP often appear to be INTP, this is because we aren't illogical and inferior Te can manifest in us when we're mature and developed.

Read up on phases and inferior function here: 
https://personalityjunkie.com/infp-personality-type-profile/

If you don't relate, then check the same with INTPs (they sometimes mistake their inferior Fe as Fi)Jeff Buckley and Robert Smith are both usually typed as INFP too.A LOT. Mostly validation of who I am and that I'm not the only one. Massive boost to my confidence and courage to be who I am.ENTPYes.Easy  - ask me questions about me and my interest, relate, respond, dig deeper.Yeah...check the order of cognitive functions  they really behave differently depending whether it's dominant or inferior.Sounds like ENFJ to me - fluctuating self esteem and strong Fe checks out. We even call our ENFJ friend 'chameleon' and that was before I made him take the test.Check more with cognitive functions , since you talk about P/J  but not Fi/Ti etc, it's not how it works. Oh and make sure what they mean in their respective positions (dominant, auxiliary etc)

Secondly people develop as they go along so it's not like you couldn't be INFP, you can be more mature one, perhaps with developed inferior Te. 

Not all INFPs are creative in the same way, you don't have to /produce/ any art.

That being said I am not saying you necessarily are one.
Are you that optimistic all the time? Do you find that you mostly live in the moment or you prefer to analyse yourself and others?Don't do tests, read about functions and make an informed decision. You did give me a first impression of ENFP, but I know very little about you in comparison to you. ENFP and INFP are very close to one another anyway (Ne Fi Si Te vs Fi Ne Si Te).I wish the same, but for T types. I don't think any other INTP added his input yet?I have the opposite experience with my friends group.I don't know much about you, but you sound like INFP to me and I will link you an article explaining about how Fi is a judging function and other INFPs traits: https://culturaldisasters.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/infp-the-authenticator/Read it man. Maybe you' relate. You're dissecting the types into separate functions too much. A type is a set of functions rather than separate functions stack together.Oh my god. Same with my parents!Lol. Yes, they're super attracted to each other, though I can't see how this could ever work for them. They had similar sense of humour and interests, but when it came to real life stuff my mum had to pretty much take over. They divorced after 15 years of marriage, so that on its own was impressive. My dad being the big child he is found someone new and settled for easy life. Still they love talking to each other etc. ESFPs def have a weird fascination towards xNFx, cause me and him don't understand each other (though we get on well with each other), but he's always so impressed with interesting theories and ideas, but he seems to only understand them on the surface. Either way, such a weird pairing, I thought it's highly unlikely.INFP checks out, apart from the lack of logic, being to scared to go outside (Ne, duh) and being vegan.So I'm ESTP, huh.I also see ENTJ - Te Ni x FiInteresting, I always hear INFP say 'oh I wish I knew another INFP rl'This one: https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.enneagramdimensions.net/enneatest_v7_excel_2010.xlsx&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1519081682582000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGow_VuVlXfZoQI2nyILxEOf7wAwA
So are ISFPsI never quarreled with my mum over cleaning my room, but the first bit was pretty accurate. My mum would eventually just put all my stuff in a black bin bag and sort of threaten to throw it away. I knew she wouldn't, but that eventually made me clean my room. She is INFJ.    
    
Also knowing one ENTJ - SO ACCURATE.
Edit: The quarreling bit, not the blackmail;)Out of curiosity - how do you two get along?94.1% INFP    
        
AccurateThis makes sense. Neither ESFP nor ENFP have Fe, but ISFJ does.A* Ni, Si, Fe etc.I'm INFP. In my work environment there's ESTP (boss), ESFP and ISTP. (Also ESFJ). I can tell you - it's hilarious.Not good experience, no attraction, no nothing. No idea how the world can stand ESTJs (might be my bad luck to negative ESTJs).     
    
Much better results with semi-duals.ExTP?First I thought you might be ENFJ, because of how self-consciously you started your post. You also say how much you like being around people, which says Fe to me. But then you go on saying how you like to be controversial too and how you start things, buy cannot continue doing them, which I'd say sounds like Ne. My hunch goes towards ENTP (Ne Ti Fe Si), but I left myself some margin in case you're more of a Se user. 

Also I don't really see any stronger indication of Fi or Fe being any higher in your stack - which doesn't mean you don't have it at all, because it sounds like you do. Maybe just not as your dominant or auxiliary. Also it's not about T Vs F, it's about cognitive functions and were they appear in your stack. It's about the whole image rather than sum of its parts. Hope this makes sense. It's still a guess as I don't know you irl.That sounds very characteristic of ENFJ. They have fluctuating self-esteem, subconsciously pick up on gestures and sayings of others and question where does the real them start and where other person ends. This is especially with strong dom Fe and poor Ni.

The perception bit sounds ENTP-y however. Naturally if you're going to share only parts of yourself that you choose without giving the bigger picture, people will mistype you.I meant it can be undeveloped, Fe-Se loops etc.Hence my further comment on ENTP.That's very arbitrary point of view.Don't we all?
(Curious - I don't really know what you all other types do)

Edit: typoMulanNo, but knowing what makes you angry can help discern your type. Also some types tend to be more controlling than others (micromanaging etc).You sound perfectly ESTJish to me.Basically. He tries to brainstorm, but I guess he just likes it, it's not super useful to him. I totally see ENTJs in the SlytherinTheodore from Her. Basically the dreamer type of a guy, struggling to fit into the world.Like the fool I am and I'll always be.   
    
I've got a dream, I've got a dream.   
    
They can change their minds but they can't change me.

INFP...what was it like growing up? Do you keep in contact with your families? What was the main thing you disagree on?

Share your experiences! Thanks!No idea, sorry:(You're such an ENTPEither that or INFP, but only because I can relate af.Yes, but at the same time - "No One Can Make You Feel Inferior Without Your Consent."I always had homework done on time and often people copied from me ¯\_(ツ)_/ ¯Lol, nope. No Fe at all. Also I think INFP would fit more in the "read at 5:50pm" categoryThanks! Appreciate it. \\Dying alone stood out and resonated with me.Soooo...  INTP? ENTJ?Check out Rick &amp; MortyDeveloping and maturing your type =/= change of your personality type.    
    
You will find INFPs who are emotional and struggle with conflict and you might find those who can maturely discuss things and won't get offended if you disagree.A lot of introspection, it takes time to learn how to make sense of it Props for Rick &amp; MortyI mean... you're not wrong.Just make sure to actually talk out the problem too.Why not figuring out who you are to begin with? Do you change your actions to fit moods of other people? I would say most INFPs love both of those subreditts, no?I'm easily spooked too and don't watch horrors at all. I don't check r/nosleep too often, but I definitely appreciate the creativity:)Winning is not the goal. Reaching a conclusion is.Thanks, very usefulMaybe try being gregarious, outgoing and eccentric and leave out the shit bit?I was trying to be funny (:But you mind end up being completely different than your parents which is bad enough. It's like with having blue eyes - your parents don't have to have them for you to end up with blue.Nah man, INFP blows up too when their emotions were bottled up for a while and they feel attacked. Throwing stuff included.*cries in Spanish*Tchaikovsky? IxFP?Yeah... maybe he doesn't think he can reach an understanding with you.ExTJ likelySo, why do you think you're ISFP again? Also ISFP is often called the artist, duh (unlike INFP the dreamer).Because your post doesn't seem explaining that.You should really dump her, like right now. It's even painful to read, please don't let others walk over you, you matter too.Wake up, he's being walked over and you're saying that's cool.Statistically there's more guys than girls on RedditYep, you can dump a friendLife will get better as you're grow older, go to uni, meet more people that are interested in the same stuff as you are. Trust your guts when it comes to people.Like eating a candy through the candy wrapper - I can almost connect with youAnd the chase goes on..Jaime1. INFP and no, always and INFP.   
    
2. Nope, I like doing job properly, but it's often "good enough", I don't beat myself over it.   
    
3.

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/33480491Someone turned off my desire to respond to things. Please send help.Just because something is temporary doesn't mean it's a lie
Never took this one. I got infj. Introvert(81%) iNtuitive(16%) Feeling(3%) Judging(3%)

Dont know about that
Still unsure. I take tests and type me's and i always get different results. I could be an infj, it fits, who knowsI wish the tests and the other things went into more specifics. I have a fickle, thin, and flowing mind, the stream can be changed by the smallest rock. its always the little details that show a little more of myself to me. and the tests just make it confusing, but very intriguing.  

That being said, i am probably an isfp or an infj, i have to dive into the functions, thank you for your adviceKate bush is an isfp that basically destroys all negative isfp stereotypes That sucks. And yeah i feel like theres alot of people that are masking themselves involuntarily. Ive seen this too. seems like they would rather observe and when they sense their label i see them pop up like meerkats its funny. 

But the thing is their label is rarely called which isnt cool cause id like to learn more about them. Literally all my gods are isfpsI feel you, this stuff is very confusing but its very interesting how this guy taught us how to pick apart brains and reassemble them into 4 letters. i am a IxFx and my favorite humans are hayao miyazaki, frank ocean, jimi hendrix, kate bush, picasso, john steinbeck and andrei tarkovsky, they are on mt olympus, my gods. They continue to teach me I look like im lost when im walking. Like i teleported from another planet and im in awe of all the human stuff. I always get smiled at. 

Ive sortve given up on typing so lets just say i am ixfxIm very pessimistic about the earth and i always get sad when i hear about whats going on. it really fuckin hurts man. I like the freedom youve given us. 

i would want to live in a ghibli film, something like howls cottage. A huge meadow i can explore. And a small little house on a cliff next to the ocean. The house will only have a room or 2, but open a hatch or something and be in awe of the underground house, way bigger than the cottage. id have a huge glass window made inside the cliff, so i can have a view of the ocean while im sitting in the living room. 

That or a whole island. And i can have an expansive treehouse using a quarter of the rainforest next to the beach. Id be a tropical ewok

I think i am an infp or an infj or an isfp dont know Lee's whole tangent on the meaning and significance of the hebrew word "timshel". In east of eden, the book

i sorta mold my perceptions around everything taught in that book. it really has some good messages and really complex characters to examine1) telekinesis

2) i wouldnt have a super name 

3) 5, id do some illegal stuff, but im not gonna hurt anybody or anything

4) 7, id use the power for my own gain but if i can sneak someone some help without a chance of being caught then id do that. 

5) 8, id be super private about my power, only letting people i truly trust know about them 

6) no i wouldnt have a costumeWhat type is BIOASWow ok. Thank you Texting is really really useful for me, as i rather not talk over the phone, the only words im able to say on the phone are "yeah" "that ___" ex: thats cool, that sucks etc. 

When i text, i can collect my thoughts and have a decent convo. I wouldnt call myself an overbearingly nice person and i dont like rainbows or bright colors. Im not emobright colors look beautiful on canvas. Im just saying that im not over here like peter piper conjuring animals and butterflies to listen to my serenadesi dont understand how people do this. Even my favorite songs are only played once and maybe twice if im really feeling it. I always gotta keep going to "chase the dragon" trying to find new favorites. I get you but i usually let the track digest first and go back to it later instead of putting the replay button on and listening to it 20 times in a row. I listen to music 24/7 as well but i only have a select few all time favorites that i go back to every once in a while when i dont feel like searching for new music. 80 percent of the time im on RYM trying to find another all time favorite, so much music out thereI have a desire to listen to my favs over and over but not literallyive been described as in the middle, but more on the introverted side. 

I dont know if ambiversion is possible though, introversion doesnt mean shyI only like instrumental music while doing homework. burial and aphex twin put me on autopilotinfp. I quite literally lose everything. Or forget stuff, even my wallet and phone. If i find something, something else is lost. And if i remember to bring something, i forget to bring something else. im in my head alot tbh. whats happening. Do you guys find them not interesting or what. Ive seen exactly 1 thread on them from the time ive been lurking this subreddit. 


I love how you're trying to turn this into something nice.&gt; This (actually much of your "strengths" section most likely, except maybe that last bullet) would be magnificent "Fi" IMO - but it seems to me to be more of a Fe + Ni overlay on Fi than Fi itself.

OK, that's really interesting. But what would mature Fi insight and tolerance look like? I'm a Fi user myself but I don't know much about the functions yet.
i've only dated two people, an estp and an entp.
the estp relationship lasted a long time, it was, however, remarkably turbulent. i wasn't really the sort to keep up with the kind of SE, the partying - the drinking - the money spending - so much! but i think this was mostly down to the person as a whole, rather than the type. he seemed to be rather unhealthy, unfortunately. 

i am now with an entp and this is, by far and away, the most fulfilling relationship i have ever had with another person, in any way that relationship means. we bounce off each other a lot and are able to keep up with one another, mentally. i would start wars for this guy, really.

as for non-romantic, my longest lasting friendships are with an isfj, a really nice person - very funny dude. my only thing that i could say with him is that i find his willingness to be left in nostalgia land conflicts with me but we otherwise get along really well. he often looks to me to help him, of which i am more than happy to explain through the layers of issues.
i have an intp friend but lately we have drifted a lot, separate ways, etc. 
finally, my isfp sister and myself work really well together. we have a lot of the same outlooks and ideals in life, we just go about them differently. it all works out. :)

I hated K-12, I felt confined and forced to learn what I didn't want to. Plus the social aspect felt extremely forced as well, I never really fitted in. But college is a completely different beast, I am excelling and loving every minute of it.
Probably ENFJ, they pick up on my subtle humour and find it hilarious and on my end I love receiving their attention.  
I've been seeing an ESFP and we also banter with each other in a very amusing way. Although when they first met me they took me too seriously and probably thought I was crazy. 

I am apparently closest to INFP. Very true, I think the reason I admire her so much is because she has a lot of the traits I wish I had.  

I like INTPs, but I am too much of an F to be one :) Thanks for your help! I'll look for your thread.I would like to see questions that ask more about your rationale behind decisions such as to more easily differentiate between Fi and Fe. As a probably-INFP who is very organized/punctual/not super spontaneous, I almost always get INFJ when I take the MBTI tests, even the official one. 

Edit: Or specific examples. Like "in this scenario, would you more likely do A or B and why?"Probably-INFP:  
When I first started playing sports as a kid I think everyone perceived me as this sensitive, unaggressive kid so I kind of hung back all the time and lived up to that image. I've always been a super fast runner though, and when I went to some sports camps and developed some confidence I became the most offensive player on my soccer team. I think everyone was pretty shocked at my turnaround.  

I never really cared that much about winning or losing. I always thought people who cared a lot about winning had strange priorities. I remember some girls getting really angry/sad when we lost a game, and I was quietly laughing.Extremely quiet and shy, always had the best grades in the class, hated the loud obnoxious kids, always had about 1 or 2 "best friends" that I attached myself to just because I didn't want to be perceived as socially retarded, skipped school constantly so that I could study at home/the library. Used reading for escapism my entire life.  
I barely showed up in grade 12 because I had already secured a spot in university. Started smoking tons of weed and became quite irresponsible when I was 17.   
- INFPI see INF_. You certainly seem intuitive over sensing in my opinion, and give off a stronger F than T vibe. As someone who recently spent a long debating over INFP vs. INFJ, I suggest reading about the differences between Fe and Fi. Also, comparing the descriptions in the right sidebar helped me quite a bit as well. I could be totally off by assuming you are I over E, though. I wasn't able to tell very well from your answers. Being "hard to read" and being more a of a listener is what influenced me into thinking you are an introvert but of course an extrovert could have those traits as well. Yes like that! Although in the end that still confused me. It was kind of like "if you responded this way, you are using Fe - unless you are just being influenced by your Fi!" haha My instinctive guess is ISTJ. I'm not an expert typer or anything, but that's the vibe I got. Some of my rationale:   

- you seem introverted, that is pretty clear  
- afraid of breaking rules  
- preference for work that involves a lot of logical thinking and problem solving  
- "I would be very excited in this situation, as it is very rare to work in a group where everyone makes valuable contributions and puts in their fair share of work." A lot of your statements make you seem responsible

Course I could be way off, just going by the information you provided. Okay good to know. Although you might want to reword this, then
&gt;  Despite the fact that I would probably not get caught, I would still be afraid that I may get caught 

My sister is an ISFJ and up to about a year ago I would say that your description did not sound like her. Or that she thought these things deep down but would never express them because she wants to fit in and get along. She has really changed recently though, especially along the lines of that third paragraph of yours. She is really trying to get me to read "Gifts of Imperfection" which I guess has resonated her with her a lot. She also has been watching a lot of Brene Brown videos.  

I hate saying this but I used to find her very naive/too worried about what others think of her. But she has changed a lot and become much more open-minded in her later twenties. I'd still type her ISFJ but I get moments when I feel a lot of 'N' shining through.&gt; This girl is fucking goddamn gorgeous

Nah that's INFPIt's all about the functions. Fi dom, aux Ne = very good looking Lorelai seems ESFP to me. Quite bold and theatrical, mentions that she was kind of a party girl when she was younger. She gives off a more dramatic, somewhat dependent-on-others-for-validation vs. the "free-spiritedness" I see in ENFPs. Both have Fi as their aux function, so it makes sense that she could be seen as both.

And Rory = ISFJ, I think. I always thought she was goody two-shoes. 

Granted, I stopped watching the show halfway through the second season because it started to get on my nerves. damn do this many people actually think I'm serious? I thought this entire thread was trolling haha now I'm not so sure. I honestly loled when I read the OP. I'm just guessing but I think she may be especially turned off by someone who goes by the alias 'GodEmpororDonald'?That's actually exactly the reason I stopped watching it. It wasn't that I hated the storyline but that the conversation was too over-focused on being witty that it didn't feel relatable. This guy is making multiple posts like this under different usernames. Like https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4s1w4u/does_this_seem_like_an_infj_girl/
^^ asking us to type a girl he's never even talked toI think you could still both very likely be INFP. Personally I've exhibited a lot of the behaviours that both of you do in your "differences". And of course, when comparing two people even of the same type there will always be differences.  
Buuut if one of you were to be of a different type, I would guess ISFP or ENFP (probably her). Your similarities seem to be based on both being FP. Do you prefer a learning style that takes the "hands-on" approach or would you rather learn by thinking a problem through?  

Do you prefer hobbies that are more physical (crafting/art, sports, gardening),  or hobbies like writing, reading, philosophizing?  

When daydreaming, are you more so lost in your head thinking about fantasies or the future, or would you consider yourself more present and thinking about what is going on around you?Have you seen [this thread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4s08bz/types_at_their_worst/). I used to do the 'burning bridges' thing a lot and usually would weirdly enjoy it, but my reasoning behind it was different than yours. Yours sounded ENXPI become extremely impulsive, engage in a lot of risky behaviour and make a lot of bad decisions. Which you think would mean that I avoid drinking, but nope. Well I'm constantly trying to quit but old habits die hard I guess. It also turns me into a total moron, and I get like 5-day "emotional hangovers" where I'm super depressed and anxious.  

In contrast, I'm pretty awesome when I smoke weed.Yeah and you can't just snap out of it unfortunately. When I finally start feeling normal again I'm like "woah..I was being ridiculous.." but in the moment it feels like I'm gonna be stuck feeling sad forever.Alcohol makes people weird. Maybe it especially affects INFPs because we're sensitive, but you can't attribute weird behaviour when we're under the influence to our real personality. Personally I have an awful drunk alter ego that isn't even remotely like sober me.   

If you're having problems with your dad, talk to him about all of this when he's 100% sober. You can't rationalize with drunk people...especially if they are in an irritable mood.  Who knows how much he really drank, some people sneak drinks when no one's looking. Yes. A recurring theme in my life is to get a new job, get really excited about working in a new environment and getting to learn new things, mastering said job very quickly, and then getting bored as hell and hating it. Especially if it's a full-time job. One strategy I have for dealing with this is having two very different part-time jobs, and having other stuff on the side like volunteering and hobbies. Still, though, I dream of working for myself.I know this is random and weird, but I'm going to go ahead and ask anyway.

I've seen descriptions of INTJs and INFJs (i.e. types with inferior Se) as feeling like they are "space aliens" because of inferior Se. I'm pretty sure I'm INFP, and I live in a constant state of feeling like I'm living in some sort of dream or computer simulation. I find it hard to take reality too seriously because it often doesn't feel real to me. 

Is this attributed to an absolute lack of Se, or is this an inferior Se characteristic? Or none of the above and I'm just crazy.
It is, but rejecting my language barrier, chaotic flow was on purpous INFP (male) - the worst.
I love ENTJ's! The way he approaches depressing topics though really strikes me with an INFP vibe. He's very adamant about his faith, and tends to have the 'vibe' of an INFP writer on his blog, using heavy allusions, metaphors and stuff like that. It got me right, wow. Figures, as I have that 'dreamy' INFP writing style.INFP's are the most easygoing, caring, moral creatures concerned with helping others through creativity and emotion at their best, and the most cold, hurt, self-loathing people, that tend to lash out and make stupid decisions at their worst. Here's an example of his writing, and though I'm not a typology expert, the mood and elegance strike me with a familiar INFP conundrum.. 

"Sometimes I’m asked why the music I create tends to sound like it does – why the optimistic flavor? Is that because you’re an excessively happy person? Do you ever have bad days? It’s an innocent question and I enjoy answering it because music has always been my way of “dealing with life” by way of escapism. Rather than create art that mirrors the inevitable dark days I’m plagued with just like everyone, I prefer to let my daydreams carry me away into places where one can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone, in a way that only the mind can allow. And rather than express whatever angst and malaise that gets dealt my way by writing profane songs littered with curse words or crude allegories or sexual vulgarities, I’d rather spend my time imagining how immensely BEAUTIFUL this life has the perfect potential of being. Of course, each artist to his or her own, but somehow “portraying true, gritty hard reality” tends to make me sick, whatever the medium of art. I can’t even watch an R-rated movie without feeling violated and totally nasty.

Regardless of circumstance, attempting to usurp the emerging enmity between yourself and the past is like trying to fight an endless army of vampires back up the attic stairs, armed only with a rolled up newspaper. Little can be done to avoid such sudden “attacks” if you can call them that, and what exactly are you supposed to do when they occur? Let them dishearten and harrow you until they’ve lost their perceived potency and you feel yourself caught in a slow death grind where compromise is inevitable? Do you battle the onrush back long enough to slam the attic door and lock it down with the biggest padlock you can find? And then what? How do you get rid of the key? Do you hide it in the bottom drawer you never use? Do you bury it in the garden under the lilacs? It’s only a matter of time until they break down the attic door, in which case it means you either run… or wait for them.

Memories are tough things to consciously ignore, especially the sad variety. They’re difficult to predict, hard to forecast, and once the downpour begins, it’s impossible to stay dry. Angry clouds jam together in the overcast like newly felled timber logs floating downriver, headed for a network of rapids, spillways, waterfalls, and ultimately the saw.

This is a depressing way to end a blog entry, especially for someone who just told you he prefers to skip the depressing junk. Cloudy days are terribly unavoidable and thus, I keep a line of text printed on the front of my mind to keep myself remembering why I continually strive to gaze past the thunderheads and on into a world beyond reality."

It's just so melancholy and almost 'detached' in a way... and he refers to the 'world inside his head,' something that INFP's usually have... I'm just not sure.INFP's walking into stuff while being lost in their thoughts and their social mimicry.As an INFP, I tend to listen to music to experience emotions or fuel my creativity and art. I love synths and airy instrumentation and tone, and tend to be most inspired by electronic and instrumental/orchestral music. I listen to a fair bit of rock, but usually only conceptual and indie stuff. I also listen to a fair bit of indie pop.  I love the feeling you get when that 'perfect' tone on an instrument or piano is achieved, and you just FEEL it. The stuff I listen to also help me dream up stories, and pictures in my head, which then pour into my art. Unhealthy ESTP's for sure. They just don't mix with my INFP mindset, and usually are too daring and hardheaded, without care for any reason but themselves. Ultra rigid, and inflexible, unless it's an action to please them. 

A truly angry unhealthy INFP is also a force to be reckoned with, using logic and emotion in a terrifying way with Te. They think in such a self-centered way, even being obviously wrong.  (An unhealthy, angry INFP reminds me a lot of the mindset of a self-righteous SJW). Regular INFP anger can be used in a very protective, guarding way, but unhealthy ones are insane...It's true. I worked with a very unhealthy ESFJ for a while. Never again do I ever want to experience that. INTP, I'd recon first. Probably ISTP and INFP next.SJ's first, maybe Fi users second. We are an enigma to ourselves sometimes... We have our internal values, but our eIntuitive side can see so many other perspectives in such a personal way. We tend to find our personality in usually odd and unconventional forms of art, lifestyle, work, ect. too.

We also can seem to be detached or mad, while honestly being the most caring and loving people inside. We just have that 'look'. On, usually instrumental or experimental stuff. ISFP, or maybe an ISFJ. I could definitely see both. Another INFP here, and I'm sorry.

We tend to do that, and it honestly feel that it could be out of fear or depression. I know for me, when I'm depressed, I may still care deeply about people, but I want to be alone because I'm scared I'm going to hurt or drive away the other people. 

It's what others have said- self preservation.

Please, ask us what's wrong, but don't try to offer solutions. Just listen. If we need to be alone, we don't want others intruding on that. We need to know people care for us, but not necessarily in the 'usual' ways.  Just knowing someone still cares for our feelings, even if we don't know how to process them ourselves is important. 1. Originally for a business class at school, later confirmed looking at cognitive functions. 

2. I don't type too many people outside of my friend group, usually I can pretty easily piece it together if I've known them long enough, or just flat-out ask them. 

3. I just love finding out about myself and others, and MBTI is a very cool system, that allows for a lot of room to better develop my weaknesses.

4. 4w5

5. Nope, every test I've taken over the past 3 years has typed me INFP.

6. I use Fi heavily most of the time, have a firm set of values (I'm a Christian, and a lot of my morals develop from that), but stay very true to who I am, finding unique ways to express myself in art and music. I also hate conflict, much like the stereotypical INFP, as it makes me anxious and depressed afterwards. I'm also terribly prone to mood swings and social anxieties. 

Anyone who knows me knows I use Ne in a very outright way. I'm super big-picture, and want to really and truly do something to change the world. I'm not a great planner, but when I see an opportunity, I will try my best to spring on it. 

I'm constantly pretty out-there, and always thinking about things, which is where Se comes in. Combined with Fi, I can come up with some really outlandish emotional situations mentally, and am really good at 'disengaging' from the world when I work on art or listen to music. I just kind of live in my own little world sometimes. 

I haven't really picked up on my Te much, outside of being extremely angry about stuff. I can be very sharp when I'm mad, and don't hesitate to logically take people down. Thankfully, I don't really get angry often. 


Never had suicidal thoughts or tendencies, though I have depression.INFP: A sense of belonging.I've heard similar things about INFP eyes. I don't know if there is any validity to it, but I think we all have a certain vulnerable look we can put on around people we trust. I don't know if it's possible, but I do have a high sense of empathy. Not in an unnatural way, but I'm just really good at reading people. Having an emotional connection to people is important to me, as if I kind of know how they are feeling, I can help them. Nothing crazy, but definitely deeper than I think a lot of people feel.Frodo Baggins, Gollum, Kylo Ren, Lucy from Narnia, Asriel (Undertale), Peter Parker, Remus Lupin, Luke Skywalker, Zuko (AtLA), Lapis Lazuli (SU). Just a few of my favorite INFP heroes/villians. There are a few more, just Google them. I agree, everyone I put on the list was someone that I can vouch INFP characteristics in. 

INTJ's and INFJ's like to claim some of these characters, but based on what I know, these are definitely INFP.

Because we only see the 'outside' mindset of characters, it is harder to type them, for sure.INFP, I find strength in perceived weakness. Maybe being quiet, deep, feeling, nice, and laid-back isn't the 'ideal' way to be, but culture is so messed up anyway, I'd rather just be myself and be friends with like-minded people.Though all of my deep and close friends are introverted, I enjoy when talkative people lead conversation. ISFP's and ISFJ's mistyping as INFP and INFJ's.Not voting. I hate both. As a Christian, I cannot comprehend how anyone that shares my faith could vote for Trump as many will. I definitely don't trust Hillary, and hate her pretty extreme pro-choice views. Neither candidate seems caring, moral, or dignified enough for my vote. INFP with inattentive ADHD. I misplace EVERYTHING.Trump doesn't share my faith. He says he does, but doesn't really uphold any of the values I read Jesus taught about loving your enemies, being charitable to others, and becoming a humble servant to people. Words=/=Actions.Regardless of if it is or not, he's dangerous and unstable. He flip-flops and lies about what he believes, and is a scary individual. I don't want him as my president.Samwise Gamgee, Leafool (from Warriors), and Faolan from the Ga'hoole universe. Isn't a lot of psychology and sociology that way?Right now, I'm pretty captivated my my group of 3 close friends. I've known them for a long time, but they are all beautiful amazing people. Just little things they do are so nice, and *human*. I can't describe it. Beautiful.ISFP and INTP. Both lovely types, inside and out.INFP and ISFP
ENTJ and ESTJ.
INFP- I freakin' love Saturn. It's beautiful, and the rings make it so unique!This is an INFP answer if I've ever heard one! I most fully relate!Definitely YouTube or Instagram.(INFP asking) Pretty self explanatory, I just want to find out a little bit more about how my type makes friends, and stays in those relationships. His work strikes me with that 'dreamy, quiet' stereotype, but I honestly have no clue..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQmXgjod8B0I might answer some, might not. Depends on how I feel on such topic.
Your average shy, kinda quirky (Oh God lol) kid who got along well with everyone for the most part and had a "group" of friends that I belonged to, but I was really attached to the hip with one best friend. Bonded with the rest of the group through one-to-one conversations. 

More quiet and somewhat detached; I was out of the loop with most drama and was informed of such going ons by my friend. Mostly stuck to my own interests, wrote a LOT of little snippets of stories, personal musings (fairly angsty ones), doodled a lot and filled my sketchbook. Everyone thought I was cute and "innocent". Didn't really get into any problems with anyone, but never really got too close either, except the one best friend. Still, I was definitely part of the group. I had considerable anxiety, especially social.

University is a completely different story lolOh is my flair not showing? Yep, predictable infp hahaWell there've been lots of personal changes since I entered college, to the point where I've actually begun to question my enneagram and even MBTI type. Like am I really a 4 or am I a 9? 6 perhaps? 7? Maybe I'm actually an extrovert? 

Many things are the same but I've been noticeably less angsty, my friends tell me I seem really "chill", to the point where they think I must have a secret stash hidden away lol. Thankfully a lot of my social anxiety has also faded and I'm able to be more outgoing and open about myself with others. I've also started caring more about other people and how to act in social situations, whereas before that stuff really flew over my head and I might have even looked down on that sort of "Fe-ish behavior" OTL cringey lol

To be honest it's kind of hard to tell if these are actual ~*~*personality changes~*~* or if it's simply due to the fact that I'm living away from home now, I'm older and no longer a wangsty teen, and my familial problems have really toned down (or at least, I'm not around to deal with them). Like maybe your "true" type really manifests later on. idk there's just a lot of navel-gazing lately

Yeah but anyway that got kind of long haha, thanks for asking! :)This was kind of creepily accurate for me, from the wanting to bulk up, dressing properly for the occasion, wanting to know what's up with the cool kids. The bodily hyperawareness to the point of paranoia has really been taking hold lately.Is it a loop? I thought a Fi-Si loop was more about being stuck in/wallowing in the past rather than being hyperaware of your physical state. Uhh lolFather: ESTJ

Mother: ESFJ

Me: INFP

Sister: INTP on a test, not entirely sure 

Older brother: Doesn't live with us and I've hardly had any proper interaction with him, but if I had to go for a wild guess I'd choose ISTPCryaotic is a very obvious INFP. I think he even took a test.You don't necessarily have to like a function for it to be mature. Fi would be your PoLR, so that would make sense. Weird, I'm an INFP and I reading this doesn't incite any rage in me, more like  "¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lmao yeah k"

Then again I bet if it was actually said to me irl or in a more expanded manner it'd probably get under my skinisn't "less dumber" redundant My parents are ESFJ and ESTJ and their relationship is incredibly toxic and abusive. Sometimes they seem to get along, and I'm sure other circumstances have their part, but often they do NOT mesh well together. 

Also I'm totally aware that it's hard to type your parents with a clear mind. I'm pretty sure of their types, though. I had them typed as ISFP and INTP for a while before I learned more about MBTI and functions and all and now I'm like LOL how did I ever think they were anything else? They're almost stereotypical, and I don't mean "oh god my mom made me clean my room what a sensor"&gt;Let’s say you hear about an immediate need for care and food for orphans in some third world country.

&gt;This conversation happens:

&gt;ESFJ: “We should do something about it. Reach out. Send them food. Blankets. Whatever they need.”

&gt;ENFJ: “I agree, but we need to do more than feed and tend to their bodies. And … I’m a little worried about what this means for their future interactions with us as a nation.”

&gt;ESFJ: “What do you mean?”

&gt;ENFJ: “If we go in there now and offer aid and support, we solve the immediate problem but in twenty years, how will they see us? As their rescuers or a conquering nation that got a foot in the door through charitable work?”

&gt;ESFJ: “What?”

&gt;ENFJ: “Right now, they might thank us for our help. In the future, they might see us as ‘interfering.’ I mean, think about how WE look on the actions of those who have come before us … how archaic we see their thinking as being, how racially driven, how backward. Is that how we want future generations in this country to see us?”

&gt;ESFJ: “Who cares? They need aid now, and we should send it now. Let the future worry about itself.”

&gt;This conversation sounds a bit absurd — but it isn’t. It’s how the two types think. I’ve watched debates unfold along these lines among SFJ/NFJs.

&gt;Si/Ne cares about offering aid in the present now, because now is where the need is, and if we have resources to do something about it, we should do it. The details are what it focuses on. 

&gt;Ni/Se is about looking into the distant future and seeing the fall out. It’s about the big picture. If we offer this nation aid, how will it reflect globally? Now and in the future? Will we get sucked into taking over this country for humanitarian purposes, and be seen later as an oppressive invading government who has no business being in this country?

&gt;One type focuses on immediate needs, one type looks far into the future. One type dwells in the present, the other in the future. One type is centered on active participation in events unfolding around them (the sensor … hands on), the other is more idealistic and in pursuit of grand visions / ideals (the intuitive … intrigued by ideas and concepts more than physical participation). 

&gt;Put simply, SFJs are more grounded, NFJs are more forward-thinking.

**Watching Youtube**: The Flintstones were named after actual flint stones... I haven't seen that show in ages. How old. One day our kids will make fun of us for not having the foresight to realize how uncool our current media is in comparison to that of the yet unhappened future. Scary.

**Waiting in line at the store**: Why do people instinctively make lines at the grocery store anyway? Or is it instinctual? Is it hard wired in us to line up? Well obviously it could be, it's not that hard. Or is it? Are our expectations as humans just too high? Are we more advanced than we think? 

**Going to sleep at 4 am**: A friend is getting married and I should be happy for them but I can't be. Why? Am I jealous? Love isn't real. It's a neurochemical con job. Is there such a thing as selfless love? Is that possible? We are born alone and we die alone. No matter how close we think we are to people, we're not. None of this is real. Nothing matters, which is great but all of our grand epiphanies and navelgazing are distractions in our tiny, tiny lives. We are so tiny. Planets are so big. Why are they so big? Did I do that one embarrassing thing or did I dream it. Am I really a core 4? Maybe a core 6? Why is it so important? Let me think about my earliest memories. 

**During my professional exam**: yehet

Edit: i was supposed to sleep 5 hours ago why is the sun upFunny, in my experience I've experienced frustration with my INFJ friend NOT being straightforward enough or assuming things on her own. I've had to reassure her many times that I appreciate it when she's blunt, that hints aren't enough sometimes, etc. And she knows that but still hesitates a lot. She has this problem with others as well. Okay?My best friend is an INFJ and I've known her for seven years now. I understand being patient with her and letting her take her time when it comes to sharing things, but sometimes there's absolutely no payoff. When I speak with her it often feels like I'm being questioned, like our conversations aren't really a two-way street. I can tell she's thinking about them but if it's not taking a loooong time, sometimes a reply doesn't come across at all. 

I understand that you can't expect someone to be (as) open just because you are, but the lack of reciprocation can sometimes feel very unsettling and I end up feeling way too vulnerable. It was never that big of a deal before but now that our friendship has gone long-distance, it's definitely more noticeable. Yeah that's what I thought too. If anything Fi and Ti can both come down with a case of "snowflake syndrome" lolThey used females and men in the same sentence too lmaoEd from FMA comes across as more of an ESTP if you ask meINFP here and same. For long educational lectures I might speed it up to ~1.25x, but I like to watch most things at the pace that the creator intended them to be at. The delivery is just as important as the content to me. Reverse this and you have the female experience on redditNot enough love for the ST ladies out there. I've known at least one female ISTJ, and my best friend is an ESTJ. We get along like peas in a pod. :)I'm pretty sure they shopped the cat face onto a guinea pig. As for why it's wrapped in tin foil with butter on top... Why not?Personal anecdote: I'm close to an ESTJ and she's one of the kindest, most supportive people I know. A human pick-me-up. Even when she gives criticism or feedback, it's straightforward and she doesn't beat around the bush, but you never get the impression that she's sugar-coating anything around you either. It's usually very well received. 

What I'm trying to say is it's probably not an ExTx thing but a personal thing.A hard truth will always sting to some degree, but it doesn't have to hurt as much as some people seem to think it does. There are some real weirdos who use that as an excuse to almost relish in being "brutally honest", emphasis on brutal. 

Oddly enough I've only ever seen this applied to negative/hurtful truths, never something like aggressive praise.Well OP did askMy best friend and roommate is an ESTJ and we get along like two peas in a pod :)I think they're being sarcastic lolI fell asleep halfway through reading this someone give me the summaryI feel you on that big time lol But I don't think knowing how to socialize with people necessitates throwing yourself into local politics or anything, just as far as you want it to go :) Having the skill to do so if you want is more than enough.I could be wrong but I'm not sure OP made this, I saw a huge batch of these on tumblr a few years ago.Straight outta LotR or something/r/shitty~~mbti~~takes is that way friendfinal boss: the I/E/N/S/F/T/P/Jat least I can be privileged somewhere then lolYeah a couple years ago as a teen I would've thought "oh how cool! &lt;3 hehe" but I feel like my third eye just opened properly for the first time because this post and the comments are making me feel genuinely......sad tbhOkay INFP has got me cracking up for the last 15 minutes how dare youbruh why do I feel like even in sensor master race au estjs still got shafted lmaoI saw this while sitting by the window while it rained, thinking it was about time for a reread...

ಠ_ಠSame here, my INTP sister is my ESFJ mom's favorite. My ESTJ dad has a soft spot for me.I love ENTPs in fiction and IRL but a recent breaking off with a close friend kind of (irrationally sorry) soured my perception of them for the time being. 

I still like lots of things about her and we were amazing when we kept at an arm's length, we really got each other. But it was like we were hedgehogs. The closer we got, we just kept unintentionally hurting and/or misunderstanding each other, and what we at first found charming just became irritating.  

I know you can't lump people together; she's one individual person and what drove us apart didn't exclusively boil down to her being an ENTP or me an INFP lmao I'm still just sour I guess. There's definitely a lot to love about ENTPs but you can't please everyone, and that applies to every type. 

/end diary entrySeriously, my best friend is a human ball of sunshine and my enthusiastic emotionally intelligent personal cheerleader. You'd never think she was an ESTJ based on all the stereotypes.Well considering that we're both sadly heterosexual not really lol But I get what you mean, a lot of them give off that "oh god please step on me" vibe. 

Also I've heard good things about The Sopranos, I'll have to add it to my watchlist.Well I just finished watching Sharp Objects, starring Amy Adams and based on the novel by Gillian Flynn. Honestly it shot straight straight to my top 5, check it out if you're into slow burning Southern Gothic psychological thrillers with amazingly chosen soundtracks. 

Seriously, it's really good! Great mood and sweltering atmosphere. ~~And stay away from spoilers for the love of god if you choose to watch it~~My dad is an ESTJ and although it feels like we're the only ones in the family who "get" each other, we have an extremely troubled relationship. 

On the other hand, my best friend is also an ESTJ and she's the complete opposite of all the stereotypes. She's incredibly fun and a social butterfly, she makes friends wherever she goes. Like the human version of a golden retriever. She's really intuitive and picks up on things quickly, making her my favorite movie watching partner. She's incredibly sensitive and emotionally intelligent, like your own personal cheerleader. She's a natural leader and not afraid to get her hands dirty in doing whatever it takes to get whatever needs to be done done. Whether you need a shoulder to cry on or someone to help figure out a solution to a problem with, she's got you covered. 

I lost my point but anyway ESTJs I love and respect you keep on rocking and doing your thingI've had multiple professors stop their lectures and ask me in front of everyone why I'm so sad :( Like dude, what do you want me to say. I've got resting sad face.Did you date barney stinsonAnd my axe!I am no man!
I'm getting a Se vibe from you too. You seem way too chill to be an xNFP :)
&gt; It is in fact their very Fi that lets them recognize moral inconsistency, blow it up, point at it, and delegitimize it.

Yep, I can totally relate to that except I use a lot of restrain as an introvert. When I get in the Te grip, it's often something I regret too...Yeah, there's a non-zero chance that I'm just retarded like they say...

But, on the other hand, I've been studying cognitive functions and types for a while now and I remain convinced of its validity.

The most convincing aspect of it is that it's even more powerful the closer you are to someone else. For example, I find it fascinating how much I can see dom-Si and aux-Fe in action in my 10-year gf, and how she understands herself in the theory also.

Yet, I have no idea how I or anyone could prove mbti empirically.True. Enneagram 4 are not that rare for INFJs, rarer than for INFPs but still.The "polite" part is not in Jung text regarding Ti. I think in this case the original text is more applicable to ISTPs:

&gt;Courtesy, amiability, and friendliness may be present, but often with a particular quality suggesting a certain uneasiness, which betrays an ulterior aim, namely, the disarming of an opponent, who must at all costs be pacified and set at ease lest he prove a disturbing-element.To me, Jung's description of Fi as primordial feeling images remains the best description, over the socionics definition. And the "still waters run deep" is a very apt metaphor of the concealed nature of Fi.How stupid it is for that person to attack his own shadow. Has he any better insight to how one should use Se-Fi? I don't think so. Arrogance and rigidity is not the way that's for sure, but in the end it's his own problemSure, let's suppose a complex with extroversion, sensation and feeling. We're left to wonder if he has any convincing replacement to either ESFPs excitement, experiences and lust (in the usual Type 7) or ESFJs gift to others and friendliness (type 2). His rectitude and supposed intelligence, neither of which will help him that much there.ENTPs have Ti which is classifying. They like to explore ideas with an analytical detachment. if you know ENTPs you'll notice how they always present different perspectives on a topic and without discussing about which side they're on. They come off as surprisingly very knowledgable and ressourceful, they always seem to have an interesting observation to say on any subject. Their tertiary Fe is pretty strong and makes them quite likeable and interested in other people.

ENFPs are less about systemizing and more about championing ideas. Fi is more interpretative than Ti,  so they wear ideas and novelty without really being able to trace why or how. Well they think a lot, but they can't trace the structure of their thoughts. They are noticeably less guarded than INFPs, they have an easier time showing their goofy side or being outspoken. Their tertiary Te can make them a bit like a chameleon around people, they can almost look like some ESTJ if they want.If I have a lot of attention on me, I'll be very concise but I guess this is more about Fi and being avoidant.

Otherwise, sometimes. Ne is like looking into a broken mirror. I just don't see or think of ONE thing it's more a multitude of things. So I can definitely get lost in there just pointing one observation after another. Mostly accurate but it's clearly a socionics description. One comment: socionics defines Fi as mostly focused towards people/relationships while, in reality, Fi is an introspective function about inner harmony in its integrity. This can be correlated with maintaining an harmonious atmosphere but not at all times because the two can be contradictory in certain situations.Just wanted to say I'M always happy to see xSTJs in the community . As an INFP I always have a lot to learn from them. This description is great and I would love to read how it FEELS to experience Te as a dominant function.To give you an example. An IxFP might decide to act with loyalty, when in reality what's going on is that he's avoiding being assertive (inf Te) and mistakens it for loyalty. Deep down he may realize that he's not acting out of morality but out of weakness. He just can't act on a fact when he sees one.That's interesting. It's as if, for Fe, feelings from within and without kind of blur together. 

Do you think that you can read other people's feelings easily, or your sensitivity gets in the way?
That’s both awesome and scary! I try to hide my feelings but lately they’ve been overwhelming. She probably knows I’m in love... Anyway, thanks for helping me understandSufjan StevensLaszlo looks so INTJ to me. Then again I don't know any real life INTJ but he's really single-minded and just looks like an arechetypal INTJ to me.

John I would totally type as ISFP.Sarah well since she's played by Dakota Fanning I can't help but see ENFJ !INFP. Can't speak for all of us but I'm really drawn towards ESFJs...

1- There's the semi-duality of sharing the same functions as Aux/Tertiary functions. For me it's really easy to notice the tertiary Ne in an ESFJ and communication comes easy.

2- Same preference for dominant feeling but in opposite orientation which is quite attractive (for mysterious reasons).Yeah I understand, I don't think I know any ESFJ males. For me, as a guy, there are plenty of ESFJ girls but I tend to obsess with one person for months even when she's already in a relationship (they say love doesn't think). Anyway, hope you can find one.Honestly I don't remember ever *wanting* to be special or to be viewed as such. That's not how it works. It's really something like Ti does, where you think (yes, Fi formulate thoughts in its head!) So you think a lot for yourself and you develop your preferences over time and BAM! some day you don't quite fit with the outside world because you didn't spend that much time adjusting to it!I like to keep things clean and in order, but unlike an ISTJ who's always on the lookout for problems, I usually let the problems come at me and then I'm like "Oh shit I need to do this". At work I'm productive of course but outside, I don't have a lot of energy to engage my Te.

The goals of an INFP will probably be different from things usually seen as successful.  For me I had my mindset on ending a relationship since I had become unhappy. Being not very assertive, it's a been a challenge to communicate and to organize my life after that. I would say to you being very goal-oriented in general, I would explore being a xxTJ.

Tertiary Si in everyday life is a rootedness in the "treasures" of my inner world, like the music I love, the places I like to be, and other pleasures. INFPs have tertiary Si so it's definitely there.

I have learned to embrace Fi because it has grown with me. I can't ignore it, I can't not be myself. People might see me as sensitive but I just go with it. I make decisions based on feeling and go with it, the reasons don't have to be intelligible to other people.I don't really have an "urgency" mode. There's a joke that if an INFP house burns down he'll just fastwalk outside.

Also, if there are display of high Se like someone yelling at me I just shut off.. the feeling doesn't even kicks in yet, I just feel numb.

Most senses are ok not great. A bit out of touch with realityI love ENFJs but ESFJ is a better match imo. As if I needed more intuition in my life I’m already way too much in my headESFJs are not rare but they are such a diverse personality type. Their mbti descriptions/stereotypes would need to be re-written. Traditional, people-pleasers? It applies to a few but far from all I've met.

If I had to narrow it down, of course their "warmth" is this mysterious aura that they all exhibit. Also, Their Fe-Ne combo gives them an incredible gift at reading between the lines empathically. I can spend hours and hours with an ESFJ without feeling invalidated or misunderstood.Fi is like listening to your inner voice, and if you tune into that voice and you trust that it knows how to diffentiate contentment from discontentment even though it can be capricious. Contentment is synonym with inner harmony.

But it's not like the outside world is independent from Fi, it influences it.

As for Fe... you'd be better than me at explaining it :)INFP Crushes on ESFJsI would have said ESFJ but I'm late to the party. You are awesome don't think otherwise!Both Fe and Fi are described as "sensitive". For example, if you go on TypeCoach, both INFPs and ESFJs are described primarly as sensitive and this carachteristic is also mentioned about ENFJs and ISFPs.

Now, as an INFP, I know well how I can be sensitive but for me it's mostly about being introverted, and the intensification of being conscious of my inner feelings.

What about Fe users? How do you experience sensitivity? Is it about yourself (your feelings) or more about the feeling-atmosphere ?/r/MBTImusicvideos

It might interest some of you who are into both music and typology… The idea is to listen to music from the perspective of the personality type of the artists who created it… well mostly the lead singers because typing every band member would take too long.

If anyone is ever to post on this subreddit, make sure you have experience in typing. I mean, it's ok to guess that's what I do too, it's not a perfect science but at least take the time to research the artists themselves and not just "they're an artist therefore IxFP" or "they make this type of music therefore".I'll be posting new stuff from time to time.
Bad typing? I have typed a lot of my favorite artists and, yes ISFP is the most common but it's not even close to halfFav: ESFJ / ENFP

Least fav: ESTJ (some, not all. Depends if they have a developed Ne)I've had a relationship with an ISFJ for 10 years. From my point of view, Si dom combined with Ne inf was a bit much. We grew in different directions throughout the years. The thing is, Si is usually wiser but there's something about the process of following Ne that can take you somewhere you didn't intend. And it's hard for an ISFJ to go against what makes sense from an Si perspective.

From her point of view, my Se PoLR was probably creating a void, not sure if she realized it consciously but I realized that she shined more when surrounded by ESxPs.Yeah, it's so easy being around an ESFJ when you're INFP. It's like our types like each other for exactly who they are and it's comfortingSubjective as in “relative to the subject”. Doesn’t mean an introvert is wrong or whatever but rather that he will take his “self” as an important factor to make sense of the worldDustin Kensrue from Thrice I’m pretty sure is an INTPI suppose some Fi users are shameless about being themselves and not caring but it’s never been the case with me.

I know too well how people think about this or that and this compromise is part of what I show to others.

I’m a guy too so there are a lot of expectations from us that are almost contrary from what Fi is about.ESTJAs an INFP, I've read arguments for ESTJs, ENFJs, ESFJs and even ENTJs as our ideal match.

What do they all have in common? 

1- The pairing of extroversion with introversion: this to me… if there's any truth to match theory it's that extroverts go well with introverts. Remember that both your inferior and PoLR are extroverted if you're an introvert, and vice versa

2- The pairing of perceiving (P) and judging (J): this seems to work on another level, in that IxxPs find themselves useful to ExxJs and ExxPs find themselves especially useful to IxxJ, etc etc

Personally I have a preference for ESFJs. But does it mean that other matches are bad? No, a lot of people live their lives alone and so never experience any complementarity whatsoever.Lucky you! Yeah I definitely look for someone to get me out of my head a bit. ESFJs are so present and warm it's really comforting. And their Ne is surprising. I'm curious if you want to share, what do you think he likes from you being an INFP?Upvoted for the INFP lolAnd now Ne vs Si

Ne: Something's got to give, I can't live another day like this

Si: WTF... do we have to do this again?!Zach De La Rocha (RATM)

Davey Havok (AFI)Also Andrew McMahonNot according to idrlabsI don't hate anything about ESFJs , you're the best! Caring, fun, lively, responsible… you're great at telling stories and getting me out of my head.What... Is anyone seeking my attention?

Oh...I want that cap :DYep he's an INFJ... of the worst kind.It’s not the Fe it’s the prejudice. There’s plenty of Fe people I admire from Chomsky to MLK..Let’s see. ENFJ would be our ideal match all the while ESFJ is one of the worst? How so? Meanwhile, INTJ-ENFP is listed as ideal match while it’s the same dynamic as INFP-ESFJ. So yeah, it looks wrong and arbitrary.I find CS Joseph unreliable. Being confident about his model doesn't make it true, in fact it's quite hit or miss. You can't just take Beebe's archetypes theory and present it like it's proven science. For me, Michael Pierce remains the most accurate though he's not as active now. TwFP is fun. but like 30 minutes into his videos I move on, some of them are just too long but he's interesting thoughWell Mussolini was an ESFP... You'd be surprised how many ESFPs are authoritarian. But Trump is ESTP thoughMy personal opinion:

Best: ESFJ, ENFJ

Good: ENFP, ESTJ, ESTP, INFP, INFJ, ISFJ

Can make it work: ENTJ, ISTP, INTP, ISTJ, INTJ, ISFP, ESFP, ENTP

Worst: None

Also worth mentioning that you’re probably better off with say, an healthy ISTP than an unhealthy ENFJ so this doesn’t mean muchThis, but with music playingHe is Fi-dom... he’s an ISFPHere we prefer the term StereoTypologyCan you perform socially even though it drains you (INFJ) or you dislike the idea of doing that (INFP) ?

Are you persistent (INFJ) or easily take 'no' for an answer (INFP) ?If you feel like an outsider and experience uneasiness or disharmony in social situations that would lean more towards INFP. If you feel like an observer and you're scared of saying inappropriate or unnecessary things then that would lean more towards INFJ.From my personal observations I’d say there ARE more ENFPs than any other intuitive type. It’s fairly common for girls. I’d say as much as ESFP but not nearly as many as ISFJ or ESFJWhat if I don't care about my social anxiety ? Does that make me The Joker ?Yep. And Mussolini was ESFP and Franco ISFJI don't think it's one of the worst match for INFPs. After all, it's an I/E pairing which is a good start. Their Se and your Fi will be much appreciated in each other since it's each other's PoLR. Their tertiary Fe should be, sufficient if well-developped... There will be a clash with their strong unconscious Te and your inferior Te though, and your strong unconscious Ni with their inferior NiI'm an intuitive and agree that N and S should be switched. The cat is ISTPWhile I agree that ENTP/INFJ pairing is ideal, the logical equivalent for an ISFJ would be an ESTP and not xSTJDefinitely depends on the type of ESTP. But if their tertiary Fe is well-developed it should go just fine.ESFPs and ESFJs are more rare than INFPs? That's...unlikely. I've met 2 other INFPs in all my life. Meanwhile, ESFPs and ESFJs are everywhere.

Older stats are still more realistic in my experience. INFJ still rarest type. Met only one in my life. ENFJs are not that rare.Dad: ISTJ

Mom: ISFP

Older brother: ESFP

Other brother: ISTP

Me: INFP

Family when I try to bring Ne in conversations:He's not. He's an ISFJ... And that's why we don't see more sensors in hereAnd DAMN's tracklist is basically an ISFJ's philosophy (Loyalty, humble, God, love, fear..)Hate that I have so many examples of thisThe hard truth for enneagram 4's: If your goal is to be yourself then don't expect any outcome other than you being yourself :)

So then Justin Bieber is right, you should go and love yourself"ExTJs want to succeed and others to fail"

"IxFP want to be original and others to be boring"

That's the same mistake here. If you value success you want success all around, for you and other people too. If you value authenticity you want it in other people too, not just yourself.
INFP, ADHD.
Can confirm conflict happens between these types.

Source: My dad is an ENTJ and mum is an ISFP. My brother and flatmates are ENFPs. Too busy partying to rule the world, sorry ;):(INFP here! Obviously don't speak for all of us, but there I personally find that it is somewhat enjoyable feeling things. One of the strongest (for me at least) is sadness. While I have little to *feel* sad about it can be somewhat comforting. It's like lying on your bed feeling peaceful and putting on a sad song - you don't feel sad, but you... "feel" sad. 

A lot of the time there are INFPs who are depressed, lonely, genuinely sad - but for those other ones it's more about the experience than about the doom and gloom. 

Personal opinion.

There's the additional "there's so much pain in the world/around me and I can't fix it, and I can't stop thinking about it," but that applies to *me* specifically to a lesser extent.Hooray! No evil INFPs!

...yet.It's entirely possible it's just the fact it's a relationship she isn't committed to, and she's blowing you off because she wants some me time. Schedule a date in the future.

1. Arrogance and self-interest.

2. Be genuine without being blunt.

3. Oh god someone is sitting next to me don't make eye contact actually maybe I should say hi to be polite oh no it wasn't loud enough now it's awkward. &gt;INFP but not as crazy.

...There's so many variables it's difficult to tell you exactly what kind of scenario a Fi person would open up to you in. One thing that is a key difference between Fi people and the rest of the world from what I understand is that while you might feel happy, sad, angry, lonely, inspired, challenged (etc) and variations of those emotions, Fis tend to have about a billion different emotions, some of which you may think are the same, but they may be subtly different and very important. 

Basically, if an Fi does open up, don't discount an answer that sounds vague, or if something is "difficult to describe". It's like comparing our sense of smell to a dogs - they might not be able to describe what the fuck all the subtle differences are and we'd think they were crazy, mostly because of the whole barking thing.Hi, me.I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's the biggest sub. 20,000+.The cool hipsters or the film students. I should note I wasn't a cool hipster, we've been friends forever, and I was also a film student.It's hung out. Hanged is when someone is executed.What tool would you recommend instead of 16personalities? I've sent some friends and family that way and even if only half of it matches it's funny to see how accurate they can be. For example, my father - 'The underlying thought running through the ENTJ mind might be something like "I don’t care if you call me an insensitive bastard, as long as I remain an efficient bastard".'

me_irlAs much as I'd like to, it's not particularly prevalent where I live :(I don't think I'd pay for it unless I was doing it for a group :) I've done maybe 3 or 4 tests on different sites and always come out as a INFP, even though I have a few non-stereotypical INFP traits.That's when you press crtl+N and repeat. I have my video queue in one tab, reddit in another, facebook and mail in another, random searches and crap in another.  Crtl+N is your friend. I'd assume it's because a lot of healthy ENFPs aren't on reddit. All the ones I know are barely ever on the internet, and are out doing things. One's in Nepal river kayak guiding and doing charity work, another is acting and directing all the time, another is skating and the last is playing music, getting high and partying. Very late to this thread, but Theon definitely not an INFP. Killing people to prove yourself to someone else doesn't at all fit. He's also quite extroverted.[May I shamelessly direct you to another fine INFP pun?](https://np.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/522uzt/dayum_gurl_are_you_an_infp/)My glasses are functional thank you very much...


They help me look good ;)No, don't be ashamed! I was sharing!

^^^And ^^^there's ^^^the ^^^classic ^^^INFP ^^^over-guiltiness.:D:DUhh. INFP-INFJ clarifier - $9.99?He doesn't seem INFP-y at all to me. While he's certainly an idealist I'm pretty sure Ni is before Fi for him.

Could be wrong though, I'm typically shit at typing people unless they're ENFPs, and I can smell them from a mile off. In a good way ;)Maybe a shy ENTJ? He reminds me of a quiet version of my father, so... yeah I'd guess xNTJ.Fluffy unicorns in dreamyland while alt-j plays in the background for everyone!Cheers :)Hey, sidenote - are unicorns fluffy? Or am I thinking of elegant rams? Or really tall rabbits?That's very informative, thank you. Also, FPs seem to get the short straw somewhat haha. Romantic idealist... that can only end well.Aww thanks Same here. INFPScuba diving

Waterpolo

Gaming 

Reading

Is drinking a hobby?

Painting

Dungeons and Dragons

Edit:

Also TV and music

Camping and hiking
Ah shit.

But yeah, scuba diving is awesome. I'm an instructor, so I get to pass on my knowledge and passion too.

Imagine being in space but with sharks and fish and dolphins and seals and penguins. That's what it's like.

So peaceful too. All you can hear is your breathe. I mean...&gt;Fi: Idiosyncratic

Oi mate, who you calling an idiot?I'm Libra and totally ok with it! Although I don't put any stock in star signs anyway so it doesn't matter hahaThis is the one I relate to.Talk?Seconded. ENFPs are an INFPs best friend.In an entirely non-fishing-for-compliments way, do you mind elaborating?My advice for any infps reading - find something low stress that you enjoy doing and don't worry about how much you get paid. Right now I'm taking people swimming with sharks. Not great money but low stress and good fun.The sharks are really friendly, I'd pat them if I was allowed. NoiceI've worked as office admin assistant and that was low stress but not that fun. I'm a scuba Instructor which is low stress. I imagine massage is a low stress thing We may or may not start a revolution tooUsername checks out, and I totally agreeeWoohooWhy can't I cry and want to hold hands with people smhWhen I'm doing I'm not suffering though, it's to... Taste the sadness Thanks! Damn it's been 3 years... Crazy.I hope you don't mean furry like the people in costumes banging.

Cos we don't usually bang.INFP

Didn't go to college, did a diploma in outdoor education focused on scuba diving, graduated as an instructor. Good times.I was about to say, despite being an INFP you seemed to entirely miss the mark for me 😂I like to think I am 😁I'm not extroverted but I think everyone would assume I was.Introvert DOES NOT EQUAL shy!

I can small talk all day! And then spend a week recovering....Socially adept extroverts can tell when they're being told to fuck off, but it doesn't mean they like it 😂Typical INFP, using *feelings* to solve your problems, er, I mean, think about how you might solve your problems.It's almost embarrassing 😂😂As an NF former nice guy (age 13-16 or so), can confirm. Took me reading nice guy memes to realiseI went to a co-ed school 😂

Also family friends.I've learned to say thank you, although I'm usually blushing a lot. My infp girlfirend still doesn't quite believe me, or is at the very least surprised when I tell her, that she is beautiful. Infps and enfps are like bread and butterI'm sorry, what huge group of friends? I was the library kid 😂Yup, kid sucked, adult is fun.Please tell me more about how I love vampires haha

I dislike this stereotype. The /r/infp subreddit typically swings from artsy stuff to depression, but I am personally super happy 99% of the time. I don't fit in to that sad boy mould. I listen to sad music a lot and enjoy things that make me feel melancholic, but not because I feel sad, it's to taste the sad. Can confirm the bedroom bitInfp struggle too budNobody knew I was depressed for two and a half years because I was so cheerful all the time. It was only afterwards, when I started being a functioning member of society again, that people realised something was upFor me, when I grew up, I was always told that me being in a bad mood brought they whole mood down. To this day I feel guilty if I'm acting anything other than cheerful. I'm not a teenager anymore, I can tell someone when I'm upset, it was a different time back then Is it weird if I want all? Maybe 
power to a (significantly) lesser degree but stillRelatable
Comfort for the most part.&gt;I think our Fi and aux Ne makes us want to explore how everything could relate to us, making a lot of different options all appear to be potentially "correct." Hence, our tendency to be indecisive.

Oh my god yes. I've always been torn when deciding because whatever I choose, I'd be wondering about the other path.Yeah. Most of the time my mind train takes off when I'm out with friends and I'm out for a while. I'm working on being more talkative in large groups though. 1-1 with friends is not a big issue though.INFP Pluto lovers representFor INFP, I'll have to guess that we don't know and we're out there to find out.

If we're looking to stereotype stupidly, ENTJ's life purpose is to become boring success people.&gt; I’m completely scatterbrained and the biggest daydreamer

Sounded like an INFP from the startDidn't really peg IT as an INFP profession but you might be right.

It's not really routine, may require creative problem solving, programming is pretty fun and it might leave you with free time to pursue other paths(This one I'm not so sure of)To be honest I like going on /r/INFP as they are pretty chill and are never low on self deprecating memes on anxiety/over-analyzing. I like to go on others as I enjoy trying to understand the other types. I still have no idea what S types are all about.Me too. Paying attention in class has been something that worked for me until I burned out in college.It sounds exhausting tbh. At the end of the day, I just want to chill and we know ENTJ's are low on chill.&gt; fiery temperament

lolI just took the test and then checked my function description for further validation.I for the most part can't discern romantic relationships from close platonic friendships. Yeah I know sex but what else is there.I can see how that would be an issue with Fe doms. Fi won't mind much.&gt;Human mess

You sound like an INFP then.

Your problem solving mode sounds like Te. Which I'm guessing is Tertiary rather than Inferior because I can't smell any Si here. I'd say you're an INFJ
It's not sarcasm. My best friend is ENTJ and she gets shit done while I just watch life pass by.Isn't that happiness of being with a person you care about? I have that with my best friend.

Edit: sounds like troubleMy bad. They seem to be less common though in my friend group and known friends, I only know one sensing type.Replies really are making me think my best friend and I are in a relationship right now.It is pretty great tbh. The emotional support is amazing and it is less pressure than an actual relationship. I think my main issue is trying to fit our friendship into a social friendship/relationship model rather than seeing it as what it is.But what if I wanted the other thingI always took him for an extrovert. Weird.I always remember him being all casanova with the girls but yeah, he prefers one-on-one things and does things alone. ISTP might be right after all.&gt; If I say them aloud, they are there

A lot of times I refused to talk to my bestfriend about my problems because I use this as a defense mechanism. I know I'm in denial but it helps. I've started telling though because it's doing more harm than good.I am pretty detached from what is and always thinking about what could be. My mind is a house of divergent thinking of possible scenarios.For me, if I feel someone is trying to "crack me open"(Mostly E-types have used this term) I close up even worse. Show them you care, open up to them as well(Shows you trust them) and they will follow.

At least for me, INFP's aren't too big about twking the first step.With the ENTJ involved, I don't know if that would be possible.To be honest I like it. At times I wish I switched to something actually useful like ENTJ or ESTJ but then I remember I'd hate being them.A puppetmaster? I love it&gt; But then there's this flood of thought and feeling going on under the surface, and we go and gush it all over that sub

Yup, had a particularly rocky week so the sub came to my rescue. Sometimes there's things you can't talk about with friends.My Te is similar. Is Fi losing it and started spiralling. Hey there's Te listing every possible logical reason why I suck. I'd expect it to be better as I'm studying in Engineering.I'm an INFP and while I love poking fun at ENTJs in here, I really admire them. The one ENTJ in my life amazes me all the time with getting so much shit done and being a kickass person overall and I don't think I can tell her that enough.Hey we're self sufficient.. when we remember to eat and do work and stuff.

Edit: not gonna lie I can get pretty co-dependent.We're more okay with being alone than extraverts. For example if an ENTJ doesn't go out for a week they might feel trapped and bad because of the lack of social stimuli. But for an INFP it's no big deal. 

While introverts can go longer without social interaction, they tend to neglect that it's eventually a need. Extraverts don't have thisn shortcoming and they even force us into social situations which we(begrudgingly) participate. It drains us, yes but sometimes you have to spend some of that sweet energy.INFP, I'd say either Ravenclaw or most possibly Hufflepuff. The test at Pottermore got slytherin though./r/infp is a strange mix of deppressing shit that makes you want to drown in your own blood and haply stuff that gives you hope and dreams. Still great for venting and talking.Because bloggers tend to be introverts because you don't need to go outside for that job.Definitely not the second. I'd say extroverts care more about how they present themselves to the world. Also most introverts love to hate on themselves.This is what my ENTJ hates about me. I'm dialling down the complaining though.To be fair when someone is giving birth, you're bound to be better dressed than them.Yeah. I hate debating please stop I'll concede anything.INFP world would be nothing like this place to be sure. But dystopias seem pretty interesting.Yeah. I mostly care about what I and my close ones think about me. Social norms seem less relevant in an intimate setting.INFP world would be changing and shifting a lot if you ask me. God would always want try out new stuff.Yeah. I hate the Introverts are this deep intellectual collective while extraverts are nothing more than shallow party beasts circlejerk.

Also being introverted does not mean you don't have to be able to function in social situations. When being called out "I am an introvert masterrace with deepness" is not a good excuse.

Never actually thought it was about the types but yeah, drinking or certain people can get me to go on extravert mode. I do need some time to myself after though.YES! This is what I can't explain to most people in my life. I can see reason and objective arguments. It doesn't mean I like them however. Whenever I say that "It's correct but still don't like it" people act as if I'm refusing that the argument is incorrect. Need to find better debate buddies though I hate debating.Oh I wasn't talking about them. I mostly try to help them and am actually kind of happy they feel like they've found space to talk about what bothers them.

The depressing stuff was mostly us circlejerking about our anxiety and excessive worry.My opinion will be biased because I think subjectively. I also know what is objectively the "right" decision. But it might not feel right because of the intuition. However whenever I express that, I'm met with people who think I'm just pressing my hands against my ears singing loudly to reject the truth.Debating other introverts might be a good out. Whenever I debated with my INTP friend, it was less about what opinions we held and more about whatever was on the plate.INFP's are pretty much "jack of all trades and master of none" according to thisWelp. Pretty satisfactory looking at the INFP side. I mostly lean towards stealth/magic paths in game and am almost always the supporting healer in multiplayer. Also interested in game design but more to the story/artistic side.Funny that I always identified with that long before I knew mbti. Perhaps the Ne with starting everything.I thought it was weird at the start but yeah. This is pretty accurate for Fi.

"Can't really explain" should be the INFP slogan&gt; I do see descriptions citing fi users as almost noble mbti knights completely unwilling to go against their values, but I truly don't think that is the case. Fi users can definitely be coerced to move against their values, it's just that they will feel insanely conflicted about it later.

I've never really felt that I held these amazing unchangeable ideals either. With aux Ne, that really sounds off. We are open to change and reinventing ourselves. For me Fi, at least the healthy one is great at recognizing others individuality and authenticity and entertaining new ideas as you said. Unhealthy Fi would basically close the ears and scream as loud as it can because "My opinion is right not yours"Exactly. I use hard-g because i like the way it sounds.It's our piece of shitDo that a lot and I'm INFPYou clearly never met me!

Just kidding. Even I can sometimes use logic in my decisions ^^^^then ^^^^do ^^^^the ^^^^oppositeWhile I'd love for gender roles to be abolished and see equality for women all around, I don't think this wave of feminism will be right for it.Nope nope nope nope. I don't want to live in the "real world". Sure I'd be more successful but still."Maybe"

"Not sure."

"I feel"

"Sorry, I spaced out"I don't hate it but if it vanished from the face of the world, probably wouldn't care. I actually like them. I know stereotyping the types makes little sense but it still is kinda fun.It's so easy to push their buttons. Just acknowledge that doing something is illogical and keep doing it.Exactly! Sometimes it might not be the best way to do things but it sure is a more interesting way.You can't be dumb, you have an intuitive type /sWell, look up INTJ slam apparently it's a thing.Switch Winter and Spring and you have my list right there. Summer can just suck it.I do thqt daydreaming too but not with that purpose. I just cook up a lot of scenarios and play thousands of ways they can play out. Rewind to a certain checkpoint and go again and again.That does sound like an active Ne. Reading your stuff, I'd say you're either an ENFP or INFP, both have the same functions though in different orders. ENFP's are more driven by their Ne and INFP's by their Fi. I'd say ENFP because your Te sounds more Tertiary than Inferior.Sara sounds like an INFP or ENFP with High-Fi.I got High Fi Ne Ni and was confused. Chalked it up to having awesome intuition.My guess is the Fe in their stack.INFP's get along pretty well most of the time. We could chill for a good whileSeems like the universal INFP Fe hate.What is INFJ Fi hate? Calling us selfish and unstable?Can't argue much over that.Oh. Most INFP's(myself included) I've seen are kinda offput by Fe because it might not seem genuine to us. Because Fe is better at dealing with what is at the surface, we get the feeling that it does not care about who people really are. But using the tert Fe as a tool like this really is interesting.Could you give any examples? I mostly try to relate the knowledge I have on one topic to other disciplines and see how they are similar. But what if all INFP's are idealist freedom fighters?Azula and Ozai from Avatar have been typed as ESTJ's. Just saying.All EXTP's are literally deadpool and all XNFP's have borderline personalit disorder. You heard it folks.Ew real world stuff. I was guessing more along the lines of engineering and sciences and stuff.Most of these stuff, I learn the basics and pick up what I can from the conversations. I probably should learn them but probably won't.Oh man that is even more frightening. What's your take on Zuko being an INFP trying to mimic Te-dom behaviourCan agree with that. Sometimes I start talking and then it's a journey we all take hopefully reaching the point I'm supposed to make.
Let me phrase it this way. Most of the airhead characters Zooey Deschanel is portraying are XNFP's. Intuition having a high position in the stack does not mean intelligence.E/ISTJ's seem better equipped to deal with the real world in my opinion. You guys are more aware of your surroundings, more logical and decisive as I can see. 

Though I wouldn't want to trade in my "Head in the clouds"  emotionally conflicted self for that. Life is a journey and I think I'll get there.&gt;always has something to say back that is often humorous and funny

I've read that recently about Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice who was typed as an ENFP. I'd say you're a Ne dom definitely. From Ti or Fi, I'd have to pick Ti though. Enjoy your ENTP.Do I even matter? 

I know it's relevant to the context but the omniscient being'll know.What I actually want to know is if I matter to my friends. Did I make them happy or didn't help at all. If it says no, then I drift through life  hopefully able to take a hedonistic/nihilistic manner. If not, I die.Thanks. I think I matter to them too but sometimes I don't know and it can really mess with my head. It'll clear up though so no worries.Probably Tolkien. It is such an amazing accomplishment to create an entire world like he did and it is what I hope I can do one day, be it through literature or video games or whatever. I would ask him how he did it and how did it feel, seeing all those small pieces come together into that amazing fabric. Would also tell him his work is still seen as amazing and congratulate him for that but I think I'd lose track of time in the middle and the conversation would be cut off. :/Weren't Fi-doms all bipolar messes? Of course we can blame them. Oh wait..

edit: self-righteous bipolar messes sorry.Of course we are kings! I had a 6 hour time to study for an exam yesterday and managed a solid 45 minutes. Then I started thinking about getting the witcher books and a whole lot of stuff because "a little distraction is good" and my time was up.When I'm thinking of the relationship I want, which is mostly emotional comfort and companionship but not long term planning, another INFP sounds amazing to just lounge around and chill and read books and cuddle. For long term, whoever I'm more comfortable with.I relate to a lot in this yes! My mind always runs scenarios simulations and stuff. It can be future fairy tales, past regrets, things I'm afraid of and will get me mad or just silly stuff. One thing is common though. My mind will regularly rewind and alternate at certain spots. What if this happened instead, or this? Or this? If I'm doing some creative work it might be pretty energizing to see all these possibilities but if it's a negative one it sucks.

I also don't get that Fi has a moral compass inside that everything has to align to things. But when something conflicts or clicks, it's significant(e.g we found a kitten we rescued from a tree with no mother around. Got it home, fed and warmed him I could either keep him in the apartment complex because they didn't get along well with the dog or take him where I found him hoping the mother finds the kitten. Eventually went with the latter and been in conflict with myself since, asking myself if my decision was right etc. Next day I found out someone else took the kitty in and then I felt this bliss and sense of right because he would be happy.) But when I make decisions with myself, my main decision mechanism is indeed if it feels right, if it clicks.

I think I get some resonance moments when I'm listening to music. A song will really sound good in a certain mood and I'll keep listening to it for a long while.Death Stars seem pretty INTP to be honest.Knew we'd lose to NTP's. You guys are just too good shitposters.&gt; Because I know that there is no such thing as a correct model.

I think you win. Models are never exactly true because they are only approximations, our attempted reconstructions of real things. They'll never fully reflect the real thing but they can still be largely accurate.Hey me. I also hate that I tend to validate my own self-loathing and romaticize it instead of working on becoming a person I can love.&gt; Really should be in one of those bubbles for the people who are allergic to everything.

I sadly don't have one of those.INFP's are mostly type 4's or 9's right?INFP's are prone to being Jack of all Trades kinda people as far as I've seen.ENFP and INFJ are pretty easy to differentiate. Look at the Primary Ne vs Ni and Aux Fi vs Fe. I doubted being INFJ for a solid 10 minutes until I realized I didn't have Fe.IMO Ni vs Ne is harder to differentiate than Fi vs Fe. Also look at Dom-Tert loops. One reason I knew I was INFP was seeing my depressive episodes being completely similar to Fi-Si loops. For INFJ, you'd have Ni-Ti loops and ENFP Ne-Te loops.

Fi vs Fe is basically this. From what I've seen, Fe seeks to establish harmony in the group and therefore to themselves while Fi seeks to establish harmony within themselves and therefore to the loved ones.

If you think "the more the merrier" you might be a Fe user. It's also a common meme that Fi users think Fe users are fake while others think Fi users are selfish.

Keep in mind these things require more careful introspection than what I've explained and none of this stuff is in any way determining.

edit: Ni vs Ne can be basically Depth vs Breadth in the intuition sense.Then relax, take a deep breath. Remember that none of these four letter combos define your personality. They just provide insight on how your mind works.

Try to remove yourself from the information for a while to relax your mind and then look again. The type things at the sidebar are also pretty neat.Sounds like unhealthy FiWhen I'm with people I'm comfortable with, I'm more extraverted and cheery. You can easily mistake me with an ENFP.

But with really intimate people, on the one-on-one time I become calmer and we can just chill.&gt; He is constantly surprising me with how much our relationship means to him. It's easy to accidentally pigeonhole him into this stereotype of the cold, emotionless robot. But he consistently shows me how much he cares about me and it's always a nice surprise to see him show his feelings because that's a rare occurrence lol

I can relate to that with my ENTJ friend. Whenever I start thinking that she doesn't care or something. She just does something. This unintentional gesture that just says "I care" like sending me cool meditation music even though she finds it boring. I end up feeling like an idiot but a happy fuzzy idiot.VOI-S.

V - 87%

O - 71%

I - 74%

The peacemaker thing also works with me being type 9INFP's, especially males are not exactly what society expects.I'd say INFP's fit well with little communities they identify themselves with for sure. But with society overall. I'd say no.As far as I remember the typical male in the western culture is an ISTJ. 

Te is associated with practicality and rationality while Si with stability and attentiveness to body(Not so sure about that). The typical male in the society and typical engineer profile is basically this at least where I live. A good ISTJ example is Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec.

However, in the INFP stack these functions are in the lower part while In the higher part we have Fi which is focused on internal emotions, individuality and identity. And Ne which loves dealing with the unconventional, the new.

On one side we have the practical ISTJ's who are useful to society in a tangible way and on the other we have INFP's who are not that interested in the real world, not that interested in tying themselves to something they don't care about, while they strive to be unique, not to mention more reliant on their emotions for direction, a trait sadly still associated with women. 

I'm definitely not suggesting INFP's are useless. Hell Tolkien was an INFP and that guy is an inspiration to me with the world he created. But they prefer to take on different roles and tend to be more eccentric.Kudos on him he's doing great.Women are often told to be more "emotional" than men. I don't think it's about femininity but more about following what we want rather than the "best choice"Exactly. I care about people other than myself therefore I have Fe not Fi is a pretty common mistype. Everyone has access to all the functions. I actually like trying to pick things apart as mental exercise but I don't do that too often and naturally. This doesn't mean I magically have Ti in my stack but I can use it anyway.Don't get hung up on the descriptions. INFP's are considered to be idealistic butterflies that want to fly around and make the world better. Most INFP's I met are more individualistic and want to go on their own journey.Grey is the best color ever! Black is a close second so I'm alright.Mostly subvocalizing. When I imagine situations however I tend to visualize as well.I remember reading time and time again that the internet is definitely Introverted Intuition biased. There is bound to be more NF's and NT's around here.You sound like you'd hate INTP/INFP'sDefinitely no harm done. You're Fe-dom and interacting with Fi-doms mean work for you guys. Though not sure about Ti. Both are not that willing in group gatherings.

It's also an old meme that Fe calls Fi selfish and Fi calls Fe fakeDevelop your Fi and you'll be golden in my opinion.My best friend is an ENTJ, the others in my main circle are INTP's and ENTP's who I play dnd with.

I'm also in a college club where most people are probably NT's though I haven't studied them extensively.

I'm getting my dose of Fi from /r/infp most of the time.Arts can't be just attributed to Fi. Each function can bring different stuff to the table and different approaches. This sounds like saying INFP's can't appreciate philosophy because they don't have Ti.

I'm not wary of Ni's I think. I can't even recognize them. Fe use however irks me. 

I love Ti you caught me there, but Se I don't know.Johnny Depp and Tim Burton both being INFP's are pretty great.

However my favourite might also be Tolkien for the amazing world building. Thanks for Bill Watterson though didn't know about him.Yeah. Most comparisons I've seen mostly relate to the extraverted experience. Such as a sad person seemingly in distress.

Apparently Fe would be more prone to talking to them even though they are strangers in an effort to help while Fi would try to understand what they were feeling and then maybe help.

However I've not seen any analogies regarding their internal feelings.Your first paragraph sounds like Ne which is basically a puppy with ADHD of functions.Don't remember seeing a description for INFP that clicked completely. They always say idealistic and internal values instead of neurotic mess.For me, it's the thought. If someone tries to cheer me up and fails, It still kinda cheers me up because it shows that they care. If it ends up badly and they're sorry it turned out that way, it's alright because they wanted it to go well. Even though with a few exceptions, I try not to feel hate towards people who didn't show malicious intent.In the die rolling metaphor, sure but regarding the essence of it, the decision making process, I don't really know.

Ti listens to its own internal logic making machine, Te observes the realities of the outside world and tries to utilize it for its gain, Fi goes from its own internal biases and opinions and Fe is more in tune with the crowd it's in.&gt;I, for example, know not to try to compete with or judge myself against the standards of my girlfriend's productivity

Oh man thanks for this. I've been driving myself nuts with my ENTJ friends productivity sometimes she's amazing. Just gotta remember we have different motivations and paths in life.Exactly. For me it's about the journey taking life and all these ideas in and making them. However when I compare myself to others I tend to break down and stop the journey altogether. Even though I'm not big on productivity, it is counterproductive and kills my spirit in the process.Oh man don't even talk about that. Now let me think of a million other scenarios that could've ended with the ant living and wallow in the guilt because the ant is dead.&gt; Do you often find yourself focusing on why you feel that way, and how that reflects you as a person?

Yup. Both INFP's and INTP's tend to pick apart at things pretty intensely. What and how are the differences though.&gt;This would explain why N-types are good at long term planning

It's like you've never met an INFP.

Look up the cognitive functions. Your N or S type has different meanings regarding its position(dom or aux) and direction(introverted sensing vs extroverted sensing)Sounds like pretty developed Fi considering it's inferior. Oh but she's 33Sounded like unhealthy Fi/Fe to be honest. They tend to be pretty intolerant. Healthy Fi tends to let people be themselves.Yeah! As long as they're not hostile, it is actually a good opportunity to peer into opposing views. INFP / M

I drive a Golf but it was more of my family's call than mine. My dream vehicle is a Suzuki SFV650 bike as I really appreciate the looks of it and it is pretty lightweight.Now I'm all worked up because I'm so excited. Thanks :DSo I am not an ISTJ, always good to know.Feelers in distress might try escaping to Thinker behaviour. Yes INFP's do have Te but if it is not developed, suddenly going into full ENTJ/ESTJ mode just makes you look like a parody while your mind is going crazy with the ignored turmoil.

So develop who you are, your strengths and your weaknesses, both are your own and both will be part of your improvement. If someone engages my Ne be damn sure I'm gonna talk their ears off. Or if I drink which also suppresses Fi and tells Ne that the lead act is nowhere to be found and he is to do the whole show now.&gt; NFs are actually terrible when it comes to putdowns and witty comments. I don't know about xNFJ but at least xNFPs are really cynics at heart so we sometimes sting others with reality checks "you need to wake the fuck up man, what if everything goes wrong".

Yeah, I warn friends about possible consequences and shit. But whenever it's me I straight out ignore it.I'm okay with this, though telepathy is also welcome.I wouldn't crush tiny humans with my superpowers, I'd just form a more or less isolated kingdom and deal with trespassers + eventual world domination.I can give you a put down on INFP's but the wprd limit. Oh well.

Neurotic messes that try to solve their problems by muttering "Everything's fine, everything will be fine" in fetal positionYou flip the socionics j/p though so it's the same as your thing.Umm. ENFP and SJW are really not that related. Sure high unhealthy Fi does make for some close minded individuals but just because you're ENFP doesn't mean you're an SJWINFP. I don't know any ENFJ's but if they are the caretaking mother hens they are made out to be, then I'm really uncomfortable. If something's bothering me, most Fe users try to pry it out of me while I just want to keep it to myself to figure it out and then share in private to my close friends. I know they mean well but I actually don't want to share and sometimes there's nothing wrong but you think there is.

Edit: Just realized this is textbopk Se-polr&gt;I've been constantly doubting my own type.

Sounds like an INFP to be honest. One day I'm certain I'm INFP and even today I'm considering maybe I'm an ENTP because I smile mischievously while thinking of tricking my friends in a DnD game.Currently my only character was a rogue but I also find Druids/Sorcerers/Bards/Druids pretty interesting. The concepts are pretty great.

However my next planned character was a tiefling illusion/enchantment focused wizard who wants to hide her tiefling identity with whatever means necessary but I think my DM friend can settle similar things with a warlock which sounds pretty interesting.

Right now though I'm trying my hand with DM'ing and the preparation and the anticipation is pretty intense as I'm also trying to not rely completely on my improvisation. It is a pretty amazing deal though and I'm looking at different formats as well such as world of darkness.We covered it before and I remember either ENTP or INTP being the king of shitposting.To be fair it's a kinda old thread. Ne and Ti has the greatest potential for shitposting in my opinion as well. I've been mostly playing rogue/loner types and want to diversify a bit to be honest and a chivalric romantic fool. )t might be fun. Also shamanistic druids and stuff.Welp that explains why my Ni and Fe were kinda high.I'm mostly in chaotic neutral/true neutral regions. Mostly trying to look out for myself and friends. Others if I can though it's not compulsory. Maybe neutral good?Infp infp infp

We are a sexy bunchHe is being "him" with someone elses means. His family needs to cut him off. If he wants to live a purely individualistic life, so be it but with his own money.Well probably. If you have good role models in one area, Fe for example, it would allow for better development of your own. Sadly this street goes both ways.It flips your Perception axes (Ne/Si vs Se/Ni) so I really doubt it.

Look up cognitive functions, especially these four.That is literally an ENTP stereotype.You sound either like an INFP or INTP to be honest. Being in music festivals is an amazing feeling also.Hey it's not hard to reason with healthy Fi why would you say that I feel like that insults me, why do you have to be such an evil person? /sImmature: My beliefs are right, mine. I'll hold to them no matter what because they are the right way to live and nothing else.

Mature: Live and let live attitude and receptable to change because personalities can change and grow and that is actually a good thing and not betraying who you are.So basically Ne is like divergent thinking and Ni is like convergent thinking.30 existential crisises? So a month's worth?You're asking for a Te grip imo. Not pleasantI feel guilt or discomfort with specific emotions such as anger. When my anger is not justified it makes me uncomfortable because it's not right. 

I'm not a big fan of public emotional expression and I keep that stuff to mostly my inner circle.

However I actually love my emotions. Sadness, happiness, melancholy, guilt they are all part of me and who I am. I love songs and paintings that can invoke an emotional response. Sure acting with logic is harder but it's something I have to do as well. The only difference is my motivations.You're right because it won't be their natural behaviour. It'll be a continuous concious effort on behaving differently. Swimming upstream.&gt;  Make them have little monologues where they trail off from the conversation mid-sentence and just start arguing with themself; have them cut themself off with lots of "actually no wait/now that I think about it/wait that makes no sense" and phrases like that

Ne is such a treat isn't it.&gt;  Functions are more generally preferences.

Pretty much yeah. Our functions are our natural preferences and it just comes easier to us therefore we use them. As a function moves further down the stack, we prefer them less and less. Like INFP's and Fe.My family are FJ's and TP's mostly. And honestly seeing even inferior Fi is kinda refreshing. FJ's are amazing with showing love and making us feel loved, but the ones in my life don't really get when I need my space sadly. Fi and Fe also has this weird conflict but as long as they're both mature/healthy, they wouldn't really mind that much.Pisces is going for an INFJ and INFP mix I think.The way I concluded my INFP or INFJ thing was by Ne and Fe mostly. I was so sure I actually had Ne(Because I'd trail mid-sentence with "but what-if"s and "though it could be"s.) and pretty sure I didn't have Fe in the high stack as I was never the "share with the group" kind of person. I'd gladly listen to someone if they asked me to but if they didn't I'd not really intrude. However the way Fi is portrayed as idealism is still kinda icky to me as well.&gt; I would have to be a puppet leader because I couldn't make a damn decision on my own

Agreed on that front :D

My Fi definitely does not manifest as idealism. If you count Flexibility and letting people be as ideals that is different though. I can't ever imagine being so rigid on my beliefs as I know I don't hold the answers. 

However my Fi shows itself as individuality. I see life as my journey. Towards what I don't know, meaning, identity whatever. I try to look after my friends, though not with great success. In the end though, the journey is mine to take. It is about who I am and who I want to be. 

Though I do have some stances on my romantic relationship things and get pretty bothered whenever people try to disregard/change them. Oh well.He specifically asked not to kill him pls don't&gt; Ultimata are great tools

Man that sounds even more like "All Tomato"Well /r/infp theme is all rainbows and happiness but people are depressed as shit. Though infp's do tend to contradict themselves.&gt; Want to piss off/hurt and INFP? Tell them they did something just cause it was trendy.

Please don't

&gt; They cry one-on-one or in private only

Dead on, I'm not gonna cry in public ever and in one-on-one, it better be someone I really trust/got me real drunk.

&gt;Often like their own idealized versions of people more than they like the people themselves

The main problem is that we expect behaviour of our idealized version of people which tends to create unrealistic expectations. Working on that.

&gt;One day they will be convinced their destiny is to grow beets in Siberia, and they will either lose interest or simply never do it 

Ne is a double edge sword.

&gt;Intolerant of other opinions in that they will look down at those whose values they disagree with. Tolerant of other opinions in that they don't expect others to change their mind and don't want them to conform because of pressure. INFPs want to make people truly believe things rather than just accept them or have them imposed.

Not really anything to add as you nailed it.I'm 22 soon to be 23. Well. I've heard two types of unhealthy INFP's so I think I should answer for both. 

One type is those that are extremely immovable in their ideas that they are really intolerant of others who do not share their values. I'm nothing like that and mostly I strive to be as flexible as I can. If I don't share your values, I'm fine with that as long as you don't force it upon me. Live and let live.

The other one is codependent/critical of self/prone to depression which sadly is similar to me. I seem to spiral a lot with anxiety recently, have been prone to withdrawing from the world, depression and apathy. And can get defensive/codependent with people close to me. 

I try to improve myself overall with getting new interests and also finding emotional outlets, such as journals and stuff.My closest friend group is an ISTP/INTP/ENTJ/ENTP/INFP(me).

We're all the jokers kinda.

edit: ISTP tests as an INTP but I'm really getting ISTP vibes from him.-I have artistic tendencies as well; I believe that logic and creativity go together great in the mind of a programmer.

-I often feel like there is a universe of abstract thought swirling in my head.

Up until these two I was pretty split. But these give me a Ti vibe which points to INTP.

However think of your judgement. In the end what are you drawn to do? What makes sense or what feels right?That was my first thought. Inferior/Undeveloped TeYou reek of Te to be honest. Pretty much to-the-point and "feelings are useless" narrative.

Maybe INTJ as you do have a lot of drive which might be coming frm Ni.The only ones calling INTJ's "the masterminds" are probably the themselves. For what it's worth, my favourite mbti meme/circlejerk after Fe/Fi conflict is INTJ's being considered edgelords.Fi users tend to(except the unhealthy ones) keep their morals/values private. While their actions are still motivated by their inner judgment and morals, it won't be as observable as Fe users. What /u/libright said is also a great point.But Walking existensial crisis is three words.

It is pretty difficult to find one word that sums up a type tbh. So.. Lost?



Nice one!A lot better.&gt; As an Fi user myself I definitely seek to understand others perspectives,

Yeah. Most of the time, I try to understand others experience by relating them to my either real or imagined experiences. I also disagree with the Fi+Te wants to change others views thing. I don't care about other peoples views, it is their views after all. I just want to do my own thing.It's like he picked them all up at once and then opened the tray, put them down, said "TA DA!" and closed it up.

Good luck with your infp.Of course! what is he an ESTJ?&gt;"You don't have to do things my way; just don't tell me my way's wrong."

Yes. High Fi wants to do things in its own way but doesn't necessarily want to dorect others to this way as well. People going other ways have their own sets of reasons and Fi lets that be. With aux Ne it is also a good exercise trying to guess their motives and drives. 

With me at least I'm more than happy to let people do what makes them happy unless it is some terrible stuff. Wanna have an open relationship? as long as you understand the risks and both agree, sure. Wanna break up with your so? If you don't feel it's working, alright. Major life decision? I'll try to give you perspectives and stuff but it is your life and your decision in the end and I'll support you no matter what(goes for close friends)

This is also why Fi hates being restricted. They probably already know their way is not optimal but they want to do it anyway for their reasons, some they can explain and some not. Not being allowed to take their own path because another is "better" is one of the things I'm bitchy about the most.

This can however manifest negatively though as it leads to rejection of outside help and advice even when it is beneficial. So Fi users should check whether going their own way is worth it every once in a while. Guilty, I also project myself to stories themselves but projecting myself on fictional characters is not a rare occasion for me.Yeahh. I'm not that big on PDA so doubt this is accurate.Would also like to add to /u/Sisaroth 7th function is also known as your POLR(Point of Least Resistance). Can also elaborate with examples I think from my experience.

Disclaimer: Sorry for the huge wall of text, I don't think you should read all of it though. They are just my experiences with my shadow functions and pretty much sum up to /u/Sisaroth's point with the addition of I'm the suckiest at the seventh one.

* Fe(Fifth Function)

I'm pretty much able to go in social functions, make lighthearted small talk and whatever. But think about where the "I hate small talk" thing comes from with INFP's. To me it is superficial and tells you nothing worth knowing. It is ultimately trivial and I see little point in it and it bores me to death. So I don't indulge in smalltalk if I can help it.

I should add I'm not reducing Fe to just "being able to make smalltalk" But controlling the emotional influence of the group, uniting people etc is not something I wish to do because it makes me uncomfortable

* Ni(Sixth Function) 

Well, Ni is one that is hard to explain for me side by side with Ti. In my opinion it is something like this, If I imagine Ne like thousands of threads/paths laid before me, Ne looks at all of them, tugging at a couple trying to explore all of them. Ni however, commits. It moves along one of those threads in a much more focused manner. 

For me I hate committing. Even in my daydreams, I can't commit to things, I have exit plans for a lot of commitments I make. When however thinking about situations and where things may lead, I instinctively use Ne of course. But whenever I need to elaborate on a situation, when I need to commit to a scenarion or a path, I use Ni, concsiously though not naturally. And it feels restricting, though useful I admit.

* Se(Seventh Function aka Polr)

The Polr is an obvious weak link in your cognitive functions and sometimes is used as a typing tool.(Yours OP is Ni I think, no idea how it manifests) In Se polr's, it manifests as an obliviousness to the outside world. I space out a lot, my mind is almost never in the physical world and notice almost minutes later after someone enters or leaves the room. Also being confrontational or affecting change in the physical vicinity is sometimes associated with Se. Most of the time, I prefer to be an observer.

* Ti(Eigth Function)

For Ti I can't really express much distaste as I actually suspected myself of being an INTP most times. Though my Ti is pretty lacking. My logic will be inconsistent and I'd really not care for it that much. Also whenever I think of things, I notice I'm immediately making it personal to me. For example when I was chatting with my INTP friend about utilitarianism, he explained it to me and I immediately thought about my personal thoughts on it and how I felt it could be better.

Also while I understand objective truths matter, I may choose to not internalize them. My personal opinion is much more effective in the judgement unless it is an extreme case.

This is interesting as what you are telling is actually similar to my experiences. I tend to sense the disturbances, slight mood drops meant to be hidden in my environment.

It is actually a reason I suspected myself of being an INFJ at times. Though I'm pretty sure I favor Ne in my stack. Maybe I'm emulating Fe for awareness of others emotions, I don't know.&gt; The main difference is that she's somewhat more attuned to and she places more importance on social dynamics based around the unspoken agreements we make on how to conduct ourselves, including interpersonal politics. Whereas **I'm more attuned to and place more importance on what's going on with people individually, and separate from the surrounding social dynamic.**
 
Yeah, I suppose they hold different focuses and mine is also on the individual rather than the whole. 

Neutral Good

Chaotic Neutral

True Neutral/looking after my own pack&gt;Don’t you dare claim the Manic Pixie Dream Girl INFPs are smart enough to be covering for ENFP stupidity

Are you laying off INFP's so they won't cry?Mostly

"I don't need to optimize X, it should be fine" -&gt; "Man X is not really working well this sucks I wonder why"Don't worry, we can compensate by ourselves.If I sense they're probing for information I'll probably close up so.. yeah it feels invasive.While each type has access to 8 functions, ENFP's being Ti Polr, I doubt it. You might be mistyped as an ENTP however.

Also on the inside perspective, Fi and Ti kinda look like eachother and I had trouble discerning whether I'm an INTP or INFP. So check that out.I'd say ISTJ, your 6th function, is supposed to be pretty strong, comparable to Aux or even your dominant function. Which explains your high Ti instead of Se.We're also feelsIt is mostly about Socionics.

Apparently our 5th and 6th functions are also fairly strong.(Fe and Ni for INFP's) but they are mostly under-utilized because they are seen as trivial by the user and our natural stack functions are preferred. 

Basically Socionics tell you 1,2,5,6 are strong functions. Though 5 and 6 are underutilized. INFP's prefer using Fi instead of Fe and mostly find using Fe shallow and boring as to us it only scratches the surface of interpersonal relationships. Ne is preferred over Ni because the commitment to a single possibility is less attractive than thinking of all other possible ones.

3,4,7,8 are weak ones with 7(Se in INFP) is the point of least resistance(Polr), the function you're most terrible at.

edit: Also see, we have either Ni or Fe Polr here, but that in my opinion is kind of the test deviating.Feels are inside. I can feelOh man if I meet a Ne-polr I'm gonna feel so bad for them.Your first thing is Ego block, you listed it twice. Other than that, pretty good and to the point explanation.Socionics, but it shouldn't be this high compared to Ne. Oh yeah, remember reading that it has strength comparable to Leading Function. Maybe OP just has weak Ne.It was part of the N roast by an ENTJ.

The INFP part was really short, only a "I don't need to roast u guys because you do a fine job at it in /r/INFP"Well, it isn't exactly my voice but it also isn't a voice I'd call different than my own.

I think I can change the voice if I tried hard enough but it takes concious effort.I really don't know any INFP's irl. The people over at /r/infp strike me as pretty chill people. You know they have their own baggage and sometimes they(also me) get too caught up in it but sometimes, in the middle of that depressive stuff, you find really supportive people, who know what it is like to be in your shoes, willing to help in whatever way they can with your journey. To me, that is beautiful.

I don't really appreciate poetry though so that sucks.Your part on INFP's was pretty solid.www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5q0e5j/time_to_roast_some_good_ol_fashioned_intuitives/?ref=search_posts&gt; INFP: Corgi

I love you for this

On the point of stereotypes, On a scale from 9-10, how much do memes matter to you?

Alright a real question as well. What gets you nerded out? You know that subject that you start going on and on but you can read the passion for it from your eyes.&gt;psyho tricks like nodding three times

elaborate?I didn't really keep a diary. Most of my emotional turmoil just repeated itself in my mind, a diary would have been useful. Started to write into a journal email account/notebook whenever I felt like I wanted to express myself was pretty recent though.&gt;being an INTJ means I have to be some awkward creep that has nothing interesting to provide to the conversation.

no no no you need to be a complete edgelord and refer to yourself as "The Mastermind" at all times.I shift back and forth between no-nonsense -TJ types and soft-spoken and kinda timid NF typesThe strength order is nothing like that. In INFP's it goes something like

Fi-Ni(though not preferred)-Ne-Fe-Si-Ti(again not really preferred)-Te-Se(POLR)what makes you say that? Curious on your insight on the things.Order according to what?Pretty much yeah. Socionics divides your functions into 4 blocks(Ego-SuperEgo-Id-SuperId). 

Ego is Strong and Preferred(Dominant and Aux Function). 

Super Ego is Weak and not preferred. Your polr(point of least resistance) is in there. 

Super-Id is weak but kinda preferred(Your inferior is called dual-seeking in Socionics and it says you are prone to be attracted to the character it symbolizes. In my experience, being attracted to strong-willed go getters). 

Id contains pretty strong functions, but their usage are not preferred over the more comfortable Dominant and Aux functions. Demonstrating function(Your 6th function) is actually told to be comparable to Dominant function strength however its usage is seen as something so trivial by the user, it doesn't get much preference. and sometimes mocked.I've heard of people "not being able to follow" Ne users on their trains of thought. I don't know though, depends on the individual.Sometimes my train moves into the station of "How did I get here". I can track it halfway back most of the time and then get distracted.You are dankI'm relieved the INFP didn't die in the fireThe moment INFP wandered in the forest I thought

"Wait! Is INFP coming back to find everyone else dead?"

Pretty great story overallENTJ's are well known for their love of pointless time-wasting endeavours yes.With that STJ count nothing will get done!Oh so much unhealthy competition will ensue though.Mine is Retentive Hysteric at 75% and This at 73%. Checking which one applies.

Retentive hysteric ayyRetentive Hysteric as well. I don't know if I'm stiff and affectively constricted but I'd love one of those NTJ girlsENTJ's also can show "My way or the highway attitude" It is immature behaviour on both types to be honest. Every type has their own sets of weaknesses and strengths.Yeah... no, there is no relation between N-S and intelligence.&gt; P.S. from some reason I naturally wrote the perception functions as E-&gt;I but judgement functions as I-&gt;E.

Probably based on your own stackyou wanna fight against the machine broINFJ vs INFP is pretty tricky in my opinion. They are all different functions yes but they can manifest pretty similarly.

My main starting point was Ne vs Ni and that sometimes puts me at ease.

also you'd have strong Fi and Ne as well just not preferred.Tears don't make good lubeHappens in most daydreaming sessions to me. It's fine thoughThat book looks like a good read.Little bit digging and found this.

https://tr.scribd.com/doc/19079731/Myers-Briggs-Type-Descriptions-MBTIYou might be a logical INFP. They exist.

Ti or Fi, pick your poison.

When you make decisions, what comes first? Your personal feelings, your wants and passions? &gt; this is what i'm already feeling

I'm guessing this one is it. That person had an experience that made them feel this way. They don't necessarily want help they just felt like getting it out there because that's how some people deal with that. I mostly prefer more anonymous means like reddit and private journals.&gt; Fi likes Te, Ti likes Fe

Your inferior is called the "Dual Seeking" in socionics. It is something we value in others.Oh damn I ate the heads first as well. But never had that concious thought.

Maybe I thought if I ate the heads they'd no longer be animals? Can't really remember my thought process as it was really fuzzy. Might just think it was tastier that way.The functions are the same, though I don't like reading the type descriptions from socionics(they portray EII-INFj-INFP as some sort of messiah that will serve as humanity's moral compass) the do show great insight on functions and stuff. I mostly read about each function and what they do on their positions.Oh the good old gripI'm a Fi-dom though I've wondered about being INFJ-ISFP-INTP-ISTJ many times so that tells something. 

Fi isn't some concrete identity in my opinion, and more of a you being tuned into your internal state of being. It is not going to tell you what your identity is, it definitely is not this concrete sets of "values" everyone is talking about. People change, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.

Fi definitely helps with self-discovery but it is not a sure way of knowing who you are. I don't know many ISFP's or INFP's in real life but most INFP's I've seen(me included) are always searching. Searching for meaning in their lives, searching for their place in the world. It is ok not to know. For me, it is what the journey is about and not knowing is part of the fun.

Don't mistake what I said with having no sense of self though. How you feel about things(not necessarily emotions) is the staple of Fi and helps with a lot of things.INFP here, my favourite heroes are either characterwise or gameplaywise

Widowmaker, Mercy, Lucio, Zenyatta, Roadhog and Pharah(Because Rockets).

I don't like that question because it assumes that one would consider being a machete person, ugh! crossbows all the way.

Though reloading is basically your pants being down time so you might need some extra defense. Maybe put a blade under the xbowI thought of it as a blade under the whole thing so you can slam it on zombies but it's easy cutting yourself with it. Using it as a stab weapon sounds better as when you're reloading you can poke the zombies with it yelling "Don't bother me"

Sniping stuff is pretty fun and simple. Getting up close can easily turn bad if you are too recklessEXACTLY

I don't mind, but it is something other than my natural state that I have to keep up conciously. At one point I'm gonna get tired.I'm wondering about making it retractable/having a slot for the blade that I can put it when I'm not in combat. Makes the wood less durable though and can cause trouble.Slashing is half the fun though, and against zombies you're going to need it to dismember. Though the wide bayonet can work for that. I can rub some mud on it if no other camo is possible too.While it'd be easy to say I'd want to be an ESTJ/ENTJ so I'd actually get some shit done, I wouldn't like that. I require more chill in my life. For me it's a stroll, not a sprint.

Being an INFJ would be pretty great though. I've kinda wondered at the back of my head if I was an INFJ and INFP and it would be pretty neat to see the other side of the fence.sx/so for sureExFP in my opinion, ENFP based on your walls(?)That seems like a high-Te thing.This might be the most INTJ comment I read today.Keep in mind that an INTJ is bound to have strong Ti and Ne but they are not preferred. Demonstrating and Ignoring functions.They'd probably be the hostage.Oh god I hate it when people try to "spare my feelings". My feelings will survive, I've done worse to myself by myself. I'd rather be broken that time rather than worry weeks about whether something is wrong.Also add not acting like an edgelord for one moment to the listI have some acquaintances but they're not necessarily considered friends. People I'm close enough to call good friends are about 5-6 people. I don't know how to actually describe a sunrise to be honest. One moment you have darkness, the night and the next, all these colors pop up, sun slowly rises. You know it won't last long and only takes a couple moments to miss it so you just have to witness it. I'm not really good on fashion though I don't think I'll tell someone their outfit is unflattering unless they're a friend and it is extremely bad. In that case I'd probably ask them "why are you wearing that?" but this would be really rare. I'm more late than any other ones.The science behind them as in the earth turns around and you can see the sun or the science of how it looks that amazing?INFP actually but good tryOverbearing thing actually was the main reason I've been hard on ENFJ's for a while on this sub. However another INFP's with ENFJ friends also reminded me of the other side of the medallion, being very loving, friendly and cuddly. You guys are great.I think a logical INFP(or any high Fi user) would be able to adapt some of their values for logical stuff, so it makes sense. However this is not really easily done for them(at least I imagine it would be in my case, I really resist to internalising stuff I don't like even though it is the logical discourse)

However the way you worded your post, your goal is logical consistency. You strive for it and are willing to overlook your morals for it. I'd say a definite Ti.If I had fire you bet I'd be staring at it for a long timeAlso pretty good at giving the good old Ni some practice.ENTP's aren't that rare but they're always played as this Chaotic Neutral caricature a la DeadpoolCompared to inxp,  not much so. Funny because according to socionics, ESFJ is your ideal match. Going by Socionics again, your most terrible match is actually an ESFP as you have no common functions and they have your POLR as dom.
Weren't people calling you INFP in another thread?You are kinda snappy so I can see where the ISxP is coming from. INFP, not so much though.Well, the basis of that is we are admire people who excel at the qualities we are deficient at. INFP's have Te as their inferior, and I do admit I'm really impressed with effective people who can get out there and do the shit. It is actually how I got over my INFP vs INFJ thing(Would I be drawn to a ESTJ or an ESTP more?). However I don't think it reflects an ideal relationship. I'm pretty sure I'd get along better with an NF or NTP type in a continued relationship. 

Do remember MBTI and Socionics are still a model. An attempt to reflect reality while not being actually real. Relationships do not count on personality types though they might be somewhat affected.No you guys like memes.I kinda see the dual type things point to be honest. I admire Strong-willed people who can assert themselves and are logical so basically strong Te users. However this doesn't mean they are a good match for me or I'd want to be in a relationship with them. I like NF types in relationship for the most part.That looks like Ti to me.Mostly messy, sometimes I tidy up though.&gt;There is that theory that intuitive types are portrayed better, more intelligent and deep so people are biased want to be intuitives

Doesnt help that the N/S questions are like

Can you think about stuff? If yes you get intuitive points.So body image issues?

I don't think they're that related to type but INFP's are the type with most common depression symptoms I think.Wow. When I saw the questions they were mostly "Do you want to be creative or do you want to do what everyone else wants to do" And it felt really odd as to why anyone would pick the "beaten path"When you said strong Te for a second I thought you were going to offer pulling me out of my head. Yours is such a tasty offer.Can say the amazing part about ENFP's as well. One of my best friends during high school was an ENFP and she was amazing. Free spirit, really fun, very easy to talk to and we met up after a couple years and she was still amazing though somewhat stressed. Shame she never was single though.This is actually a pretty good point. To me, creativity and originality is really important and I want to embody that if I can help it. So when I see those questions, I mostly prefer to go for that answer and mainly thought that was how people wanted to see themselves like that. 

In doing that I think I forgot to look for their perspective. As you said, the "sensor answers" also have their audience. They are a lot more reliable. Also your problem with the Bruce Lee quote applies to me as well. My life is full of half-explored hobbies and I know I can benefit from the "get shit done-iness" of Te and Si. Though I do love my Fi and Ne.I've got slytherin which is my least favourite house.I don't think that is specific to INFJ.

INFP's are described as these compassionate gentle spirits who can see all perspectives and judge no one, who can care so much for people and causes they believe in. Which is pretty great but they can also have really negative shit going on. Passive aggression, manipulative behaviour and a lot of vindictive stuff.

Each type is capablew of a lot of good and a lot of bad. Some descriptions tell you only the good but in depth ones make sure to tell the bad as well.&gt; Hating sudden noises is a good marker of low stack Se.

You got any of these for low Si and Te?Seems about right. Especially the part about anger.Doesn't change them though. Changes the PolR and stuff sure.What I meant was INFP and ENFP have the same set of strong/weak functions so it might be difficult to differentiate between the two.Pottermore placed me at Slytherin though I really prefer Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw, in no particular order.I get that. It's not about whatever message you're trying to convey with your clothing. It's not about the expression but it is about your connection to that particular piece. I have that with some of my clothes, especially sweatshirts and hoodies.IxFJ in my opinion, leaning towards ISFJ though I couldn't differentiate between Si/Ne and Ni/Se clearly so not going to say that one for sure. I spotted Fe for certain though.In my opinion, the aux function plays a huge role in how the dominant is expressed. For ISFP's their Fi, that sense of individuality and intense emotional depth is expressed with more tangible things. For example their appearance. That's why the goth stuff comes up, because that image, their clothes is a way for ISFP's to express their identity. 

Of course they aren't all goths, of course not all INFP's write poems and make flower crowns.I can make decisions based on my emotions and I will damnit!

My core values are making decisions with my emotions.Basically judging cognitive functions. High Fi and Fe would be more influenced by the values they hold in their decisions while high Ti and Te users will be influenced more by logic. Doesn't mean they can't make decisions reliant on the other though. INFP's can make logical decisions using their Te but most of the time, Fi does the trick and Te wouldn't be necessary.Umm, I think the strength order was more like 1-6-2-5-8-3-4-7 but I like having strong Ti better than strong Fe so I'll bite.Socionics defines 1 2 5 6 as strong and 3 4 7 8 as weak functions though. However I'd say 8 is more preferred than 5But you two can be truly happy in a perfect fairy tale relationship in your head with a personality you can project onto her.

We gotta stay inside our heads.How do you simulate Se?That crosses out INTP for me.Of course it's INFP's, we're a FiNe SiTeProbably happened with horoscope, probably happened with MBTI.Ur an esfj I don't want a housewife kthxbaiSo.. for me that means shutting up my internal voice and seeing everything for what it is rather than I don't know, other interpretations?

Don't think I'm even able to do that Oh Ms. Heidi has the best clues.See, your Ni is too focused and my Ne allows me to experience the world more fully.

I stare at a spot until I realize I'm staring and then shake my head and stare at a different spot.&gt; imposter syndrome

How did you know?So.. just tumblr?They are your conflict type with your PolR as their dom and all your shadow functions on their stack.This can cause a lot of issues between INFPxENTJ couples to be honest.Scientifically proven and based on  anything are not the same thing.Going on socionics, how does the "mobilizing function" of INFP and INTP factor into them being comfort seeking?&gt; The problems come in when he comes into the MBTI subreddit and talk Socionics shit.

You know this sub mainly adopts a lot of socionics ideas. The descriptions at the sidebar are taken from a socionics site.Oh wait it's a literal doorslam.

ESTP brother sounds tough.They were talking about the "INFJ doorslam" which is basically cutting someone out of your life instantly in a spectacular firework show.

Though every type can cut people off, this doorslam is special to us due to the stuff stated by the top comment, absence of communication until the volcano erupts.You forgot "Down to earth" which I see in almost every description.&gt; For IxFPs you are insecure of giving facts and being competent so you create your own "facts" and try to look smart

This is part of the reason why I always say "I think" or "should be". I'm never sure I know something correctly so trying to play that off.Demonstrative Ni shows, also weak/non-valued Fe.

I'd say INxP though I haven't really watched the whole thing.I don't know why but I thought of Fe in this question. Makes little sense but still.I'm pretty shitty at crying. Especially watching emotional scenes in movies/shows I get really emotional, tear up but never been able to get a good cry going since like 2000 when I saw that Pokémon movie.

Edit: cried at a futurama episode. Not sobbing but it's alrightMine is closer to the INFJ so that scares me a little. But yeah, that lightbulb is not getting changed.For INTJ Ti is a lot stronger than their Fi but Te and Fi is preferred in useOh great, you awakened my April Ryan salt again. I always saw her as an xNFP but couldn't pin down the orientation. She was this soul who felt lost in this wide world, found a sense of destiny she was uneasy with but went with it anyway.

Then she was cheated away from it. She has nothing left. She was such an amazing character to me and  - SPOILERS - it sucks we don't get her in the third game - SPOILERS - now I think she's an INFP.Did you finish the second game? She was one of my favourite game characters in the world and I also really wanted her to explore her Dragon origins so she could feel like she belonged.Chapters tie a lot of stuff up so İ recommend playing it whenever you get a chance. Also a lot of mind blowing stuff.That looks like a Si flagI'd say ben wyatt is an INTP with strong SiSo basically this is rather EII vs ESI?Her book on INFP's is also pretty well received by INFP's&gt; INFP: Fi – Ne – Si – Te - Rogue/Wanderer type. Possibly with the help of some magic-over-emotions. Solitary, depends primarily on self and a variety of skills. May use these skills to see and manipulate the interactions in the environment to achieve their goals. Good survival skills if they take to the road or nature. Naturally become disciplined over time. Uses small tools and implements to aid in tasks.

Sounds like Arcane Trickster with focus to Enchantment to me!My favourite one of those was when it was suggested that Zooey Deschanel couldn't be an INTP because she probably likes sunshine and vintage shoppingFrom what I've read, this sounds like anxiety. Trying meditation can help. Look into mindfulness.Happens more than I'd like to admit./r/CannotWatchScottsTots/Oh my god I can't believe people think all INFP's just have access to this feeling chi.

I prefer feeling voodoo&gt;Fi fits me to a T

missed a great opportunity for a pun there. Also your whole expression is really relatable to me especially 

&gt; I really hate generalized normative statements like "real men do _____" or social obligation/norms.

part. Mercy/Zenyatta/Lucio/Roadhog/Pharah for me. Though mainly Mercy and Zenyatta.Sometimes I hate myself for a lot of things. For not being a certain other way, not being more effective, not doing more, not seizing enough opportunities, for being cowardly etc. I've though that being some other way would have made my life tons of times easier for sure.

The certain thing however is that I wouldn't trade being me to any other thing.Absolutely normal. Daydreaming is not type exclusive.

Stealibg Sci-FiEither ESTP(conflict type) or ESTJ(Dual). Either way, they can take care of themselves.

Oh guys, do build a bunker with all the food and entertainment and such that'll last me for life there. Yes I mean books too. Also if you do find out how to be immortal, do let me know.INFP might. I sometimes say it.

edit: oh wait /u/ThePerfectBuzz mentioned me. Let me elaborate a little then. Inferior Te mostly keeps us unproductive enough to get our shit together and keep us frustrated about it while PolR Se also has its effects but it is unvalued.

Of course an INFP can develop their Te enough to get their shit together and make the impact they want to on the world, which is a wonderful thing alltogetherhttp://personality-testing.info/tests/O4TS/results.php?C=2&amp;P=3.9&amp;M=3.1&amp;S=2.4

HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF FOR THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SADOH WAIT!

I thought OP meant the transmission was going to be manual.And intuitives get it bad enough from you I suppose, keep on dealing what you're dealing&gt; INFPs are capable of selfish destructiveness (I knew one who regularly drove while intoxicated because “I’m a good drunk driver”).

Also this guy was definitely an ISFP because "driving"I think he meant it as FP's + IXTP's&gt; speculating alternative scenarios and how that might change the judgments, etc.

This is something I noticed a lot in my thoughts. Ne keeping me from jumping to conclusions. When I'm about to get mad at someone for something Ne pops up and speculates about why they could've done that.There are some yes. Certain MBTI types tend to be at certain Enneagram types. 

INFP's are commonly type 9's and 4's.Bouncing off the black mage is what makes me like rainbow road as well. They're pretty creative​ in that manner.It's basically a giant canvas where everyone gets one pixel at a time. Allowed for a lot of groups and cults to happen.Yeah, it is pretty establihed that the internet is a "INXX" biased medium.\\&gt;Thus, an INFP you've just met may come off at first as an INTP until they are comfortable and they drop the Ti act.

Explains brittaPandeistic INFPThey share zero functions keep in mind. Stress makes you turn to your Inferior most of the time, which would be ISTJ. ENFP does have strong Fe due to its demonstrative function but I don't think an ENFP Hitler would've used it as much.efficiency/productivity is a pretty Te thing. I'd say ENFJ because you have high-Ne as demonstrative function but the difference between Ti-Se is a lot more pronounced than that so INFJ&gt;illogical

Ti is basically internal logic. While it might not make sense to the outsider, the main thing of it is basically "Does this make sense to me"Careful not to get addicted :D It's a slippery slopeI've got "The Fool" with "The Priestess" as a close second.

The concept of "Jack of all trades" resonate with me a lot so can't complain.I actually like People-watching as well but haven't found a good spot for a long time. Also agree on the meddling part but it can sometimes backfire. What I see as giving the other person space to breathe after being told they need some, it can be read as apathy due to unclear communication. Sucks when it happens.

&gt;I've read that Fi types empathize by putting themselves in other people's shoes, thereby generalizing their theory of self into theory of mind. Their ability to do so is limited by how well they can relate to the other person's position, but can lead to greater insight than Fe's more superficial approach. Is this correct? :)

On this, I think I can share my brand of empathy. I used to think I had a "Fe" approach to it where I simply felt what they were feeling and went off that. Analyzing it further however, I was just oversimplifying my own experience. What I did was basically internalizing their emotions while also trying to get into their mindset. It is less like "What if this happened to me" and more "What if I was them when this happened to me". However, as you said, the less I know/relate to the person, the closer I get to the former statement as I have less of an idea about their experience of being them.They are defined that way though. Primary function is defined as the strongest and most preferred function you have. If your auxiliary function is stronger and more preferred, that is not an exception, that is your dominant function.Exactly, I can't know the full experience of being that person without actually being them. If not understood, this shortcoming can cause a lot of communication issues.Healthy Fi doesn't necessarily have values that align with society.

Healthy Fi realises that their values are personal and not universal and the other people having theirdifferent views doesn't make them hitlerso.. XNFP's?

I'd say depression for the I, golden retrieverness for the E.Be nice to your PoLR'sENTP is literally called the "Debater" and Ne loves going for multiple perspectives and looking for different ways to strike while Ti gets a good logic exercise. Lower Fe governed by Ti likes seeing people gets flustered too I guess.So basically dealing with cognitive dissonance by altering its perception?April Ryan from Dreamfall is one of my favourite characters and I get the feeling she's INFP.

April Ludgate from Parks and Rec too also INFP(though that is debated on) I guess. Starting to see a pattern here, let me check out April from TMNT.It is pretty debated yeah. For her Fi vs Fe is pretty obvious but I can't tell out Se vs Ne as I'm not that familiar with what Se does(and a lot of descriptions give me the impression it's pretty similar with Te for some reason).

I have however heard that ISFP's use their Se(clothing,hair physical aspects they can control) as an expression of their identity. Don't know how much that applies to April though.Pretty Fine yeah.Actually, I'd go for INFJ. I'm curious how the other side of the mirror seems. We both value different functions but they manifest similarly and it is pretty interesting. I wanna see how a life full of Ni and Fe is instead of Fi and Ne. Though I love my FiINFP and 459/945 so seconding that.I'd change honest there with "frank"&gt; Stop talking about shit nobody cares about

Jokes on you because I never start because who would care ^^^^except ^^^^meDoesn't that essentially mean "I'm not sorry for what I did and my actions are not at fault, but your reactions are"Why is my inner monologue talking to you?The one that stung to me the most was from my then-bestfriend about how I "didn't care". Don't say that to an ENFP.I'd ask for an example on the inferior Te thing but I think I do that enough to myself at times. Oh I'm definitely not considering reading at coffee shops definitely not.Fe is not exactly about fitting in but more about what you're tuned with. Fe is more aware of the whole the things around them while Fi is more aware of the self and the individuals.&gt; conquer without having to change.

+1Makes sense, I can always look at my Ti and try to improve it to work better with my Ne. But I don't think it will ever be prioritised.INFP 10/10 accurate.

Best description of Fi I've seen so far.Nope.. 16personalities is basically the first test a lot of people find and dichotomy based.I don't know this seems legit guys

https://i.imgur.com/gjIkKAc.pngThat's kinda the Socionics way. L is for Logical, E is for Ethical and Extrotim, I is for Intuition and introtim.

Your first two letters are first two functions and the third letter is your orientation.

EII is Ethical Intuitive Introvert, Fi NeI thought the same thing about myself for a whileI kind of felt drawn to the void, their antagonistic nature distorts and manipulates what is already there. They also look like a spreading alien growth which is pretty cool.

edit: /r/place because the bot reminded me
"Weapons Skill: Psychic fury cuddling"

kYeah, I guess. The came from the races being already described with personalities.You're the most aware of your second function.It was discused somewhere(source 5/7), that your 1st function is the one most natural to you, and you don't really pay bigger attention to it most of the time. And you may feel like you are using your 2nd function the most, even though the 1st one is the one most important. It makes sense at least for me.Eren.
Yup.EMBRACE THE MOE  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ✧Hell. I'm pretty sure that Andrzej Sapkowski is an ISTJ. CD Project Red have kept the vibe of the core.INFP. Pretending nothing happened. Thank you/Fuck you BYE

At least I don't live in the US. I'm at least happy that all this bullshit is over for a while.That was pretty much my idea of a INFP class too. Kind of a wandering healer/druid. Something like a Mage Ronin sounds good, preferably with a bunch of non-lethal KO spells up his sleeve.Aw man, This guy is growing FAST. We are already typing him?[Vsauce did a thing about that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM)I'm about to finish the first book right now. Funny seeing people typing him right now. But yeah, he seems more like a Ti user.According to the databank Reddit is ENTP, Instagram is ISFP, Snapchat is ESFP, Facebook is ESFJ, and Tumblr is INFP.INTP has almost 30 000.INTPboooooooFUCK.

THAT.My mom and aunt are twins and ISTJs.I wouldn't be surprised if it was statistically harder to stay sane as a Ne user.&gt; robots

ISTJI bet dogs are ESFPs or ESFJs.The protagonist of Mob Psycho is probably the most likable fictional INFP I know :P...Unless that's the case. :P 

I have always heard about ISFJ being the second option, but ISTJ makes a lot of sense for him, yeah. Been a while since I watched it, but I don't remember seeing much Ne in him. Si, on the other hand, is quite strong.

I wonder why I never though of that. Maybe that's because people were talking either about INFP or INTP or ISFJ.&gt; Fe: Fuck me, police

hmmoofDamn. This guy is good.I will use this to explain mbti from now on.That's more ENFJ than ENFP.[Writing Area](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Writing_Area)

I've obviously been wondering about their MBTI types, but I don't seem to have a clear idea o their types, which is kind of embarassing seeing how I've been watching them for like, 3 years now. Still, it's not like we ever see them talk about philosophy or something.

Well, the N vs. S distinction is kinda hard on me, and I don't want to go with "They are all N's because they're nerds" answer :P

Anyone got any ideas? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSkevM8zRpAWhenever someone have a problem with it quickly becomes obvious that they did not research much about it.

If someone had a problem with the way MBTI actually works I would get it, but I don't recall I've ever seeing such criticism anywhere. Instead I see it get compared to horoscopes by people who don't even know about the cognitive functions.

There's obviously a problem with how MBTI is presented to people. Is it because of the tests? Is it because people who use it are fucking weirdos? :PThey seem unable to admit they are arguing from their own morality.

There's this famous Te boi called Ben Shapiro who's being promoted as a debater who utilizes cold hard facts and logic, starting the meme that I love so much.

He's been bashed for the fact that despite his claims, his argument are attempts to desperately rationalize his subjective opinions. His views come first, reasons why those views should be shared by everyone are added second.

I also quite recently argued with someone who claimed to be an ENTP online about a topic I won't mention here because I don't wanna start an unrelated shitstorm, but the gist of it was that she claimed that people who do X are evil because she wouldn't do what they were doing. 

I mentioned that that is a valid viewpoint and all, but not everyone feels that way and it's not an explanation for why others should too. Aaaand then she proceded to claim that her opinion is commonly shared and "everyone can agree with that" when, obviously, there's an entire community of people who don't. 

This whole method is really silly to me because I believe that arguments made from personal, subjective morality are completely valid.

"I don't like it" Is a legitimate and respectable argument to me. And the whole effort they spent to conceal that comes off as incredibly silly to me, when I believe that we should just make the effort to respect our inherent differences in worldview.

What do you guys think? Am I just wrong and misreading it? Are there some ways I could make thinkers comfortable with their morals while arguing? I really want to hear your opinions on this one.I think this may be why I like Enneagram more than MBTI.

Enneagram community is more about encouraging self improvement than it ever was about dick sucking."Comment"I think those pieces are too vague to align with any of the types. I like them though.Yeah. It definitely wasn't about intent.FPs probablyIt appears that a relation between ones type and the look in their eyes exists. We don't know enough about it for any practical use, but it's neat as hell.When I listen to podcasts I always play a video game, because I won't be focused on any of these things alone. Doing two things at once will keep me engaged in what I'm doing.That data comes from online tests I believe, so it has to be inaccurate.10/10

And thats not good since my favourite games usually have a lot of crap to manage.Stardew Valley is boring as shit :IOblivion and Skyrim handle progression in such terrible ways.How are even still alive?We can't be.

My only nemesisMost INFP  thing I've seen today.You're a hero alrightI like Corona virus is known just as well as China virus now.Fi is an analytical function.*thought lelThis is spot on.aww fuckI'm getting Harry from Kingsman vibes here. A hero who thought classy villains here cool when he was a kid.YOU'VE BEEN HIT BY

YOU'VE BEEN STRUCK BY

A SMOOTH CRIMINALAll these sky pics make me wonder just how many mistyped ISFPs there are on r/infpI'd like to point out that different enneagram types can make those results different.

As a Fi dom enneagram 9 Im very likely to compromise in order to get along with others and avoid conflict. I only do that with things I don't feel about strongly of course.

It's a nature vs nurture thing.Personally I'd say Hogwarts houses are closer to enneagram tha MBTI .Nah, we all know sensors don't exist. ^At ^least ^that's ^what ^this ^sub ^seems ^to ^suggest...This is pretty damn hilarious.Online studying turned out to be a huge struggle for me...The worst thing is that people assume that 16 is MBTI, and then project 16p's faults on MBTI...This is because we love being sad.*Fi still can't say anything.*

OOOFWe may not realize we are angry. INFPs tend bottle anger up inside - Inferior Te. That's why we're often 9's in Enneagram.I'm seeing a lot of confusion here. I'd like to point out that opposite cognitive functions aren't exclusive, you can use both Fi and Fe in abundance. 

Figuring out your functions positions in the stack is trickier than just figuring wich ones you use.You guys are getting appreciated?Watch Kingsman.Schoolgirls are the supreme form of personality personification.I think Fi users are much more bothered by those things than other types.Almost as if they were similar types hmm...Pretty sure that's more ESFP, the full Shonen protagonist package.&gt; Ah fuck it, I guess this is enneagram.Do you guys even know what Fi is?Nah, but it's fun.He's like, three people at best.I think you inspired me to make a post like that for ESTJs , cause they sure as hell deserve it.

Especially since recently I watched Beastars that has a very healthy ESTJ acting as a mentor for the INFP protagonist.Eh, I like a bit of racist humor too. I mostly treat it as making fun out of racist stereotypes.As always this sub forgets that sensors exist.What a fucking gamer wow :DISFP is supposed to be the ENTJ's hidden self.Bro, learn more about MBTI. Mainly, I think you should talk more often to the types you don't understand.

As an INFP, Te is a vital and ever-present part of my thought process. I wouldn't be very surprised if you knew an INFP in your workplace or whatever, but mistyped them as an ISTJ, just because they use Te and Si often in a professional environment.

For example, your comment technically should offend me as a Fi dom no matter what, but it's just so goddamn wrong and out of touch (Te) that I can only be amused. 

MBTI isn't about skill, it's about preference.It makes a lot of sense tbh. His description made me like warlocks.Please stop jacking off to Keanu# We don't need convincing dammit!I recently dropped out of my programming college, only to find out that when I learn programming by myself I do it at a much faster rate..."So you hate her for &lt;Insert a slew of things the previous person never mentioned and provide no context&gt;?"Y'all must have never seen a thinker use mental gymnastics to try and justify their feelings.

Thinkers can be extremely dumb about their feelings and it's noticeable if you argue with them enough.My dad is an ESFP, this is more accurate than you might think.

He was always the one to encourage me to go to parties. He was even surprised I wasn't interested in drinking when I was underage.

His perception is quite unsurprising seeing how I've been alone to two parties for my whole teenage life, only because those parties were my best friends birthdays,  while there are old pictures of my dad at parties, drunk, shirtless, wearing a goddamn Elvis haircut.    &gt;:([FRANKLY I FIND THE IDEA OF A FEELER THAT THINKS OFFENSIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKk4Cq56d1Y)I have a love/hate relationship with debating since I believe it's important to challenge your beliefs and learn about different points of view. Don't do echo chambers kids.

H o l y s h i t t h o u g h can it be exhausting.

Especially when I get downvoted to shit, like, why do you people hate me ＞﹏＜Fi can also be bad at that. 

"If this kind of humor doesn't offend me, others won't be offended either, right?"About as accurate as 16p. Nice job.Eyy, INFP 9 here. I always vibed with the design of Canada from Hetalia.Did you just replace "gay" with "xNFx"?

I was pleasantly surprised.NTPs seem to both be vague references to adventure games.

INFP is def a Little Prince reference.
INFP. Against Brexit. If there were good reasons for doing so, why did the Leave campaign run on a series of promises (250 million pounds for NHS, we'll cut immigration) and then immediately back off those claims once they won?The same reasoning applies before the vote; prior to the vote, I was deeply skeptical of the claims the Leave campaign was making regarding immigration and the proposed savings. The statements made by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson after the vote suggest that this skepticism was well-founded.The EU wasn't created out of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, though. From the same Wikipedia page: 

&gt;The Treaty was signed on 29 October 2004 by representatives of the then 25 member states of the European Union. It was later ratified by 18 member states, which included referendums endorsing it in Spain and Luxembourg. However the rejection of the document by French and Dutch voters in May and June 2005 **brought the ratification process to an end.** Following a period of reflection, the Treaty of Lisbon was created to replace the Constitutional Treaty. This contained many of the changes that were originally placed in the Constitutional Treaty but was formulated as amendments to the existing treaties.

The actual constitution for the EU is covered by a different treaty: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_the_European_UnionYes, I understand that. Thanks for asking :DIt's amusing, then, that they would implicitly acknowledge that while they might be the most important thing in the world (being the King), their introverted counterparts (as Queen) are more capable, powerful, and overall have much more impact on how you develop your board.Here's what I find valuable about it:

Even if it's completely wrong and there are five personalities, or sixty personalities, or 1 billion personalities . . . reading about MBTI has helped me understand that not everyone thinks like I do. It sounds so obvious and yet, it's very hard for me to not assume that I'm completely average and that everyone thinks and reacts to things the same way as me. It's helped me be much more patient with people who are very different from me in personality.

Being able to have a model that explains how two different people can react differently to the same stimuli feels very valuable, even if its core assumptions are flawed.
INFP: I enjoy a lot of meaningful lyrics, more mellowed out tendency, melancholic beats. But I also enjoy, depending on the song, higher more energetic pacing, but still at its core meaningful thought provoking lyrics. I enjoy David Bowie, Jeff Buckley, The Smiths, &amp; Joy Division just to name a few.I spend wayyy too much free time studying functions, and MBTI in general in a self-analyzing way not to be sure. Definitely INFP. On a side note, you get little moments of realization when characters you admire from books or film, and that you relate to end up being your type... something clicks.I think any type can be bad at P.E., though according to MBTI, specific types may be more endowed with a kinesthetic sense that help with athletics compared to others. I am INFP myself and I did sports in H.S. and did well in P.E. as well.  Edit: On a side note, I guess what fascinates me most is the way I would approach athletics, and how my method with my functions contrast to those of other types. For example, I find myself using a lot of extraverted thinking when it came to sports as well as my extraverted intuition, so that my movements though influenced by practice were also more planned than I’d say a sensor would have been. This in turn would ultimately be what would be perceived as the “bad” at sports, or at least less adept than sensor types in my opinion.
if you are questioning what it means for something to be abstract in general then pretty much every function is abstract in one way or another. However, in terms of how it's used in MBTI it is specifically referring to abstractions from sensual/physical reality. so yes, Nx functions are metaphysical in nature. Ne distorts existing frameworks through which we perceive reality to identify new ones where as Ni users build their own frameworks internally based on their perception of the general principles that govern physical reality.

Also, what's to suggest that Se is more conscious than Ni, generally? in the narrow/specific Jungian or MBTI contexts maybe but generally, nothing suggests this. where did this assumption come from?yes that was the reason why i made the comment about what it means for something to be abstract--definitions vary with perspective and personal interpretations. it's bound to happen based on the nature of what we're studying: the subject.

yes i spend much time analysing the complexities. that is exactly why i made such a general argument and i understood the point of your post. i just don't agree with some of your definitions.

it appears (though i can't be sure) that you are also making an assumption that the perception of metaphysical phenomena comes from within (hence why you my definitions of Ne point to all introverted functions), i would say that Ne users extrapolate from ideas based on existing patterns that are readily observable/available in the outside world in order to conceive of possibilities. they extrapolate "concrete" data in order to gain metaphysical understandings. this has nothing to do with "archetypes" in the way that jung describe Ni to work.

as for INXJs not disputing that Ni is unconscious or the most unconscious, i am not surprised that they don't because how would they do that? i am not surprised that they struggle to define even define Ni properly given such parameters. however (in good Ne fashion and like i think that you suggested) try and find a general relationship between the functions opposing functions e.g. Fi and Ti or Ne and Se to infer a what a possible relationship would be between Si an Ni. i've done that and it's much clearer how Ni works and there are plenty of example of conscious Ni process and no, many of the things i thought were Ne turned out to be Ne.

The following is one of the closest definitions i have seen to my own understanding of Ni and it was written by a correctly typed ENFJ:
'Introverted iNution (Ni) seeks the “models of best fit” in interpreting the world, creating and developing general models about the world and interpreting events in conjunction with these beliefs. It wants to understand what everything really means, the implicit connection between disparate events and circumstances, as well as predictions about how things are likely to unfold and develop ' ~ Tiffani Warren from Celebrity Types

infact just check out the whole article. most of the things are close enough.
http://ojjt.org/2016/07/typing-yourself-using-functions/

For the ESTP vs INFJ: more or less conscious regarding what? you said that the dominant is more conscious so if you are judging conscious based on Se then the ESTP will be more conscious of that aspect of the outside world.

INFP forum has too many SJWs. there are unwritten laws and codes defining the things that you can and can't say. it's like an invisible group think which is intellectually stifling and as a result the forums are flooded with people emoting everywhere and safe space topics rather than any serious theories, philosophies or ideas relating to the make up of the world because of the effort to sway things away from any kind of controversy. it's much better to speak to INFPs in person or small groups to engage in such things.

concerning the discussion of ideas, a hell of a lot of INFPs on the forum seem to think that anecdotal evidence is a counter argument for everything (this is more so with younger INFPs) and if you call them out on it then you become the bad guy for invalidating their experiences and perceptions. 

having said that, the thing that is most consistent within INFP forums is that everyone is accepted or at least tolerated and well looked after. anyone can go on there and get some love. there are no witch hunts like the INXJ forums. it doesn't matter whether you are a real or a fake INFP because nobody cares much as long as everyone there can relate to each other.takes 1 INXP to place the initial one and just 1 ENXP to change it because they've never been the kinds to settle on just one bright idea0 INTPs. be sure that the group will groan about the unpleasantness of such mundane tasks but they'll likely have built devices to do it for them. 

1 ENTP will try to McGuyver the dead bulb resulting in them blowing up half the ENTP population (i'm sure any ENTP has the potential to screw up that badly). However, some of the ENTPs remaining outside the blast radius might be successful

0 ISTPs because 1 will probably fix the bulb

ESXPs will probably end up hurting themselves doing stunts with the dead bulb and upload the videos to youtube with various MLG renditions. maybe a few dead ESXPs

The ENTJs will scream at the lightbulb for its lack of efficiency and then proceed to throw money at it until it changes itself or they'll get their minions to do it for them

1 INTJ might take a long time to change the light bulb after studying it and finding a way to vastly improve it.

INFPs will probably stare at the lightbulb for a while, space out for a bit and then decide that the darkness sets a way better ambiance for writing poetry

INFJs will be stuck trying to figure out a hidden meaning behind the task "what does it mean to change?"

1 XSTJ required. They'll do it the fastest and will probably be the only ones to actually change the light bulb as instructed

1 XSFJ in order to find an XSTJ to do it for them

1 ENFP. surprisingly they may be the only type of the feeler capable of completing the task. However, they require an Ipod with hardstyle and Trance tracks on shuffle. They'll likely replace the bulb with a rainbow strobe light and party with the neighborhood's single gay men who magically find themselves there.&gt;Nothing but assumptions, there is no evidence or anything that necessitates that use of Ti must repress Fe or vice versa, it's nothing but a general simplification, it's just assumed that such is the case.

i know what you're getting at and i agree. it's an attempt to reduce the degrees of freedom. This just highlights the assumptions we make to get the "best" use out of the models.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiodromia

This still does not suggest that the dominant represses the inferior in the way that something like mbti or socionics might claim. it only shows how such an idea may come about by association.He's ENFP. His production style is very Ne-like in general and it's especially apparent in his new album. There is less attention paid towards having a common cohesive structure to his overall songs and more emphasis on having a series of extremely well developed sections foremost which are later fit together in less traditional ways. Sure this is arguably what Hip Hop is about but a lot of Ne doms tend to veer towards this style of production in general. Many Ne dom musicians seem to preference loose structure or like to experiment with the structure of music in aid of exploring new potentials.

He is clearly extroverted and prefers to be socially authentic at all times which is more Fi rather than save face and play the smile and wave game. He's not grounded like an Se dom and you get more of a sense that he lives in a different world.

Simliar ENFPs in Hip Hop are Tyler the Creator, Flying Lotus and Lupe Fiasco who also have that other world quality.

XNFJs in Hip Hop: Common (INFJ), Murs (ENFJ), Macklemore (ENFJ)
&gt; Functions are about cognition, not behavior

but both are correlated so to disregard behavior so readily is to not take full advantage of the given data and create unnecessary limitations. Plus if socionics can make claims about there being a link between physical appearance and type and back that up with research, comparatively it's not such a big stretch to consider this.Shoddy? sure. https://www.quora.com/What-is-Magnus-Carlsens-MBTIHe could have used an online test for all we know. i came out as the wrong type on the first test i ever did as do many others. if it was an official test administered by a practitioner then that would be different.

&gt;Making moves based on a "feeling" instead of "thoughts" is just semantics.

How exactly can you be so sure? This is actually how feeling works. seems like he makes a lot of value judgments without consciously logically reasoning things through but the value is still subordinate to the logic.

&gt;Chess is a logic-heavy activity so he's obviously using it.

To clarify, he doesn't process the logic consciously as much, relatively speaking, relying more on the feeling of the moves. that's a quote but i can't remember the source.posting something on reddit doesn't mean that i expect the scrutiny of an academic in the related field.depends on perspective. both can be classed as sympathetic or empathetic in different contexts. Definitions is MBTI seem more like datum points, anyway.

If empathy is stepping into someone's shoes and experiencing something as if you were the other person then an Fe dom knows How they're walking following from their knowledge of how emotional sequences evolve. they later deduce the "why". whereas an Fi dom knows why they're walking following from their knowledge of the deep individual interpretations and what the emotions personally mean to the individual themselves at a given moment. they later deduce the "how". both require entering another person's world in a different way. 

Fi dom user knows the personal meaning or significance of an emotion (nuances in how they are impressed); Fe dom knows the personal manifestation of an emotion (nuances in how they are expressed).
Fe dom will be able to more quickly pick up on the general value e.g. if something makes or will make someone happy based on the manifestation. Fi dom user will more quickly pick up on the type of happiness or what that happiness means to an individual in question.

Fi dom = deep empathy for a few people

Fe dom = empathy for lots of people.

For Fe dom users, emotions have a general form/meaning.

for Fi dom users emotions only have form/meaning based on personal contexts.&gt; Fi has to search for something to relate to. "how would I feel if xxxx happened? It would be like I felt when yyyy happened. I understand now". Whereas Fe is basically "I know how that feels because.... Because."

actually, for people that an Fi dom cares about, it's more like: "how would i feel, **if i were them**, if xxxx happened?" they can momentarily detach from their own values and then they feel everything because they actually put themselves through the entire experience. However, they need more input from the person beforehand. it could have nothing to do with their personal values or anything that they've previously experienced at all. it's just that an Fi dom has more awareness of how their own values compare to someone else's which allows the Fi users to relate the two whereas Fe doms don't have so much awareness.

There are many examples which oppose what you're saying. imagine that an Fe and an Fi dom are both confronting a confirmed murderer who had a rough childhood. the Fe dom is way more likely to be able to sympathise with the murderer's childhood but is also more likely to jump to general values and damn the murderer to hell. Since murder is so far abstracted from general values they struggle to identify with the murderer at all. They just feel that the murderer is bad, ignoring the personal context in favour of the outcome. 

However, the Fi dom is more likely to try and interpret the actions based on the murderer's individual values to find out the meaning in context. They want to know more about what the murder's experience what it was like for them despite their actions and there is much more of a willingness to understand the murderer's perspective so the Fi dom is slower to arrive at a judgment. they'd be more likely ask something like this: "why are you in pain?"

which one sounds more like empathy or an attempt to empathise?



This is comparable to Ti vs Te

just because Fe users have more of an innate awareness of certain real world values, stemming straight from their subconscious and allowing them to tune into most people faster, does not mean they have greater capacity for empathy. it doesn't even mean that they're empathising or picking up on the right things at all. The Fe dom's lack of self awareness about where the feelings come from only reflects a different way of processing.

I've heard of fuzzy logic before. i'm implying that INTJ logic might be "fuzzier" but i'm assuming that you think that the links i'm making are invalid.

Thanks for the info.No, feeling is logical. i'm sure every feeler knows what you're talking about but for the sake of others, it's definitely inaccurate to say that feeling is not logical. There are many interpretations of logic but when western people think about logic they tend to think of the scientific method or objective logic. Feelers tend to see more into the objective world, attaching more quality to things than what "actually exists" (of course that is up for interpretation). The fact that it's more common for feelers to have deep sentimental attachments to certain possessions is a reflection of this.


Michael Pierce did a good video related to this but there is a lot more to it.
https://youtu.be/y3fEi1EgmQ4?t=6m52s


lets take a simple wiki definition of logic:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Logical_form

Feeling functions adhere to all the basic principles of logic in a different way. To convey the difference between thinking and feeling you could say that Ti is internal objective logic whereas Fi is internal subjective logic. Thus what feeling and thinking logically systematizes is completely different.No, they are correlated and this is clear based on observation alone. They can be (and usually are) a reflection of value for most feeling types. 

Concerning ethics and morality, there are certain times where things possess a value which is neither right or wrong. Ethics and morality are also subsets of value judgments but i understand the confusion since definitions are limited. They don't encapsulate how feeling works entirely.Feelers are generally more emotional so it is correlated (unless you are redefining what it means to be emotional).

You said that Fi tries to find universal ethical standards and that's not necessarily true. universal values is more accurate. Ethics and morality are merely tools for understanding values. They also do not necessarily create values within themselves. Some Fx users may find better tools which negates the need for finding universal ethical standards.

Ni and Fi were among the most difficult functions for Jung to understand. His definitions are close in some regards but they don't encapsulate feeling as a whole (at least not for me or other feelers that i have talked to about it in depth). I'd doubt that Ni doms would say that he nailed the Ni process either. If you're looking for accurate definitions of these two functions then it may not be adequate to rely solely on Jung as a source especially given that he expressed some uncertainties about them.&gt;The feeling you are talking "in-depth" with your friends about is the colloquial definition of feeling, not this type of feeling.

if the difference is to do with your thoughts on emotions then no i'm probably not. This statement leads to a whole host of potential problems so i'd like you to clarify what you mean by the 'colloquial definition' and what distinguishes it.

&gt;As a dominant Ti user, Jung understands that his system uses purely subjective logic to define people's motivations. There's no "Ni gene", only behaviors and reasoning that we can collectively address as Ni.

what if the collective interpretation shows Jung's interpretations to be limited? if the definitions of the functions aren't limited then the understanding of it's mechanics are.

&gt;His definition of F leaves out emotionality as a metric.

i'm not claiming that emotions are a direct measure for feeling at all; they are correlated. Therefore emotions can be used as an approximate measure.



personal desired of the heart and opportunities to have deep bonding moments with others. Next would be anything that's self-development related that aids in a search for self-discovery. These are some of the things that drive me the most in life and are of equal importance.Like many things, MBTI and the functions are more like datum points. The problem with your argument in general is that it is based on potentials rather than anything which can actually be validated which is also ironic. 

you are making statements which cannot be proven

&gt;There are realities of others' actual selves that Fi-doms simply will not see at all, or will not see accurately

to support statements which cannot be proven

&gt;This reference point means that anything that doesn't compute when run through the Fi-dom's self isn't seen/experienced accurately

how do you know that this even happens? Both arguments reference a point before any actual validation. This essentially goes nowhere. There are seeds of post-modernism and you could literally use the same principles to make an opposing argument with equal strength.

we generally derive points of reference based on what is already known and not potentials.

"The self" is to be used loosely when interpreting Fi especially given that all introverted functions are self-referential and personal. Fi is not just about one's own values; it is about personal individual values in much the same way that Ti is about personal logic. Just like Ti users are able to understand and appreciate logical systems of reasoning that differ from their own and interpret where things are headed, Fi users are good at doing the same with someone else's personal values (hence where their awareness of authenticity comes from).

if you are arguing that Fi can be removed from the true reality of things and using that to discredit any realistic labels/associations with Fi then the same also applies for every other introverted function and their labels/associations.Get off your high horse or come up with good arguments.&gt;If your perspective assists you in navigating your real life, off the internet, with actual people in your life with whom you have actual relationships. it really doesn't matter who argues what on reddit, IMO. 

To you maybe but not to me. to simply put it: bad perspectives can lead to bad manifestations.

&gt;I particularly abhor trying to have any sort of dialogue with what I experience as INFP pseudo-logic, especially in that heightened "look I am using all sorts of logical sounding words and concepts" mode.

That's an absurd interpretation of motives and very disrespectful. why argue soundly when you can go directly to personal attacks and employ fallacious reasoning? i have another logical sounding word for you; it's called "bulverism".

&gt;For me, the truth of all of this is found in its actual use in real life

I'm sure that no one else finds truth that way. say what you want about elodie123 but in this case she seems to hit the nail on the head many times.

I'm sure everyone has times where they quickly and/or harshly judge others based on some form of archetype but expressing them without actually supporting any of the claims with solid reasoning just makes you seem ignorant. it's unfair on the other person because you mark them with negativity without providing a way for them to properly understand the issues you perceive or a way that they can make adjustments. if you have these kind of unsupported interpretations it's best to keep them to yourself rather than degrade others and the quality of the conversation.

This is a much bigger waste of time, i assure you, so we should leave things off here. There is no bad blood.Current type: INFP

Extroverted type: definitely ESTP

Introverted type: ISFJi agree with much of her points and the general conclusions. there are a few things here and there that aren't quite right for me but it seems pretty sound overall.

i agree that extroverts are far deeper in many ways but i don't agree with her examples, explicitly--i could see where she was going and agree with the conclusions. i also disagree that Fe is directly like Ni or that any judging function is directly like any perceiving function but it seems like it was said more to drive a point home. i never really liked the whole "deep vs shallow" distinction, because of how it's misinterpreted and misrepresented.

i also disagree that Fe is almost as objective as Te since for me it is just as objective, in this context. if extroversion is objective then there is no reason to believe that Te is more objective unless we define thinking as objective as well which causes problems. it's clearer to define either extroversion or thinking as objective but not both. 



the rest seems pretty accurate to me but then i'm not Fe so i'm not sure about whether my own ignorance leads me to fall short of some of the nuances and intricacies of the function that the author of the post tried to convey.it's not a cognitive function thing.I am nit-picking. like i said, my disagreements were related to "a few things here and there" so peppermint-kiss is right; there is much more to the video and the certain parts which i analyse do not reflect the contents as a whole and should not be solely considered to form a general opinion.

&gt;it seems like such a bizarre thing to say.

not really. i said "in many ways" and did not say generally.

like i said: no bad blood.
i hope you did actually watch the video

you jumped the gun
this is going to go well...
hmm i suppose mine would be:

ENFP, INFP, ENFJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENTJ, INTP, INTJ, ISFJ, ISFP, ESFJ, ESFP, ESTP, ISTJ, ISTP, ESTJ

but in no particular order xD

I love you all and would happily sing kumbaya around a fire pit with each and every one of you...apart from the ESTPs...I don't want to have to run for my life because the ESTPs got bored and decided to chase the NFs with their flaming marshmallow sticks.lmao, i always knew that god was an ESTJ. If the bible isn't micro-managing, i don't know what is. It also makes the most sense that he'd give his own people the biggest hook-ups in society; Although, being made in his image i suppose we all have more than a little ESTJ inside of us, waiting to burst out like an alien spawn.It's possible that outliers exist. Jung seemed to believe that we can switch types. can you solidly justify why you think it was Ne opposed to Se or Ni or something else?

there's also things like schizophrenia.

Socionics claims that we have all 8 functions but even with that, the functions have specific roles which do not dynamically change.

I don't think that this is something which most people experience.Calm down! and you're definitely wrong!

It's clear that Jung continually developed his ideas, sometimes making many contradictions with his previous ideas as he developed more profound views later on in life. Jung actually said something which eluded to this conclusion in a popular interviews that came over a decade after psychological types--can't remember it but they talk about it here:
http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2012/02/jung-identified-himself-as-both-intp-and-istp/. However, some interpret this as Jung meaning that one's true type only becomes established later on in life which, unless Jung was an outlier, breaks away from current popular perceptions that type forms in adolescence or early adulthood. 

Edit: I actually found the video https://youtu.be/eTBs-2cloEI?t=28m

Jung also went on record saying that 'the classification of individual's means nothing, it is only instrumental' among other things which imply Jung's rejection of rigid categorizations of character and it was also strongly implied that he did not like the meyers-briggs system because it did not adequately capture the insights in his works.

also note, that in what you're quoting, he said "SOME kind of biological foundation" which is extremely important. you're assuming that the change in someone's "type" is not also a part of instinct. you are putting way too much stock into this excerpt, likely making misinterpretations and not considering other factors.
you're probably also not considering the role of the transcendent functions and other subtleties which effect distinctions of type.

do more research on his comments about psychological types, post 1946Can't make one these kinds of humorous INFP descriptions without crying in it haha. 

considering that INTJs got the lightest burn out of the intuitives it's possible. 

i'm thinking STP. i think sensors got it really light, especially the ISFJs. 

He's definitely not an ENTP. they got a burn which they can't recover from; although, ENTPs can be brutal about themselves, sometimes--whether or not it's honest or a joke. it's why i love ENTPs; they're brilliant but don't take themselves too seriously.lmao i love you guysThe MBTI part is cringe but as for all the rest i can see where the ENTP is coming from. it's not like the online dating communities aren't generally shallow, anyway. if anything, they're the worst. people read a simple profile and mostly just look at your pictures to get a grasp of who you are. it's not like in real life where at least there are some kinds of social rules or circumstances that allow people to engage and actually get to know each other a bit more, but online, you can just wipe left or click delete or not reply and most people don't care because it's far more depersonalised so one can expect far more rejection.

Online, just knowing who you are is often not enough and more is needed for someone to individuate themselves from others to seem more appealing. many people have a lower level of tolerance for common niceties, which they've already seen a million times and need something more arousing or different to keep them engaged and willing to talk. 

it seems like the ENTP understands this and is merely playing the system (how very Ti).  problems came because he told her that his message was canned and because he didn't properly convey things in the light-hearted and jokey way that he likely wanted it to be received. even though it may be an effective way of finding someone in online dating, many people will find it offensive, even though it's just a by-product of general attitudes in the communities. 

I think he's an ETP because this smells of low socionics Fi 7th function--in other words, he has a simple yet effective understanding of how the general environment works (reasonable Fe) but is not so aware of the nuance in people's individual impressions and how some people might negatively respond to what he's saying (low Fi). as a result, i'm sure that in his mind, there is no reason for her to be offended because he was probably trying to be funny and is just playing the game to get some matches or whatever, hence why he seems to be confused by the backlash.

i know that these are speculations but i don't get the some of the insults. seems like it may just be a product of misunderstandings on both ends and low social awareness/social awkwardness on the part of the ENTP. it happens sometimes.[Fe](https://youtu.be/-RNG_tTXXcg?t=47s)

can't think of a Te or Ne song, but nyan cat would make a pretty good song for ENFPs. what is a more representative mascot than a cat in space, with a pop tart for a body, shooting rainbows from its behind? 


warm, smart, weird and spacey, most usually. occasionally cold and withdrawn on bad days. i've been described as 'that one odd ball that everyone knows' because of my quirks.figuring out what the heck reality is.Fun for me came from seeing the immediate benefits of learning something new.

ISTJs and EXFJs (maybe edging to ISTJs), particularly because i had a majorly unfair view of these types due to many bad experiences. after learning about them more, it all made sense. i saw how my own ignorance made certain situations worse in some cases and i now have a better understanding of their points of view and the ways in which they choose to explore life. i can also have a deep appreciation for certain things, methods, gestures, etc. which i otherwise wouldn't.

these types were the most interesting to learn about since from understanding their point of view, i gained many insights about how my own ignorance and biases were a reflection of my many weaknesses.

ESFPs are pretty close behind, though and may overtake these types but i'm still learning. Se is truly amazing in its own right.or personality cafe or INTJforum...or any other forum but i get what you mean. it's the same with other types, across the forums, particularly IN types (not specifically concerning these issues but the problems are in the same general region). it's all too common that i'll see people who will learn about their type, over-identify with the positive labels and then suddenly, it's like they're different people with super powers.

In summary: many people on the forums are not real people.got 23. i didn't take the test too seriously but i don't think i'd have gotten too much better if i did, honestly. proficiency at reading body language, in this way, is more of an Fe or a sensor skill, i think.i didn't relate a lot (although the forest one is pretty spot on) but i loved the expression. i viewed the ones for almost all the types. thanks for posting.

there's some pretty cool stuff on Perc Cafe

[ISTJ Pics](http://personalitycafe.com/istj-forum-duty-fulfillers/52389-istj-porn.html)both are right.screw you guys, i'm special and getting blue balls.To be honest, it is a bit of an intuitive's playground, so the culture is not surprising but sensing functions are majorly slept on. The stereotype is that intuitives tend to veer more towards theory whereas sensors tend to veer more towards direct practicality...and as you can imagine, this serves as a major problem when trying to dissect sensing functions through theory since intuitives don't use them very well and sensors tend to describe them via relatively theoretically simplistic means. As a result, the functions get undersold because we intuitives sort of "take your word for it" and then everyone wonders why there's an intuitive bias in these communities. that's my conjecture.

from what i understand, there is nothing to suggest that sensing functions and sensor lifestyles aren't just as amazing and complex--actually i'm pretty sure they are just as amazing and complex from a mechanistic point of view. 

The question is: would most sensors in the community actually be interested if we all diverted our attention towards the theory of sensing? when i talk to my intuitive friends about mbti they tend to find it amazing; when i talk to my sensing friends it's cold blank stares.I think that most of the free online profiles aren't that great for any type. They're all pretty loose and vague. i completely agree that more enthusiasts should learn about sensing so that they better understand themselves. however, intuitives need help when understanding it since, as you can probably tell, most of us struggle to even understand our intuiting functions, let alone the subconscious/unconscious sensing ones. 

it's difficult for us to study sensing in ourselves and it's hard to know what to look for in others. trying to understand sensing can feel a bit like shooting in the dark. in other words, we're relying on you guys for good content about sensing or to point us in the right direction i.e. accurate sources so there's a good foundation to build on. Otherwise, there's a lot of information on sensing from psychologists which most of us rely on, without much question.

Additionally, there is not just an issue with the general description of sensing functions; there's a problem with them all. The general Fi descriptions are so bad that as i remember, when i first got into MBTI, i thought they were more like a preface and that i'd find the serious, more profound descriptions of what the function actually is, later after i found better sources...but i was told that those were the good ones, apparently (that was before reading psychological types, though).

I advocate Jung and Van der Hoop. i'd say that Jung is still probably the closest in general when it comes to defining the functions. socionics is very good in some areas. having said this, i don't think that any of these resources has close to all the answers.

I look forward to more posts on these functions that will benefit us all.Coool!!! love it. these are very creative.Embrace the Ne!!Damn, they got ethered, son!...wait...screw you guys.
i don't agree with some of those points and he clearly misunderstands Kierkegaard
 here (though he did express some troubles understanding him in earlier vids) but it seems like he's just starting to get grips with Te and Fi. 

This made things even more difficult to distinguish, for me. especially when considering his thoughts on empathy vs sympathy and INFJs empathizing with the perpetrator. i always thought that empathising with the perp was an Fi thing, to be honest. maybe it's an IXFX e4 thing. i still think the empathy vs sympathy divide doesn't work and that both types do lots of both in a different way. having said that, Fx doms tend to be more sensitive to these sort of things so may find themselves sympathising and empathising more.

He does seem to over value the INFJ's use of Ti though. By the way he's emphasisng it, you'd think EXTPs and IXTJs are closet feelers. Of course, it's possible that INFJs have a stronger use of their tertiary than other types. it's also possible that a lonely snowflake can reach the ground in a desert. it's the tertiary function, pretty weak and subconscious but michael probably feels it's much more prominent than it generally is because he is a philosophy student.

All that aside, it's a great video as usual but i would have liked to see more focus on the workings of Fe (which is at more of the forefront of the psyche) and Se for INFJs. would love to see an ISFJ or ESTP video next.
i don't think that Jung is implying that intuitive types utilise more of their unconscious minds than others. how could one possibly know in that case? it'd make for a pretty useless theory. 

Edit: sorry it seems that this is what Jung is implying in which case i'd have to disagree. every type utilises their unconscious in a different way. i'm sure that Se and Si work in similar ways for sensing types. it's not useless, in this case where the definition of the personal unconscious is made to become extremely narrow. There is an inconsistency here.


The way that intuition has always been colloquially defined seems like a mix of the introverted function processes.Happy Birthday, lad. Three cheers, i wish you all the best and hope you revel in a the blessing that follow forth.
what does an ESFP look forward to the most on their birthday?good intentions i.e. there's no hidden agenda. intentions and "vibe" trump expression. i could happily chill in a living room with others, without saying a word, and it could still be bonding.

For me i preferably like some form of "deep conversation" even regarding things that i heavily disagree with. the depth and perspective is usually more interesting than the topic itself whether that manifest through emotional attachments that i can also get a positive reaction out of (i.e. passionate) or it manifests in a more analytical way.These explanations cover a distant area but this doesn't mean that they are disconnected and unable to predict such behaviours. i wouldn't say that socionics is over complex; i think socionics is far from complete for us to be able to TRUST these rationalisations.

these behaviors and ideals are really not that uncommon for other types at all so how do you properly parse it out as one's hidden agenda? isn't the whole idea of the super-id block that it's an unconscious blindspot? in which case, how would someone distinguish these motives as unconscious?Yes, there is a strong connection. There are already professional astrologers out there that can use birth charts to determine MBTI type. Try some of the astrology forums and the NF sub-forums as well.science is just as much B.S. as MBTI and astrologyScience didn't make the computer; we did.That's a pretty good explanation of Si.many things are accurate to me. i agree with a lot of what you said about Ne and Ni.Lmao, you would...

i thought the meek were to inherit the earth.

so which ENTJ owns the world? seems like you all cancel each other out--too many cooks.no it is a personality theory that encompasses, at the very least, aspects of a personality. Look up the definition of what a personality is...

I can't believe this comment has been down-voted; the categories are literally referred to as personality types.Semantic and philosophical differences. It still doesn't deserve a down vote; The statement is not wrong. Functions=Cognition, organisation, mechanism and subsequent byproduct=personality. Apologies, i think i was projecting my frustration a little. things can be very unfair on here sometimes. I don't think the categories were labeled as personality types for the sake of ease.

what's the difference between cognition and personality in your mind??? no Isaxus does know what he's talking about...i almost feel bad for defending you. it's a valid perspective. I just don't think that the argument is complete enough to denounce yours. there's nothing weird about it.out of respect for you and your intentions i think we should just end things here. i'm more than acquainted with your point of view, which should come as no surprise.

I'm not convinced on why the process of forming laws through modern science (scientific method) is fundamentally more significant, for attaining knowledge of reality, than say...methodologies used by astrologers.
Heidi Priebe is an ENFP, right?
Sure, she's being flippant with her language but i agree with the general message. from what i've seen, she's written some excellent articles. 

i do think she's ignorant about sensing but i don't think she's implying anywhere here that intuitives are somehow better or that sensors are stupid. when i read your analysis i was questioning whether you were purposefully misrepresenting what she was saying in service of making valid counter points. i can't distinguish whether or not these are just the conclusion you drew and the implications you're imposing, especially since i've only seen a few articles that she has written.

For example, if we look at your first argument: 

&gt;Implying the internet isn't a societal source, nor is used by Sensors who are the overwhelming majority as stated

I am not sure whether you're just being pedantic and trying to point out possible implications but you've clearly taken this out of contexts. If sensors make up the majority, you'd expect our culture to be mostly adapted to fit their needs, unless intuitives are uplifted as some kind of super class--which we aren't. By society she means general values, culture, physical organisations etc. put it this way, it's far easier to make a living catering to the needs of sensors and far more likely that sensors will feel more in tune with the general culture. 

you're right that the internet is mostly an expression of sensors but there is a key difference: There is no search engine that immediately organizes and discriminates between ways we can engage within physical communities in our day to day lives; our lives simply aren't structured that way and teleportation has not been invented yet. Unfortunately, due to such constraints, it's more common that an intuitive may feel misunderstood and that their needs aren't met due to the relative scarcity of intuitive's world view and values. 

Taking that into account, it's no surprise that intuitives more often find solace on the internet. It also no surprise if it turns out that generally, intuitives may have more interest in things like MBTI because they want to find out why they're so weird and struggle to integrate like most others. It's also no surprise that ESXJs get the most crap online because they're the most abundant types in 'society'--pure projection which seems to be more in line with the direction that Heidi was taking.

This is mostly regarding the first point you made alone. more context is need but i really don't think most of the implications you're emphasizing, encapsulate what she was trying to reflect at all.I agree in some regards but how else should we divide things? i've thought about this recently. Intuitives do place more value in theories and concepts, in and of themselves. Theory is an abstraction of sense data and real world phenomena which is what intuitives are more comfortable with. This doesn't mean that sensors can't theorise--No, not at all. However, i tend to agree that sensors see value in theory by virtue of its direct application to the physical world. Makes me wonder what proportion of philosophy students are sensors. I'd think that for many sensors, the majority of it would be pointless mental masturbation.&gt;First off, for my pedantic tired ass, Capitals serve a purpose, even if you're on the phone (;

Lol good one.

&gt;But yes, I completely, intentionally, purposefully misrepresented her points for my own select implications

you'd be surprised, i see this all the time, especially among debators or maybe there's more depth to your grudge with her that i don't know about. i don't know your intentions writing your comment but this is what struck out to me as a possibility. If your intent was to put forth an argument then that's certainly one way to do it in an "ends justify the means" sort of way.

&gt;And this is why I'm this this "crusade" against articles like this that don't even point out the bad aspects of intuition or even low sensing

sure i agree but my whole issue is that i don't think she is trying to bolster intuition at all. i think she's just trying to add some perspective which is my issue with your rampant implications.

&gt;See, this is exactly the mindset I'm harboring against.

you're doing it again. i'm speaking generally. I am not saying that sensors can't think that they're weird; i'm suggesting, for reasons stated above, that it would likely be a feeling which is more common for intuitives.

&gt;Then what did she reflect really? I'm open to things I missed, I completely admit that I focused on aspects I've seen content like this having on people.

I think that the article is mostly harmless. she's just giving more context and trying to refrain from applying any moral judgment. I got 13 but I wish it was higher after looking at some of the questions. I wish that i was the kind of person that could call themselves a natural leader etc. it seems like I urgently need an ENTJ to teach me how to be awesome.

Jokes aside, it's not a great test. My father is a narcissist but one of my role models growing up (ENTJ and one of the best people i know) would probably outdo him on this test because he's very self-confident.&gt; just a layer of real world that isn't culturally encompassed in a focus on the 5 accepted senses as the sum total of reality.

Hmm, interesting. Very insightful; I know what you mean. So in your mind, sensors are theoretical but in an "unconventional" way--for lack of a better word. So then how do we label things for clarity? No one else is going to know how to create a distinction, otherwise. I still doubt that sensors will be seen in a philosophy class because they don't see that as real to them. Relative to the sensor's perception of reality it is still conceptual and theoretical. So as far as general interpretations go, we intuitives still value concepts more and are much more in tune with them.Yep, keep following the rabbit hole. I came to similar conclusions so it will be interesting to see where things end up in your theory. I am having doubts that you've actually experienced your shadow (more likely a projection or silhouette constructed via your ego) but yes the other functions would appear to be otherworldly to us, naturally.i can see that the commentors are giving you a hard time. your function definitions do need work. to me it looks like you understand how things work but you aren't explaining things well (INTJ problems, am i right?). I've read through much of your comments and follow your way of thinking.

i'll give help with Fx: Emotions morals and ethics are all a by-product but not feeling itself, it's more to do with values.For me Fi is more of a visceral experience and i'd say it's probably similar for Ti doms as well i.e. they get an internal sense when something is not "logical" which precedes their thoughts. in fact i wouldn't be surprised if the dominant is generally experienced viscerally.Could be right and there's no problem with that view as long as there is consistency in the actions and rational that stem from it. However, i am skeptical about that occurring. It also seems like too much of an uphill struggle against the structure and the values in the MBTI community when people start using themselves as the vantage point to define the world. The whole model potentially crumbles under the weight of relativity when such labels are stripped of implicit meaning and like you're suggesting, people would need to have an awareness prior to MBTI for there to be any hope of them grasping some forms of common meaning since no foundation exists in the definitions themselves. It could work and I'm not placing any definite moral judgement. 

As for what you said about your GF, I can't be entirely sure of what to make of that. Not enough details but I see a few emerging points and perspectives which make sense with your general argument. It's not fundamentally right or wrong but it serves Jung's ideals more than those of myers-briggsi am glad you called it "truth". i very much disagree that Tx is [Objective Truth](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Logic).

What exactly is "logic" in socionics? It seems to have its own meaning. it certainly isn't reason which is why it can't exclusively be associated with truth in any form.
Gengar, Machamp, Onyx and AlakazamNooo! get the hell out of here :P&gt;Just that she's a sensor by the categories in which you're speaking and had no problem immediately getting (understanding and seeing the relevance/potential value in) what I was saying.

Figured but couldn't be sure.

&gt;I can't follow your first paragraph at all

I'm criticizing your argument by walking through possible implications and consequences. Not saying it's generally right or wrong, though.I checked it out. Based on what she's saying i'm pretty sure that i had a clear understanding of you the last time. Investigate into the Jungian or Freudian definitions of a personality. You're probably misinterpreting character traits or the persona as something which encompasses the whole of one's personality when it doesn't. Personality, as a whole, is not just about behavior and conscious preference (i.e. whether or not you like the color blue).

Through one's own distinctions and impressions, it is reasonable suggest that functional stacks are not necessarily a reflection of personality (as you're currently doing) but to do this would be to interpret them in a way that is completely different from the desired impression and the intended application.

Hope that helps, brother :)I understand your view. I've heard it and thought about it before. Please check out the Jungian and Freudian definitions of personality. You have a different interpretation of what constitutes a personality; there's nothing wrong with that. I agree that the functions themselves are not personalities--that'd be akin to calling wheels and some sheet metal, a car. They are (based on how Jung seems to paint them) meta-objective qualities which are not solely defining of person-hood. However, MBTI is a personality theory. I am not sure what else to say.

&gt;Place 5 people of a certain type next to each other and you'll see that their personality (as in their whole persona) most likely isn't identical to that of the other 4.

The Persona is a subset of one's personality. 

It's a personality theory but it's not so detailed that it can account for all the differences among everyone. It's no surprise that you'd still see a lot of variation even among your ENTP sisters. it is splitting over 7 billion people into 16 types, after all. For something to be a car, it has to be built to certain specifications, following a general schematic, but that doesn't mean that variations can't exist within the build; look down any road.63% Casually Quaternarian

my guess: 

Quaternarian ~ Perceiver with IXFPs most likely on the extreme end

Trinitarian ~ Judger with EXTJs most likely on the extreme end



I agree with everything you said (yes i lurk your feed occasionally for gems like this). Taking the 4 function model as a basis, i think that the functions which appear the most "real" to us are the dominant and the auxiliary functions. when you hear about the mystical psychic and surreal stuff i think that it's related to the tertiary and the inferior. it's these functions which are inductive and seemingly surreal in their process. it's the inferior sensing which may likely lead an Ni dom to be detached from a conventional view of the perceived world. maybe it's the greater resistance from the status quo that may make Ni doms more likely recede into their minds as a form of detachment or become great theorist, with the desired effect of being able to clearly express their worldview. However, this is not necessarily how they are hardwired to detach; It's more a result of circumstance than innate ability. it seems for you, and my INFJ mother, that you just see REAL things differently rather than having a greater affinity for concepts.

It's the same thing with Fi, for me. I've been called stupid, for the most part of my life, for having a more unconventional way of interpreting/rationalising the world. that's why i get frustrated when people default to feeling being emotions and not values. sure it is linked but i view Fi as more of an upside-down Te and i can justify it in detail. what INFJs use as their main tool for logical arguments is Fe, in my mind, and not Ti. However, Ti is probably used more for creative reasoning when induction is necessary. This is why i believe that INFJs have the conspiracy theorist stereotype, since although the theories may be logically sound, they are constructed through induction and based on unstable premises. What do you think? this is the same way that i use Si.

I sort of see the roles in our civilisation like a carnival wheel spin, rather than anything divinely structured or ordained. it just so happens that the sensor's world view prevailed, pushing the intuitive's to the side--breeding them out etc. Even though the same overarching mechanism of perception is at play, the intuitives becomes the "mystical dreamers" and "the visionaries" because their alternative perspective allows them to see many things that others don't...even if they can't see much of the things that most people do and the sensors become the pragmatists/the realists and thinkers become the scientists etc etc. 

Whether it be through science or newage (I'm personally 100% sure that not all newage is B.S. since I've seen physical proof of some things. it's rampant in my family and i'm into some of it myself. i can explain the philosophical premise. i kid you not, the rational for this stuff is just as ungrounded as Ni is from the real world--if you catch my drift.) or art or whatever else, there are many other viable ways of understanding reality, whether we ground our reasoning to the material world and use that as the basis of understanding existence or something else. It just so happened that the carnival wheel landed this way but maybe in an alternative dimension, the intuitives are the pragmatists.

I think that this is what the user beknowly was trying to convey. you could say that it's the same as the objects/fields idea in socionics but it stresses a relative frame instead which seems more in line with your thinking.&gt;I see a huge difference in putting a perceiving function in service to a judging function

Yes i agree. what i meant is that Si is inductive but the way in which it is inductive is very different. it's perceptual induction. A common INFP stereotype is seeing things through rose colored glasses. that's because of tert Si; we don't take in raw data all the time, we draw upon what we know and induce the rest, when it serves the dominant. The induction can sometimes color our experiences in a way which distances us from what is actually happening in the moment. Most of the time i don't feel like i'm tuned into the actual reality of an experience, based on what people tell me; rather, i'm in my own independent fantasy that i have created, stemming from my conception of the values which construct my environment. For Ji doms, i think that reason is our reality. if i can soundly reason something to exist then it is real for me, regardless of whether i have actually experienced it.

I think that all dominant functions pick up raw data, but i would be picking up F,T data instead of N,S data. introverted judgers use Ji to build their perception (Pe aux) of reality but F,T data is not necessarily sourced from ourselves. i assume that N,S types are more attuned to experience and spend more time observing the experience so that they can understand how others interpret it (Je aux). I think that the divide may be that for Pi types, we are all having a similar experience of some fundamental reality that exists. all of our individual experiences are puzzle pieces of what fundamentally exist and any distinctions we make are a result of the way we interpret it differently. However, Ji types don't believe we have the same experience but there is a consistency in the way in which relate to things which forms our view of reality. reality for us is a reflection of the way in which we fundamentally relate things together. That's my simplified theory.

There are many layer of depth to this (at least for me) but i'm not sure how these thoughts differ from the way you see things. It doesn't really matter how different everything is as long as there is consistency. I think we both agree that there is no reason to believe that anyone has super powers and that everyone has their own unique and valuable interpretations and perspectives.

&gt;As for discussions of new age stuff, my perspective is along the lines of it is mostly lies/deception mixed with little co-opted bits of truth/reality.


I disagree that it's mostly lies but i'm not really comfortable discussing it either. this is not really the right place/sub/thread. Just put the option on the table in case you decided to probe.
like what?&gt;As far as I've seen high Fi users are the most confused about who they are, hardly the most "connected to the self" then are they?

"I know one thing: that I know nothing" ~ Socrates

I've seem many Px types say that they are more aware of the real world than other types. We obviously can't justify that objectively; however, this is psychoanalysis. Assuming that this is true, assuming that they mean a complete awareness of the world and assuming that consciousness is split between variables of self and world awareness, it either follows that Jx doms have more self awareness or that they're just generally less aware and inferior. Jx more self aware and Px more world aware is a reasonable distinction if we choose to simply types this way.

&gt;'m an ENTP and the average for the sociopathy test that floated around a week or two ago for my type was 19. I got 11

Your unusual capacity for empathy is making me uncomfortable.ignoring the socrates quote, how is this reasoning flawed?

&gt;what you consciously tell yourself to protect your ego and what is actually going on under the surface aren't the same

I didn't mention the ego


&gt;self awareness is primarily observation

By your own logic, how can you make a clear judgment at all about what is self aware in the first place?
pretty sure he's ISFP.necessary and inevitable. I think that we naturally drift towards organisations or concepts that promise a higher sense of union in order to relieve existential angst.Interesting. i'm not sure that intuition is explicitly a right brain thing (not in the mbti sense, anyway), nor would i say that this is necessarily linked with intuition, as it is framed in MBTI or through function models. In my own life i've seen this sort of thing most commonly in SFPs. It's likely that their associations are either different or require much more elaboration. i'm not sure if one could say that it's more raw or pure, though. I wouldn't be surprised if the elaborate/unconventional associations are why they are rumored to be more creative, since for them, the symbols have a greater density in their meaning or they have an unusual relationships with each other. Unsurprisingly, it's correlated with Left-handedness, schizophrenia among other things which are more common with highly intuitive individuals.I'm not religious, either but i used to be. There is a cultural tie to most major religions that seems to be the source of most ethical conflicts. Nothing gives those atheists moral authority; their beliefs are just as subjective. Their attempts to disprove religion, through rational stemming from their own subjective beliefs, says nothing about the objective truth.xD amusing analysis.I know you're serious and would agree that there is a lot of validity to your analysis, in principle. I know that there is a correlation between eye movement and types because i've seen it as well. i found it amusing because based on appearances your rationalisation seems overly simple but i am sure that there is actually much more profound meaning to you than what is actually expressed. your intuitions are likely much less a part of general awareness than you think and so the depth that resides in your expression will likely go unseen by most people. Ji-Ne problems, lol i relate strongly.

Edit: lol I didn't spot Se as much in Roosevelt but after watching Churchill for a few seconds it stuck out to me that he behaves like an ESTP...lo and behold:

It's ok, we can be crazy together
Please can you down-vote me too? I just want to feel like i'm a part of something.[Q.E.D.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07wuZ3EWMAA)aaww I &lt;3 U, man
but it seems like someone else loves us both a lot more.please tell me where you found the fountain of youth.I've already booked the holiday for the coming summer :)mmhmm, you're one step away from becoming an honorary feeler.Fi is basically an inside out Fe so for this to be valid we would have to be assimilating to some form of dogma as well--likely our own. Think about Fe through that lens. Fx functions really aren't that much different if this is taken into consideration.This is exactly what it is, in my mind, but there are many ways of looking at it. you can never use thinking without feeling. you can never use Ti without Fe, hence why they come in pairs. at least that's one way of viewing it but this pretty much solves 99% of problems that people have with interpreting the functions. it's built on a few assumptions (pretty good and consistent ones which follow well from Myer's logic) and fit's MBTI interpretations most accurately.

There are at least 3 or 4 major ways of interpreting the functions which are all different. There's Jungs, there's socionics, there's MBTI (which is different from Jung's) and they all have slightly different meanings for all the functions (in reference to how they manifest one's personality) since they seem to be interpreted as slightly different aspects of the psyche.It's like being aware of people, yourself and your effects on the surroundings but not the actual surroundings themselves (probably different for ISFPs). my personal experience is that the people or the "vibe" makes the place and i often don't remember anything specific about an environment other than an internal impression. whatever impression or "feeling" is the most dominant often becomes my entire experience of a particular event since like other introverts i get so lost in the impression that my own personal reality frequently overpowers the influences of the outside world to the point where i am completely lost. particularly when i am speaking to people, i can get so lost in their world that i completely lose sense of where i am. i'm commonly way more focused on someone's "being" and their story and how things relate to who they are rather than their immediate state--never talk to me whilst i'm driving unless you desire to be taken to the E.R.

I prefer monologues since the focus is usually on the individual and relations to them rather than what they're actually saying; it provides more data to build an image or a story relating to them which then becomes part of a general impression of them, rather than a dialogue where focus has to be delegated to adding to the story, paying attention to specific and developing the subject matter for the sake of the interaction itself. The personalized quality of the interaction is often lost by trying to move a conversation somewhere that an individual wouldn't naturally take it. I also feel that i express myself more through subtext and by the nature of the connection so i don't feel a need to verbally contribute to be a part of an interaction. generally, any form of interaction is an expression of a certain connection or "feeling" and i am very aware of the many different ways in which that feeling is expressed, whether that be art, music, body language etc, as it's perceived to relate around an individual's story.

I tend to think in picture's colors and vibes mostly and any words or expressions are reflections of those images and the more abstract the stimulus, the more abstract the images are. I've seen abstract
 [maths](http://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-7972936-stock-footage-abstract-color-tunnel-animation.html?src=rel/6459551:2/gg)
like this before (in the link), except the tunnel was also moving and i was travelling down it--it's usually some variation of moving lines. Having said this, i've been told that i have some symptoms of synesthesia so i am not sure whether this is Fi or something independent.

I'm encased in this bubble of ambiance, voyaging through this imposing sea of externally projected feelings, tones and shades that shape the world. 

I am not sure if any other Fi doms/aux relate to any of this but this is a piece of my common experiences. i think this is what you're looking for; however, I interpret Fi as basically Ti but with a greater focus on people rather than things (to put it simply and somewhat crudely).All the anti-feminist comments are being down-voted; go figure. I haven't seen anything of significant value from modern western feminism at all yet. I've mostly seen a neutral or negative effect. There's a major lack of balance (see down-votes) and too much focus on shutting down any opposition which leads to more problems or the same type of problems of a slightly different nature. There's too much ego and too much selfishness. a lot of feminist don't realise that they're just as prominent an influence for existence of the problems that they claim to be trying to combat. Even many of those that claim to be less extreme want to have their cake and eat it too, with hyper sensitivity to the smallest issues that effect women and total ignorance to men's issues and the sacrifices that men make for the sake of society.

From what i've seen, gender roles are hardwired, enforced and cemented by all sorts of social factors in dating (i.e. ethereal qualities such as "chemistry" shape gender ideals), interpersonal relationships, parenting etc. 

This is not to say that i haven't seen some inefficiencies in society caused by the existence of specific gender roles but any mention of actual issues are perverted in favor of selfish motives. My general impression of western feminism is currently negative. 

male INFPThis is common thing for most of the rarer types. i'ves seen INTPs complain about how everyone is just not logical enough, i've seen the arrogance from Ni doms, i've seen moral authoritarianism from Fe doms and Fi doms talk about how everyone is insensitive. The funny thing is i've seen the worst from XNTJ forums by far. i think i've seen just about every ENTJs say "get on my level" at one point or another and talk about how far superior they are at getting things done and being successful. What's worse is that, in my experience, Te doms most often send my B.S. meter through the roof trying to 1-UP others with claims of things that are exaggerated or false.

I see this kind of thing most often with younger people, it happens with all types and it's sort of human nature. it's a reaction to having one's ego suppressed by the forces of society; consequently, any need for their qualities often surfaces with arrogance, projection and some form of over extension as self-validation.

I don't like your reasoning /u/nothingwillgowrong . you're using your specific instances as ammo to straw man general statements. There is viability in the claims that some archetypes are generally better at certain roles or tasks but not enough reason to believe that any type is generally superior. This doesn't make any type somehow special.Whether you were using patterns or not it's still a strawman based on inductive reasoning built from specific instances.
 
It's clear to you that your own type follows the same thread of behaviors but my point is that your perception of there being more or less, for certain archetypes as a whole, is an attribute of your own biases.A philosopher? ah i see, they're your "plan B" in case you run out of food.lol i knew it; too sneaky. i'll be sharpening a weapon in your name as prep for you. a spear's distance away at all times. it'll take an arm and a leg for us to form a truce...;)Thanks for sharing. innerverse is vague but it's a hard construct to define. needless to say, this is helpful for understanding. I imagine the Ti dom as tinkering within the mind, pulling apart an object and comparing all the little pieces which may not actually exist in reality but which you intuit based on experience of taking things apart. maybe it's like having an awareness of potential sub-systems which could compose an object or a macro-object which an object could be a part of and the Ne potential excites your imagination to explore that single object in a highly detached way for a countless amount of time.

Correct me if i'm wrong but if it's anything like this then it's cool and very different. i'm more attuned to the mythical fantasy. it's a bit like when a child pretends that a tree is a scary monster. the object becomes completely lost through associative representations which unconsciously spawn from my feelings towards it. pulling objects apart by imagining the pieces or considering the object in a detached way is rare and if it happens the process is forgotten once i've satisfied the means for doing such. instead it quickly deforms based on a "feeling impression".

If it turns out that the Ti innerverse is more "grounded" i'm wondering if it's because a Ti dom's imagination brings such vivid clarity to an object in focus that any fanasy-like deformation defile it's nature. rather than the object being a source of some mythical image or world, perhaps it's an accessory to it, whereby sci-fi daydreams are built out of exploring the potential of a particular object of focus.&gt;tho as an intp the 'object' is rarely something concrete

we're on the same page.

I hope it's clear that i'm relating thing for the purposes of outlining clear differences (not to take the spotlight away from the Ti world, rather accentuate it). If this process is logic then it's something i don't understand. The object has no depth to it at all. it merely "IS" for no real reason that i can understand and because of this i often question its existence entirely. based on my understanding of what you're saying, assuming a natural essence of an object is the purest abstraction from my own reality, so it has to be "personalized" to exist or have any meaning.

Thanks again.do you adopt it as fundamentally correct or the most accurate expression of correctness based on what you can come up with at the time? I get a sense that Ti is never satisfied, almost as if they can never really find "the truth".Thanks for the input
Maybe it's fairer to say that the IXTP object is more mundane whereas the IXFP utilization is more mundane. i'm not sure that this is what you were implying but i feel it's difficult to say that the Ti dom process is more mentally laborious, generally. however, i'd agree that it is far more intensive in this specific manner.&gt;The worst is when someone asks "What are you thinking about?"
"I don't know" &lt;-- is usually the correct answer

lol, i can see why. how about "why is that correct?" or "how does that even flipping make sense?"

&gt;To me this is hilarious and fun to do. If I talk about this stuff out loud, other people go "my head hurts", or "you're over-analyzing

I'd probably become nauseous after 5 minutes lol and consider 5 minutes to be quite a feat.A
 [wonderful](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_SKdN1xQBjk/hqdefault.jpg)...time.......&gt;I like hearing the contrast especially because you're describing a process so very different

Glad it's useful

&gt;It wouldn't occur to me to think about an object in terms of it's essence or of it having depth - something either is or it isn't. How does an object have meaning?

This is some seriously tricky waters. I mean that i anthropomorphize  objects or transform them by feeling in some way because the object has no implicit nature. a child, through their imaginings, may attach human qualities to a teddybear to the extent that teddybears become innately associated with a particular character or quality but this means nothing regarding what a teddy bear is and its actual function. its true nature is lost in a subject and in favor of imposing a character or my own qualities. the ontological form of an object is so unconscious that it is meaningless to even question it. none of this means that i am more illogical since i don't need to understand logic to be able to perceive the desired structure for reasoning with it as it relates to specific utilizations.

Ti is expressed as subjective but based on the way that i presently understand the difference, this may be because the ontological form of the object is extracted, modeled and retained by the subject. For a Ti user it's a more conscious and personal interpretation of an inherent form which exists outside themselves; for me, that form completely escapes conscious awareness and instead, the object becomes a subject of its own. Hence, it's much more easy for you to question an object because you have some personal grasp of it's ontology, even if you can't identify it (which is why one would question the object in the first place).

maybe we can both agree that an object has no meaning because it is meaning, but the implications are very different. The fine details are tricky because things start getting nauseatingly metaphysical but i hope you can see where i'm coming from. does this still sound even a little correct?Thanks for sharing.

So how would this manifest when reading a fiction book? when a world or landscape is being described, would your data base of sensation evoke rich experiences by the mere statement of the presence of daisies, even if they were not the focal point of the environment? I imagine Si to 'fill in the blanks' of how things are experienced before or regardless of a full description of that particular element. Maybe, extreme Si doms have a vivid perception of things like how the smell of daisies dissipate as they move away from them and maybe even how that smell works in combination with the rest of the sensual qualities within these imaginary environments. maybe, i have no idea; take the reins.&gt;I cringe away from 'personal interpretation' 

Please, do tell me more about how it makes you feel.

&gt;I'd say an object has no meaning because 'meaning' is a human construct that has no bearing on anything except as it relates to people.

Exactly! For me, the 'meaning' is all that's there so it's the direct opposite. Good good great!

&gt;That's fascinating. I definitely don't do anything like that.

success with no mess. some clear differences are established&gt;Well, a 'personal interpretation'...

Gosh darn it, you wrote a whole comment because i forgot to put the smiley face at the end. We INXPs are supposed to be stereotypical far too lackadaisical for this level of unnecessary output. damn, now i have to crank my La-Z-Boy forwards and send my finger to the gym again to rectify things :). 

I got it the first time but maybe it will be helpful for others. My jokes need work lol.innerverse like what's in your head most of the time whether it be thoughts daydreams etc. Some feelers i've talk to don't have this kind of inner world which they create, but it seems to be a lot more frequent among feeler types, based on what's said on forums (which is what i'm mostly going off) and what people tell me. They talk about being in different worlds in their day dreams into which they recede, or they'll have surreal images pop into their heads. There also seems to be a strong relationship with there being more color or strange color arrangements. 

I'll do an Fi dom post later but what is your experience like?Thanks againMugen from samurai champloo - ESTP clearlyvery insightful. Had to think about this for a while. This is indeed quite different from the way that i relate to Si through my tertiary, but that's to be expected since the roles are different. Si dom sounds like such a cool adventure.

great comment, thanks!I like quite a few Heidi Priebe articles because i have a good sense for what she's trying to say. It's not supposed to be super comprehensive and she has some great insights--If you want that go read Jung, Aušra, Beebe and a bunch of other people with contrasting views (contrasting with Heidi as well as each other). The format alone should be enough to show that it's for the more casual audience.

In some regards i think that there is enough ambiguity in typology that it's not only possible for mistyping to have an effect but we may not even be aware of when a shift is occurring because interpretations may shift to accommodate them. The one that reflects you the most often. However, it'd be good if you could talk about them both and how and how they relate to your experiences. don't the two converge at all?Yea, there's an unfortunate lack of ISTPs here. maybe it's just a lot harder to explain or the question doesn't appeal to them as much. do you have an idea of how to rephrase the question so that it's more appealing for ISXPs? maybe i'll do a thread for the extroverts but i always thought that an extrovert's "outerworld" was more developed and in focus.&gt;I say dreamlike because, when I revisit a memory or when I imagine something, the mental picture and experience is the same as when I'm remembering a dream I had.

Is the dreamlike nature an inherent quality of your environment or is it more of a projection or overlay from your inner fantasies and experiences? do you think that there are very specific triggers in a given environment or is it more of a reflection of a certain mood or tonality? I've also been wondering which types would be the most susceptible to false memories (i think it's intuitives) but that's a little off topic, maybe.

&gt;Thus, because I'm revisiting memories/imagining some possibility nonstop, my conscious mind is perceiving the world around me through the lens of the inner images I'm working with. 

Ah, so it's like bridging multiple scenarios? so are the images sounds and representations reflections of scenarios that become abstracted (the distillation of essential and comparable qualities of an event). hmm, so my hunch is that Ni users may know what will happen because they've seen it before in someway so the Ni experience is less independent from what you've actually experienced before. If that's the case, does that mean that you more often speculate by trying to interpret whether experiences are relatable? If that's the case then events probably feel much more cyclical and it's probably easier to understand how processes occur through cycles of archetypes (this is just an Ne trail. don't think too much of this).

&gt;Have you ever had a really potent daydream? One in which, for a moment, your eyes stopped seeing what was in front of you and started literally seeing your daydream? 

don't you have problems navigating and seeing where you're going or is it something that becomes mare active in familiar places? it sounds like a trance.introverting is tough work.Yep, just prompting a discussion. I am also a little insecure about how my own experiences line up but i relate to this a lot. will add my piece tomorrow.

Thanks for sharing and providing insight!Hey, i'm glad. Thanks for showing some love. I thought that extroverts had more of an elaborate outer world but i'll keep the topic on the inner world for extroverts if you'd like--or maybe just 'world'. I was thinking of doing Fe next (Fe then Se, Ne, Te).You lost me here, buddy.yep and the darkness makes sense but in order to utilize it's like pulling tooth and nail to build a ladder to get to something that actually makes sense in the world. otherwise, there's just a 'feeling' or tonality. usually, expressions are just a reflection of that tone or feeling but they never encapsulates it. the impression is fleeting and as self understanding develops the tonality of a given expression also changes.That's a good sign. i'll do an Ne one later on. it'll be good to see how they all contrast afterwards.for me, my inner world is like a soundtrack or an artistic impression of my journey through life. daily experience emanate with a tones which are the focal point of daydreams and inner imagery. These tones aren't really an emotion; like the internal images, emotions are also more like a casing or reflection of a particular impression.

I wouldn't say that these are unconscious collective images like Pi doms are said to experience; rather, they feel like things which i personally associate to embody a particular tone--they are not detached from me and i feel a great sense of control over them. control is meant loosely since i don't force the images to arise but it's like water painting in the sense that i can manipulate the forms and arrangements to some degree and it doesn't change the meaning. 

Outside could be mundane but the feeling of the environment could inspire a series of inner imagery or stories that create an adventure out of essentially nothing and possibilities emerge from an awareness of different things that resonate with that tone. Thus my mind explores what the environment could be based on it's impression. It feels child-like and i often relate the way in which things capture me to a child at play that imagines a bottle to be a spaceships. things in the environment have a resonance that inspires my mind to play on its own.

It's different when i am practically engaging with something. in leisure or when dealing with people it's more like a daydream but when it comes to practical problems i.e. fixing things, maths, Sx and Tx stuff it's disparate images, sounds, random colors and flashes. The images often help with problem solving especially if the problems are difficult or abstract but for me they can have seemingly no relation to the problem at hand (i solved a calculus problem by thinking about the shape and color of a banana, once)  and they don't always organize themselves in a way which is congruent with events in the real world. It's extremely difficult to express anything that touches on my inner experiences and I usually settle for something that makes some form of sense and gets close enough to be useful. 

I am often completely zoned out from my physical environment (unless under stress) and often lose sight of it in face of a tone which it 'naturally' embodies or tones that i've carried from memories or previous experiences which are imposed on the environment. the tone is the focal point of all experiences so if i am engaged with someone and stepping into their world which has a very different tonality to the outside world then their world will completely embody my experiences and i'll lose track of things again.

since i interpret things by the tone the reality of something gets really confusing. I have a quite a few memories of things with questionable reality that add to or substitute experiences because they feel so congruous. i am not sure whether this is an INFP thing (maybe unhealthy ones) or my own problem because i also hallucinate a lot and am quite detached.

for those that say that Ji doms judge first for me that is sort of correct. I notice the tone almost instantly but have a hard time expressing it correctly in a way that relates to a desired/valuable answer. relating logic with this tone and comprehending how the expressed problem relates to it takes up most of the time.

can't think of anything else.That's interesting but yes that makes sense. i feel like my inner images are all Si related but they don't usually make any sense with anything practical on their own. how does that Ni represent itself in your head and how are things inside your head different from how the world appears to work or look?So where does the crazy artistic streak from ISFP's come from? do you go solely by the external aesthetic appeal? i've had two ISFP friends that were are top artists, one of which could create unbelievably detailed sculptures from as young as 6 years old.

Dario Nardi said that ISFPs have one of the most unusual brain wiring yet everything is expressed in such a grounded way. there's the inevitable obstacle between language and process.Join us!Yes i agree. i'm no author but i can see where the label comes from (was wondering about the impetus for the stereotype). The process does make sense with Se Ni, though.what if you were watching a video of yourself frying eggs?maybe but you're answering a different question, i think. i don't mean the ideal world or a world of only EXFJs (which could be the ideal world).[Cold Conspiracies](http://imgur.com/a/BUKTZ)[Get](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ship&amp;utm_source=search-action)

by best authentic self do you mean the best part of your authentic self that aligns well with who you are dealing with? where does authenticity come from? is it characterized by the way that you choose to deal with others in the moment or by the way in which you would generally treat someone of a particular nature? i can see how treating others differently would seem to show one to have many contradictory aspects of themselves. if you go by your feelings in the moment, how do you deal with 'inappropriate' feelings or inclinations and what makes a particular action or code of conduct 'right' in that situation?

No, it makes sufficient sense but It required a lot of reading between the lines so accuracy is questionable. I grew in a house with mostly strong Fe users; My mother is INFJ my brother ENFJ and my sister ESFJ. Not making any moral judgements about your way of processing the world. 

Honestly, the Fe fake stereotype didn't really cross my mind; I don't think it's accurate. I am already well aware that it comes from a misunderstanding. I more focused on trying to understand what authenticity is to you (how you define yourself) and what aspect of you it is derived from. I wasn't trying to say that your internal process was contradictory but that is the way it looks on the outside looking in. The EXFJ inner world still seems mostly fluid to me but there is a solid core that grounds everything. 

From what I understand, mirror types is an exceptional way to mark our type dynamics. The process is opposite but the material and the manifestation is not. I think I sort of get it. Would you be interested if I did an Fi dom types vs Fe dom types write-up?
&gt; It is raw perception from realms that are generally submerged below consciousness.

I am assuming that by this you mean it is generally submerged for others. It'd be hard to know if it was supposed to be submerged in your own unconscious.

Assuming that this is the case, does this mean that you see others to be somehow reactive to these perceptions, even though they're not consciously aware or that these perceptions are somehow implied in their expressions/experiences? Can you give any examples?do the clouds come out of conscious thoughts/meaning or do you program with meaning afterwards? in other words, are you watching clouds of meaning shifting around or are you watching images shift around which get imparted with meaning afterwards?I have an understanding of what you mean, but what are you focusing on then? Do you even know?

The subconscious must be reflecting something that exists in the environment and your environment must be reacting to the inner images in some way, otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell that you were picking up the information subconsciously. If that's not the case then there's no way to distinguish those inner images from fantasy.

From what i now gauge, your intuitions always have some form of meaning, even if they are not directly applicable to the things that you think they are, in relation to the moment.

Can you give examples of how these subconscious images have reflected your environment? Is their any consistency to your internal imagery i.e. a red flashing light in your head means there is danger (spidey senses)?.no problemEpic interpretation. How long did it take you to reason everything out?/r/shittymbtithis seems like a troll post but i'll play the game.
In a primitive society, intuitives would definitely be the first to go. You can't fight a lion with an idea but if for some reason it seems like you can, that only supports the fact that we lack the sensibilities to harvest edible mushrooms.

edit: also, check out /r/shittymbtiInferior reptilian brain not enough to grasp complexities of superior intuitive brain. It may seem like we are air headed, but in reality, 'the intuitive's brains are so large that there is literally not enough room within the 3rd dimension to contain them' (Plato, He definitely said this at some point, 87-99).

Jesus and Buddha are both probably intuitives and i'm pretty sure that the MBTI lord himself, EJArendee, typed God as an ENTP troll.

Checkmate, sensors.Hillary Clinton?&gt;Literally the only reason people type anyone remotely successful as a sensor is because of SJWs and our overly PC culture.

irk? and i really think that due to the simplicity of their nature, the label 'sensor' is highly appropriate because they are only capable of performing the repetitive checks and balances which were instructed by their overlords. It's just science, man.[Blu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uLjj81rPXI)
 is most likely an INFJ

[Common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeTnog5RRQo)
 seems like one too. This song has 3 out of the 4 NFs types: Mos Def is first, ENFP; Talib Kweli is second, INFP; Common is third, INFJ. one of the most NF rap songs ever.He's passionate, sure, but he does also have very strong feeling. I'd say ENFJ; I think he's a dominant feeler and although he does have an Fi type vibe, Fe valuing seems more prominent from his lectures. ENFP is a good second bet. It's very unlikely that he's a dominant thinker, especially given his rational surrounding what constitutes [truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gdpyzwOOYY) 
which seems to rail against thinking, especially Te.&gt; the beauty of Ne Fi Si. the self preservation of the soul of mankind

If  types could be responsible, EXFPs would probably be the ones that are most attuned to the affects of the cultural zeitgeist. Like Fe doms, it's easy to see how they can be perceived as a strong force for regulation for the sake of societal preservation.I agree that he comes off like an introverted feeler based on appearances, especially an INTJ but Peterson essentially seems to make an argument that values and morality IS and facts OUGHT which is as hardcore a feeler position as it gets. This is very much the sentiment of a dominant feeler in particular. If the capacity for making strong, sound logical arguments is what makes someone a thinker then the vast majority of those holding significant positions in academia (i.e. professors) would be thinkers, especially in a science field such as Peterson's where facts and measurable data are hailed as evidence for justified truth, first and foremost.Does it have any over Fe? I seems a bit replaceable.&gt;One of the first rules of typing accurately is to remove to the greatest degree possible what you believe a member of given type should or should not claim to believe from your mindset.

Sure but you could say the same about how someone is expected to act or behave, in which case, without having some kind of direct feed to the psyche, you'd have nothing to go off of.

Even Jung doesn't refrain from suggesting that types are predisposed to certain beliefs. They reflect our reality, why we do things as well as how we see and process the world, to varying degrees of strength, just as much as any kind of action or response. Consequently, I'd suggest that for accurate typing everything should be interpreted in context.



Mhm i agree. It sort of looks that way from the outside for Fe. I grew up in a predominantly Fe household with 3 Fe strong users and the apparent adaptability can make it seem as though they have no fixed identity but there is a core which they adapt around and Fe gives guidance as to how they can best align and express who they are in reference to the orders of the world. It's much easier to tell who an Fe dom really is by their friend group. However, for Fi doms we have the opposite stereotype of being overly self centered so the opposite characteristic appears true because we seem more fixed in our values. It's more like we don't have a core so we have a harder outer shell of values to hold ourselves together in relation to our own view of the world and how things could change and potentially be.LOL! ENFX without a doubt. Id say that he is an ENFP. He values Te and not Ti. Watch his other channel, the NFness more clearly stands out. I can see why, given his profession, that people may vouch for Se over Si but he comes more from the angle of health and spirituality. He uses a ton of Ne, either way.Aww this was nice. I am not fully sure of your intent so i am just going to say things that came to mind and brain dump.
 I suppose we can seem insensitive when the world the we see to reflect us is not a true mirror. So maybe we attract those we see to better reflect us to better relate and understand how our nature can be expressed in the world.

In some ways, others are always aware and watching but they may not know how to process us the same way we process ourselves. We are all living in the same world even if we see it slightly differently so however you present yourself, you are noticed, so long as you make an appearance. How can we see that senitive side when you withdraw from the world in fear? It belongs to you just as much as anyone else. Any hopeless conception of the world, though consolidated, cannot be the truth if there is no room for ourselves.
So a proper image of your sensitivity is reserved for those that live in the corners of the world that truly reflect you, whether that be with NFPs, STPs or Leos or your nextdoor neighbors or the cat down the road.

I think sometimes our concept of the world can be more damaging than the world itself. You are not insensitive, your emotions are probably more complex or manifest more unusually than what others are used to. If anything, i think it's beautiful that anything more than a little strange shows that we are playing in a bigger sandbox than we thought and there is so much joy to be had in showing others that care to notice and appreciate that.

I don't know if this will mean anything but i hope there is some value . I am in a bit of a colorful mood.
ESFJNah, it is just that time again. I saw bits of the anti-INFP posts which were amusing. Some valid points but the vast majority weren't and usually it comes from those that don't know so much about MBTI, really. They could have even been trolls, i really couldn't tell this time. I have been here long enough to see a rotation of hate here and most types are in the rotation except ISPs, INTPs, ISFJs for the most part, and ENTs. If it makes feel any better we will all be hating another type soon, and if you are one of the lucky types you can feel good about that too. This is really not a battle worth fighting so grab some popcorn and watch the chaos. I am sure some INFPs appreciate this post today but opposition/trolls will be back. It is the cycle of reddit. What we really need is an NF white knight bot.It's really really not, though.  It's like a back handed slap.Firstly, it shouldn't be surprising that INFPs are typically going to be more sensitive. It correlates well with the dominant feeler terrain but this has it's positives and negatives, clearly. It's more complex than to just slap Fi doms with the over-sensitive label and ironically satiate your own ego.

&gt; For starters, the INFP is overwhelmingly dealt the short stick when it comes to cognitive functions. FiNe has the potential to generate a plethora of unhealthy behaviours

I am assuming that you mean because they get the short end of the stick, giving them more apt for conflict in society, this means that they are more likely to exhibit unhealthy behaviors, otherwise, every type has unhealthy behaviors and this doesn't add much. However, this link is extremely unfair because it is predicated on health being strictly defined through a form of social engagement which is specifically, (yet not necessarily justly) characterized with some context independent pre-imposed general value upon which they are being judged (judged through a socially imposed standard and attempt at a potentially unsophisticated deontological ethical lense). If this is what you mean then the avenues that evolve from this are insulting.

&gt;Fi with Ne - the massive disparity between what the world should be like and what it really is often doesn't bode well for the INFP.

A collective resistance to FiNe ideals, assuming that this resistance exists, doesn't directly indicate anything about the health of the FiNe user. Every single type has ideals related to their cognition. What makes the FiNe idealism inherently more negative?

&gt;Sure, functions aren't behaviour, but they create predispositions

what do you explicitly mean by this in reference to stereotypes? because the implications in context with the rest of your post seem to support my earlier assumptions.

&gt;INFPs tend to get stuck on levels 2 and 3 due to internal conflict generated by FiNe interactions, which massively hinders ego development.

&gt;Combine these factors, and you get the negative perception of the INFP - FiNe stunts ego development

No. I don't know what else to say or how else to put things. That is not how the ego works, this is very uninformed. if anything, Ni doms have the most hindrance to their ego development, following this logic.

&gt;since the INFP's a late bloomer, they are still likely to be immature and display unhealthy behaviors since they haven't engaged SiTe - in other words, finding a healthy

Assuming that you characterize the dominant as the ego function, as most do, this could suggest and easily be interpreted to mean that ISTJs are one of the most all round healthy types since INFPs, more than other types, need development of their tert or inferior functions to be as socially apt as others.

&gt;
I think INFPs are great and have huge potential

thanks

your intentions seem good but these are some of the issues that projected out. I am hoping I misinterpreted everything. I am also convinced of many mistypes and although i agree with a behaviorist link (what not all do), the behavior profiles commonly used to characterize INFPs (and most of the types to be honest) are sometimes wild and often off the mark. I mean, [Trusted tests like this](http://www.celebritytypes.com/test/infj-or-infp.php) are just atrocious.

Edit: yes I did misinterpret your post and the entire direction at that. Apologies but I hope i provided some thoughtful counters to dissuade from your devil's advocate position.
&gt;That's true, but does that make dislike any less reasonable?

that's not the point of my argument. my argument is that conviction to the negatives as a strong or stronger argument is potentially bad reasoning.

&gt;Is it unreasonable to tie health to social engagement?

not always but that is not what is being expressed either hence the difficultly parsing things out. Not long ago being openly gay was an 'unhealthy' quality. yes it is an unsophisticated attempt at deotological ethics and even if you don't accept that, to dismiss INFPs based on such a potential is also inconsistent with other social ethical principles even common law i.e. innocent until proven guilty. So the notion of it being harmful or suggesting that it being harmful is bad on that basis is flawed because in truth, if the INFP's engagement is fundamentally justified then it was harm caused from no wrong doing. 

&gt;Also, you've mentioned how these observations are insulting, but haven't specified why.

Because if I misinterpreted you then the whole thing would be void rendering it potentially pointless so clarification was necessary but basically the avenues suggest that INFPs, considered collectively, are deficient, needing special care etc but even then, the ethics come into question regarding how things are being dealt with. if you are accepting some form of inequality then the approach of the opposition, here, is like criticizing a dyslexic person for being dyslexic.

&gt;While it might seem implicit to you, it's important to be aware that other people don't think the same way - clarity is important.
N.B. this passage was pretty difficult to interpret, and I've probably done it wrong.

The funny thing about this condescending comment is that this is exactly what I was trying to take into consideration which is why it ended up coming out so complicated because finding efficient, effective wording and making sure that I am laying it out clearly is a difficult task as we eventually split hairs, especially since we process things differently. Otherwise I could have probably said it in two simple sentences for another INP. You do realize that this could also seem quite hypocritical, given my unaccounted for struggle to try an interpret your own lack of elaboration? 

The problem with these types of arguments of questionable stability, which i have had with very smart and not so smart INFJs (when sympathetic to some of their alternative positions) is that they go nowhere because functions.

&gt; The INFP doesn't have a 'doing' function in its dom/aux

If you are claiming that Pi Je are 'doing' functions then you are also making an analogous critique of all perceivers.

&gt;(indeed, INFPs do perform really well academically, but I've generally seen them struggle when they approach university). This really sucks them into the social identification stage, since this naturally appeals to FiNe - being around similar people reinforces the values involved with Fi, which in turn reinforces the observations made by Ne (since observations are heavily affected by mindset), and so the cycle continues.

assuming that by struggling in university you mean in terms of finding direction, otherwise an academic incapacity contradicts your first point, then this is meaningless because you can't fix a judgement of any given quality. E.g. by focusing earlier on finding a passion, their sooner reflection, rather than waiting for a mid-life crisis is arguably not only more beneficial for the INFP in the long run but also the more valuable position for others given that we are more engaged and productive when moving in a more fitting direction--GDP etc.

&gt;You say this, but you don't mention how you came to this conclusion.

Too long but this argument is unnecessary to refute your position, anyway. your observation of INFPs being at lower ego levels are unjustified which you will then have to prove because (at least based on my interpretations) you've wrongly abstracted this conclusion from the source material.

&gt;Well, I never intended to do anything besides speculate and inform, in the process allowing people to come to better-informed conclusions about the other viewpoint.

Yes I realized and quickly apologized


&gt;What I've said is generally reinforced by the other comments on this post, which suggests that this model is consistent with why INFPs

In your mind, sure

&gt;useless rhetoric

subjective

&gt;what matters more to me is just that people don't be dicks to each other about their differences, and engage in honest dialogue where it is needed.

I agree but as to how we agree is a different story? jk
Thanks, I generally don't get offended easily. If what is said is sound, no matter what it is, i'll accept it. Don't get me wrong, I see where they are coming from and how stereotypes emerge but yes I agree with what you have said. It's easier to be more sympathetic towards EXTP because of Ti PolR etc. I hope you offer me the same sympathies because my Se use is awful and I know it too. However, my main problem is the bad arguments and the lack of consistency, at least when trying to represent other types, as well as a disregard of their own lack of self awareness in reference to these representations. We know that it's not easy to understand the functions that are of lesser consciousness (or any function for that matter) and even after years it's still difficult to hammer down the precise activity of certain functions etc. So it's these impassioned arguments stemming from clear ignorance which are more grating. Make sure you can see the right target first before you shoot them with an arrow. Also, I am always a little worried for some of the new feelers on the subs who are on the sensitive side and end up reflecting on/internalizing info from bad feedback.
 
Hey, thank you, daisies. I am glad that the contributions are interesting to you. I'll be posting something new, soon. The philosophy side of things is quite hard to make heads or tails of but it's good food for thought. There are a few spiritually oriented things, that are a little too divergent for the sub, which I don't post or only send to jermofo (because I know they are also of interest to him) but if you are interested I can post them to you as well, when I find any.

Sorry, I am a little stuck for a good reply but i'm not even really sure what to make of things most of the time. Observations are correct that culture have spawn around certain stereotypes which aren't even true. In many way, it is almost like on the type forums a fake world is constructed to judge, by way of extrapolating the usefulness of these models outside of their fruitful boundaries and I see this culture and stereotypes reflected throughout every aspect of the way that people engage in this sub. there is a user called hamfree and I remember them saying that when they changed their flair from INFJ to ISTP that their comments would get more up votes than usual (not that I care much about the votes themselves but the implications--they are useful as a gauge for collective interpretations). It's quite a head scratcher in totality with a lot of ego involvement and I remember being more in that mix too when I didn't know as much about type.
The online tests are also perpetuate and reinforce this sense of culture which leads to 'mistypings'. It's really hard to express but I think the discord we see is an expression of something bigger revolving around communities of this kind that won't be change by one person comment or post. As new people are introduced into MBTI through tests on sites like celebrity types it helps to perpetuate these cultures and before you know it, regardless of efforts, unless it's a massive effort, things are back to square one. on the INFP vs INFJ test there is literally a question that loosely says 'do you prefer fiction or non fiction?' as a way of distinguishing between the two and it's because of things like this that they mostly mistype me and others.
I think as enthusiasts learn a little more they move on from this way of thinking about typology. oddly enough ive seen a lot of NTs eventually see through it but unfortunately outright bash typology as a whole when really their disdain is for that cultural demon I tried to outline.
There are a lot of other factor but yes, I think we should be nicer to each other. As I have understood things, types manifest because of each other (sort of like a nature/nurture response towards a gap in the market) and others should subsequently be respected in regards to them fulfilling a need or purpose that isn't their own.


Hey, trippin. That's a pretty cool interpretations my mind would never have gone there. I wonder what the other two possible meanings were for you. It does make it way darker that they are both so cheery if that is what the artist intended. The watermelon could reflect the hunter's value of them amongst every thing else in the hot and dry habits that they are found in (buys them dinner, maybe). I saw something very different and I think NPs are more likely to interpret things in ways that seem to go out of context. It seems ambiguous as to whether the slices are going in or out and they are neatly cut. Also, since the elephants are cheery it seemed reminiscent of a child's play time with food. It is a bit like the adventure a young child might create when you are playing aeroplane with the spoon to help them eat their food. The child is building a world or an adventure (elephant) out of lunch and the elephant sort of reflects how the food ends up used in ways or places that it's not supposed to go.

It does seem feeleresque and likely an Fi type created this but i am not sure whether this would be more Se or Ne. More abstract art may well come from SPs to be honest. I think an SP is probably more likely to create the art with a much more 'sensible'/ relatable view in mind. Create with a vision of something that makes more direct sense regarding the actual elements but that is just as unusual or diverse in appearance, no? Well darn, that disney one was really intriguing though and created a lot of visuals for me. fun indeed. As far as socionics goes, I think this is more likely to be your Si or Se. strikes me as more along the lines of these functions. I have still been thinking about Se since the typology challenge and there is quite a lot more overlap between the S and N functions than people portray. If I can come to any comfortable conclusions i'll post my findings.

&gt;I was more astounded by the assertion that the piece was dubbed "illogical" when in this medium, like in many works, it's fair to say it's left open to interpretation for a reason

The first comment was a bit weird but then the second seemed like it was all being framed as merely their own subjective opinion. Either way, the art interpretations were more alluring. I somewhat agree with the INTP. I don't know much about art history or if there is some formal way to imbue meaning into art pieces but for me, much of the beauty is that acceptance of open interpretation so that much of it can be a form of expression for both the artist and the viewer. So for me the difference in their opinion surrounding piece adds a lot of value to art. 

&gt;I was kind of leaning XSFP
Picasso to my knowledge, although very limited, seems like an SFP, yes.

&gt;Jermofo and I tossed around art and obscure mythos interpretation as a possibility in Jungiantypology what seems like ages ago. What are your thoughts on integrating and/or alternating one or both there?

I think that both would be a good idea for the sub as long as typology is in mind somewhere. However, if Archetypes etc are more in mind I'd personally take it more seriously and be less likely to comment but regardless it'd definitely be valuable. I think that it would probably draw in some new people to the sub as well.
Good post, it was enjoyable. Glad the discussion was valuable.I always hated these kinds of posts. They also get treated as venting threads for people who have an axe to grind. A lot of these critiques are so general and can be broadly applied to every type in some way.  There is next to no substance without at least some form of consistency to these stereotypes and more harm than good comes out of these. Without tracking for consistency, any characteristic can be exploited as a negative; if you wear armour you are slower in combat. There is not much here for construction and points of view tend to be contradictory. Soon this sub will be saying something completely different about ENTPs etc.

Sorry to shatter the worldview but there are also no god types because if there were, it makes common sense that society would have already accounted for this but it's funny to see the egocenticism in the projections of qualities and intents extrapolated from the semantics. Archetypes are complex for us and It takes a lot of time to really even grasp the nature of a type. A ruler doesn't need a peasant so duality theory wouldn't even make sense. A bunch of wondering souls feeling like they're kings of the desert within which they find themselves and in about 2 days they are going to be writing a post about why mbti is wrong and innaccurate etc. Things will die down with time, so don't worry. Paraphrasing Jung, the problems of others that we profess say 'more' about our needs. 
These posts are always frustrating to read.&gt;it wasn't my intent to make these kinds of posts

I know.You know what's ironic about this? You didn't get my comment.
Am I trying to feel superior? No, I generally don't try to take things out of context to make a pointless argument.
So obvious that you still don't understand the comment? I gotcha. It's so obvious it's not. Horseshoe theory.
If it was so obvious then things wouldn't fall into the expressed patterns and I wouldn't be making this comment. 
Petty, I know but according to my standards you have no point &gt;Focusing on the negative aspects does exactly what you're bitching about; it offers a counter balance to the positive ones which makes figuring out what's in the middle easier, what the "phenomena" that gives rise to both the positive and negative traits might be.

Gosh you're still clueless. I agree but 'consistency' was an important word in what I said. /u/Lastrevio understood me fine. So do you enjoy picking fights with people on our sub? Why so abrasive to everyone? Often I agree with what you say but this really is a waste of time. However, keep providing ammo to roast yourself, though. You're in the right place. speaking on that, /u/Jermofo this is why I believe ihq is correctly typed. This is a good example of PolR Te where we see huge Ti leaps through inference which are abstracted from the rational at hand and I don't see much evidence of Ne valuing.

&gt;I paid no attention to who you were.

If this is what you come with, please keep it that wayI first saw it as light blue and greyish and then thought about it and watched the colors slowly change to pink and white, in a sweep from top to bottom, like a developing photo. Interesting experiment but I think I have seen a similar one before with a dress.Why do you think he is an ENTP? He appears as an Ne Dom for sure but beyond the persona doesn't he align much more Ti-? ISFP 7W6 is exactly how I'd type him as well, honestly. I wouldn't say he has an Fi blindspotI agree that INFPs and INTJs actually do compliment each other well but there are various issues related to first geting aquainted and whatnot. An issues with INTJs is that they can be very very quick to dismiss things and very often we see them to be complacent. 
They also tend to have a whole host of emotional issues themselves that they don't know that they have because they aren't aware of them. They feel as though, because they are able to be somewhat stable in th external world, that this reflects themselves when in reality, all kinds of things weigh them down from their past, present relationships etc and when you unravel this for them you watch them breakdown whilst having no idea why. They're far far more sensitive than they think they are and i'm not the only INFP to state this, it seems. Depending on the INTJ, this may or may not work against you.

An INFP definitely has to take the reigns of emotional affairs in the relationships because INTJs are clueless, whilst also being unaware of the true value of the things that you may be doing for them in this regard (though they'll be grateful in the end when they can see everything laid out). They also find our process of empathizing and relating very strange, at least initially. There are a lot of Ne-Ni clashes that can lead to misunderstandings if you do not explain yourself and your motives well to the INTJ and the 'whole picture' needs to be explained for them to understand any of the parts otherwise they'll disregard all the parts and reject you and/or your ideas.

In my experiences, INTJs also don't play around with their relationship goals. They more often seem to set themselves on one person and tend towards monogamy in my experience. Things like marriage and plans way off in the future will be spoken of early which also creates problems. They're so set in what they want and have a vision, which they're competent with in regards to thinking related issues but not feeling related ones. It feels as if they set the plan yet have no scope of all the things that need to be established between you for things to work effectively, nor do they put enough effort in because they actually don't know what needs to be done and have to be shown that they don't. Don't expect an INTJ to aid you with your all emotional issues to the same level because it just isn't going to happen. However, you can certainly see them as a motivator or catalyst where they don't provide a solution. This creates a huge amount of pressure because you have to find ways of healing yourself as well as adjust things within the relationship dynamic that will help you obtain their relationship goals and believe me, the time constraints that are set can be difficult to deal with. There just isn't room for things not going as planned and the whole picture has to be clear and set in stone for things to run smoothly which isn't always how things work with an INFP. 

Many of the INTJ points that have been said about INFPs are right so I thought i'd give some perspective from the other side.
It's a very very rewarding pairing for both overall (more for the INFP since there's more positive pressure on them and growth that they consciously experience and are aware of). It's especially good for going all the way, with the very long term in mind (marriage, best friends very stable relationships etc) but not so much for short term or shallow relationships.
I can clarify this if necessary and add points about INFP negatives in relationships, as expressed by INTJs. I hope this adds perspective.He's the top ranked chess grand master and "apparently" a self-typed INTJ.

Apparently, when he plays chess he doesn't rely as much on logic to make his moves. He judges the proficiency of his moves based on how they feel to him which sounds like it could be well developed Fi.

Seems to have more INTP traits and philosophies overall.

Can you describe the IXTP innerverse and how it affects the way that you see the world?

I commonly notice IXFX types to describe theirs as something very surreal, mythical and fantasy-like (a separate world) whereas for thinker's they tend to describe theirs in a way that seems more grounded and relatable to reality but things are more advanced (a better world). I am curious about your common experiences in the introvert's haze.

And me as well.Wake up, go to school, get back to my dorm and then busy myself with any of my 33252436345 hobbies I have. Repeat this every day until Saturday when I finally do any homework I have for the next week because the deadline is usually till Sunday.

Honestly, I don't like studying that much unless it's a subject I'm fucking interested in—a criterium which 90 % of my classes don't meet. If it's anything interesting, I always end up reading tons of books. For example, I know way more about quantum mechanics, a subject outside of my field than about German literature of romanticism, an obligatory class. I've got tons of problems at the end of every semester when there's so much exams I usually have to keep up with caffeine or stronger stimulants.

I know my approach to studying isn't probably healthy but I don't like school that much. At least I don't skip classes or get high before them.Your fears are valid however knowing your type will likely result in a sentence: "hey, I might finally understand the reason why I behave and do things in a certain way". MBTI is a limited tool to know yourself and should be used as such.

Knowing your type won't definitely put you in a box. You will still be you, you will still be a unique individual. There's an analogy possible by comparing MBTI to music: Cannibal Corpse and Deicide are both death metal bands. However, they're both unique groups with their own unique attitude to composing/making music and unique shows. Knowing that they're death metal groups is useful because there are other similar bands with similar approaches to music but those bands will still be unique individuals. "Typing" them as death metal only describes the **general tendency** towards harsh guitar riffs with lots of distortion, blastbeats and gorey lyrics.

Same with MBTI: you can have for example two INFPs but they will be very different. Their MBTI only describes the **general tendency** for INFPs to be kind (day)dreamers and idealists who have a rich inner world of emotions and creativity. However, one INFP might be more of a shy person who likes to be in the background supporting people by staying out of the spotlight but the other INFP might be more of a confident "hey, here I am, ready to help you with everything you need". One INFP might use their idealism to help better the world, the other INFP will say "fuck the world" and will instead use their idealism to pursue their own interests and goals. Yes, they're both INFPs but they're totally different (and unique) individuals.

Knowing that I'm an INFP (and learning about MBTI and socionics as well) helped me better understand myself. I rarely use it to type other people because they have to type themselves. After discovering my MBTI type, I know why I am so empathetic, why I have tons of different hobbies, why I like to daydream a lot, etc.I've seen her typed as INFP or INFJ, and I can understand the arguments for both (personally leaning towards INFP). Do you think she could be some other type?
Holy shit son!

Send ENTJ to the burn unit.Omg **chestmaster 9000 game** XDI literally thought of Seo XD*takes out cigar and smirks* 

Debate me bro. Teehee :)

(*whispers*) Stop making me giggle when I'm trying to be a badass. Senpai is trying to work here!Maybe I need to take lessons from my kohai :OLol nah I don't want to get butchered ;DHow should I phrase it, young one?

'How do I maintain a poker face?'Is that a challenge?You little punk. 


 Challenge accepted. If you don't comment, I'm gonna kill you. Let's how many INTJs react to our social experiment.

More than 30 comments, and you gotta post something on INFP subreddit. No please don't.I find most of your posts to be cringeworthy. 


You destroy threads with your ignorance. 



We talk about loads of serious stuff on our sub reddit - in fact, it's good you don't like us.Ok.Ok.Lmao okay fam.It's Reddit. 


Calm down.Thank you for this.I'm an INFP and I got ENTJ.


(*whispers quietly*) Yay.♡♡♡♡♡♡ sooo cute!
Fe dominant rather than Fi dominant or Se dominant I'm good at math... I liked learning about formal logic in school... so I thought it made me 'logical' enough to be a T type but the way I process things personality wise is completely different from most thinkers. When I read about any type I over empathize and think I *am* them when in fact I'm an INFP doing typical INFP shit at that exact moment.reverence, shyness, sensitivityI am an INFP but went through a period where I thought I was Te dominant, don't ask, so I ended up getting really deep into information on INTJs, then on INFJs and now ENTJs.

I want to move on to another type but I don't feel intrigued enough obviously not because they're inherently uninteresting just nothing has sparked the motivation to find out more. I want to know who you like learning about:)
Hunter actually seems appealing, since I would have a strong purpose in life. The road eternal seems appealing too though, since I can just live freely and constantly have new experiences. Healer seems good at first but its sort of like groundhog day if you think about it. Same thing with fisher king and escape, you are just stuck. Dominion doesnt seem appealing at all. Overall Id probably go with NAKAMAWhy do you say they arent actually rarer than ISTJ? The data seems to show they are one of the rarest types.They make about 3 percent of population while ISTJ makes up about 11 yet the INTP sub gets about 7 times the traffic that ISTJ gets. Is this even realistic? What are the reasons for this? There could just be more INTP on reddit but with this huge a discrepancy you would think people were mistyped.
ESTPsINTP or ISTP :/

I think they prob have it the hardest socially.I'm an INFP stepmom lol, it's a tough gig! Be sweet to her, it's a very hard position to be in within a family for any personality type. INFPs care deeply and hurt deeply as well. Yes we are "too sensitive" for our own good. Don't look at her with pity, she can feel that, respect her for who she is. If you look hard you will find positive traits in her. Sorry she is depressed, very common for INFPs. ENFPs are fun :)ESTJs don't really get along with a lot of people :pGenerally speaking, I think it's easier to operate as an extrovert in this world than an introvert.Well put!I'm sorry, wow that's prob what my stepkids will say about me one day :/. What type is your dad btw? Is he supportive of her? Or does he take your side mostly? If your dad isn't fully supportive of her...sometimes stepmom a take it out on the kids as unfair as that may be. Also, don't lie...I'm sure you haven't always been an angel toward her. I find it much easier to get along with my INTP stepson than my ESTP stepdaughter...but teenage girls are nightmares in general. I've always liked ENTPs bc they make me laugh, we both share Ne so we get each other's sense of humor.  Also ENTPs can be little shit stirrers just for fun :p (which may drive an INFP nuts, esp if the joke is on her). It's hard to know what role to be in as a stepmom. You feel like a complete outsider in your own home. This is not just my experience, lots of stepmothers feel the same way, there are books written about this family role. Plus most stepkids honestly don't give a shit about their stepmoms. They have severe Fe issues :)That's how long I've been with my stepkids, well my stepson (5), stepdaughter (6). I have no kids of my own bc umm no thanks :). I have been a full time step parent for over 6 years. I am not proud to say this but I'll be honest. There have been times where I have felt burdened by my situation and have probably taken it out on my stepkids which I know in my heart is wrong but there it is. There have been moments where I have felt dislike for them both (mostly my stepdaughter bc she's been giving me hell for years). I do favor my SS, he's just a nicer sweeter kid in general. My SD is very assertive, aggressive, she is a go getter and I have no doubt she will be just fine when she's an adult, she's just not very nice. She even has trouble making friends at school and other parents don't like her/don't want her around their kids. I've put her in therapy so many times (myself included) but it's a disaster. She's going to go live w her bio mom full time and I think that's best for her and me. My SS wants to stay w us. 
  She would always say that I didn't like her, but when I would put out the effort and we'd have a great time she would do something dramatic, or act out out of nowhere and everything goes to shit. I honestly think she never liked me bc I'm not her mother. 
  When you said that she can't read sarcasm LOL, sarcasm is an INFPs second language, she probably misinterprets everything you say as negative toward her. She probably takes things you do or say way too personally. I do that a lot. Y'all probably have a bad history just being reinforced by negative experiences. 
 I'm sorry she treated you lesser than her own kids and I def believe you that she did, that's very common in blended families. My money is on that you have prob hurt her feelings and now she is acting in a way to preserve her dignity, sanity. Both my stepkids have made me cry, I've never let them see it but their father knows. It sounds silly that a kid can make an adult cry but it happens. It's hard to be that Saint and give that unconditional love that flows so freely from biological parents. 
Anyway, best of luck :/ blended families are difficult. She most probably does care for you since she's been in your life for so long. She's seen you grow up. As you said before, if she's dealing with depression she's not being her best self. 
I hate sad stepmom stories :(ISTJ - accountingDoing things, finishing tasks, living in the moment Te/SeGood one, I'll add and not being disappointed with the outcome.Interesting, I thought INFPs had that in the bag.INFPsI think Hillary is an ISTJ to the core, Bill ENFJ...13-21...why?You are very literal. Clinton (both of them) have very strong Js...I usually go by cog function anyway. I'm 36, I don't consider myself on the younger side of Reddit. (I'm a Democrat as well).Donald Trump - ESTP 8w7Obama is an ENTP, Bill could pass as an ESFJ. He definitely has very strong Fe. No idea? I'm standing by it though :)She's not an extrovert...at all.Not sure why the downvotes, it's all speculation really :)She's the epitome of an introvert.I'm attracted to funny types, I like people who use their Ne. I also like sarcastic dry humor at others expense, even if it's toward me. Not sure how I ended up with an ENTJ, I just liked (and still like) the fact that he is super loyal and was never a "player". I've always had crushes on ENTPs but they are hard to trust and are fickle little bastards :). I'm usually attracted to thinker types, especially the non emotionally available ones :/ lol. Male ENFJs are hard to come by but I'm sure I'd get along well with them as well. Ok maybe not the epitome, but I'm 99.9% sure she's an introvert. I laugh and can be loud but am an introvert. She's ambitious, she is not a natural when it comes to people, it's taken practice. That's why she's often so misunderstood, or comes off as phony compared to say her husband Bill. She acts like most politicians, she was also a lawyer where speaking/people skills are learned.I've been following Hillary for a while, I've been to the Clinton Museum, and learned a lot about Hillary (her younger years). I'm actually a huge admirer. I think she's a solid ISTJ. Lots of people think Clinton is an ESFJ or ESFP, but I think he's an ENFJ. He is very Fe-NiNo she's not, just stop the political rhetoric...save it for r/politics or r/The Donald.Then I'd have to say maybe try your best to study up on Hillary with non bias resources because you are dead wrong.I love how you say it and get upvoted, but when I say it I get down voted and get asked for concrete facts. Really? Are you part of that crew? What's she like with them...tell me more. I want to hear about extroverted Hillary and Wallstreet stories.I think he's a very unhealthy ENTJ. Type 3w4As a fan of Clinton you give her way too much credit lol and describe her like a soap opera villain. No reality there. I thought INTPs were the smartest.If you listen to Hillary's speeches (more importantly her interviews) she is very detailed oriented and factual, that's Introverted Sensing. I hate to say this bc I admire her a great deal, but her details make her speeches almost tedious and boring to listen to.  She has a powerful memory for what has worked well in the past, and the desire to structure her career, her entire political platform to what has factually worked. That's why she is somewhat predictable, not so much a wildcard.Although, I am not an "expert". I've been studying it for years, and know all the functions (as well as Enneagram stuff) I admit I am sometimes not a pro at articulating very well why a person may be a specific type but I usually nail it for some reason. Or am pretty damn close. I've actually read somewhere that INFPs are the types that will come up with a correct answer but have no idea how they got there. It is strange how often this has happened to me during school, at work or in general. INTPs are the masters of explaining technicalities and how things work. Not me, I've got the underestimated Fi-Dom (intuitive gut) that is often misunderstood and underestimated.And Trump's are stellar...There's one Hillary fan and that's me, where did you get the impression of the "lots of shills4hill". It's been mostly me and one ENTP said she was a good speaker which most politicians are.He def is a Fe Dom, but pegged him as an intuitive. Although I can see some Si in him as well. In his speeches he remembers details about things...people in particular very well. I could see him as an ESFJ or ENFJ...but leaning toward ENFJ. ENFJs have charisma down to an art...they are the cult leaders of the MBTI. I could see Ronald Reagan as an ESFJ, do you see the difference between the two? I'm agreeing that she's an introvert lol. I made the same statement earlier and was downvoted.LOL, She's not. You just dislike her.What in your opinion makes her the most corrupt? I agree Hillary is a capitalist, but she is against complete deregulation of corporations, that would make her a Libertarian. The United States is a capitalist Country. I think she does care about the middle class, but also our country as a whole. Here you go, an unbiased site for your reading pleasure. http://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Hillary_Clinton_Budget_+_Economy.htmLol you should go to Personality Cafe or even better Typology Central. Typology Central seems to have the more mature and more educated crowd last time I checked. They do both MBTI and Enneagram. They are fun places to talk about stuff like this.Whoa easy! No I was saying she wasn't a Libertarian...I said she was against complete deregulation of corporations. 
It's not a Leftist term to say that the US has a capitalistic economy, but to be more precise we are more of a mixed economy...bc we do have regulation. 
I have no idea how having genuinely free markets would be a good solution unless you think monopolies are a good thing and good for the Country...I strongly disagree.
I just asked you a simple question, what makes her the most corrupt to you? I'm sure you could find lots of stuff on the Internet, I was asking YOU why she is so corrupt.
YES! I think socionomics is complete BS (not that MBTI and Enneagrams are a complete science). They lose me when they talk about physical attributes and linking that to one's personality type. Anyone ever see a Ne correlation with bipolar disorder? Oh my God, I think Fi Doms may be the pros at negative self talk. "I'm stupid, ugly, can't do anything, somethings wrong w me, I'm weird, no one likes me, etc"  I could literally point out all my flaws with each function lol. None of these are true but damn Fi Doms can talk themselves into a dark place. I think that's why depression is so prevalent in INFPs.
My husband is also a Te-Dom (ENTJ) his negative self talk is similar to yours, hard on himself...it actually motivates him to be better, but it can backfire if there is no balance. He def has much more self confidence even when he's at his lowest...very resilient.
Maybe it depends more on what the majority of people see as useful traits. What would ENFPs be critical about with Ne? They are messy? Disorganised? I think it's deeper than that. I could see some ISTJs having OCD due to their strong Si and having melt downs when things don't work out as planned, or if their environment is in complete chaos.
Se Doms honestly never seem down on themselves unless they fucked up something without thinking things through but they tend to be pretty resilient.
Ti Doms can get frustrated with all the technical details and not see the forest through the trees
Ni Doms hmm...just a pessimistic view of the future in general?
Fe Doms...not fitting in (but don't we all want that in some way)

Wouldn't we be more down on ourselves bc of our inferior functions? 
Sorry just rambling nonsense :)Only the national government can regulate monopolies...not states. I don't even understand your logic there. 

Here's a FACT Comey didn't indict Clinton...why do you think that is? Lol a House panel...good luck!

Hillary Clinton's stupid emails has been talked to DEATH, there have been movies made about Benghazi for God's sake. Do you think Hillary would have made the same decision in hindsight about Benghazi? She was told by Ambassador Chris Stevens to NOT bring in anymore troops for fear of causing unfortunately what ultimately happened. She made a statement and even took full responsibility for it when it wasn't crystal clear that it was entirely her fault. She isn't evading that Benghazi never happened.

I don't think she is corrupt, I do think she isn't perfect and is a flawed person. What leader isn't? I think she's extremely intelligent, very ambitious and overqualified for the job to be POTUS, especially when compared to her opponent...and Sanders.

I could make the same argument about how horrible Trump is, I could take his clown ass to TOWN, what would be the point? He is a complete joke and a con artist...want to talk about liars? Trump is the King of Lies.

While Sanders may be more genuine and "for the people", he's very myopic and super idealistic in his views. Maybe in the not so distant future Sanders' policies would possibly work...but kind of doubt it. He'd be working against the "hate to pay taxes Republicans" and good luck passing any of his big plans without a MASSIVE and I mean YUGE increase in taxes. Oh and I'm sorry but free college? Go F yourself millenials, what a way to destroy our education system and prestige of even getting a degree at that point. His views are like a silly Fairy Tale that will most likely never happen.

So in conclusion Hillary is the only rational choice and it just so happens I like our only rational choice ISTJ or not :)Charisma must be subjective because I find him repellent every time he opens his mouth. Is loudly bragging about yourself and how great you are while throwing juvenile insults to anyone who disagrees with you charismatic? I would argue that Hillary is more energetic than him because she's been a civil servant since her teen years while Trump has been running shady deals, not paying taxes, starring in a dumbass reality TV show, getting married 3 times, and filing his businesses for bankruptcy, opening casinos, being a loud blowhard in general. Hillary has been working for our Country. Trump is all talk, while Clinton walks the walk. He's a reality star who has never done one good thing for the American people unless you count a lame TV show. Hillary has dedicated her entire life to public service while he is a business man with multiple failed businesses who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth not even good enough to start a business without daddy' money.  He has benefited from the legal protection of bankruptcy for multiple failed businesses. While not going bankrupt himself, he has numerous documented failed business. He defrauded people with trump university. Trump steaks failed! Trio airlines failed and was sold off.  His TV show is a parody of real business.  Many trump properties aren't even his, he just sells branding rights. He is nothing more than a spoiled rich kid who thinks he is better than everyone else but lacks the intelligence and true success to back it up.  The biggest joke on the American working class is that they support this wealthy fuck who likely thinks they are all below him.  Here's a FACT: Despite the FBI investigating her emails, they found nothing that they would indict her on. I guess the FBI and the Attorney General should defer to you, bc you seem to have all the FACTS. You clearly know more about the case than they do. 

You should feel silly by default, you are a Trump supporter.I struggle with this a lot, it's very frustrating. I got ENFJ (married to an ENTJ)As a typical insecure self absorbed INFP...I just noticed that NO ONE has gotten INFP as their ideal love match ::cries::You don't thinks she's an ISTJ 3w4? 

You are probably right about Bill ESFJ 3w2, except I still think Obama is an ENTP 6w7. :)He cheated on his first wife with his second. You also may want to recheck those polls bud. I'll be working on balancing out that Fi for sure.Trump is an ESTP 8w7 and I'm not budging on this one :). Also check out Obama on YouTube, the Seinfeld show "Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee".I don't know go ask Condi Rice and Colin Powell why they also had private email servers when they were Secretary of State. You are an ESTP aren't you?the Hell did you not know the Marla Maples Trump scandal? Now I am embarrassed to be debating with a 14 year old boy over politics online. I'm seriously too old for this shit. You are really sensitive for an ESTP, and that's pretty pathetic coming from an INFP woman. It's still lame to be debating a teenager.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/

The only place you should watch all election. You are welcome :)First of all, you are definitely a sensor, don't flatter yourself. You are an ESTP, ENTPs are witty and intelligent. You also obviously love how rude I am because you won't stop responding. Sweet Dreams kiddo.(It's actually a right leaning site)Well get out your parent's basement and go balance out your Se :). I was in a sorority, not emo, I am not creative, don't like poetry, music isn't that important to me, I can be kind of a judgemental bitch...(secretly though)Lol sorry seeing that comment by an INTJ flair makes me laugh. I like your humour.Well then you need to enroll in an American History and political science class STAT! You are an ESTP, embrace it! You should be proud, Donald Trump is one as well. That list is pretty impressive and accurateI'm inferior Te and am horrible at telling stories, my friends make fun of me for it...not in a mean way, it's just that I'm ridiculously bad at it and leave out lots of detail.Trump is an ESTP, Pence hmm...I don't know that much about him but right now I'd guess either ISTJ or ISFJ.He's an ESTP, almost a caricature of an unhealthy one. Still a schoolyard bully who never grew up.I think an ISTJ would be the least likely...
Possibly INFPs as well, I tend to size people up for a long time before opening myself up to them, also I'm always on my guard.ESTPs esp with Enneagram type 8w7My stepdaughter is an ESTP and she definitely thinks she's a special little snowflake.Aww you sound sort of sweet, I'm sorry for being a bitch...it's just kind of fun sometimes. Also I really can't stand Trump, it's serious.I would think Te would be subdued...in an INFP, at least that's how I work.No I was being sincere, that time :)63% INFP
10% ENFP
9% ISFP
6% INFJ
6% INTP

So pretty accurate :)That sounds like it might work for me if I were looking for a life coach. Not for a validating ear though.It's the inauthenticity that some ESTPs exude that makes me weary. I only feel like they are being charming if they want something from me. :)I agree, when someone is going through something horrible I can definitely see where they are coming from and put myself in their place. I can be kind of shitty at consoling them...I'm not sure why. It's as if I freeze, I don't want to say something lame and cliche when someone is going through something bad. I prefer to listen and just be there for them, but I'm not great at making them feel better about the situation like a Fe user would be. I find some Fe Doms to be sympathetic, but can also see them being closed minded to people who may not fit in the consensus norm. They are really good at saying the right things and doing the right things when a friend of theirs is in pain. I hope that made sense, it was a bit rambling.I think an ISTJ. INTPs might over analyze missing some street sense, I have also noticed that while INTJs are good at looking at all sides of a situation they can be strangely naive when it comes to human nature. ISTPs may be okay, I always picture ISTPs as more of the brawn before brains type, but they are pretty good at seeing through people...strangely. They may even be better at seeing through people more than ISTJs who can also be on the naive side...but not as bad as INTJs IMO experience and knowledge of the functions.You guys can see through people's bullshit remarkably well. I will give you that.They seem like the strong silent independent type, deep down they also seem like they want a "real" connection with people but it doesn't come easy. They don't seem to trust others easily, usually sarcastic, they judge people almost immediately but usually keep their thoughts to themselves. They are street smart, down to Earth, logical and good with their hands. Intense emotions within themselves and others is to be avoided. Probably lack a transcendent point of view.Sounds like you are describing an INTP as well.I swear to God, I saved a butterfly caught in a spiderweb yesterday, I even put it on a flower and googled what they ate. I think it died anyway :/.Both?I daydream everydayINFPs are much higher than expected! I agree that ESTPs def belong at the top.I got a 14 :/Haha! Watching the debates too?If they are thinking about something I care about then yes. I’m always interested in how I’m perceived by others but that won’t necessarily make me change my behavior like a Dom Fe might.I really relate to Kristen Wiig’s character on Bridesmaids No I don’t want to be an INFPRN - INFP ...I wish I was a zookeeper I think I’m married to an ISTP and agree ENTP 43.59%
INTP 43.59%
ENFP 38.46%
INFP 38.46%

Interesting...I always test out as an INFP though, but feel like I’m an ENFP. 
Texting. I hate talking on the phone.I'm an INFP.

Mother: ISFJ

Father: ESTP (or ISTP; can't decide)

Sibling: Likely ISTP

^ They're all toxic people and I've never been close to/gotten along with any of them.

Cousins: INTP, ISTP and INFP

Grandpa and two uncles: ISTPs

Aunt: ISFJ

My grandma was an extrovert, but I'm not sure what her type was.

Get/got along best with my cousins and grandma.Yeah, that doesn't describe me either.I'm an INFP.

I don't trust my driving. I'm a bit nervous driving because I tend to zone out daydreaming, which obviously is not good... 

Music being on is okay, but not too loud. I'm still learning to drive so having it too loud can make it hard to think when I'm trying to do something. Once I'm more comfortable driving, music wouldn't bother me. Normally I prefer music being on when I'm in the car.

No, I don't get road rage. I like most of them. My favorites are the Toy Story movies.I was planning to go with Yellow since it was the game I started with in the 90s, but after reading the descriptions of the teams I'll probably go with Mystic. Plus blue is my favorite color and Articuno is my favorite of the legendary birds, so that too. 

I'm an INFP.Draining.That's how it is for me at times too.
&gt;This year, I graduated with my music degree. I went to the school, and told her everything she did wrong with me and teaching. I had also accumulated enough sources and witness to get a case started against her and got the school board to fire her.

Lol savage! Bravo for standing up! Teachers like that need to know when to move on. 

Edit: Please also know he/she could have been taken advantage of by bully like students or parents. Many teachers become loving again. They sometimes need some genuine appreciation

As well as social workers, journalists, security workers, janitor: those who work behind the camera, COUNSELORS etc...

Vivid details. Maybe we can hear your music some day? Ty! =D
Hi. categorizing hitler as a sociopathic or w/e INFJ bothers me. Why? 
Is Ni Fe really about treating other human beings as the "lower" level race?  
These days I notice "hitler haircuts and beards." Why are we glorifying a "breeder" who experimented with other humans like domesticated animals? Did this minority rape, plunge and had terrorists hiding among them? 

Wonder if some PR prodigy/other type diverted attraction from themselves and used INFJs as escape goats.  Maybe hitler was a puppet by something/someone more powerful...



First sorry if l am replying to this subject past its due date. My Ni was in lalaland. I needed to step back until my irritation subsided.

Ty for your considerate message. 
I am not even sure if l am an INFJ. I can relate to many other types as well.   

I am guessing that lNFJs with extroverted feelings can easily understand people's hearts, minds, and intentions. A brilliant INFJ with power would use that advantage to bring harmony and understanding in a group. They are called counselors for a reason?
He loved power and order. He loved the military. (Nothing wrong with that).  
If he was an INFJ, he could have easily related to the Jews and minorities to "manipulate them" to whatever selfish ambitions he had for his cause.
His approach just doesn't seem infj to me. Also read his wife's memoir. She is very gentle and seems like an introverted feeler. I can't see the INFJ "yin/yang."

What was more messed up was how he accelerated the extermination the more desperate he was getting. He is a sick inspiration for future war and hate. I do not want to categorize him as anything...not INFJ, not German, not a man, not a leader. Hope he is only referenced as how "not to human"...nothing more. Ok. With that note, will be watching ["Denial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7f7wV9tN5Q)

XD   
Have a nice day. 
Appreciate your mature assessment. However at this point l think it's appropriate to ask /u/doggymelonss if she wants to continue discussing this and in what context. She (whatever her type) only wanted to introduce herself to a community she loved, but got twisted into some type me thread. MAYBE how she reacted created some miunderstanding?  Unless SHE wants to continue talking about this, l only ask everyone to consider that continuing this discussion without her can unintentionally lead to harassment, gossip, isolation aka bullying. Thanks for reading.

*crossing fingers for a funny type me thread*Hello!

Care to share any embarrassing or funny stories that you still giggle &amp; XD =) today?  
Or your best comedian moments?

I love basketball! 

There's so many factors that influence games. while stats are fun in basketball, things like team fit and spacing are things to look for when watching it. When playing it, it's a blast to score and revel in succeeding for your team. Because it's fast paced, these feelings come fast and often INFP 

Electrical Engineering, chose it because I thought it had high potential for success. Bill Walton, Hall of fame center  INFP

If you haven't heard him commentate I reccomend his comparison of Boris Diaw to Beethoven and his flawless description of Dwyane Wade

I dunno ENFP, hes pretty unfiltered and the jokes are always fresh. AS far as anime channels go he comes across pretty chill, but he seems to like to include his friends in his videos or interact with his viewers---so I'm guessing more extroverted. Lol are Fi-te users monks

But seriously good job thats probably inline with how it would go down in my mind if my vase broke. ENTJ: 

Kuroko no Basuke - Akashi, Hardworking, open to new ideas and techniques, domineering.

Shinsekai Yori-Squealer, Ambitious, big goals and plans, good communicator, untraditional style for goal achievement 

I was introduced to the concept from 16 Personalities, I find it interesting that that site always gets me as a INFP while the other two I've tried (the one you linked here and the first one in the sidebar) tag me as INTP.  
I think the humanmetrics site you linked hit it pretty spot on, it gives me marginal to no preference of T over F (3%), which fits with my own analysis, I'm a natural INTP who's drifted to F due to personal circumstances. Wow, I'm INFP and this is totally me, I have entire albums I can't listen to anymore because they remind me of a rough patch on my life, and some of my friends have no idea what genre of music I even like because I'm so emotionally connected to songs I could never share them with others. As an infp who gets literally nothing out of /r/infp, tell me more. Perfectly said, you put words to a back-of-my-mind hunch. I've been reading /r/istj a while due to a girl I'm into being one, coming from there to /r/infp it's all "thought you guys would enjoy this comic/song/site/story" with virtually no actual typology discussion. I always felt a twinge of "something's off" while reading about INFP's, which I always tested as. But yesterday reading through the INFJ's function stacks and especially an article highlighting the INFJ-INFP differences I got that "Oh my God that's so me it all makes sense now" for the first time. I'm still not 100% convinced, but I definitly feel much more confident in my assessment as INFJ than INFP.
We already talked about this months ago, with a big post the whole sub disagreed with. be the change you want to see man, stop complaining.Then make a post and talk to the sub directly? Something my friend said recently is that there is fairness and equality. Feminist these days say they are looking for equality, but its really fairness, which ends up putting men down.. a lot. However, true equality I don't believe is possible, because people are different. The genders are different. So true equality is not possible, but we can certainly do better than we have now.I wouldn't say God speaking to you is automatically mental disorder worthy. But in this case He didn't seem quite right.This would be beneficial for me also.Btw it's called AFL mate. 

I get so fustrated seeing all these people judge and condemn something they understand so little about.. Although I can see that happening in many areas of life let alone this one. Because they take a surface view and stop there and assume that's all there is to it. Oh man the pain.. :PPersonally I find it painful to see others judging something and critising it while having evidently such a small grasp of the full concept. Missing out on something that has provided so much benefit to me and others that I know. Whether the theories have been through the 'scientific method' or not really doesn't concern me. Or I could just be saying that because I'm an Infp :pWow apparently I can't read. Sorry man, ignore what I said.

yep. agreed. Oh its an ISTP. my 2 main friends are an INTP and ISTP. Such interesting creatures.yep i could probably relate to those examples.. a err female friend thought I was like possessed because of how angry I was when she crossed one of my personal lines. I'm generally chill as well, until theres something worth sticking up for. My friend described it this way.

Fe = morals, Fi = values
Both are judgement functions, just like Ti and Te
Morals = standards of behaviour; principles of right and wrong

Whereas values are more like what's important, and what should be believed.I stand by this post.Not once.point me in the direction of the feels and ill feel them.plz no.I don't blend well with ESTP's. They are like my anti type :Pmy belief is that you have to do something that means something to you. Whatever form that takes. meaningless jobs are soul crushing.I don't like reading. 
I dislike poetry and art, and I'm not very creative. 
Accurate for me, so add that to your stats. ;)

Buut I am a typical INFP, tho I did struggle for some of them. omg I totally get what she's talking about. 
She visit our home sub at all? :pOhh Maan. Suggest it. She may feel at home there. 

Just know the functions then it all makes sense. My ST and NT friends are much better at describing to others. I only use it for personal introspection really. Not that I study anymore these days. 

Confidence is a maturity thing, and not something that comes naturally to us. I got so much better in that area over the last couple years. I'm pretty sure isfp talking about dress sense is fairly textbook I believe. Nice ;)Case of silent majority I think. Can confirm. During my depressive phases I definitely turn to online attention, but am doing my own thing when feeling fine. Please make it quick and painless. If you need a support guy, this friendly infp can help =]I don't like poetry and don't read books. Just sayin :phey.Well, when you put it that way, the first thing that comes to mind is that I'm a Christan. I consider it the most important part of my life, whether I act like it or not. 

I didn't really know you enough or feel like asking deep questions or shallow ones, so just went with an induction to see how you would respond I guess :pDon't touch my enneagram man! :P

But as far as I understand it, both those personality systems are a lot more grounded in science and psychology than the other stuff is. Not something worth attacking you over, but I also enjoy mbti/enn but not anything elseThey didn't connect the two, you did. They provided it purely as talking points. Not quite worth attacking them over it. In saying that, the goal of an icebreaker had been achieved.Yerrr noAus.
Embedded here too I would say. To a degree.
What's your point about socitel influces? That society made me a certain way?

It was more called to than led to. 
Started with hearing my name called when I was young, then growing to discover who God is. Plenty of experiences to satisfy me that He is real. Although a large part of it is me just knowing, but that doesn't really do it for most people. Which I understand.

Yup. =]
You asked a pretty good question man, it really makes someone think about what's important to them then share that. It's such a good starter. did you just assume the current status of my mind? bigot.They did not draw a connection based off mbti or to any particular type.
a single individual posted content that was relevant to them. If you want to diss stuff that is relevant then go for it, but it's not directly connected to the topic of mbti, only to this individual. True, most of the sub is defs sjw which is annoying. Oh well. can relateThis.I dislike hypotheticalsBecause I can imagine the thing being too real, and it makes me stressed and sad. Despite it being a silly situation. In order to find a valid decision, I have to get too deep into the story, and I'd rather not do that. I am also bad at decision making, and it stresses me out having to think about it :P

Guess my type. :P /sI do often get lost inside my own internal world, it can cause issues while driving even.. :phah I guess it would be nice to know more infps irl. We always have some kind of deeper emotional kinship imo than with others. This thread turned fairly suggestive. Ye. real infps just say nigger.I mean.. That's kind of violent, so no, they don't say that. Then you're just an unpleasant violent individual and I want nothing to do with you. Good day sir. no you couldnt.sounds more like offence than self defence. Thats the issue.
I've thought about this too, in terms of how gender differents affects the types.
Would you say its like a separate bio and chemical difference that affects how the same type plays out.Mmmmm. I disagree. Male a female differences are huge. 
Both play an impact sure. But I wouldnt dare minimise biology. You do know there's many established ones already right? why did you focus so much on females here? 
what about the males hmm ?o.O

Se is my Polr tho. yes thought you meant that, not the order there tho. anyways.
there just seems to be this common thing about infps being females, so I felt like mentioning it. tyHey man! well... I guess I can't argue with you.. :PYou're incredibly incorrect. So I guess that means uncultured.  
There's huge groups in the East, china, here in Aus etc..omg. I seem to have this ultra child like state that only comes out with people I am super close with. No one else sees it.   
But I guess i understand some of that manipulation stuff too :/hu.. attachment theory hu? That stuff always manages to bring out my scary sides ;P  
What did you find if I may ask? 
Sorry, this is so late but, 

For the first one, it's honestly difficult, but I'd say I relate more to A. Strongly to, *My own sense of constancy in personal ethics and in my relationships with others is a very strong factor in my sense of self-worth.* I can be very critical about other people at times, and the things they do. Though it makes it sounds very black and white here, *I'm able to almost instantly recognize whether someone is a friend or an enemy, whether they're demonstrating good will or ill will, and whether they are drawn to or repelled by me.* Which I do not relate to, though I'm critical to others and myself, I do see people more in shades of grey. For B, I relate very strongly to the part about being demanding/having high standards.

For the second one, *However, if taken too far, this produces stress, as it inhibits my natural inclination to voice exactly what my thoughts are on a given issue or situation, with the expectation that others will appreciate my straightforwardness, rather than accusing me of being insensitive.* Definitely, the truth should be more important than other people's sensitivies. 

However, *This caution gradually disappears as I get to know people better.* isn't me. The caution is always there. I think that there are times to use logic and there are times to use heart, and I switch between the two depending on the situation, which is why my test results are usually really close between T and F. But I do prefer to take personal meaning from something I'm doing rather than just talk about things from a dispassionate academic or theoretical point of view. I'll do that if I really need to.

So I'm going to say I relate more to B on this one.Yeah, me too. Thanks :)Te (Extroverted Thinking) (65%)

based on your results your type is likely - unclear
Type doesn't equal specific interests.

I'm an ISFJ but I detest children, loathe chores, and would never be a stay-at-home partner. 

But that type still fits my thinking style and values.  

The type I fit doesn't define my tastes anymore than yours does, because that's not what a personality type describes.  haha, I chose my username because it's the Pokemon Espeon's name in the Mandarin version.  :3

I can agree that that sort of behavior is very obnoxious; I don't think of people I run into IRL in terms of types, but I hate it when folks pull that emotional leverage crap.  ESFP- student

What was the origin of this phenomenon?  Are ESFJs more likely to be abusive, or at least exceptionally controlling, parents than some other types?  Or are people typing abusive parents as this simply applying some surface level characteristics without further thinking?  
Honestly, this seems too real in the NT subreddits sometimes... Being an NT doesn't even make you smart just like being an SFP doesnt make you amazing at design. Describing profiency at the functions lies outside of the MBTI area of expertise. 

Edit: to be honest, the picture can be applied to people in every other group aswell.holy shit have you lost a loved one? Or are you just asking how we would deal with it?

if its the latter; i don't know what to do, havent experienced it yet.

Former: im sooooooo sorrrrrryy :((((((I think that psychopathy skews MBTI pretty hard, but i guess its interesting to think about.

Just thought i'd chime that inwell, you worded that kinda harshly and generalizing-ly. If you had said that you haven't gotten along with sensors as easily as you had with fellow intuitives then you would've been golden.

Saying "i hate sensors" makes people think if you run into and define a sensor, then you begin to hate them.INFP. I love ISTPs and ESFPs. I'm reserved towards people that i'm not close to, but when i get close to them, i get very weird. When i get close to ISTPs and ESFPs i seem to bring out the weird in them. So we have weird little conversations that only we understand and i love it.I'm not one of the dudes that downvoted you, i'm just trying to see why anyone would downvote you. Since you asked. People might just be too quick respond to perceived bigotry. That's a good thing tho, probably. Ayyyy, that's me. I love doing this. I feel like this is an Fi trait. Especially in Fi-doms. I don't know if you're unsure about your type. But your description here reminds me of some good ole' Fi-dom.There are upsides and downsides to every individual. That's their downsides. I'm saying 'their' because some ENFPs value authenticity far more than harmony or image.

I don't believe pretentiousness is an ENFP trait. ENTJs may do this too but you haven't run into any yet.Maybe i'm just weak but the thing i find the hardest, is to fight without thinking about how it will affect other people. That's why Attack on Titan is my favorite. I've watched naruto up untill it got trash like 3 months ago. And im still watching One Piece. I've watched a fair bit of anime, but AoT is still my favorite. AoT really inspires me. 

1. AoT
2. One Piece
3. Naruto original series
4. Berserk
5. Death Note
6. Adventure Time
7. Rick and MortyI just got done watching Erased. The only thing i disliked was: The obvious Villain. There aren't that many characters in the story and the mysterious murderer is obviously someone we know. If there were more characters to fit the bill and not just the "nice guy" and the obvious bait guy. 

And the fact that a 29-year-old couldn't control himself around children. That made it kinda awkward sometimes.As i see it, MBTI has a goal that it accomplishes but that goal is blown out of proportion by the mbti community. What i mean by this is that, MBTI can't accurately predict behaviour, tendencies or overall personality as much as the community gives it credit for.

MBTI describes natural preference. I've said this a bunch of times on the MBTI subreddits. MBTI doesn't describe behaviour or profiency at using each function. 

ENTJs like using Te, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're smart or determined.

Anyways, to your question. As /u/Pytak said, most people look up to people who have good social skills. The community then catagorises the ENFJ as that guy/girl. Even though that's not accurate or scientific. An ISTP could be the most boisterous and social person in a room with 10 ENFJs. 

To conclude this long, shitty rant; The community takes MBTI to an extreme it can't really follow. The most MBTI can do for a type like yours is; "You don't typically like to dabble with emotions as much as you like tinkering with software." 

I feel like i didn't answer your question at all, but hopefully it helps?Are you serious?.. Don't put this much weight on MBTI, it's not scientific, its a self-help tool and very basic typology. You cannot assign attributes to types. You can only assign tendencies and even those are sketchy. 

Fe users are not proven to be more liable to lying, and they never will, because people are not their types. Atleast not their mbti types, maybe there is an undiscovered typology thing which is accurate but its not MBTI.i should but i just can't be bothered, your comment just seemed to most assumptious. 

"Truly an alien peoples" This makes me think you immediately treat people differently when you've assessed their types in your mind. That's just fucked up.Well, i wanted to make this a subtle PSA. I just want to remind everyone that MBTI can't accurately predict which type is more likely to some tendencies like lying.

As i said, i love playing with MBTI but some people just seemed to take it too seriously. You're right, if this subreddit was 100% serious and 'scientific' so to speak, it would be pretty dead. 

Anyways, what i wanna get at is just to hit a middle ground.It doesn't help that most INFPs tend to dislike their type leading to forcefully placing themselves in other types and/or selectively picking traits that kinda seem to suit them. 

Also it's hard to understand a person by reading maybe a small bio and text written not by an observer but the person himself/herself. So since INFPs are known to be "feels over reals" It's hard to judge when someone is being genuinely self-aware or just a little bit delusional in describing traits they don't actually show.

So the INFP label is just slapped on people that seem to have a bit too high regard for themselves in their own descriptions. That's how i feel like it is anyways. 

What the fuck, this guy responded to himself on an alt account..

He's not even trying to hide that they're tied to the same dude.

???I don't understand your question... What do i love about having Fi?.. I have a preference for using Fi, this is not something i've chosen. 

Maybe you think the functions have a specific goal or ability? This is not true. Te doesn't make you logical and efficient, it makes you like logical and efficient things. Same with Fi. I'm no more emotionally in-tune or naturally more empathetic than a thinking-type. I just like being introspective and think about things related to Fi.

This is why i don't understand the question. It's essentially: "What do you like about liking topics/problems/things/ related to Fi?" 

I've made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/51kurb/psa_mbti_is_function_preference_not_function/) about this about a month ago.This comment is useless. What do you expect me to do with this? Point out how my rhetoric is contradictory so i can make progress or show you how you've got it wrong.

There's a distinction between preference and profiency, if you haven't picked up on that then its probably why you think i'm contradicting myself. This may not relate to others, so it's better to post INFP stuff in /r/infp MBTI is an observation of 16 types of preference. And yes, it is indeed preference. There is no ultimate truth. (is that statement not an ultimate truth? no and yes, its just a paradox) As long as you're human, you're being subjective. That's just how it is, no 
matter how much you'd like to believe otherwise. You're actually saying it yourself, which i find funny. "Perception is where ideas differ" How can they differ if there is such a thing as ultimate logic or truth? Is it not because of subjectivity meddling with your ultimate logic?

Logic to you, doesn't necessarily mean logic to what we call an insane man.

And to the second section of your comment, no i am not. Im sorry. I'm saying the question is bad. 

What do i like about my perception? I don't know what do you like about seeing the colour blue as blue?

I like the colour blue because it makes me feel cold or something. That would be Fi working, but you can't go meta and think about what you like about thinking like you do. Because you need comparison and opposites to map this subjectivity out and create more subjectivity, which i don't have because i have thought like this all my life. I'm not subjective about my subjectivity, this is just nonsensical.

What is logic to you? Is logic that humans cannot be pink? no, that's empirical evidence coupled with inductive reasoning. Logic follows logic? What exactly do you mean? 1+2 = 3? There are in fact many kinds of logic.

There's a guy who has a degree in logic i think on the ENTJ board, maybe we need that guy to settle this. Maybe i'm just being a goof.

Yes, this is clearly going nowhere. You're saying the same stuff you said before so lets just end that here.

I will say this though Te doesn't make you efficient... You shouldn't mix idioms with something entirely different. "You are your thoughts" This is incredibly unscientific, literally incredible because you have no source. You're pulling this out your ass. 

MBTI is and has never been about describing the following: Attitude, behaviour, traits, profiency at using functions, intelligence or complete personality. It is only preference for functions which is why nobody is taking MBTI serious within the fields of psychology. It is in essence useless because you cannot produce consistent empirical results from the types. The empirical data collected from the MBTI types have little to no meaningful correlation between each other. NT's are not smarter than NF's even if you really want that to be true.

You're way too sure in what you think is true. I won't respond if you can't come up with anything you haven't said before.I don't know how to not seem like a phony but i think if you try to convince people that you aren't a phony, you'll be seen as a phony.

My advice is to not try at all. If you try to convince those guys, it'll probably backfire. It's so corny and not-constructive to say this, but let them be. If they say something that hurts you, just avoid them. Whatever your first instinct is in these situations, is probably the best action. That's what i think atleast.The best way to type yourself in my opinion is to look at the functions and determine your first 2 functions or atleast the first. What's your go to way to handle any problem? 

I think that the letters are too abstract and loose so they can kinda fit anyone. I'm an INFP but i thought of myself as a logical kind of person, i still do, but i know that it's because being logical is one of my values. It's not that i like being logical and find myself at home in it, it's that i like the trait of being logical...?? idk if that makes sense

So the letters and tests can be deceiving for sure.

Let's just start with the basics, what temperament (i think thats what its called) do you think you are. 

If you get upset at something someone said to you, is it because they appeared demeaning in their tone or the way they looked at you or is it because you think what they said was a personal attack?Ne is also a perception function, that's why it's weird to say "my mind thinks for me" with Ne. It implies judgement and the lack of it in Se.I live in Denmark, and atleast one of our job website business things use MBTI. I'm guessing its a western countries phenomenon.

Edit: i found out about it on the internet, the 16personalities website i thinkThat's a very insightful comment. I've seen some threads as of late such as "which type is more likely to lie?". This is not what MBTI is about. 

MBTI has a goal, which it accomplishes in my opinion. The goal is to describe each of the types preference for the 8 functions. The goal is not to describe traits such as tendency to lie, be dominant or submissive in interactions or anything like that. 

When i say that people are not their types, i don't mean it in a cliché sort of way as in "everybody is a unique snowflake" kinda deal. I mean that MBTI doesn't cover the behaviour, complete thought process, intelligence or anything of that sort in a type. It's possible that there's an undiscovered typology pattern in humans that can achieve that goal, but MBTI at it's current state isn't it. It describes that ESTPs like to use Se and Ti. This is what they like to use, but that doesn't mean they're bad at using Te or Si, they just don't *want* to use those functions, typically.

ENTJs aren't by nature smart and ISFPs aren't by nature amazing painters. 

I realize i can come across as annoying, but i just can't bear the thought of people relying on MBTI to determine whether they want to be friends with a person or not. ENFJ's can be assholes and INTJ's can be the nicest people. ENFP's can be well-structured and organized but typically they *like* to be chaotic and unorganized.

That aside, i love this subreddit and i love typing characters in shows and what not even if it's 'unscientific' or whathevevehrhehrdh. /rant
Gotta say I love your use of ƒ, 1˚, 2˚ and 3˚, haha. Something about your shorthand is very pleasing to me. :3Hahaha, if you can't settle, it's probably because of Ne man. Just being real. :P

In all total honesty, it took me a straight four years before I finally settled on my type, so...Thank you so much for these responses guys! They're seriously fantastic. Takes a lot to be so self-aware, so I really appreciate the input.

Thoughts I might give some of my own thoughts on my type too, since the responses have been so great....

Immaturity for INFP: kind of obtuse, really oblivious to anything going on around them, really caught up in their own head, world, emotions. So will, for example, in a conversation, just talk on and on about themselves or their own interests without considering the interest, emotions or comfort of the other person.

Maturity for INFP: more outwardly engaged. Using Ne to ask questions and explore the external world and the people around them. Showing interest in others and not just being self-absorbed. Even better is when they can learn to not just create idealized worlds and versions of themselves in their minds, but actively seek ways, however small, to actually do good and to do things they care about in real life...

Granted, still really young here. But just thoughts based on my personal growth thus far.
Distracting myself from the truth of my own mortality.The skill/enjoyment in manipulating her sister is totally at odds with both INxP types, though. INFP   
1. Chaotic Good  
2. Chaotic Good  
3. True Neutral or Lawful Evil Maybe Feeling dominants (ISFP, INFP, ENFJ, ESFJ) tend to be more receptive/accepting towards seeing the mental health dimension of their problems and getting help? I know plenty of other people of non-Feeling dominant types who, I would say, have mental health struggles, but they would not necessarily think of their issues in those terms, or seek out therapy or diagnosis. Fi is often associated with identity and values. If I wanted to know more about your identity and values, I'd ask you what you'd want to get from this job after doing it for ten years. Not where you see yourself or whatever, what you want, your hopes and dreams fulfilled. Being in touch with your Fi will help you maintain belief in yourself and your abilities regardless of the outcome of any one interview or prospect. You can't control how people react to you, but you can control how true you remain to your values and yourself, your strengths and your passions. Thich Nhat Hanh said, "My actions are my only true belongings. My actions are the ground upon which I stand." I would say that this prayer of his is a Fi prayer of sorts: https://presentheaven.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/thich-nhat-hanh-on-embracing-reality/  Based on my Goodreads account, in chronological order by date of reading:  Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card,
Beloved by Toni Morrison, On Writing by Stephen King, Bukowski in a Sundress by Kim Addonizio, and In Cold Blood by Truman Capote Based on your answer, I'd say that your Fi is pretty undeveloped, so working on it sounds like a probable answer to your anxieties. All of your goals are contingent on external validation, controlled by the opinions of others. Meditating on Fi would be looking primarily inward, in order to discover values and goals you can attain towards on your own, totally independent of your future position or company.  I honestly would not characterize your answer as idealistic--your goals are very pragmatic. Pragmatism is key to achieving your goals, as you've said, but if you don't invest time into learning about who you are, what message you want to express in the world, or what will make you feel fulfilled on your deathbed, even the most glowing victories will eventually become hollow.I've gotten the same results and I think it's because I'm an INFP who uses Ni frequently in my creative and business pursuits. Yep.Immature Fe users can come off judgmental because their emotions are more wired to their perceived well-being of the whole group, so they don't hesitate to make suggestions that are more personal to the individual members. For example, I can't count the number of times the Fe users (ISFJ, INFJ, ESFJ) in my life have suggested or hinted to me that I should drink less alcohol, even though I didn't solicit any advice or have any problems whatsoever related to drinking. They simply believe, based on their own values and experiences, that drinking is a bad habit for everyone, which I have no issue with, considering their life experiences. However, this introduces the next point: the judgmental vibe also stems from their tert or inf Ti, which tries to justify their preference as the objectively correct way of doing things for everyone, rather than a personal choice. 

In contrast, as a Fi user who has made many immature judgments, I would always "live and let live" when it came to those kinds of lifestyle decisions, but I would be more inflexible when it came to statements that I perceived as wrongly hurtful, such as sexist or racist comments. I struggle to emotionally attune to the speaker and understand where they are coming from in order to have a more diplomatic, hopefully productive conversation with them, as Fe users are more adept at doing (at least initially). However, I would characterize my stubbornness as more of "I don't want to be around that kind of hurtful speech, so I'm leaving, clearly you don't care about my views" rather than a Fe/Ti-based appeal to universality. This "appeal to universality" is probably the most concise way of explaining why Fe/Ti, as well as Ti/Fe, can be perceived as judgmental and restrictive towards individual differences. Personally, I see a LOT of Ne (tangential possibilities, lots of ideas bouncing around in your head) and not a lot of Ni (automatic big-picture thinking). I see you as a Ne-Si and Fi-Te user, probably an INFP. ENTPdom Ne: the walking and talking to mentally stimulate, the use of the "rant" to express your thoughts on random subjects, enjoying doing everything and nothing at the same time  
aux Ti: love for origami as a continuous challenge through diverse applications of the fundamental principle of the fold, also kind of the debate/critique style of your rants, your desire to "take time to analyze the right answer to things"   
tert Fe: strong ability to phrase speech tactfully, but sometimes you choose not to use it, "deeming conflict necessary," desire for legacy as a desire for social status, but without a clear shape     
inf Si: "over-narrativizing/theorizing" about the body and the self; aspire to dress well, but currently dress sloppy; "a lot of trouble deciding what kind of person I want to be"Right you are, I'll rephrase. ENTP because he definitely uses Ne as opposed to Ni.I can see INTP. The E vs I is, in my opinion, the trickiest distinction due to the same functions. The E's I know can all be very withdrawn at times (particularly ENFP, ESFJ, ENTJ) and not at all social butterflies, quite the opposite.People of every type can have goals and the ability to focus on their interests. I chose ENTP over INTP because I thought you seemed to be motivated by the exploration of possibility than the accretion and application of principles.Relevant, MBTI notes mine: "Whereas Plato (Ti), according to the Timaeus, regards physis as the result of poiesis, viz. the poiesis of the demiurge who creates from ideas, Aristotle (Te) considers poiesis as an imitation of physis. In short, the form or idea, which precedes the physis, contrasts with the living, which is the innate principle or form of self-motion. In other words, the technomorphic paradigm contrasts with the biomorphic; the theory of nature as a whole (Ti) with the theory of the living individual (Te)." (Ludger Honnefelder, "Natur-Verhältnisse" in Nature als Gegenstand der Wissenschaften (Freiburg, 1992, pp. 11-16))Si: Alternately, fantasize about the future and/or generally walk around in a daydream. I got 59% INFJ, 41% INFP, but my impression of the questions is that if you're not kind of an asshole, you'll get INFJ. INTP. Ti/Fe: 1-8, 10-16. Ne/Si: 9, 17, parts of 19INFP. Fuck you, but also, I enthusiastically support you reaching your full potential.As an INFP, can I be opposed to this entire conversation because I don't give a fuck? Haters gonna hate. I've read the whole thing and everyone in it kinda sucks at communicating coherently. To me, you come across as very clearly INTP, which, of course, uses the same functions as ISFJ, with different priorities. Based on what you've said regarding traditional courtesies, as well as (especially) your relationship, I see Ti-Fe as opposed to Fe-Ti. Your disengaging from your physical environment in favor of a vivid inner world (drawing upon your favorite stories), particularly when under stress, suggests Ne-Si to me rather than Si-Ne, as do the following quotes: "I do not care about what other people do, but I like to listen to what they 'know'" and "I've been told I act like I don't care about anything. I care about a lot." In my experience, high Si users are more in touch with what they care about and what they want to tell you in a conversation, rather than starting with the exploratory mindset you describe (not that high Si users aren't open to exploration, it just doesn't seem to be their first priority in a discussion).   Not really.If she's ISFJ, her Fe is--as someone else mentioned--very repressed. It's true that there's much more use of Si than Ti in her post.INFP. Combat to the death or the ability to jump really, really high. I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that I am a Si user and my brother is a Se user, and we both have that habit. It's significantly hereditary. Also, the MBTI functions inform about how you consider information, not about any behavior.
As an INFP, I'm pretty sure FI would help someone to see the world and morality as grayI think most INFPs would embrace this idea. I know I'm pretty used to being the underdog.1. Harry Potter
2. Jane Eyre
3. The DudeI could never get into the habit of studying but taking tests is something I've always been good at. As long as I pay attention in class I'll be alright
I think you've done a good job of capturing the range of how Fi can be expressed in this post. My one issue--or rather, point of clarification--is that your post could be interpreted to suggest that the unhealthy version of Fi is the normal or default version, and that Fi users would need to strive to become the latter.

In practice, most of the Fi I encounter leans towards the latter, rather than the former. For example, of the dozen or so Fi doms I've been close to (myself included), there's only one who was persistently selfish. And even then, I think her situation was bringing out the worst in her. Likewise, when I do see short-sighted or intolerant traits in Fi doms, it's usually when they're under a lot of pressure.









 As an Fi-dom I'd say that those first two scenarios that Peppermint described are spot on. No translation needed. They already pretty much describe my default state, and that of some of the other Fi-doms I'm close to, such as my mother. I feel good about it, I guess, but I can't say that I would call it "magnificent". For me it's pretty ordinary.

This is basically what we talk about and how we prefer to talk about it when everything is going well. I can lose the ability somewhat if I'm under a lot of external pressure, so I attempt to make life choices that keep that from happening, even though a casual observer may not realize that that's *why* I'm doing so. I think this can sometimes feed the perception that INFPs do weird shit for no reason, but it can be difficult to explain to others who don't have the same need.

I know you have some doubts about INFP self awareness, as well as a desire to have MBTI grounded in lived experience (and it seems that many of our experiences are quite different). But several of the people in my life would vouch for me and other Fi-doms on this, including my INFJ. This inquisitive perspective-shifting quality is also central to what makes me good at my job.

I can't really speak to whether it resonates with the Ni-Fe way of interacting with the world as well, though I do think sometime people of different types can use different functions to achieve a similar outcome.
She's not a redditor, and is only just starting to get into MBTI now, so I doubt that she'll want to get involved in this discussion directly, unfortunately. She hasn't been that keen on it when I've asked her before. But I can ask her again.If you have the time, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the differences between the primary 8 function models vs. Grant's model. I'm not new to any of this, but you seem have a rare knack for being both comprehensive and concise with your summary here, so I think it would be helpful to read nonetheless. (please &amp; thank you).Thanks for this clarification, and for your excellent overview in that other thread.

I get what you're saying here, though I also agree with Komatik. I think the discrepancy may be that you're describing how the 8 function models are intended to work, while Komatik is describing how many people in the MBTI subs approach 8 function models, and why they're drawn to them in them in the first place. 

It seems that some feel boxed in or bothered by the idea that they overwhelmingly favor four specific function attitudes, and that there are large areas of human experience that they habitually turn away from as a result of these preferences. For this kind of person, the notion that we use all eight functions has a lot of appeal.

I've seen this in ESTPs as well. They try not to show it, but they can be quite sensitive if you don't play along with whatever game they're playing.All of that stuff engages Ne just as much as it would engage Se. It's just that Ne users will process the experiences differently.

Maybe it would would help to think of adventurous spontaneity as associated with Pe in general, not just Se.&gt; but not having an objective framework to support the feeling wouldn't likely make that experience of hurt any less evident of an underlying problem.

Question: what does this mean? I tried parsing it, but the triple negative is throwing me off. Can you please rephrase?

By the way, as an INFP, I generally agree with what you're saying.Why do you think he was savage? I don't think the INFP description was particularly negative. 

If I had to nitpick, I'd say that he still understands INFJs better than INFPs (unsurprisingly). But given that he's aware of this and interested in having a dialog about it, I don't think it's a major issue.Yeah, I also think he does a great job, and I appreciate that he's still making an effort to understand his non-preferred axis better, as evidenced by his 90 minute Fe vs Fi ramble videos last week:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_57EUkdddVQ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL2nU1BiWlc

Also, in particular, I always liked the analogies for Fi/Te and Fe/Ti that he used in his Functional Axes video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unetLukpiV0

I think the "show" part of his videos was more compelling when he was using lots of images to illustrate his ideas. But a few weeks ago, he changed his format and stopped using them due to image royalty &amp; copyright issues. Alas...&gt; He does seem to over value the INFJ's use of Ti though.

Yes, I agree. He comes across as much more Ti-ish than the average INFJ, so I suspect his impressions of the type in general are skewed by his own personal experience.

There was a user named /u/WhatINeverSaid who had a theory that each type could be broken down loosely into two subtypes based on whether they expressed the aux or tert functions more, relative to other members of the same type. So you would have some INFJs who were more Fe-ish than average, and some who were Ti-ish than average. And he used Michael Pierce as an example of a Ti-ish INFJ. It was a really good post, but he deleted his account a few months ago, so I can't link to it.Thanks. I've come across several different models for subtypes, but this one was new to me.&gt; And I've heard that INFP is a mirror and INFJ is a sponge before somewhere.

Probably from Personality Hacker, or someone that reads or listens to their content. I've heard people call the thing that INFJ does "mirroring" as well; I don't think there's an officially correct terminology.&gt; both can appear to be "mirroring" because its how each type goes about feeling what the other is feeling, however Fi tends to recreate what they expect the feeling is (in the other) within themselves, whereas Fe tends to directly step into the shoes of the other. (stupid, presumptuous Fi types tend to act like they know what I'm feeling even when they're wrong about that, whereas strong Fe types often know what I'm feeling better than I do

To share a contrasting viewpoint, this hasn't been my experience of Fe vs Fi at all. If anything, I've found Fe dom/aux types to be more prone to misreading or overlooking what I'm feeling than Fi types. It seems like not having Fi creates a blind spot around certain areas of human experience for them, and it so happens that those areas are kind of my home base. Moreover, compared to Fi, Fe is often more interested in the present emotional state and less in exploring the depths of why that state came to be.

In any case, at this stage in my life, realistically, I doubt that I'll ever meet someone who knows what I'm feeling better than I do. There have been some occasions in the past where someone has picked up feelings that I had but was unaware of and revealed them to me, but that hasn't happened in a long time... at least 15 years, I'd say. I've done enough growth work in this area that it simply doesn't happen anymore. If anything, the tendency that some Fe users have--to believe that they know what I'm feeling better than I do--is more of an obstacle to true understanding because it requires me to persuade them first that there's a world of other stuff going on that's off their radar, which isn't always easy.

I'd be careful about assuming that Fe emotional reading is more accurate than Fi emotional reading. Really, types who use either function can be--and ideally should be--humble when it comes to picking up and interpreting what other people are feeling. And both can be stupid or presumptuous.

&gt; grasping this fully is quite unnerving--that this could happen--someone knowing you better than you know yourself--via Fi this is impossible at best they could break even, but Fe is capable of such a thing--it is a benefit of extroverted functions--Te can do it as well--"knowing" is used loosely here)

This is debatable. Firstly, whether it's even possible for another person to know you better than you know yourself is largely dependant on how well you know yourself. As I suggested above, the better you know yourself, the less likely this is to happen. Secondly, although Fe is more attuned to emotional atmosphere of the present social situation, Fi is more attuned to the depths of the human psyche. Which one does a better job of knowing what's going on with others will vary from situation to situation, and person to person.

It's important to realize that MBTI doesn't cover the full range of human cognition. It just indicates your preferences for how you process information and make choices, and whether you direct these processes toward the outside world or your inner world. 

As such, there most general human traits, skills, and behaviors don't map directly onto a single function alone. We all have memory, and are capable of empathy, logic, imagination, analysis, spontaneity etc. to varying degrees (with the odd exception, of course). Our function stack will influence how we go about these things, but it doesn't literally mean that you're using Si every time something reminds you of something else.

Having Si in your stack indicates that you prefer to reflect upon your sensory experiences over time, and are, to some degree, more interested in these reflections than in engaging with the outside world through sensory experience in real time, which is what Se does. The stereotypical (and some would say, unflattering) Si traits of liking routine, being traditional, or sticking with what's tried and true are just a few possible expressions of this reflective inclination, but by no means a given. But generally, this process of reflection motivates Si users to want to recreate past sensory experiences that they like, whereas Se users are more inclined to seek a broad range of novel sensory experiences.That would make sense for Keirsey since his whole model is behavior based, not function based. 

The central difficulty with typing by observation is that there's no way to see the cognitive functions directly because they're just mental constructs. But Keirsey didn't believe in cognitive functions to begin with, so... problem solved.Are you going to ask people to temporarily turn off their flair? It's easier to type someone when it says it beside their username.Lots of people think about stuff like this, so really it could be any type. But I'd agree that in terms of probability it seems more likely N than S, a little more likely F than T, and marginally more likely I than E.

I wouldn't recommend trying to type yourself based on a single thought, though, if that's what you're doing.Okay, so I take it then that you're assuming (probably correctly) that a number of participants may have previously mistyped themselves, and that in these cases, you want to see if you can determine their correct type from their writing?

Just wanted to understand your experiment better.Okay, cool. Thanks for explaining. I'm curious to see what arises.Oldham: http://www.npsp25.com/

I don't find Big 5 useful at all for self knowledge, though I can see how it would be better than MBTI for research purposes.On average, it seems to be:

Easiest: INFP, ENFP, ISTJ

Hardest: ISTP, ESTP

But I don't think stuff like this is carved in stone. Other, non-MBTI factors play an even bigger part. It also depends on the subject or type of conversation I want to have. It might be easy to talk about personal growth with one person, and logistics with a different person.Fi is often described as being really in tune with your own values--and that is a part of it--but it's so much more than that. Just as Ti is interested in and wants to model how things work from first principles, Fi is interested in and wants to model how people work intrinsically, and independently of the social context. It's basically about making subjective, qualitative evaluations and relating them back to the true nature of the self.

Where it gets interesting is that the more you explore the self via Fi, the more you begin to understand that although we're all different from each other, there's a level at which were all made from the same psychological ingredients, which are drawn from the collective unconscious. So understanding yourself in terms of these ingredients and how they relate to your values and actions helps you understand other people in the same terms, and vice versa. This is the key part that often gets lost: Fi, like all the introverted functions, is individualistic in a way, but it also can be universal and timeless.

As such, Fi:

* is really useful for understanding yourself, independently of group dynamics or the immediate culture you're in. This creates a degree of independence which I really enjoy.

* is equally useful for understanding others from the inside out, and cutting through their persona or mask to see the person hidden within.

* helps build relatedness and intimacy through sharing personal experience. Building on what I said in the second paragraph above, I find many of the most amazing conversations I've had have an Fi quality to them of comparing notes on discoveries that were made through self reflection. 

* helps me experience the warmth and security of human connection to others in a way that isn't so reliant on external harmony or social protocol. I love that, for myself, the sense of common ingredients that Fi fuels is always with me, and that it carries more weight.

* inspires a lot of great art, imbues it with emotional depth, and helps me experience art in a richer and more powerful way than I could without it.

* helps me make good decisions once Fi has had a chance to sort through psychology behind the decision. And although, Fi can be slow when I come across a completely new kind of decision and I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, once I've sorted it out, it becomes super quick and reliable.

Of course, I'm not suggesting that any of these experiences are exclusive to Fi users, but these are some of the things that Fi is most suited to.Yes, pretty much this. I don't think any of us can say definitively that our experience of love is better than another person's. But anecdotally, Fi-doms seem to pay more attention to their emotional life (for better or worse) and experience emotions more intensely than other types on average. Higher highs and lower lows.No problem; thanks for asking. Yes, I both love and make art (though I meant "art" in the most general sense--music, poetry, dance, comedy, film, design, etc.). The way you respond to art also sounds very Fi-ish, and I can relate to it. What type are you, by the way?It's a good essay, though. :)Thanks!&gt; I just like being introspective and think about things related to Fi.

Just expand on this, and you've answered the question.It's also because he was trying to align the Myers-Briggs types with the four classical temperaments, and he thought that doing it this way was a better fit.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter#Historical_development

If I remember correctly, he explains this in Please Understand Me II

http://www.celebritytypes.com/test/infp-or-intp.phpIt is? I guess you're suggesting that most people would assume that the average or median rating is 5 (or somewhere between 5 and 6), and then rate themselves according to that.

I would have thought most people would assume an asymmetrical scale with an average iaround 7, since we tend to use those kinds of scales in rating schoolwork, movies, etc. where 6/10 wouldn't be considered an above average rating.With that test, it's also worth reviewing the questions and reflecting upon which answers are meant to be the INTP answers and which are the INFP answers, and why. This may help shed some light on how the two types are different.

Or you can try listening to this and see if it helps:

http://www.personalityhacker.com/phq-questions-intp-vs-infp/
Can you clarify what you consider "self analysis" and what you don't? The term is just as open to interpretation as "self aware". If you mean mainly self-training specifically around to skill development, then I'd agree with you--STPs seem to have the edge on that one.I agree; that series of videos did me a world of good in understanding and appreciating the Fe-Ti axis, as well as giving me ways to bridge any gaps in understanding they have towards me as an Fi-Te user.Adding to what others have said about Fe not always being accommodating... Fe can also be very directive, as in it can try to shape the preferences and moods of the group in order to achieve the kind of external alignment it seeks. I think you're more likely to see it used this way the higher up it is in the Fe user's stacks. It makes sense that both responses you got were from Fe doms, who tend to be natural leaders and will use their Fe to shape the social dynamic.

Also, Fi is generally more connected to other people than it appears, mainly because the connections it makes are asynchronous (or at least less synchronous than Fe). In other words, it is less attuned to the social dynamics in the immediate surroundings because it is more interested in shared human experiences that aren't dependent on the immediate surroundings. 

This is most visible in the part of the video where Garfield goes on about how he wishes that everyone could have the opportunities he had to pursue his passion and develop his greatest gifts (or something like that... going by memory here). He's actually being very other-focused--just not in a way that's tethered to the moment.Do you have any evidence of this? I don't use Ti when I answer these kinds of questions.

Isabel Myers had this to say about IQ test:

&gt; "Conventional measures of mental ability, such as intelligence tests and scholarship, show some of the very highest records belong to INFP and INFJ types, who relegate thinking to last place or next to last. The preference for thinking appears to have far less intellectual effect than the preference for intuition, even in some technical fields, such as scientific research, where its influence was expected to be important.
&gt;
It would seem, therefore, that the mark of a thinker is not so much the possession of greater mental powers but having them run on a different track. Thinkers are at their best with the impersonal, and they are the most able to handle things that need to be done impersonally."
*- Gifts Differing* p66

I think you may be making mistaken assumptions about which functions are needed to solve particular problems.I usually find other INFPs easy to get along with. I'm not quite sure what you mean in your second sentence ("I'm guessing Fi is up there"), but I find that most of the time, the Fi-doms I know leave a lot of space for other people's subjectivity, so there isn't much conflict between us.Yes. It's only effective for tasks that require a low level of attention/thought/skill/accuracy to begin with, where you don't really care about your productivity.Both like to do their own thing. Their own way. In their own time.The function stack doesn't determine the chronological sequence in which you use the functions, though. It doesn't literally mean that you must use your dominant first, then your aux, and then your tert, and so on.

As a judging dominant, I generally observe first and then draw conclusions from my observations (because that's usually what makes the most sense to do). But human perception is never truly universal; even for P-doms, it's always filtered to some degree by our interests, biases, past experiences, etc. In my case, as an INFP, I think the range of things I perceive is influenced by what my dominant function is currently interested in or working on, which is quite different from acting or deciding before observing.But I'm also saying that we all choose what to observe to some extent, whether we do it consciously or not. In other words, that there isn't really such a thing as universal unfiltered human perception. The filters are not necessarily dependent on a Jungian judging function. 

...And that it's impossible to verify that you haven't unwittingly omitted something from your observations because you won't notice what you didn't notice because, well, you didn't notice it in the first place.I don't find it to be all that different from disagreeing with people of other functions/types, to be honest. I guess the style of arguing and the things people argue about may vary according to function, but the underlying heart of conflict is generally the same. 

That said, I'm not sure I've ever met another NFP with a *completely* opposing worldview, to my knowledge. Why do you find that NFP friends are usually extremely cautious and skeptical of each other?

edit: forgot a wordWhich types? IPs and INJs. 

INFJs are an unusual case in that they usually good at playing along, so they will appear to fit in while still feeling that they are misfits. 

All four IxxP types like to do their own thing and tend to think that society is often wrong, so it's better not to try to fit in all the time.

Edit: Also, any person who is in the minority gender for their type, as has been mentioned elsewhere. E.g. female ENTJs, ENTPs, or male INFPs, ENFPs, etc.No. For example, the reverse is true with myself and my INFJ: I want to talk about while she wants to cool down first and talk some other time.Although I find Heidi Priebe's content hit and miss, I think she described the Fe/Fi split pretty well in this article. Of course, her descriptions here are written in a way that's flattering and idealized; she's describing the full potential of each function more than the messy actuality.I think the main proponent of this pairing was David Keirsey, who thought the ideal match for any type is obtained by switching every letter except for S &amp; N.

My sister is an ENTJ and we get along very well, but even if we weren't siblings, we would have made a terrible couple. I think that for me, having an ENTJ partner would likely have been great for the business &amp; practical aspects of a relationship but unsatisfying for the emotional aspects. But I also think it depends on the individual. 

Gender can also play a factor, since ENTJ is considered a more traditionally masculine type, and INFP traditionally more feminine.
&gt; I feel he must have really missed the importance of cognitive functions.

Well... he didn't believe in the cognitive functions and developed his own model without them, so I guess that would be an understatement.This is so true of myself and my ENTJ sister. If only I got paid the big bucks just for being talkative. But only about things that interest me. And only when I'm in the mood.

Yeah, I've always found that behavior so bizarre. Like, why not just give people things they actually want or need, and let them respond accordingly? I don't think that Fe users always fall into that pattern or anything, but it is fairly common.FWIW, the founder of Personality Hacker types him as a definite INFP. It's just another opinion, but unlike the rest of us, she actually knows him (her brother was Martin's assistant for a few years, or something like that).If you're making a list and you want each point to be on its own line, make sure you hit enter/return twice before each new line. Otherwise it formats it all as one paragraph, making it hard to read. (I'm guessing that's what you were going for).Thanks for taking the time to write this series. You've done a great job of distilling the essence of Jung's descriptions into a much more readable form. 

I think these posts would be good candidates for the sidebar.Oh man... I'd evict them. I'm a bit anal about putting stuff in the dishwasher in a way that saves space and increases the chance that everything will be cleaned properly, so I feel your pain. Not sure that this can be blamed on FiNe, though.Sugar and salt dissolve into the water, becoming a part of it, but also altering its composition. Pebbles retain their essential form and remain distinct entities.In practice, Fi also picks up the emotions of others but the mechanism by which this happens is different from that of Fe. For example, in a social situation, my INFJ and I will both pick up the vibe of the room, or things that are going on with others. 

The main difference is that she's somewhat more attuned to and she places more importance on social dynamics based around the unspoken agreements we make on how to conduct ourselves, including interpersonal politics. Whereas I'm more attuned to and place more importance on what's going on with people individually, and separate from the surrounding social dynamic. 

In my experience, Fi users are often stronger at the latter than Fe users. But overall, they balance each other out, and Fe and Fi can cover a lot of the same territory.Why does it suck to not have it?Interesting description. Where's it from, originally?Thanks. I took a look there and it was a good read. For me, some aspects of socionics resonate better than others.Yeah, I've never found that intertype relations held up well when I tried applying them to people I know. They also have some weird physical type descriptions (e.g. "Frequently has a disproportionate figure, often squat in physique and prone to corpulence. Gait may be a bit clumsy and waddling.").

Although I'm not convinced that 8 function models are more accurate or true than 4 function models, I do find value in their ideas about how we relate to the shadow functions.Since most of the answers you got were along the lines of "Myers wuz dumm", you may want to read up on the actual reason why, which she explained in detail in the first chapter of *Gifts Differing*, pages 12-14 (or 14-16 of the pdf file):

https://www.cpp.com/pdfs/7270.pdf

In a nutshell, to an observer, it's more difficult to see the auxiliary function of introverts than their dominant function simply because the dom *is* introverted, and therefore, hidden. Introverted functions are difficult to see in action, period. For example, as an INFP, my Ne are often more visible than my Fi in a social or work setting (the same holds for Te and Si, to some degree).

There are some advantages to this approach--namely that it highlights the similarities between E/I type pairs (e.g. INFP &amp; ENFP), and that it reflects how people engage with the outside world vs. the inner world, which was, apparently, of primary importance to Jung in the first place.

The obvious disadvantage is that it's more confusing when you're first learning about cognitive functions and how to translate the letter codes into a stack. But the reality is that most people are never going to become MBTI/Jungian Typology geeks anyway, so does that really matter? They were going for maximum accessibility for the general public, and that's what they achieved.I heard a podcast on Personality Hacker a while ago where they addressed this. I think it was this one:

http://www.personalityhacker.com/phq-questions-can-sensors-speak-intuitive-language/

IIRC, their take was that many sensors are fluent in intuitive-style conversations but they may get bored with it much more quickly.It's a Socionics term. Strictly speaking it isn't part of Myers-Briggs type theory, but many people here are using a hybrid of the two theories rather than just sticking to one.I really like their podcast. They cover a lot of interesting topics relating to personal growth outside of Jungian typology, and have some keen observations about Myers-Briggs functions and types that a rarely see discussed elsewhere. 

By my observations, their understanding of the MBTI is pretty solid, and I like that it's grounded in people's real world experiences, rather than purely theory driven. And I like the fact that they approach the theory as a model which may or may not be useful in real life, rather than being attached to it being 100% "correct".

I think their podcast is better than their videos and written content--they seem much more at home with that medium. I've never used any of their paid services so I have no idea how good they are with that, though I suppose I might consider them if I was looking for that sort of thing. It doesn't bother me at all that it's a business; it's not like they're doing a hard sell.

I think the car model is just okay. The biggest problem with it is that by using it, they have to refer to everything twice--once by their own terminology, and once by standard terminology--which makes the discussion more cumbersome and ultimately forces the listener to do more work, not less. But they've been doing it that way for long enough that I guess they're stuck with it.


To be fair,

1) They're a personal growth site first and a typology site second. They actually delve into many models for personal growth--it's just that most of them are outside of Jung and Myers-Briggs (e.g. flow, imago therapy, NLP, Maslow, systems theory, etc.).

2) They don't claim that growing your aux is the cure-all for everyone, just that it's beneficial for many people if their aux seems to be weak, or as you mentioned, for breaking a dom-tert loop. They've discussed other approaches, but said that the main reason they keep repeating the aux thing is that it seems to have the most yield for the widest range of people.

3) The ego block &amp; shadow function stuff is Socionics, not MBTI. I'm aware that many users here like to cross-pollinate the two, but I don't think that doing so should be seen as a necessity.They're aware that INFJ and INFP are totally different on the inside, and they've talked at length about how they're different. They've also challenged the J/P stereotypes the same way that you're doing, so I'm not sure where the disagreement is.

I think the "INFx Unveiled" thing is some sort of course or program that one of their colleagues runs. I have no idea how good (or shitty) it is. But I don't think it's entirely unreasonable to want to create a program for both INFJs and INFPs. The two types have completely different internal wiring, yes, but they often have similar interests and values, and deal with similar obstacles in life. That said, I'm not exactly looking to sign up.
Yeah, the course is promising quite a lot. The marketing language they're using doesn't appeal to me, but that said, I don't necessarily think it's predatory to offer a paid service to people who are looking for it. People are free to make their own choices. Maybe someone will get something out of it. It's possible that the course is actually good. Who's to say? Either way, it isn't even PH's course, though I guess there's guilt by association.

I'm not sure why just those two types, but my somewhat educated guess is that either: 

a) the person running the course is and/or has a lot of personal experience with INFJs and INFPs and is hoping that there's someone out there who could benefit from it (the product-driven "sell what you've got" approach).

or

b) they've found that there are a lot of INFJs and INFPs floating around who say they want to heal their inner wounds and find their true purpose, so they decided to respond to an existing need (the market-driven "give people what they want" approach).

I suspect it's more the latter, and that other types haven't stepped forward with those same needs to the same degree.










Out of curiosity, why do you view it as being geared towards Fe types?Sudoku, crosswords and IQ tests aren't really Te tasks. If you really want to Te, figure out a practical, long-term, concrete goal and develop a plan to work towards it. Work on it a steadily each day. When making decisions, set aside your personal preferences in favor of whatever advances your project towards the goal most effectively. 

Then start enlisting other people to work on it as well and shift your focus from working on the goal directly yourself to guiding and directing others towards accomplishing a goal. Ultimately, you want to build a self-sustaining system around you that achieves the goal for you without a lot of personal effort, using other people as components within the system.

That is what Te does. It's also why Te doms get paid the most. The logic puzzles are just... logic puzzles. They aren't function-dependent.Well, there's this quote from Isabel Myers:

&gt; It would seem, therefore, that the mark of a thinker is not so much the possession of greater mental powers but having them run on a different track. Thinkers are at their best with the impersonal, and they are the most able to handle things that need to be done impersonally.

When making decisions, thinkers are more likely to see the soft stuff (values, emotions, social expectations, relational harmony) as noise in the system, while feelers are more likely to see it as useful information.No prob :)Okay, I'll play:

1) JOY - Great performances of art--could be emotionally powerful music, or a well told story. New discoveries, as well... particularly anything that helps me grow.

2) SAD - The premature death of a beautiful idea.

3) ANGRY - False accusations. Being treated dismissiveley, especially by a loved one.

4) DISGUST - Excessive filth and decay. Certain types of creepy crawlies (e.g. I'm not too fond of maggots).

5) FEAR - Unfulfilled potential.Not that I know of, but once you're familiar with the dichotomies (or the cognitive functions, if it's a function test), it becomes obvious what each question is getting at. I think most of us could game the test to give any result we want.

If you're curious about specific test questions, post them here and I'm sure I or someone else could tell you.&gt; has thrown me under the bus so many times ... he unequivocally has my back

??

How does this work? Is it like he only buses you in some situations, but always backs you in others?

Not bad. Off by one letter and one number. Do you want to try again, or should I just tell you?Interesting. Thanks for sharing. He sounds like a classic ESTP. Thankfully, most people (myself included) become more balanced and well-rounded over time.INFP 4w5. :) Why do you see 3?Yeah, I figured it was that one. I could maybe see 3 if that fear were my main motivator, but it isn't... at least not directly. I'm ultimately more motivated by self-expression and a sense of duty to share my insights with others for their benefit. I think it's more of a 4w5 integrating into 1 sort of thing.

Good job, though. Thanks. I've actually never asked anybody to type me before, either in MBTI or enneagram. And no-one has ever challenged my types either, so it was an interesting experiment.So what did you learn?Nope. I'm an INFP who prefers music that matches my mood and finds it easy to solve logic puzzles. I'm skeptical of your criteria.

No need. Been through that already, long ago; definite INFP. 

First three times I took the official MBTI test I scored ENTP, then INTP, then INFP, which is what I've always gotten since then if I answer accurately. So I've come from thinking I was an NTP to realizing I'm an NFP.

INFP is also correct in terms of cognitive functions. I'm clearly an Fi-dom, and clearly favor Te over Ti or Fe as well.

It's actually fairly common for INFPs to be good at logic puzzles, along with INs in general (which can be inferred from Myers' research on the subject of types and IQ). I have no idea where your theory about mood and music comes from, though you can elaborate if you like.Cool. Looking forward to it.Then maybe you should clarify your question ("Do you find it easy to solve logical puzzles?") to indicate that you're referring primarily to logic puzzles of unusually large scope and complexity that most INFPs would lose interest in before done. Generally, the term "puzzle" suggests smaller scale stuff.

You are correct that I'm usually not willing to invest weeks, months, or years to solve a challenging logical problem, but I'm fine with minutes, hours, or days, which is well within the scope of common standard tests of logical ability such as IQ tests, college admissions exams, and a lot of applied math. All of which I do well on. I'd hate to be a pure mathematician, though.





But isn't cynicism ultimately the product of idealism and disappointment? I think most cynics actually are idealists.Can you list all the specialized versions (assuming it isn't crazy long), or alternately, post a link that has them. I've never heard of these before.Thanks for doing this!

So, according to the official MBTI theory, what are the implications of the tertiary being "neutral"? A few possible interpretations off the top of my head:

1) the tert is neither introverted nor extraverted, but remains "ambiverted", or fixed as right down the middle.

2) the tert is able to shift fluidly between intro- and extra- at will (or it does so unconsciously as needed).

3) the tert is fixed as either intro- or extra-, but it varies from person to person.

4) the tert is fixed as either intro- or extra-, and it's the same for everybody, but because of the controversy, they're not willing to declare which theory is correct (EIII vs EIEI). So they're hedging their bets by leaving it as "open to debate" or "TBD".

By the way, Naomi Quenk used this very same "E-I-neutral-I" approach in her book "Was That Really Me", citing the 4th reason (controversy, open to debate).

Ok. Thanks.BTW the "Change all the letters except N/S" thing isn't really an MBTI thing--it's a David Keirsey thing.&gt; According to type theory and the "type house" model all 3 of those types including mine are right next to eachother and likely to get along easily. 

What is the "type house" model? I've also never heard of this.

Not boring at all :). This actually raises another question:

&gt;  the main reason the tertiary is neutral is because the official MBTI institute doesn't have enough statistical evidence to prove one theory over the other.

So am I correct in inferring that the MBTI institute conducts statistical research on the validity of the other functions of the stack? 

This comes as a big surprise; I had thought that it was difficult-to-impossible to generate stats on cognitive functions directly since they're so nebulous and haven't been proven to exist in the first place. And that this is why the psychology profession favors models such as Big 5, and Isabel Myers based her statistical research on the dichotomies instead of the functions.

If they do have statistical evidence to support the other parts of the function stack, I'd be curious to know what it is. The only studies I know of are Dario Nardi's research, which even he says should be viewed as "exploratory" rather than as hard science.I'm not the OP, but it's important to remember that the J/P dichotomy is defined as how you relate to the exterior world only, and that means that you will have the opposite relationship to your interior world.

In other words, using your definitions, J types like schedules and discipline in the outside world so they can remain flexible and less disciplined in their inner life. On the other hand, P types are actually more disciplined than J types in their inner life, which allows them to be flexible and less disciplined in how they interact with their environment. The reason why the J/P dichotomy sort of works anyway is that it's focused on the exterior world, which more often translates into observable behaviors such as neatness, punctuality, spontaneous action, etc (though not always).

As such, you can't really make a valid blanket statement about whether J or P is more disciplined or flexible overall, because the distinction actually lies in the *context* in which they apply that discipline or flexibility.Sorry if my answer rubbed you the wrong way. Hopefully OP will come back and give you the answer want.Excellent, thanks!Paraphrasing from [the last time this question came up](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5qr3um/i_vs_e_function_stacks_question/dd8dq21/):

&gt;You may want to read up on the actual reason why, which Isabel Myers explained in detail in the first chapter of Gifts Differing, pages 12-14 (or 14-16 of the pdf file):

&gt;https://www.cpp.com/pdfs/7270.pdf

&gt;In a nutshell, it's easier for an observer to see the auxiliary function of introverts than their dominant function, simply because the dom *is* introverted, and therefore, hidden. Introverted functions are difficult to see in action, period. For example, as an INFP, my Ne is often more visible than my Fi in a social or work setting (the same holds for Te and Si, to some degree).

&gt;There are some advantages to this approach--namely that it highlights the similarities between E/I type pairs (e.g. INFP &amp; ENFP), and that it reflects how people engage with the outside world vs. the inner world, which was, apparently, of primary importance to Jung in the first place.

&gt;The obvious disadvantage is that it's more confusing when you're first learning about cognitive functions and how to translate the letter codes into a stack. But the reality is that most people are never going to become MBTI/Jungian Typology geeks anyway, so does that really matter? They were going for maximum accessibility for the general public, and that is what they achieved.INFP

Reflective: 9

Intuitive: 9

Global: 7Interesting observation. By this...

&gt; brutal Fe means that goals are set specifically with adverse effects toward people in mind.

...do you mean setting goals with adverse effects toward people who disrupt the social order? Or something else? It seems that brutal Fe is usually still trying to "serve the people" in some way, but can be callous toward outsiders because it sees the outsiders as the problem to be solved.Good points in the first and second paragraphs. Thanks for answering!

&gt; Also Fe is not as judgmental of outsiders as Fi (especially NFP) can be. ....  Strong Fi is more likely to seek assimilation (a lot of SJWs are NFPs for example) - seeing one right way to be and anything else as wrong.

My experience hasn't supported this, though. Is there any way you can back up this claim, preferably through evidence rather than theory?&gt; But the salient point is that they reject people they see as having "chosen" to be "wrong" - they see a large group that includes 'acceptable' people, and then another group of people who have "chosen" to not do the "right" thing. They don't feel bad prejudging those people because they see it as that person's decision rather than an inherent part of their identity. The issue (from my perspective) is that they see it that way regardless of how they've set up their camps lol.

Yeah, I don't really relate to this, both in terms of myself or other Fi users (or NFPs especially) that I know.

&gt; But the question I have is - what about the working-class whites? ... Do they receive the same acceptance and open-mindedness?

Yes, for the most part. Of course there are people who I relate to much more easily than others based on common interests or point-of-view or lifestyle or whatever. And I also have misconceptions about others from time to time. But one of the main features of my experience of Fi and Ne is that when I come across someone who seems very different from me, or at least to have different beliefs, I'm particularly eager to learn more about them and what life is like from their own point of view. I ask a lot of questions. I'm pretty good at creating a non-judgmental space in which they feel free to open up--and people do open up with me quite freely because they can tell that my apparent openness toward them is genuine.

Overall, I'm really not very tribal. I know that I'm just one example, though I'm not particularly atypical amongst other Fi-users I know (to be fair, I've also seen similar levels of openness in many Fe-users as well). I'd say that for myself, your description was more accurate when I was in my teens and early 20s, but it started to change by my mid-20s. Whatever Fi-driven opinions I do have now are more likely to fall under personal preference than under broad classes of what's good and bad.

Where are you drawing your conclusions from? Is it mainly a blend of socionics theory and your observations? I noticed that you said in one of your other comments that...

&gt; it's important for a lot of Deltas to not discuss or acknowledge the fact that they do actually split people into groups based on their perceived characteristics. I think it is not something most of them can necessarily even perceive in themselves

...which is possible, I suppose. But it's also possible that the theory is flawed. I'm all up for probing the dark corners of my psyche to reveal uncomfortable truths, but having done a lot of work in that area already, I don't get the sense that this is quite on the mark--whether for me or for most other NFPs I'm close to.



I don't know that any of this can be proven, per se. And if it's a lot of trouble for you to dig something up, don't worry about it. It's not that big deal for me. :)

But since you asked, I was more looking for anything concrete that could at least help substantiate the claim that a lot of SJWs are NFPs. Or the related implicit claims that NFPs are disproportionately SJWs as compared to, say, NFJs, and that it makes sense to look at NFPs through that lens, since we're talking about Fi vs Fe. I mean, it's an easy thing to say, but I don't know if it's actually true, statistically. 

Also, when you bring up SJW, I'm not totally clear on whether you're extending that to people involved in social justice and activism in general, or only to people who are unreasonably judgmental and/or hostile toward those who disagree with them. SJW isn't a term that I use at all, nor do I hear it in real life--only online--so it's also possible that I'm not understanding you correctly.
No worries. It's not that I was bothered by the idea of the aristocratic trait being a negative one--I guess it's that I'm skeptical of the model altogether. To be honest, I've always found the socionics model to be pretty hit-and-miss in its descriptions and concepts when I try to apply them to myself, people I know, or to real life situations. I haven't investigated it thoroughly so I'm not totally discounting it, but I've gotten a lot more out of the four function models than any of the eight-function variants (Socionics, Beebe, Berens).

Thanks for the background on aristocratic vs. democratic, though. Really interesting.

&gt; What it sounds to me like you're describing ... is not that you've managed to erase your discernment as you've gotten older ..., but actually that you've managed to increase and refine it - to become more discerning rather than less. Instead of grouping people based on large, messy labels, you've become more able to approach and judge people based on just a few traits or characteristics, the ones that you consider most important to evaluate.

Hmmm... I wouldn't describe it this way, but I'm willing to toy with the idea for now.Why are you dating my dad?!

But seriously, your boyfriend sounds just like my dad, who is an ISTJ. I agree with others here that your BF may be mistyped. ISFJs can sometimes be judgmental, just as anyone can be, but usually not in the way you described. 

Odds are that he really believes deep down that he has found the correct way of doing things, and thinks he's doing you a service by trying to help you become what he sees a better version of yourself, and genuinely doesn't realize that he's stepping all over the real you and being hurtful. 

I'm not sure how much success you'll have in persuading him to back down from his position and to leave some room for gray between the black and white. If you can't, then I think you're going to have to figure out whether you can live with someone like that as your partner. It's really not easy, but it can be done; it's just a question of whether his good qualities make it worth it to you to do so.Yeah, all of what you just said sounds very ISTJ to me. Many Te/Fi spend a lot of time helping other people and putting their needs before their own as well.Nope. I like talking on the phone almost as much as talking face to face. The lack of visual cues doesn't bother me when I'm talking to people I know, since people give off auditory cues as well. I'm probably even more attuned to tone of voice and changes in the rhythm and timing of how someone says something than I am to facial expressions and body language. 

Whenever this has been brought up here or on other mbti-related subs, a clear correlation between phone phobia and type or functions as never emerged--just a lot of DAE mee too. Dario Nardi's research found a link between strong Fi and sensitivity to tone of voice--which I guess you could use to explain me--but it doesn't explain all the other INFPs who say that they have trouble without visual cues.

I think the biggest factor in this is generational change. Not long ago, the phone was the only way to communicate with somebody who wasn't there with you, short of mailing them a letter. Since there were no other options, it motivated you to learn how to pick up auditory cues, or at least to get over your anxiety about them. It's just a skill, like any other.

That said, I'm totally phobic about making customer service or tech support calls.ENFPYes and no--they can to some degree, but not fully (it depends on how you define your terms).

For a more in depth answer, Dario Nardi talked about this a bit in his AMA, the link to which is in the sidebar:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/18gudp/ama_with_typologist_dario_nardi/c8epyrq/

&gt; Culture and upbringing do a play part. So Americans need to know how to display or mimic extraverted Thinking (TJ) behaviors. Whether their brains work that way is another matter.

&gt;I do find people can over-estimate their proficiency with functions in the opposite attitude. That is, an INFJ might report comfort doing Ne and Fi, and generally, neither the behavior nor the brain activity support the self-assessment.

&gt;By way of anecdote, I recall an INFJ at a type conference engaging in my a chat about analogies and how INFJs do these well. An ENFP and an INTP came over to us and one of them cracked a joke. The joke was an abstract analogy that sounded like jibber-jabber to someone who doesn't do Ne. But I've spent years with ENFPs and I understood the joke immediately and added to it, though how I managed to add to it effectively, well, that was pure random serendipity. The INFJ didn't get the joke at all. In fact, she seemed unaware a joke had occurred. Nor could she add to it. That said, I wouldn't be surprised if, in her creative writing time, that INFJ effectively uses metaphor and such all over the place. But she can't do it in real time or apply it on dozens of questions or problems at once.

&gt;In the EEG, I have never seen an INFJ or INTJ -- either college age or among the 3 midlifers -- meet the criteria for the "Christmas tree" pattern so common with ENTP and ENFP, and present at times for INTP and INFP. That form of cross-contextual thinking is just not happening in the brain.

&gt;I'm confident that people can learn to produce the "products" of all 8 functions. Steve Myers has done some great work on "products" on the functions. But that's different from actually using those functions.If you are an INFP, it is not possible to be Ni dominant in any of the variations of Jungian Typology (original Jung, Myers-Briggs, Socionics, Beebe, etc.). What is entirely possible, and quite likely, is that one or more of the tests you took is inaccurate.

I test as INFP on nearly every dichotomy-based test, but function tests (including Keys to Cognition and the various ones at Similar Minds), usually tell me I have high Ni and/or Ti, though I really don't think I do. 

Personally, I think the function tests don't work because they make too many assumptions about which functions produce which results (e.g. if you threw a football, you must have used Se). Other models may have other explanations. According to Socionics, for example, some of your shadow functions are strong but not highly valued, though I'm not sure if that applies here.

I get INFP either way. I typed as ENTP and then INTP the first two times I took the official test, but I think that had more to do with where I was in the ongoing process of self-discovery, rather than a built-in flaw in the test or the underlying model.I agree, though I think a lot of the time, the motivation for wanting to explain/clarify/correct comes from mistakenly assuming that others are as interested as we are in understanding how we actually work, as opposed to doing it out of defensiveness or butthurt. 

In my case, I instinctively want to engage in Fi/Ne/e4 style conversations about the inner workings of human nature and how they relate to identity and the choices we make (for myself and for others). And I'm generally interested in how people self report their experiences. When you're online, it's easy to get in a situation where you think that the other party is more open to that type of conversation than they actually are. Eventually, I realized that it's usually not worth the trouble.

P.S. Haven't seen you around in awhile. Doing well?Yeah, I'm good too. I've also been busy with real life over the past year, so I haven't been posting much. 

Also, in keeping with my previous post, I got kinda bored with explaining how Fi works over and over again to different people. I've had success with it in the past, but the constant turnover of users combined with the ephemeral nature of Reddit posts meant that made it seem like I wasn't really accomplishing anything, so I decided to put that energy into other things. I still love talking about this stuff in person, though. Well said. I wish I had something to add, but you covered pretty much everything.I'm an INFP and my spatial and mathematical/logical intelligences are measurably much higher than my verbal and social. 

Contrary to stereotypes, there are a lot of INFs that are very strong at math, though I also know others who struggle with it.Nonsense. I'm an INFP and I choose music to match my mood, while my INFJ chooses music to alter hers. It's possible that we're anomalies, but more likely that the writer is just full of crap.Interesting test. I had a much easier time with the YES section than the NO section since I can see many different parts of myself, covering a wide range of traits in different situations.

It gave me a tossup between INFP and INFJ, along with a tie-breaker question. Based on that answer, it incorrectly concluded INFJ (NiFe).

Given that this test took longer than most others and wasn't more accurate (for myself, at least), I'm ultimately not sure how worthwhile it is.Being concise is easy.

Guessing how long/short/simple/detailed/surface/in-depth of an answer the other party would like to hear can be difficult since few people bother to articulate that. What's too long or rambly to you is likely perfect for another person.

But if you ask me to answer something in 30 seconds or less, I'll usually pull it off in 28.

Unfortunately, it sounds like you're the one who isn't treating yourself with respect. And by extension, you're projecting that out onto all INFP males instead of just working on your own issues.

As one counterexample, my life isn't perfect but there are lots of people who respect me, even when they don't always understand me.I'd suggest seeking out some of the user surveys that have been done here in the past. This is perhaps the most recent one:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4yaeqh/big_fun_reddit_mbti_survey/&gt; Although I'm sure I've heard the idea of dominant-function-as-flow-state used in a more general context... ?

Personality Hacker uses this concept, based in part on the neuroscience work of Dario Nardi. If I remember correctly, he found that using your dominant function helps you to achieve a flow state. But also that Ni doms tend to have a more meditative or "zen-like" brain state be default, (though it comes at the expense of being somewhat detached from their surroundings--inferior Se). 

So, in that sense, you're both correct... if we can assume that Nardi knows what he's talking about. His AMA is in the sidebar, by the way, though I don't think he mentioned flow there.Nothing offhand... I'm not very literary, though I do read my share of non-fiction. I'll see if I can think of anything. I never read Les Mis, nor did I see the stage version. Just the film from a few years ago, but I wasn't all that into it so I don't have much of an opinion.

One other point: though Ni is strongly linked to archetypes and the collective unconscious, the other introverted functions are too to varying degrees--Fi especially. I actually think the archetypal aspect of Fi is more important than the individualistic aspect (though they are related). For that reason, I think a good book would be one that explores archetypes as separate characters, while also showing how the characters are also part of the same whole.I agree with KuteKitteh that examples would be helpful, though I disagree with the rest.

I've often found Fe doms and auxes misreading a person's or group's emotional landscape (assuming we have a reasonably similar understanding of what that means). They're only human, after all. I wouldn't expect them to always get it right. 

I have also had issues from time to time with Fe users stubbornly insisting that their assessment is correct, despite disagreement from the people in question or other factors that would make their beliefs implausible (the "I know you better than you could ever possibly know yourself" syndrome). 

People of all types make assumptions sometimes, including xxFJs. And sometimes those assumptions are wrong. That is not to say that these problems are the norm, just that they can occur. 

But what exactly do you mean by:

&gt; Is Fi just as capable of assuming such an emotional landscape?Yeah, that works. He was probably trying to make a joke based on the stereotype of Asians being poor drivers.I don't do that shit. You don't know me. /s

Actually, I know lots of intuitives and none of them sleep with music... except on occasion my mom but only when she falls asleep unintentionally because she's tired. She would never do that deliberately.

You may want to rethink your conclusion.INFP. I read through all the dichotomy descriptions without first checking to see what they're supposed to be for my type, in the hopes of choosing more accurately.

THEORY &gt; MY ANSWERS
------------------

**Farsighted &gt; Farsighted** -

Yielding &gt; Obstinate -

Static &gt; Dynamic -

Aristocratic &gt; ????? - leaning towards Democratic, I don't resonate with Aristocratic much at all

**Tactical &gt; Tactical** -

Constructivist &gt; Emotivist -

**Negativist &gt; Negativist** -

**Judicious &gt; Judicious** -

Objectivist/Serious &gt; Subjectivist/Merry - I see elements of both

*Process &gt; ?????* - leaning toward process, but elements of both

*Asking &gt; ?????* - leaning toward asking, but elements of both

So that's 4/11 definite matches, or 6/11 if I treat the tentative matches as correct. This highlights one of the issues I have with Socionics: that for all of the additional complexity and comprehensiveness of the theory, the accuracy drops to the point that I can't rely on it to be useful, even after accounting for possible misinterpretations on my part. There are still some powerful insights within it, but I find it difficult to extract them from the noise and apply them to real life.This categorization comes from David Keirsey, not from MBTI. It's based on commonalities that he observed between different types, and their similarity to the classical system of temperaments from ancient Greece.

You can read about his rationale for why in brief here: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter

Or more fully in *Please Understand Me II*.

I'm not saying whether or not it's valid... just that it doesn't come from Myers or Briggs-Meyers, and that strictly speaking, it isn't an MBTI thing.Probably not, though. Whenever I've seen these types of diagrams, they've always been used to illustrate 4 function models, not 8 function models like Socionics.I agree with you completely. It's interesting to see the "that's a very ESTP thing to say" responses, since I'm an INFP--pretty much the type that is most unlike ESTP--but I would make the same argument.Hmmm... isn't it at least, like, half socionics? I haven't read the whole thing yet, but just reading the first section, aren't concepts like +Fi or -Fi, ignoring functions, supervision, psychological distance, etc. coming from socionics, rather than other areas on Jungian Typology?&gt; notice how Sensors don’t ever complain about intuitives being airy fairy over the top overthinkers?

Do you mean online or in real life?

Of the two sensors I've been in serious relationships with, one thought that in conversation, I went on too many tangents and was hard to follow. She wished that I were more straightforward, which was more-or-less like saying I'm an "airy fairy over the top overthinker".

The other one enjoyed listening to my ideas and trains of thought, but had a hard time engaging with them directly. She was really interested but couldn't respond much. So she wasn't complaining about it per se, but she did notice a difference in how we thought and communicated. Unfortunately, I was left having a lot of monologues where I really wanted more dialogue with her.

I haven't had either dynamic with any of the intuitives I've been in serious relationship with. Same pattern holds up in my family: the three intuitives (including myself) will often end up having conversations that my sensor dad doesn't relate to or finds boring.

I don't see the sensors as less intelligent at all, nor that intuitives are "special", nor do I feel like there is or needs to be some big insurmountable seperatist divide. But yeah, some sensors do actually complain about how intuitives think and talk.Can you please clarify "How well do you honestly understand how your brain works? How you think?"?

Do you mean on a neurological level? Or understanding your thought patterns by observation, such as can be achieved through meditation? Or your reasoning from point A to point B? Or something else?

The question is a bit unclear, especially since your emotions also have to do with how your brain works.Empathy isn't the domain of any one function. It's a general human trait that most people have to varying degrees. There are, however, many different flavors of empathy and many different ways in which a person can empathize with others, and your cognitive function stack will influence that.

While Fe empathy is more immediate and "in the moment", Fi empathy is more reflective and it draws on universal aspects of human nature that reside in the collective unconscious. As such, I disagree with the notion that it is primarily about imagining how you would feel in someone else's shoes and projecting your own experiences outward. Personally, I've never found Fe types to be more or less empathetic than Fi types, but they may show empathy differently, or in different situations.

As such, it's not uncommon for Fi types to be people pleasing as well. Even my ENTJ sister goes into people pleasing mode in certain situations. Though, I don't think people pleasing and empathy are necessarily related--it's just a particular behavior, and is sometimes rooted in insecurity of some kind. Sometimes people pleasers can be out of touch with those who they're trying to please.My current understanding of Fi empathy is based on a synthesis of my own experiences, those of people I know well, and Jungian typology theory, while also taking into account the collective experiences of the community of Jungian enthusiasts.

Speaking for myself, I disagree on the grounds that I already understood how empathy worked for me, and that it was rooted an archetypes and a strong desire to understand the universal human condition long before I knew about cognitive functions or the deeper aspects of Jungian typology. Specifically, I'm aware of when I'm imagining myself in someone else's shoes and when I'm not, and there are lots of times when I experience an empathetic connection even when I'm not imagining in that way. The "put yourself in someone else's shoes" thought experiment can be an important part of empathy, but if that was all I could do, my empathy would be severely limited, in my opinion. There's just so much more you can pick up about people on a more subtle level than that process can afford.

For example, much has been said about how FJs can pick up the emotions of others in the same room, which I think is true to an extent. But I also pick up on that stuff, too. I'd say that if there is a difference, it's that, compared to Fe users, I'm less oriented to the collective energy of the room, and more attuned to the energy of individuals. And that I'm less inclined to try to reshape the energy of the room into something more desirable, and more inclined to let people find their own way, or to try to influence other people in subtle ways, rather than the more overt approach of FJs.

I could go on for awhile, but this is already getting long. But although, I deliberately wrote this from my own personal point of view here, it seems pretty typical of NFPs at least, and INFPs in particular. I'd like to gather more experiences from SFPs and TJs about how they empathize in order to flesh out my understanding, but that's a slower process.

Let me know if that answered your question or if it was too vague or too personal or whatever.Agreed. I'd also add that:

- Fe types are better at reading groups of people as a whole and working with them as if they were a singular entity, while Fi types are better at tuning into and working with select individuals within the group. Which leads to...

- Fe types are better at cultivating group dynamics that encourage everyone to be on the same page and work together, while Fi types are better at creating group dynamics that encourage divergent values and points of view while still maintaining some degree of cohesion.

Yeah, maybe not the best wording on my part. Thanks for the correction. I do still think that Fe types tend to be more aware of the overall vibe and collective values of whatever group or society they're involved in than Fi types.

&gt;&gt; Fi types are better at tuning into and working with select individuals within the group
&gt; Could you expand on that?

Let me think about how best to explain that and I'll get back to you. I don't find Fi to be that mysterious, so I'm willing to anwser other questions about it if you want.

&gt; Yup. Fe can also be used offensively to disrupt group dynamics. Is there an Fi equivalent? Like a Hannibal Lecture or something?

I had to think about that for a bit, but yeah, if I wanted to mess with people or be cruel, I could see myself doing something like a Hannibal Lecture. I actively go out of my way *not* to pick people apart like that because it can be very destructive. But that seems in line with Fi villainy.


I haven't found any one type to be definitively nicest, but to challenge your point, I know several ISTJs who are really good people. I'd describe them as being as nice as any other nice people I know.&gt; I'd put it as Fe looks more at relationships between people (network technician), and Fi looks more inside of individual people (computer technician). Both will know a bit of the other (you have to), but they're looking at it from their area of focus.

I like the IT analogy...

&gt; Both can be good communicators, but Fi seems more careful to express themselves accurately (the individual), whereas Fe will be more careful of how their message will be received and understood by a particular audience (the relationship).

...but I don't quite agree with this. For me, it's all about shaping my communication to align with the perspective of the other party, at least to the best of my ability. It's integral to how I'm wired, and I'm not even sure if I can switch it off. I know I'm just one example, but I greatly prefer verbal conversations over textual conversations for that reason--it's easier to read the other party, which makes it easier to make sure my message is understood.

Perhaps my disagreement has to do with where the crossover point lies between the two approaches you've described. It's kinda like how people say that introverts are drained from being around people, dislike parties, etc. In practice, it's not so cut and dried. Although it's generally more true than false, it's also common for introverts to be energized by one-on-one or small group conversations about things they're interested, and often you'll see that introverts at parties will tend to create that sort of experience for themselves by going off to the side of the room and engaging in more intimate conversations. Likewise, in my experience, Fi communication is actually highly relationship oriented, but it's more adaptive towards smaller audiences than larger ones. I'm substantially better at anticipating how my message will land when speaking to individuals than when speaking to a crowd or community. 

I think this is sort of getting at your original question. I've never seen Suits, so I'll take your word for it :)

&gt; so I'll just go with sorta stream-of-consciousness in the hopes that it'll inspire you to say something interesting in reply and snowball into an awesome discussion. ;)

Hope I don't disappoint. I love talking about this stuff, but as I said, I'm way more verbal than textual when it comes to conversation, and I've been working on my time management lately at the expense of Reddit--I used to post here a lot, but I scaled back. So we'll see how long I can keep it up before real life takes over again.

&gt; I notice INFPs talk a lot about "vibes" and "resonating" with or against something. I wonder how that works / how it's processed in the brain. Is it like a physical vibration, or more like sounds in harmony or disharmony, or something else?

I don't know enough about neuroscience to comment on how it's actually processed in the brain. I find it interesting, though (I have a copy of Nardi's *The Neuoscience of Personality* staring at me on my shelf, but I never did get around to reading it).

If I had to relate it to physical phenomena, I'd say it's most similar to how sympathetic vibration, consonance, and dissonance work with sound. But I'm musical, so that analogy naturally makes sense to me. Other INFPs may experience it differently.

I do find that in verbal conversation, the rhythm, tone, pacing, etc. of how someone says something can contain just as much information as their words. Sometimes more.

You've brought up a lot of interesting questions... I may come back later and add to my response, but I need to take care of some other stuff at the moment.

Here, have a downvote!

(Just wanted to let you that know I care)&gt; Ok. I was guessing based on a conversation I had with another INFP, looks like I still need more data. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Yeah, possibly. You might find a lot of variance from person to person within the type in terms of how they communicate, or at least, how they describe their approach to communication.

For me, the desire to align the way I present my message to the other party's frame of reference comes out of the Fi active listening thing. It seems to be integral to my dominant function.

&gt;&gt; I greatly prefer verbal conversations over textual conversations for that reason--it's easier to read the other party, which makes it easier to make sure my message is understood.
&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing this is because of voice tone? Interesting. I wonder how common this is among INFPs.

I'd say my ear for tone of voice plays a big part, though there are other reasons, too. Some people complain that they find talking on the phone awkward because they can't see the other's face, and therefore can't read them. But if I'm talking to someone I know, I can pick up nearly as much from just their voice. And it's still vastly more than I can catch from words on a page.

As for other INFPs, I'm not sure. I've seen several discussions about communication preferences on the various MBTI subs over the years, but it seems like the general millenial/gen-Z preference for text-based conversation outweighs any type specific preferences.

&gt;Many INFJs prefer text communication because they have more time to measure their response (and obsessively re-edit it 50 times), but I prefer interactive communication because I can just blurt out whatever I'm thinking, and detect and fix any misunderstandings as I go.

Yeah, I'm with you on that. Obsessive re-editing just takes way too long. I almost always prefer the spontaneity of conversing in the moment. It's more fun *and* more efficient. When I was a lot younger and shyer, I may have preferred having extra time to carefully think through my words, but I can barely remember that time. I think for introverts, it's often a confidence thing, where they think that writing will protect them from social embarrassment. 

Even without re-editing, I can speak much faster than I can type, and listen much faster than I can read--as can most people, to be honest. Also, given a choice between having one interruption that takes my full attention for 5 or 10 minutes, and many smaller interruptions that take less attention but are spread out over an hour or more, I'd usually choose the former. It's more conducive to depth of conversation, and I'd rather focus on one or two things at a time and then move on to something else than to have to pretend that multitasking is more effective than it actually is.

&gt; I think speaking to crowds is more about having a consistent message...

Good point. I think I'm just trying to get a handle on what Fe does well that Fi doesn't. The notion that Fe users pick up more about relationship dynamics through people watching seems plausible to me. My INFJ partner is like that.

&gt; Is it much easier communicating with individuals that you know personally, or do you also do well with individual strangers? I'm thinking that Fe's reliance on visual cues might work better for observing strangers, whereas Fi's use of auditory cues might get more details on people as you interact with them?

It depends on the person and the connection, but I also do well with individual strangers if it's in person (as opposed to over the phone). I mean, yes it's generally easier to communicate with people I already know, but it's not uncommon for me to connect with a stranger in a way that feels like we already know each other.

&gt; Interesting, I'll have to follow up on that. I asked because it occurred to me that maybe Fi uses the right auditory cortex (which handles rhythm, tone, pacing, ...) for general processing, the same way Ni uses the visual/spatial brain regions for general processing. If it turns out that INFPs think musically, that would be so beautiful and appropriate somehow. :)

Yeah, it sounds poetic. But I'm also highly visual and spatial; I'm not sure how that ties into Nardi's work, but it seems to go against the stereotype that we're all meant to be primarily writers. My INFJ is actually far more interested and far better at creative writing than I am, while I'm much better at visual arts, design, etc.



I've read this description before. Can you remind me of where it comes from?

Pretty much everything is true for me. It isn't the complete picture, but it covers a lot of the major points.Hey, I'd meant to get back to you, but I got busy and then kinda forgot what we were talking about. But I'll respond to a few things...

&gt; Those people might be Fe users, that's what I was referring to. Phone conversation gives you the voice tone information you need, whereas for most Fe types it's either face-to-face or impersonal.

Possibly, though I think that effects of function stack are outweighed by other factors such as generation. I grew up when the phone was the only option short of meeting up in person, so you pretty much had to learn how to communicate verbally without visual cues. Most my friends and relatives are comfortable with the phone. But it I do think that being and Fi dom helps.

&gt; Yeah same here in the other direction. Plus I want to make GURPS templates for all the types, and Fi is one of the functions I'm struggling to define properly.

Can you ELI5 what is a GURPS template? Quick Googling hasn't helped much.

&gt; Oh! A surprising Fe superpower seems to be the ability to (automatically) shut off our emotions during a crisis, so we can be level-headed and pragmatic (Ti?) and just do what must be done.

I'm quite strong at this, too, though. I've never really considered how it might be related to functions.

&gt; What about profiling people you've never interacted with, purely based on observations at a distance?

Hard to say... I don't usually bother unless there's a reason to. I do people-watch, but I wouldn't say that I profile them per se.

&gt; I posted a thread in /r/INFP, it does seem like many INFPs perceive non-musical concepts that "click" in a way that feels similar to harmony and disharmony in music. Some wondered if it was like that for everyone, well for me it isn't, it's more like visual recognition - like something that's unfamiliar at first and then suddenly I recognize it.
&gt;
&gt; Although, is it possible you could be ISFP? ISFPs use both the Fi brain areas and the Ni brain areas.

Can you elaborate on that? I do process internally visually sometimes, but probably not in the same way that you mean.

Nope, not an ISFP. I'm quite Ne-ish, and not very Se-ish at all (outside of having good aesthetics, visual/spatial skills and situational awareness, which some associate with Se). Although I find socionics concepts to be hit-and-miss and I generally favor four function models, I have noticed PoLR type patterns with several people including myself, and mine is clearly Se--particularly how it relates to attitude and social dominance.&gt; Ni types are pretty good at those things, actually. Just not so quick to process unexpected changes, overwhelmed by too much stimulus, not attentive to routine details, etc.
&gt;
&gt;How are you Ne-ish?

Trans-contextual thinking is pretty much my default mental state, and it guides a lot of my behavior, ranging from my sense of humor to how I problem solve.

&gt; Attitude and social dominance?

Meaning that one of the common ways that strong Se is expressed behaviorally is by having a kind of... swagger. It's not quite the right word, but I can't think of a better one at the moment. It's hard to explain, but I find that SPs tend have a strong visceral presence and direct physical engagement with the outside world. And that this can be used to influence social dynamics by applying pressure in a way that can influence others. It's also pretty common for SP males to develop a "cool" or "badass" way of presenting themselves, or at least to want others to see them that way (though it's more obvious with ESTPs and ISTPs). 

Of course, I'm not saying that every SP presenst that way, but it is something that jumps out to me because so not my natural way, and that it seems to rub me the wrong way much more than the average person... though I've learned to be more comfortable with it in recent years.

I hope that was clear. I'm trying to bring a lot of different ideas together in a way that doesn't ramble endlessly.

Not to diminish the gender issues in our society, but the dynamic OP describes reminds me a lot of the dynamic between me (INFP) and my sister (ENTJ) when we work on projects together. She's much better than me at delegating and corralling people in a friendly but authoritative way, and having discussed this a fair bit, we both think Te is very much to do with it.

I wouldn't exact;y say that I'm terrible at it; I can pull it off when I really need to. But she thrives on that stuff whereas I'd usually rather be doing something else with my energy.Thanks.I have to agree with Druvgs and AAL314 on this one, both in theory and in practice. In my experience, people with strong Fe are often accommodating, yes, but they tend to be more so with people, wants, and needs that match their sense of how people generally are. They tend to be much weaker at accommodating those wants and needs that are individual or idiosyncratic, which is where Fi users shine.

Most Fi users I've known, including myself, are acutely aware if just how different their values and preferences are from those of the collective or the "default human state" as AAL314 puts it, so their interest in accommodating their own desires is paired with in interest in creating a social atmosphere that better accommodates people liking different things--moreso than the FJs that I've known.
I just took a quick glance; aren't they just using socionics naming conventions?

Socionics INTp = Myers-Briggs INTJ

Socionics INTj = Myers-Briggs INTPIt typed me as ENFP, which is odd because on the E/I scale, it indicated a slight preference for *introversion* (51% I, 49% E). You'd think that give a result of INFP.Don't take the percentages or relative function strength that this test provides too seriously. It produces theoretically impossible stacks for everyone. It still gave you INFP, which is the important part.Username checks out..........but you are being rude, without even trying. 

This is not the way to get your questions answered, which is too bad because it was actually a good question.Isabel Myers explained the theory behind it in the opening chapter of Gifts Differing. You used to be able to download a free PDF of it from CPP's website, but I can't find it now.

It's worth noting that the function stack most people use now came from Harold Grant, and that the official stance (from either CPP or MyersBriggs.org... I can't remember which) is that they have been unable to confirm the attitude of the tertiary function. So an INTJ could conceivably be Ni Te Fe Se.Score how? On Dario Nardi's test? Or one of the one's on Similar Minds? Or your own assessment?

Others here have given you Socionics-based answers, but a simpler explanation is that the function tests don't work reliably because they make too many assumptions about the thought processes behind whatever answers you give. Consequently, they always produce stacks that are theoretically impossible, whether by Myers-Briggs theory or even by Socionics theory.My gut impression is INTP, but I've given this no thought whatsoever. Do with it what you will.Strong Fi users are also strongly interested in why people do what they do... probably more so than Ti users. 

But you can use different functions for the same purpose; it's not like there's one specific "motivations" function.I think there's some truth to this sometimes, but it's only part of the story.

The other side of the equation is that in an online forum like this, there are people who will automatically assume that if you disagree with them, it's coming from a place of defensive outrage, rather than reason or insight. Because many people have preconceptions of INFPs as being easily triggered, they will sometimes project that emotional reaction on to you and use that to dismiss whatever point you were trying to make, regardless of your actual emotional state.

But the thing is, even if someone is genuinely emotional about whatever they're debating, it doesn't necessarily mean that the emotion is clouding their judgment or that they're factually wrong. For INFPs, who are often laid-back to a fault, emotion is one of the main driving forces behind whatever actions we take. I think people mistake this emotional fuel for emotional decision-making, and close their minds to what we have to say.

As such it can also be impossible for an INFP to disagree with others if they're looking through this lens. Even in writing this, I'm conscious of the possibility that you might say "See! You've just proven my point! Look at how defensive you are!", which, if that is what you're thinking, would defeat the point of writing it in the first place. I don't know if this applies to all INFPs here, but it's actually far more common for me to let things slide and let people believe whatever they like than to counter. I choose my battles.

I'll also add that I often have the same problem with people in general that you do with INFPs regarding objective facts--that people can be touchy when you point them out, and they may reject them outright or quickly try to change the subject. I've had this with all types of people--most recently with ENTP, and big time--so I don't think it's necessarily type-specific. In my social circles, I'm typically the most diligent fact-checker of the group, and my friends and family recognize me as such.

And your bluntness is appreciated... just not entirely agreed with. :)


I think it's highly debatable, and it's one of the main differences between the various models of Jungian typology (Myers-Briggs, Socionics, Beebe, Keirsey, etc.).

Some would say that there's a hard link between specific traits and specific cognitive functions and that we get around the problem by using an eight-function model, such as socionics, and saying that everyone uses every function.

I think it's more likely that the traits that you've described--valuing memories, selfishness/selflessness, step-by-step thinking, etc.--are not contained within individual functions but rather, they exist by themselves and their expression is shaped by the function stack. So anybody might value memories, but the process by which they do so will vary. Anybody can be selfish, but Fi and Fe types will express it differently, and are probably activating their brain in different ways when doing so.

You may want to look into Dario Nardi's work on neuroscience and typology, since he's been exploring these same questions.

Realistically, the official MBTI is likely the most reliable by far and it has the most research and development behind it. Normally, you have to pay for it, but sometimes you can find a clone of it online.

Even still, it isn't foolproof. No method is.Of course... why wouldn't it be?

I agree with Danoply, but I'll expand a little. Since Fi-doms invest a lot of energy into mapping out their beliefs, values, and actions in relation to all the different parts of themselves, they'll tend to feel such a conflict in a more personal way than other types. 

If another type might feel like they're doing something wrong, an Fi-dom might feel like they're splitting themselves in two, or that they've created an internal civil war between competing archetypes. Basically, the alignment that Fe-doms seek between individual people within groups is replicated internally within Fi-doms by seeking alignment between individual archetypes within themselves. 

As a side benefit, this also makes them more attuned to such internal harmony and disharmony within others.&gt; DaveSuperPowers 

That's a surprise. I thought he'd been abducted by aliens... or kidnapped by ejarendee during one of his psychotic breaks. Never to be seen again.
High Ne and I often sleep poorly, but it varies a lot. I'll go through periods where I'm sleeping really well, and then it'll switch to phases of lousy sleep.Really? I recall him saying INTJ, which also would make a lot more sense.Doesn't everybody?
Are you assuming that high Ti and high Ni correlate with high IQ? If so, then why?

I don't think I've ever seen any evidence of such a correlation.Sure, but OP referred to Ti and Ni specifically, and not to S.Yes, that's what I recall, too. I don't have any reason to doubt him.Yes, of course it's possible that he could have mistyped himself; that goes without saying. 

But I've not seen anything in his videos that strongly suggests to me that he is not an INTJ. Hence, at this time I don't have any reason to doubt him... beyond the basic level of uncertainty that always exists with typology. 

&gt; You're making it sound like it's a question of his honesty

I think you're reading something into my comment that wasn't there.INFP here. My worst would be pro wrestler, morning show host, and one of those Alaskan crab fishermen (like on Deadliest Catch). 

I wouldn't want to be a drill sarge either, though.

I had an ISTJ ex who was and still is the funniest person I ever dated--both intentionally and unintentionally. I can't picture her doing standup, but then again, I'm not sure if I can picture anyone I know doing standup without actually seeing them do it.Yeah, there's a part of me that secretly wants to get paid to yell at people. One could do worse...FWIW,  I think you described the INFP point of view on this very well here, even though it was a lost cause. I don't think there's anything you could have done to persuade AAL to actually listen to you.

The one thing I'd add from my own experience is that even when I do really care about something, I'll still willfully sacrifice that desire or need if doing so will give the other person what they desire or need. Not always, of course, but quite often--especially depending on how important it is to them.

With most people in my life, this settles into a healthy reciprocity where we give and take back and forth. Where it can become a problem is if the other doesn't notice the times I set aside my wants and needs for them, they may erroneously conclude that I always need to have my way, coming to the same sort of false conclusion that AAL is making.

Of course, it's possible that handful of INFPs that AAL knows actually are that selfish and he/she/they are just making a poor generalization about the type based on their own bad luck. Who knows?
Hmm... I don't think there's anything about being an INFP that would makes one difficult to impress. I'm not sure why Aurarus thinks otherwise; on the contrary, my INFJ impresses me pretty often.

I can be impressed by all the usual stuff, including intelligence, looks, and people making cool stuff, though I do have fairly high standards. But I'm most often impressed by creativity, depth of insight, and mastery of one's craft, since those are the things I aspire to for myself.

I've been watching the Olympics lately, so I've been impressed with people pretty much non-stop.

Maybe you have a hard time reading impressedness off of the INFPs you know? I'm not extremely introverted, but I'm low key in how I express certain things; I can see how some might have trouble picking up on it--even more so for an INFJ, who might have different reference points for self expression.∞∞∞∞Maybe not. This is the sort of thing that would really need to be studied properly to know for sure. 10 random people from each of the subs wouldn't cut it. 

I think you might be surprised at how many FPs are good at stuff like this, contrary to stereotypes. For example, I also got 10/10, and didn't find it particularly tricky. 

Personally, I wouldn't be shocked if, over a large sample, TPs scored higher on average than FPs. But I don't buy your claim that "it won’t even be close" when you consider that the IQ scores of the two groups are a lot closer than one might expect, and that logical reasoning is one of the cornerstones of IQ.

Not on hand... I'd have to search around for it (which I'm not going to bother doing, but feel free to search yourself if you like).

I've taken mental notes, though, whenever I've come across a study on it, and typically the top four types are INTP, INTJ, INFP, and INFJ in roughly that order. That's more or less what Myers found when she studied it several decades ago, and I don't think I've seen any later studies that contradict that.

There's also this study about types and giftedness which produced the same order:

https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/3o52vi/oc_mbti_types_ordered_by_intelligence/I half agree, though I would frame it differently. That is, I don't find that FPs produce more stupid comments here than TPs, nor do I think that we need to achieve a special level of calmness to be able to think clearly.

I do agree that FPs can be thrown off more easily when we experience strong emotions, and that when that happens, our arguments may come out the wrong way. And that when that happens, some TPs may dismiss the argument, the person or even the whole type prematurely.You can doubt it if you'd like, though I'm mildly curious as to the basis for your doubt and what you think the correct order should be.

In any case, my point was mainly about correlations between logical ability, IQ and type. The gifted study just serves to reinforce the main point since it produced the same type order and giftedness, high IQ and intelligence are closely related concepts.

Have you found any credible type vs. IQ studies that better support your own ideas?



Why have you decided that I am taking your claims personally?

To the extent that I disagree with you, it is because you haven't come up with a compelling argument as to why your claims are correct, and what little evidence we do have points in a different direction. 

I've read your other thread as well, but your case still comes down to stating your opinion ("I feel", "This is just my experience...", "It's just so obvious to me ... it stands out very clearly" etc.), but then expecting it to be taken as fact without having done the work to craft a persuasive argument.

By the way, what have you concluded, if anything, from your informal study in the other thread, and how does that fit within your general view on studies?I think you're assuming a lot about his intentions. Considering that he didn't believe in cognitive functions at all and that they weren't part of his model, I don't think it's particularly strange that he created groups that would've shared or not shared functions in some other model.Sure. I agree that the asymmetry of it is odd. To be fair, he did explain his rationale for doing so, though I don't quite remember what it was aside from wanting his temperaments to line up with the classic Greek temperaments.

Either way, I wouldn't interpret the asymmetry as anti-sensor bias without a stronger reason to.&gt; Fe just wants a environment where everyone around them is comfortable, happy, and functioning well. I’m way more comfortable in that than an room of Fi users that wants the room to full under stand them. 

So how do you create an environment where everyone around you is comfortable, happy, and functioning well if you're in a room full of people you don't understand?
I was puzzled by your reply until I deciphered the typos in your previous message. I guess you meant...

&gt; I’m way more comfortable in that than an room of Fi users that wants the room to full**y understand** them.

..whereas I'd thought you meant...

&gt; I’m way more comfortable in that than an room of **full** of Fi users that wants the room to **understand** them.

That missing "y" makes a lot of difference. Anyhow, I realize you're probably just overempasizing to make a point (and it is a bit funny). But realistically, I think that few Fi users actually expect you to *fully* understand them to enjoy their company. I know I don't, and the other Fi users I know don't take it to such extremes either. Even some_quirkyname didn't say that--you're the one who added the "fully, whereas I think they meant "understand better" or "understand enough".

I do sometimes find Fe users running around like crazy to do things for me that I really never wanted or needed or asked for, presumably to make me "comfortable" but regardless of whether or not it actually does. And it can be very difficult to dissuade them from doing so.

This is where it would be helpful to understand the other person a little better, simply to find out whether they need to have their back scratched in the first place. I find Fe users often overestimate their understanding what make's other people comfortable, especially when they're around FPs, who's needs may be idiosyncratic.









This is a common misconception.

In the official MBTI test, your score on each dichotomy isn't an indication of the strength of that dichotomy, but rather, it's clarity. So, to use your example, a high N score doesn't necessarily mean that you're more intuitive than someone with a moderate N score. It just means that your preference for intuition is less ambiguous. 

As such, the scores on each dichotomy don't really have anything to do with function order. The test was never designed to be used that way--it simply wasn't their intention.

As for the various free online tests, well... who knows what they indicate, if anything at all. Most of them have been cobbled together without much development behind them and should be taken with a grain of salt.

I have no idea why Loopulk thinks the dichotomies and functions are unrelated, nor why they received so many upvotes for it.A few here have said INFP because of supposedly not paying attention to their surroundings. As a counter-example, I'm an INFP who sees driving as an art form and who really loves the spatial awareness and skill development aspects of it. It can be really beautiful when you get in the zone and start to intuitively read the road and the other cars and see the spaces in between, while becoming one with the car. Can you tell that I love driving? Always have.

I'd love to take more advanced driving training, such as the sort that helps you get better at controlling skids in rain and snow. And also racing training on the track. It's expensive and you need to devote time to that stuff, so it's on the back burner for now.

In short, I'm quite confident behind the wheel but humble enough to realize that there's so much more to learn and that I can still make mistakes so I need to be conscious and careful. 

To be honest, I don't relate to the claim that INFPs are spaced out all the time and don't know what's going on around them. In the context of driving, this is the sort of thing that would need to be studied properly to determine whether I'm full of shit, or I'm just an anomaly, or whether the reality over a large sample matches the sterotypes.

If you're a nervous driver, don't make the mistake of believing that it's because you're an INFP, or that you're somehow deficient because of your type. Instead, work on developing your skills and gaining more experience and  identify and address whatever emotional factors are feeding your fears.INFP. Yes, I have a very good memory for music. Unlike Loopulk, I think this ability varies a lot from person to person, so I don't think everyone can to nearly the same degree.

But I'm also not sure it has anything to do with type.
Why do you think it's a nasty habit and so counter productive? If it causes problems for you, how can you be sure that it causes similar problems for him? What do you think he should do instead?I was hoping you could give an actual explanation of the psychological principle as you understand it. It seems like that's what OP was asking for, too. I'm familiar with many psychological principles, but not so much with this one, which is why I asked.

But if you don't want to, no worries.&gt; Medicine, and the medical field in general, is Si all the way. Has nothing to do with Se.

I generally agree, though I've read somewhere that Se is overrepresented among first responders such as paramedics, ER medics, etc., which seems plausible.I agree with you on this. It seems like most of the people in the "of course we use all eight functions, the four function model is stupid" camp are assuming that each function is a task-specific tool and therefore one would have to use eight separate functions to be a complete person. It's an odd assumption, but it's very popular for some reason.Your view on this is essentially the same as mine. I think far too many people here overestimate how strongly functions are linked to specific tasks, underestimating their adaptability. I'd also add that most of our core traits and abilities and the thought processes such as logical reasoning or empathy are not tied to the functions directly, but rather, our function stack will shape and influence how we carry them out.

As such, I haven't found that using an eight-function model necessarily adds much of anything that can't already be explained using a four-function model. There are a few concepts in socionics that I agree with, but generally I see the added complexity as more of a weakness that a strength.Keep in mind that [OCPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_personality_disorder) (obsessive-compulsive *personality* disorder) is not the same thing as OCD.

So, yes, OCD probably not related to type, but OCPD seems to correlate most with ISTJ.Looks like IDR Labs. They have maybe a couple dozen personality tests there.The ISTP closest to me is kind of an asshole, yes. I'm not quite sure what he cares about--he's not the most forthcoming person in the world.

Five years, though... not sure what type you are, but you're definitely in the "doing things in their own time" camp.He was some random guy who used to make *lots* of MBTI videos. Always just him talking to the camera. Then he apparently went kind of crazy and deleted his channel.

Here's a mirror of a few of the original videos:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB0snuw1XtOAJAnnCEhflvg/videos

I wasn't a fan, but lots of redditors liked him.Everyone hates Fe doms? News to me. Although Reddit hardly matches real life, people here complain far more about Fi doms than Fe doms.

To be honest, it doesn't sound like these are cognitive function issues so much as general assertiveness issues. Issues that many Fi users also have.I think the main problem with these kinds of discussions is that none of us know the same people and we have such different anecdotal experiences with people of each type. 

So, for example, the ISTP closest to me is moody, passive-aggressive, and complains all the time--which isn't too far off from "bitchy moodswings". But if that doesn't describe you, then it might sound like it's coming out of left field. A lot of the "why are INFPs like such and such" posts seem out of left field to me, too.

Anyway, one thing that nobody else here has mentioned is that despite the reputation for being self-involved and having our heads in the clouds, INFPs also listen very intently to others and pay attention to all sorts of nuances of what people say, how they say it--and when possible, *why* they say it--that the average person, and in particular the average ISTP, would miss. Dario Nardi in particular has pointed out the connection between Fi-dom and deep listening as a flow state, and although his research isn't hard science, I think he's on to something. 

The things you notice can shape your communication style in profound ways, as can the things you unconcsciously overlook. As for your INFP, it's entirely possible that the communication that you consider vague might be clear not only to the INFP in question, but to other people he knows, and that he may be equally puzzled as to why you don't seem to "get" it.

Elsewhere, you said: 

&gt; i'm an istp i'm not asking for elaborate explanations of his deepest emotions lol.

Maybe that's what he actually wants, though? I know I would never be happy with a partner who wasn't interested in that stuff.

I can think of maybe a dozen different explanations for his behavior and/or your interpretation of it, so I have no way of telling without knowing him. But I would guess that what seems to you to be guessing games is to him a process of checking to see if you're really listening (that is, in a way that would work for what he's trying to communicate), and he's getting back mixed messages: an explicit "yes" mixed with an implicit "no".

Sometimes these kinds of communication incompatibilities are really difficult to overcome, so maybe it's better that you aren't a couple anymore.
&gt; ime INFPs listen, but then make assumptions about what the other person actually meant and how the other person feels. I speak pretty clearly, I don't need someone making assumptions about what I really meant or how I actually feel. I find most of those assumptions are incorrect as well. 

This hasn't been my experience with other INFPs, in comparison to the other fifteen types. I find that assumptions, misinterpretations and projections are common pitfalls in general human interaction, and I've had people of varying types do the same to even though I'm speaking clearly and precisely, including the ISTP I mentioned before. Sorry if you had that problem with your ex, though.

As far as what I said about deep listening, subtext, asking why, etc. goes, I think it's fine as long as you understand that it's speculation. In other words, if I was curious about how the other person feels, I would ask "were you feeling something like this?" and listen to their answer, rather than trying to tell them that I already know they feel. 

&gt; Fi is a judging function. It takes information from Ne and Si. Ne and Si are the perceiving functions. You aren't perceiving words with Fi.

Are you familiar with the research I mentioned? The association he found between Fi and listening is based on brain activity, not theoretical musings. The actual mechanism of how it works in relation to cognitive function theory is debatable, but it's worth noting that he didn't find that correlation between listening and Ne or Si.

Edit: expanded bit about subtext&gt;Se
&gt;PoLR: Lost in thought a lot, unaware of their surroundings most of the time, doesn't care about the look and aesthetic of things. 

I don't think this really holds up, especially the aesthetic part. Way too many INFP visual artists and designers.How do you reconcile these two thoughts?:

&gt; Well, some intuitives are annoying because they believe themselves to be better than others
...
&gt; an intuitive who believes themselves to be better than others can be the worst...

...
&gt; for example, if an ENFP friend says something that I feel I agree with, I feel like they've already said it all for me, or I feel like my thoughts are inferior to theirs because wow,

If I understand correctly, it seems like you're sometimes willing to put intuitives on the same pedestal that you loathe.Add me to the list. I'm a clear INFP, but the test said I had a stronger E trait than I and that my Ne was stronger than my Fi, suggesting that I'm ENFP.&gt; In other words, Jung said that people who qualified as one of his eight types ... were either introverts or extraverts, but that a plurality of people didn't qualify as one of his types.

Can you provide a quote for this? 

I didn't read all of Psychological Types, but my interpretation was that he was saying that people generally (meaning all people, or at least most) are either introverts or extraverts, but that most of them also show aspects of the opposite attitude rather than being 100% intoverted or 100% extraverted. In other words, the "normal man", while being more balanced than extreme, will still have an attitude preference. 

Likewise, it seemed to me like he was saying that people generally *did* qualify as one of his eight types, but that the descriptions he gave in chapter X were for extreme cases, not for the normal man.
&gt; and who said the functions have to be stacked in a certain order?

The people who created the models that we're discussing. 

If you want to create your own model that you think is more logical, name it, and promote it, go right ahead. But don't just start using it out of the blue to answer someone else's "Is this normal?" question here as if this were r/mossy84snewmodel or something.Not this INFP. I did engineering and I would've hated Philosophy.Those four temperaments come from David Keirsey, who explains it in his book Please Understand Me II. 

I don't recall his explanation being particularly deep; I think it was just that he thought that these were the groups with the greatest commonalities.

It's worth noting that Keirsey didn't believe in cognitive functions.A few additions, corrections and elaborations:

There's also David Keirsey's model which did much to popularize typology via his books *Please Understand Me/Please Understand Me II*. His model is an offshoot of MBTI that rejects cognitive functions outright and instead puts its emphasis on four temperaments, which he aligned with the classical Greek temperaments (sanguine, melancholic, choleric, phlegmatic). This is where the popular SJ/SP/NT/NF groupings come from. Keirsey's theory is less about cognition than it is about behavior.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter

The Myers-Briggs model is still function-based, though. In their model, the dichotomies are a direct reflection of function preferences. If you haven't already, I'd strongly recommend reading Isabel Myers' book *Gifts Differing* to understand the rationale behind the theory. Their interpretation of the function stack changed a bit in the early days, but the only difference now between the Myers-Briggs stack and the Harold Grant stack is that Myers-Briggs leaves the attitude of the tertiary function as "uncertain" as they've never been able to validate it one way or the other. So Myers-Briggs defines the stack as EI?I or IE?E, while Grant proposed that the stack always goes EIEI or IEIE, which is what most MBTI enthusiasts now use.

The Myers-Briggs Foundation have also extended their original model with *MBTI Step II*, which further subdivides each dichotomy into different areas. It seems that comparatively few have ever taken or even heard of MBTI Step II.

https://www.myersbriggs.org/using-type-as-a-professional/mbti-step-ii-instrument/home.htm?bhcp=1

The most popular model on Reddit is actually the MBTI model modified using the Grant function stack, followed by Socionics, of which there are a few variants. Only a few here use Beebe's archetype-based 8-function model.

So, I'd say the main models in wide use are:

* Myers-Briggs
* Socionics
* David Keirsey
* Big 5
* John Beebe
* Jung's original work (which is vague and open to interpretation)

With 16Personalities just being Big 5 with MBTI type names and pleasant graphics. Most other models are based heavily on one of these, and most people on Reddit mash up multiple models freely, which adds to the confusion.No problem. Myers-Briggs, Socionics, and Beebe all use different versions of a cognitive function stack, with different conceptions of what the order means. Though Jung introduced the functions, he didn't arrange them in a stack per se, and some claim that he never intended them to be used in this way. 

The example you gave is Beebe's version.

&gt; Which model would you say is the most common for beginners?

The dichotomy-based side of the Myers-Briggs model is by far the most widely known as many are introduced to it at school or work. On the other hand, 16 Personalities has probably become the most popular free online test over the past few years, even though it's really a mashup of dichotomy Myers-Briggs and Big 5. 

Given one of these two entry points, most people are happy to read a few type descriptions and go about their merry way without being too concerned about the underlying model..

Beginning typology enthusiasts will usually continue onward with the cognitive function side of Myers-Briggs using the Grant stack (though they'll probably never have heard of Grant and won't realize that his stack is non-official).

Some will then go on to Socionics or Beebe, particularly if they're looking for more complexity. It's debatable whether complexity=accuracy, though. Likewise, many enthusiasts see Keirsey's model as the weakest of the bunch, even though it was arguably the most popular at it's peak.His type is ultimately more about his thought process, what he pays most attention to, and how he makes decisions than his secret world of emotions, though. 

That said, It's entirely plausible that he could come across more like an ENTP in many situations while still being an INFP. I scored ENTP the first time I took the official MBTI test, and I got INTP the second time. I still score ENTP if I answer according to an idealized version of myself, which isn't to say that I actually want to be a different type--I'd just like to be more entrepreneurial than I currently am.I think you're assuming a few things here, though. I'd counter that:

1) Different people can have very different ideas about what is the aim of vacations, or even what they consider relaxing or fun. The idea of a depressed person going on a vacation to take some time out to heal sounds reasonable to me. We don't know what was said or agreed upon beforehand.

2) It isn't clear in this example whether the ISFJ falls under "friends of her trust" or "other people".

Based solely on what OP has said, I can imagine a scenarios where either friend was more at fault (or both, or neither, for that matter).

Your English is fine, by the way.Thanks for coming back and giving more context. Based on this, I still probably would've been bothered by the ISFJ's behavior.

It seems like the sort of situation that would have benefited from clearer communication, and maybe more importantly, not feeling obligated to do everything as a group.

As for Fe vs Fi, the conflict does have that quality to it. Whether or not it's caused by functions specifically, it's noteworthy that some people feel more like everyone ought to put on a happy face for the sake of others and that healthy relationships require some degree of performance, while others value more of a "be who you are and let others be who they are" approach. FWIW, my INFJ is more performative and I'm more be who you are. 

A few months ago, I had a massive fight with an ISTP friend who started raging on me because he wanted us to hang out much more often, like best buds, while simultaneously being annoyed with me if I was ever unhappy about anything because he saw that as being a downer. I thought the whole thing was weird. 

It seemed like he had a pre-existing template in his head about how "hanging out" was supposed to go, even though I could never fit into it even if I wanted to (I didn't). And he thought that that template was what was best for everyone, even though it was ultimately just based around his own unconscious wants and needs. This also seemed like an Fe/Fi conflict to me.Any number of reasons. One example: as a male INFP who's good at math, science, tech, logical reasoning, etc., I tested as ENTP and then INTP the first two times I took the test (the official one, not the free internet ones). Although it's obvious to me now that I'm a feeler, those tendencies weren't nearly as visible until well into my 20s.

More broadly, one of the key revelations of Fi self inquiry is that people are usually more multifaceted than they realize. Looking within, you might discover all kinds of semi-dormant archetypes, including qualities that are quite different from your main identity. In other words, an INFP might see a part of themselves that is ISTJish, and another that is ENTPish, and another that's ESFPish and so on.Not that I remember, but I read it a few years ago so I may have forgotten. It's worth reading, though. Get it from your library if you don't feel like paying for it.Any number of ways:

1) An Fe user might consciously and deliberately use their harmonizing skills to manipulate others to serve their own ends (hence the stereotype of ENFJ cult leaders).

2) As others have said, Fe users sometimes project their own needs onto the group. Their ideas of what's best for everyone aren't always accurate and may unconsciously become corrupted by their own unfulfilled needs, biases, etc. People who don't pay attention to their own desires because they're in the habit of always putting others first are, ironically, even more likely to do this.

3) Some Fe users need to play the role of "the giver". Though this may seem generous and often is, it can also be controlling if it comes with the implicit expectation for others to play the role of "the receiver", regardless of whether they want to or whether it's appropriate for the situation. Their apparent generosity may quickly turn to judgment, anger, or resentment if they think you don't appreciate them for whatever they're offering.

4) Fe users may sometimes disregard the wants, needs, and desires of others if they deem them inappropriate or disruptive to the collective. Though the selfishness of this position isn't always obvious, it's worth remembering that in identifying with the collective, the Fe user may benefit directly by neglecting individuals and outliers. Taken to the extreme, this is why it's possible for Fe dictators to do horrific things to minorities while still taking the position of being "for the people".

5) People are not their functions; they are multifaceted. FJs are capable of good old-fashioned "me first!" selfishness from time to time, just like anyone else, despite the general orientation of Fe toward the collective.

Of course, none of these behaviors are exclusive to Fe, or to Fe users, nor are they emblematic of FJs in general. But I've seen enough of these things in different people, and enough examples of altruisim and self sacrifice in Fi users, that I actually don't think that one is more selfish than the other at all.I don't think there's a single silver bullet question that can definitively separate the two types. For example, the questions others have posted here wouldn't work on myself or my INFJ partner.

That said, a larger number of questions that cover different areas and issues might get you closer. Try this 17 question test and let us know what you think:

https://www.idrlabs.com/test/infp-or-infj.php

Some people here have found it helpful, though not all.Cool. Which questions stood out for you, particularly ones where you strongly preferred one answer over the other?I doubt that all or even most ISTPs are dicks, but the couple of ISTPs I've known that were dicks had a weird derogatory attitude... a little like a much lower key version of a stereotypical high school jock dude bully.

My impression was that they'd developed ideas about what it was to be cool or badass, and I probably violated these ideas because I don't care about that stuff (as is typical of a male INFP). One of them in particular seemed to have contempt for me because he thought I was weak, though he was wrong.

More generally, I think it's fair to say that Ji doms can sometimes become attached to their own framework of how things work, how they ought to be, etc. and can be irritable when their framework is challenged or ignored.Yeah, those are all meant to be the INFP answers on that test, and I think they're generally valid. 

INFPs tend to want to be in a society that allows people the freedom to be true to their inner nature, within reason. INFJs tend to want a society that's more collective, with a stronger base of common values and universal rules that we can all live by.

The one question there that I don't relate to as much is the fiction one. I like fiction, but I'm much more into non-fiction for the things I create, while my INFJ is more more of a fiction storyteller.I haven't noticed this pattern. As one counter example, I'm an Fi dom and I ask lots of questions, while my INFJ partner asks a lot fewer. Each of us can be more open or more closed depending on the circumstances.Really depends on the person. Type may influence the ways by which you express altruism, though.Without getting too deep into function dynamics, I do sometimes have conflicts with FJs regarding the inaccuracy of their empathy toward me and others.

I don't know if they know me better than they know themselves, but it really becomes a problem if/when they think that they know me better than I know *myself,* because it's almost never the case. This can lead them to make too many assumptions and not really listen because they think they already have it figured out.

That said, I think that Fe and Fi users can both be empathetic with reasonable accuracy; it's just that the process by which they empathize is different. Which way is more accurate may vary from situation to situation.Being caught up in your head and being empathetic aren't mutually exclusive, though. Based on my experiences as an individual and with other INFPs in real life, and from what INFPs say online, I'd say that we have a tendency toward both traits, and sometimes at the same time.

For example, I can be very attuned to other people's mood, especially as it's revealed through the way they speak, and I often see through people's attempts to hide their vulnerabilities while simultaneously having a blind spot around unspoken social codes and agreements.This is widely disputed, though. Over the past 6-7 years here, I've seen countless claims for either way--meaning, there are just as many who would argue that Fi is more empathetic and Fe is more sympathetic.

I actually don't think that one is more empathetic or sympathetic than the other, but that the function will influence the style of emp/sympathy and shape how it is expressed.I think the point is that Fe does it without realizing, which is something that maturity in itself wouldn't prevent. It's an issue of having a differing fields of awareness.&gt; They’re less about having fun and more about exploring ideas and diving deep.

For INs, exploring ideas and diving deep *is* fun.My family is all Fi/Te: 1 ISTJ, 1 ENTJ, 2 INFPs.I dunno. I have a few ISTJ friends and I always worked well with them on projects. Might be different in the workplace, but I don't see why it would be.

The other ST types would be more of an issue, yes.Very rarely unless someone died. It depends on if I'm going through something serious reliving something serious from the past, but on average maybe twice a decade.

Little tears here and there are more common.Maybe it's an age thing? Dunno... I feel sad or stressed often enough, but rarely in a way that I'd break out crying over. Last time was 2012.

I'm actually surprised at how common frequent crying is in this thread for people of all types. Or maybe other people have a lower threshold for what counts as "REALLY cry".Generally, yes.

Fi isn't inherently anti-group, so much as it sees the group as a collection of individuals. 

Fi favors group dynamics that are designed around allowing the individual members of the group to stay true to their respective natures, with much less of a need for shared identity, values, or for having everyone on the same page.Different INFP here. I'd also disagree with #7. Though I don't have the high levels of body awareness one would associate with, say, SPs, I'm not particularly clumsy. I actually can't say that I know any clumsy INFPs. I'm also not very absent-minded, though that term can have several different meanings. But I pay attention to my surroundings. My INFJ partner on the other hand...

Some models of Jungian typology link Se with being attuned to physical and/or social dominance, projecting an attitude of power, and being action oriented. If anything, I think that's what INFPs and INTPs have the most aversion to.Some of the more common complaints:

- that it's dichotomy-based and not function-based (most people here heavily favor functions over dichotomies)

- that the test is inaccurate (which it may or may not be)

- that the type descriptions are overly flatteringTrue. While I find the socionics models hit and miss and I generally favor the Jung and Myers definitions, this is one particular aspect that I find pans out in real life. 

It's certainly more true for me and other INFPs I know than the absent-minded/clumsy thing. Edit: adding to that, the SPs I've known--and to a lesser extent, NJs--have a stronger connection to physical presenece and power.That's actually totally not what I was describing. The aversion to Te is a different phenomenon. We can agree to disagree, though.Why do these link to Facebook? Seems kinda odd.Nope. I tend to talk on the fast side, mainly because I think faster than I talk, so to me it's often still slower than I'd like. Depends on the situation, though. But I haven't seen any correlation between talking speed and type.Three of the most giving people I know are my INFP mom, my ISFP mentor, and ENFP close friend (not an Fi-dom, but strong Fi nonetheless). So yes, they can be.

I think that people vary so much within each type due to values, culture, personal growth, general circumstance and life choices that these sorts of questions don't really work. There are so many ways to give and receive that a person who is giving in one area of life may not be giving at all in another. 

Jungian typology is more useful in understanding the different ways that people give and expect to be given to than it is in predicting how giving they are. You alluded to this in saying that you're "forgetful with dates like birthdays and I don't give people gifts but i'm very giving with my time". That's a fairly typical Fi-dom point of view.

Generally, INFPs favor giving to others in subtle, supportive ways, rather than being demonstrative about it, so their giving tendencies may go unnoticed by some.I've never heard of one either, including here on r/MBTI. The gender role reversal seems to be too much for most people, in addition to whatever other type-based disconnects there may be.Thing is, both the "live and let live" thing and "moral crusader" thing are active expressions of Fi. And they're really kind of the same thing anyway. The main driver for Fi going into moral crusader mode is in response to a perceived threat to their own or someone's else's ability to live and let live.

In practice, I think most Fi users--and Fi doms especially--spend most of their time towards the relativistic end of the spectrum and only go on crusades when they think it's absolutely necessary.Why don't you want to ask them about it? Seems like the most obvious solution.

There's a pretty good chance that they secretly want you to ask them what's going on as an indication that you actually care what they think and are willing to listen.

If I go quiet with someone, it's usually that I've given up on trying to get through to them... be it just for now, or forever. But even if I think "this person is never going to get it," I'm happy to be proven wrong.Nothing ventured, nothing gained. It sounds like the status quo isn't good, so it's still probably worth the risk. Good luck.The most common typing I've heard for him is ENFJ.Why do you think this test isolates Ni-related skills and differentiates from skills related to other functions, or skills that aren't function-related at all?
Interesting article.  As an aside, I have an INTJ friend, and I knew before looking that most of them would stay INTJs.  :-)  But I digress.

INFP here.  When I was younger, my answers would have been all over the map.  *Anything* but INFP.  Now?  INFP all the way!

Edited to add:  Haha, I took another quick look at the article, and it appears that nobody who is not already an INFP wants to be one!  (They don't know what they're missing, that's all.)  :pLaughing at your image of driving your own Fi nuts.  :-)
Surroundings, definitely

INFPskip, go to the park, get stoned with friends, then go to mcdonaldstired hahahaahahaha the deep conversations with the dog is so accurate&gt;It is EXTREMELY hard to describe but one of the thing i do is I analyze the meaning behind everything. Such as analyzing how my own thoughts form or analyzing people's actions and its origin from the subconscious.

i do the exact same thing every time i get high. its very tiring. i know what you mean about trying to find the origin from the subconscious. it's like i'll be watching tv and i over analyze every character and try to get to the 'root' of the issue/action. 

its so weird and hard to explain but i get you. 
I don't think this is about ENFP/INFP's conciously acting like special snowflakes. Through Ne / Fi some ENFP/INFP's somehow just don't feel understood in a world dominated by Sensors. At least I can relate to that as a male INFP. Through iNtuition we just seem to live in different realities than many Sensors do. I say realities in plural since we can oftentimes look at something from many different perspectives at the same time while Sensors on the contrary seem to look at life from a more clear, single, matter-of-fact point of view. My ex-FWB for example was an ESTP and she had a really grounded / matter-of-fact way of looking at life. She had a particular head-on way of dealing with problems which made her come across as just more down-to-earth. For me the relationship lacked depth and openness which she felt kind of threatened by (or didn't understand) because she just doesn't need that complexity to have a fullfilling relationship. Then there's my manager at work, who is a male ISTP and he has a unique talent to just grasp reality in this really simple way. It's like they see more clearly because there's just less fuzz from their perspective.

Edit: just found out that after two years of thinking I'm ENFP, I'm actually INFP. Mind = blown.In addition, especially ENFP's like to be valued for their uniqueness. It's what drives them: to stand out and make a mark. The status quo doesn't appeal to them in whatever way. I think OP misinterpreteds this drive to 'shine brightly' as arrogance or perhaps the E/INFP's he knows are just not that well developed.I (INFP, M28) have recently come out of a 8,5 year relationship with ENTJ (F26). Since I've been dating around I meet a lot of Sensors that serve as great FWB's (just temporarily, and with mutual consent... I still have Fi to account to). But I can't for the live of me imagine myself leaping into a long-term relationship with somebody that isn't either INFJ of INTJ. Damn shame they're so rare. So if anybody can talk this thought out of my head: most welcome.

Edit: mistyped both myself (not: ENFP, but: INFP) and her (not: ESTJ, but: ENTJ). I wrote quite a long reflection on it over at r/INFP for those that are interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4v9dep/a_happy_personality_with_a_sad_soul_entjinfp/Hahaha :) I can see why you're sad and I can definitely relate to this but you must admit that this is pretty funny. I've learned that alot of people aren't as willing to open up as you and I might. Of course her (and his) reaction was obnoxious and I can see why it frustrates you as I'd hate to be misunderstood too. But let them, who cares. You're not a creep, she's probably not actually raped, he's just being protective and has only heard her side of the story. It all seems like one big misunderstanding. Just remember: it's their loss, not yours. Please don't let this ever stand in the way of you opening up conversation with randoms. I know alot of people would really value you for such acts of kindness. Just forget about it.Why does it feel like all INTP's in this thread are identifying with the girl? I think this objective, detached 'matter-of-fact' like view on the case isn't really helpful. You're just stating out the obvious. You really think OP would reach out to reddit if his intentions weren't pure? Don't you think OP dreads to be misunderstood? Think of how boring the world would be if we'd all adapt to the 'norm' and just minded our own business. Sorry for my rant: this is apparently very important to me (?).Haha I love the fact that OP can't take criticism and tries to defend his perspective even though both POV's are right at the same time. As a spectator I can now see why people think we (INFP's) are terrible at receiving feedback. It is because we are. Terribly so. But I feel you OP :) Change management consultant here (INFP): 10/10 would recommend a career in OD. The diversity of the job is amazing and really helping people in their work is very rewarding. Sometimes it's difficult to keep the bigger picture in mind when working with firms that are focused on short term profits, but in general I think the business world could certainly use a few more of us dreamers!It seems my life goal is to keep all my options open (the projects and clients I work on vary wildly which is very exciting), that and the fact that my father is a business man who took me along sometimes when I was a kid made me excited about the business world. After highschool I studies BSc. Business Administration, after which I did a MSc. BA in Change Management. I did alot of internships during this time to get a feel for my (dis)likes and chose a career in OD / Management consulting at a firm that is very vision driven and has a distinct focus on human/employee value. I really love the diversity of my job and the fact that I get to help managers/employees/clients (and their clients) on a daily basis. 

Edit: you might also want to look into Human Resources, Organizational Psychology etc: there's certainly no one best way to get into this field. If you have a nag for dealing with complexity and an eye for human behavior it generally doesn't really matter what your background is.
As an INFP that has just overcome one: seek distraction, be kind to yourself, talk to people (any, but preferably one that is paid to listen), steer clear from r/INFP (steer clear of any sites that help you 'analyze' your situation: knowing more isn't going to help you get out of this: on the contrary) and be sure to PM me if you want to talk about it! I'd gladly help out!
Anna Akana -ENFP or INFP (probably ENFP)But with leading T? What about ISTJ or ESTp?Leading S! I still want to know why leading S would be more confident than leading T!I used to like astrology when I was 12, in the sense that I thought it was interesting but even then I was embarrassed when it was brought up because people assume you're unintelligent/superstitious. I actually just like the kind of conversations you can have while discussing MBTI even if the underlying theory isn't that sound (disclaimer: I don't know that much about it- I DO want to get more into it...). I liked astrology for the same reasons. A friend of my mom used to use it as a way to get people talking about themselves, in a way that felt unintrusive and fun... And I like that it gives you a way to put people into neat little easy to understand categories, it works just as a mechanism that you can use to start thinking about people's motives, desires, etc.I love people that to me seem to have a dominant Te vibe. They seems so confident in themselves in a way that I find soothing somehow. Te doms were what I was thinking of when I wrote this.INFP, people who I really take to are usually ENFP.Wait, what makes a bad ESFJ so good?ESFJ's are intrigued by me but ultimately think I am ridiculous.

*It would be more accurate to say that the first ESFJ I thought of saw me this way, in general their Fe wants everyone to be included but they don't t like my type of touchy-feelyness.** another type

For me, I used to wish I was ISFJ. I admired and emulated ENFP's but I always thought I would become them, basically. I envied ISFJ's because they were the quiet girls that I thought I was supposed to be, in the sense that I saw them as socially acceptable in all the ways that I wasn't. You don't get anything weird or uncomfortable when you scratch the surface with them, you're pleasantly surprised that they make you feel so comfortable.  I see them almost like a guide for how to be graceful if you're on the shy or quiet side.

I want to get to know more about this type and understand them because I still as a gut reaction will feel somewhat judged by them, not that they're unpleasant towards me,  I just keep thinking of their little confused frowns when they get to know me right before they don't do anything mean, lol.
This is very simplistic and not all together correct. An xntp uses Ne to explore possibilities, especially future possibilities.  So, seeing the exception to the rule is not "brain melting," it is a logical conclusion.  Ti and Ne working together are all about logical possibilities. Absolutely, empirically, and emphatically wrong.  For one thing, no function stands alone.  What you're saying sounds like a primitive computer program, not a complex human brain.  As an intp, I am constantly changing my knowledge and understanding of things, and entps I know do the same. To a Ti dom/aux information is never static, but constantly changing and building on itself. What you are talking about in your original post is two naive people, not necessarily two people using Ti.What about all the times she breaks the rules? She sneaks out into the forest to hunt illegally, she sells at the hob illegally.  And, she makes no attempt to fit in at all, except with others who are viewed as outsiders.  She is very distrustful of the government and authority in general, and goes out of her way to avoid being controlled. These are *not* Si qualities. I've seen her typed as intj and I think that's pretty accurate. You can't plan a scheme like that without assloads of Ni.Why do you keep posting those disney princess memes with the princesses incorrectly typed.  Rapunzel is ESFJ and Ariel is ENFP, neither are INFP. [Nope](http://mbti-in-fiction.tumblr.com/post/30590525407/luna-lovegood) and [nope.](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/search/Luna+lovegood)Are you familiar with the functions? How you analyzed above is not really the right way to find a characters type.  There are a lot of resources to learn about functions and accurate typing. If you look at the examples I provided, they do a good job of explaining how the functions work in the context of this character.I agree. The xSFJs I know are incredibly good judges of character.The online community for INFPs is pretty bad, and it perpetuates the incorrect stereotype that INFPs are overly sensitive delicate flowers for whom the real world is too harsh.  This may be true for some people, at least the vocal minority, but I don't think it's true for most INFPs or Fi doms in general.  Fi is very emotionally private, and, at first glance, I think a lot of them can come off as thinkers vs feelers because showing emotion does not come naturally to Fi, that's what Fe is for.  An ISFP or INFP will seem reserved and even stoic until you push a button, then you'll hear how they *really* feel, and it's usually loud, harsh, and unexpected.

As for the difference between ISFP and INFP, the difference is very subtle.  I'm probably going to get flack for this, but you can tell the difference by how they dress and decorate their home.  Se is stylish, Ne is eccentric.  ISFPs make their clothes look good; INFPs can look like crazy homeless hipsters if they're not self aware.  Se sees what looks good and wears it, Ne considers what could look good and sometimes it does, but it's usually a little, um, different. True, but it's a different kind of stylish. SFJs will be more comfortable in mainstream trends and putting their individual flair on from there. Fi-Se really wants to stand out and be an individual, so they'll wear more cutting edge styles.  ESFPs do this too.I love Tim and Eric! I'll admit the show was an acquired taste, I had to be convinced to give them a chance, but I'm glad I did because they're hilarious.  My ENTJ husband LOVES this kind of humor, and as long as I keep an open mind I like it too. An altered state of mind also helps( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).Everything you wrote strongly reminds me of my ENTJ husband and also my ESTJ friend.  I'm pretty sure Te is what you're looking for.&gt; I don't lie, but I just don't offer all the information.

Yes. This is what I do. It saves a lot more time that lying.

I also never lie to my kids. Kids are smart and they can tell when you're lying.&gt; It's pretty common that people start demanding specifics in order to try to back you up against the wall or otherwise undermine you

This happens to me a lot (people demand specifics from me).  Do you think this is a consequence of an unhealthy function/type or are some people just assholes? They can't explain because socionics doesn't make sense.No no no. You are definitely *not* INFJ. There is absolutely no indication of Ni anywhere in your post.  You are probably ISxJ in a loop.  You are obviously depressed, and you should address that as soon as possible. Check out [this page](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/133090287772/accurate-typing-tertiary-temptation)and see if any of the loop descriptions fit you.Just stop talking to this person. They have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Rationality, Independence, Exhibitionism

They all fit me pretty well!I took it again and changed only one answer and got rationality, independence, and playfulness. 33/36

Unknown type&gt; INFPs are deeply in touch with their emotions and, when making decisions, are likely to consider their emotions as evidence in themselves.

No. Absolutely wrong. Fi has nothing to do with emotion, it has to do with values.  I'm not going to choose to do something simply because it makes me happy any more than you, as a Fe user, are going to make a choice based on others emotions.

INFPs are deeply in touch with their values and ethical beliefs. When making decisions we consider values first (Fi) then the facts of the situation (inf Te).

And, as an INFP, my values *do* include truth, intelligence, logic, persistence &amp; mastery as well as integrity, personal accountability, authenticity, emotional depth, sensitivity, and uniqueness of character.  I also strongly value emotional control and restraint. I can't handle outward shows of emotion under anything but extreme circumstances. 

MBTI is not about emotion, that's the enneagram (which I highly recommend studying).Maybe not 100%, but probably xSxJ. There's not enough info, but definitely Si dom/aux.Did you read through and study the enneagram? Enneagram is what really helped me learn my type. Don't look at the correlations between mbti and enneagram yet, just read through enneagram type descriptions. And, as always, make sure you're being honest with yourself. Check out r/enneagram. I always like the similarminds.com tests.  Just remember that enneagram test results can change depending on your mood, so you'll want to take the test a couple times and read the descriptions to see which is the best fit for how you are most if the time.[I just found this site.](http://www.lessons4living.com/overview.htm)  It's a very simple overview, but I think it's a good starting point.

E:  [This one's better.](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/)Edit:  Maybe I was a little harsh. I could have made my point more eloquently, been nicer to spare people's feelings.  But this post has absolutely nothing to do with mbti.  You can't take random cute pictures and assign them personalities. This sub has gotten so far away from any kind of intellectual discussion of mbti, all that is left is type-me posts (which are fine) and these shit posts. 

I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but...THIS IS FUCKING GARBAGE!!!  Take your shit posts back to tumbler. Please.I'm sure your auto correct has never led you astray. I'm glad to see such a perfect person setting me straight. Keep fighting the good fight in defense of shit posts.No, you're right, you can't be typed accurately over the internet. It's hard enough to type people you know well, much less internet strangers who type up a couple sentances about what they think of themselves that day.  I'm as guilty as anyone else on this sub for the type-me posts, but no one has gotten it right and that's because there is nothing you can write that can convey who you are as a whole person.Welcome to the wonderful world of Fi.  I had the same issues when I was younger; bullied, rejected, ignored.  For me, it got better once I grew up and moved out and was able to interact with a much wider variety of people.  I learned to keep my mouth shut until I was sure I wouldn't be teased and rejected.  That gave me the opportunity to study people's faces and body language and how they respond to other people.  I've gotten quite good at gauging people's responses now, so I notice right away when I offend someone and I stop talking (and apologize if appropriate).   I have some good friends now, and I'm kind of on the fringe of a fun group, but i never feel like i can be myself. For me its worth it, tho. I get depressed without friends. Make an effort and it will get easier, and, sad as it is to say, being cute definitely helps.Calmer than you are.&gt; ISFJs often have a naive worldview, usually basic as fuck or overly idealistic.

I know a lot of ISFJs, which seems reasonable given the frequency of their type, and *none* of them can be described this way.  They are, in fact, very wise to the world and the people in it. They use their Si Fe to gain and store knowledge about people and situations and use that knowledge to navigate those people and situations effortlessly.  Regardless of type, anyone can be "basic as fuck." Si Fe doesn't strive to fit in, they value group harmony through shared social norms, but that doesn't mean they are weak naive people pleasers. 

These kinds of dismissive stereotypes are what's wrong with the online mbti community and why so many people are mistyped. &gt; try to find people who like actual individuals and value authenticity.

In an ideal world, yes this is great advice. Unfortunately these people are few and far between and, if you want a social life, you have to reign in the weird.  I barfed a little in my mouth writing that, but it's still true.&gt; ENTPs tend to put up a witty/cool front, ESFJs put up a random/goofy front and ISFJs put up an intellectual/serious front. INTPs tend to not put up a front at all.

This is a clever observation! It's like a defense mechanism.  What fronts to other types put up, do you think?Anyone can be, and usually is at some point, naive.  Thats not a personality trait.  Also, no sources were provided, and I doubt any exist for such simplistic and dismissive statements.Narcissist is more likely than sociopath. Narcissism is easy to pick out after just a short interaction. A sociopath would be better at hiding their true nature.Do you think he's introverted or extroverted?  You could probably narrow it down to xxFJ, judging by the info you provided.  Maybe ENFP, too.  Check out ISFJ, ESFJ, ENFJ, and ENFP.  Are you thinking of socionics? Sociology is the study of the development, structure, and functioning of human society. Socionics is personality theory based on Jung's personality studies.This is inappropriate. Stop harassing me.This is inappropriate. Stop harassing me.Honestly, your answers don't say much. You'd have to write a paragraph for each question to even get an idea of type. 

Why the sudden uncertainty? You usually seem so confident.Well, I can't say you're wrong. But the poopy-pants analogy is a little harsh.  

As I was reading this, I was becoming more and more enraged, but then I realized that that's exactly what you're talking about.  

So.....yay for that.This is what I do too, almost exactly.  From what I understand, tertiary Si comes across as foggy nostalgia and sentimentality.  For example, I think about my home town and all the quirky charm it had, then I go back there and am reminded what a piece of shit small town it really is.I don't think Te doms.  This is anecdotal, but my ENTJ husband is terrible at trivia. He really wants to be good at it, and he should be, he is incredibly intelligent and well read, but he always loses and gets super mad about it.  Same thing with an ESTJ close friend. She hates trivia for the same reasons and refuses to play anymore. Ok. Then what makes you doubt ESTP?If there's anyone on this sub who knows himself, it's you. You've proven that in almost every post and response you've made. You're ESTP.No, no way is this INTJ.  This whole thing is a big long Fi rant. That's one of the reasons people don't want to identify as Fi-dom, because of the stereotype that it isn't methodical and rational.  Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not, it depends on the individual.  What you need to look at is the reasons behind the opinions.  In the first two answers, it is all about liking/disliking for personal reasons. They are logical, well thought out reasons, but still personal.I think you're absolutely right. Good assessment. I'm fairly certain you are ESTJ.  

Most of your answers are strongly Te.

&gt; then come up with a plan to get everything taken care of

&gt; but with plenty of time to sober up enough to drive in case our driver doesn't follow through on his promise, 

&gt; everything in 7.

&gt; I can come off as very arrogant

The only question here that addresses intuition is 9 and your answer is still strongly Te, but shows little trust in gut feeling (which is a really bad analogy for intuition).

You are an extrovert.  You need to move.  You need to get your ideas and thoughts out there.  You need to discuss things to help yourself better understand them.

I know that ESTJ is the most common personality type, and that turns most people off, but it shouldn't.  ESTJs make the world go round.  They make the truly rational decisions and analyses and know what to do in any given situation.  Being a highly intelligent ESTJ is, in my opinion, the biggest advantage you can have.  You will know how to deal with people, manage them to a successful end, and reach your goals faster and better than most other people. 

If you have evidence to the contrary, let me know.  Online typing is often inaccurate because you can't truly see the whole person.

&gt;  INTJ friend has a very silly, playful, self-deprecating tone that sometimes comes out in his writing.

Have you considered that your friend might not be INTJ?  Most people who claim to be INTJ are mistyped. 

Just an observation.Yes. It depends on which source you look at. I should have said 'one of the most common.'Yes, they do ask for personal reasons, and those personal reasons will give you an idea of type.  Her response was very Fi, almost textbook.  A Te example might be disliking lazy people because they prevent you from achieving your goal.  Or Fe might dislike rude people because they disrupt the harmony of the group or situation.  Now, I know everyone dislikes these things, but it's what you dislike the most, what really gets under your skin.  For me (Fi) what op wrote really resonated deeply, but I also have moderate contempt for laziness (inf Te) and rude people (because who doesn't).  The thing to remember is that everyone *can* use every function, but your function stack is what you are most comfortable with and use without trying.  

Don't worry about being combative, I like a good discussion. 

eta:  I didn't realize at first that you are the op!  Do you disagree with INFP?  If so, why?  I struggled a lot with accepting my type and I'd be happy to talk more about it, if you think it would help.One of my good friends is my reverse function type: Fi-Ne-Si-Te vs. Te-Si-Ne-Fi. (So I guess that is opposite-letter type INFP vs ESTJ) We get along great most of the time, but my weird Fi-Ne reasoning can really get on her nerves.Read about the functions first, then decide.  

That said, I think you're ESFP based on your post and responses.  How are you at a party?  My sister (ESFP) says the party starts when she arrives.  She is also a very intelligent overachiever (honor student, served in the military and earned all sorts of awards).  She's great at almost everything she tries, and she tries EVERYTHING! She plays every sport she can, she sews and cross-stitches, she plays piano and guitar. Her boyfriend is ESTP and they are similar, but she does everything with a smile on her face, while he's more serious about things and less tolerant of what he perceives as bullshit.  That was the good, now for the bad.  She can get SUPER cranky when she has to do something she doesn't want to do.  Cranky might be an understatement; she will DESTROY you if you make her compromise her individuality.  Not that she strives to be a special snowflake in any way, she just knows what she likes and what she doesn't and when she has to do something she doesn't like for too long, watch out.  Also, she is a chronic procrastinator.  She always finishes what she starts, but she usually has to stay awake for 36 hours straight to do it because she puts it off until the last minute.

Ok, I just wrote a lot of stuff about my sister.

This isn't the best way to type, but examples are hopefully helpful.Here's my take on Te-Ni and why I think it has nothing to do with "gut-feelings."  

My husband is an ENTJ.  I have absolutely no doubt that he is an ENTJ, and he is the reason that I am so skeptical when people claim to be Ni dom or aux.  We have been together for 15 years, and in that time he has been able to foresee the results of every political trend, including election results, before they happened.  This has nothing to do with being "psychic" or having "feelings" about future events.  He reads everything he can get his hands on about politics, the economy, social trends, everything that has anything to do with the future of the US and the world (in that order, since the US is where we live).  He takes all of that information (Te) and forms very accurate assessments of future events (Ni).  I know he does this because he thinks out loud.  He tells me every (single itty-bitty tiny detailed) step of his thought process, from an inkling of an idea, to knowing, shortly after the 2012 elections, that Trump would run again in 2016 and the whole thing would be a complete farce.  

He also does this with technology, which I have no reference point for, but he studies the market and knows what will succeed and what will fail.  He knows when to buy what technology, and what will soon be obsolete. (I can't give specific examples here because when he starts talking about technology I retreat into FiNe la-la-land.)  

My final example is how he works.  He is a film maker, and when he has an idea, he can see the finished product in his head before he starts, and he makes it happen exactly how he wants.  He knows every step along the way, he knows what will work and what won't, and he know how long it will take.  It's really amazing to watch his process.  

That was just the positives of being an ENTJ, there are plenty of negatives, but I won't go into those now.  Suffice it to say, that Ni is a very powerful function, especially paired with a strong judging function (Te or Fe) and it doesn't think, it doesn't guess, it knows.For a good example of ENFP check out [Enid Patterson's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvXWcCPBxeS9Gx1AdMjECyw).  She's an ENFP who talks about personality types and typing.I don't even know where to begin....

You have no idea what you're talking about.  You should do some research before you call a function stupid.  You should also do some research before spewing your bullshit.  That girl you know who was mean to that one time who is probably Fi-something is not a reliable source.Thank you.  This is much better.  I've had such a hard time typing myself because it seems no one takes INFPs seriously.  I'm a smart person, not super smart, but average smart.  I'm well educated and I've had a lot of unique experiences, but when people hear (or see) INFP, it seems I'm immediately discredited.  It's been quite a frustrating experience, so thanks for placating me for now.Honestly, I still think you're an ESTJ.  But, like I said before, it's very hard to type people online.  Also, keep in mind that you probably won't know your true type until you're at least 25, if you're mature. (I'm 34 and I just figured out my type) So, for now you can settle on unsure/ExTJ and wait to see what time brings.Edit: I re-read my comment. There's nothing bigoted about what I said. I expressed an opinion, not intolerance. If anything I made the argument for tolerance.


~~I'm glad you bring this up.~~  I am not a bigot, ~~but I can see how what I said may come across that way~~.  I respect other people's spiritual beliefs.  It is every persons right to live life how they want, believing the things they want. Spirituality is a very important part of life for most people, and I would never dream of telling people what to believe or outwardly judging them for it. That said, I do have that knee jerk reaction to religious people, as I'm sure religious people also do to me, as an atheist.  It is human nature to be suspicious of what is different, and I won't pretend that I'm any different.  But, I make the conscious effort to recognize this about myself, and act and think accordingly.  We are all creatures of instinct, but what sets us apart is out ability to accept the new and/or different.

I do not mean to make this a religious debate.  Spirituality/religion, to me, is a very personal thing, and should be treated as such.  I feel this way about all subjective beliefs, including politics.&gt; Everyone should have a free education and free healthcare.
Why?

If people have knowledge, they have power.  If they have power, they can make a living for themselves.  If they can't make a living for themselves despite their power of knowledge, if they're oppressed, they will have the power of knowledge to take action against their oppressors.

Healthcare is more personal.  I've seen people close to me go from contributing members of society to bankrupt because of a sudden and unforeseen illness.  This should not happen.  Rich or poor, people should know that when they are sick, they can get good competent treatment.  

Both of these things would lead to a great reduction in crime and poverty, and would lead to a more stable and peaceful society.

&gt; Is your beef only with the ideas they perpetuate that you consider ass backwards or is there a more fundamental clash?

I guess there's a little of both.  Religion wouldn't bother me if it was kept private, or at least separate from the laws of society.  If you follow a religion and want to adhere to its laws, then good for you, do it.  But don't expect me to follow the same laws or have the same morals.  Church and state should be *completely* separate.&gt; for example the military fascinates me, but I'm sure I'd have a breakdown or otherwise lose discipline if I were to join

Honestly, it felt like I was thrown into a river with a fast current that I was incapable of stopping.  I just had to go with the flow and hang on for dear life until it was finally over.

&gt; the thing I can't account for is the partygoing 

Me too.  My love of parties doesn't really coincide with my introverted nature.  But, I really do love loud noisy crazy parties!
&gt; Have you ever thought about moving to a country with free education and healthcare to get a better understanding of the system? If you have/haven't, what's stopped you?

I don't need to live somewhere to learn about their political system.  I can read history, news articles, blogs, and talk to people to get a good understanding of how life is in socialist countries. And, I don't want to love. I like it here (US).

&gt; Didn't you just say you're not okay with that though since a lot of these laws are oppressive and step on other people's rights? Where do you draw the line?

I'm not okay with most things about religion, but I would never tell anyone else how to live their life.  It's not my job to liberate people. I can provide knowledge and the rest is up to them.&gt; But you only get part of a picture, in a society everything is connected, the things you read about don't give you a full picture of all the pros and cons. It's more like studying particular trees than walking through the forest.

Yes, you are absolutely right. In an ideal world, this is what I would do.  Unfortunately, I'm not at a point in my life where that's an option. So, I have to make due with second hand information. I'm usually pretty good at connecting the dots and taking disparate opinions and coming to a fair and logical conclusion, but I know that falls short of actual experience.

&gt; Why do you not want to live there if those societies have what you want? Attachment or something else?

I want to live here. This is my home. I love my city, my family and friends, my job, my hangouts. And, I love (in a general sense) the people who live in my community and want to make society better for them.  I don't want to run away to where they already have what I want, I want to create that here so everyone can benefit. I don't really know how to do that, though. I'm an idea person, not an action person.  But, I share my ideas with whomever will listen, and hopefully I can light a fire under someone who actually know what could be done.

&gt; So you wouldn't stop someone who is committing or about to commit mass murder if you could? 

As I said in my op, church and state should be completely separate. Religion belongs in a person's private life and should be kept there. And, they should not impose their beliefs on anyone else using any means, violent or otherwise.  People have the right to believe what they want to believe, but not to act out at the cost of harm to people or anything else. So, of course I would stop someone from committing any atrocity, if I could.

Thanks for helping me out on this!Trying to figure out J/P?

I make quick decisions based on research, and I make a loose plan after that to see how things go. For example, I'm back in college learning web design, something completely foreign to me, but I did research and it is one of the fastest growing career fields with the least amount of required education. So, within a month, I did the research and enrolled at school and now I'm on my way to a new career. I only enrolled in two classes, to make sure it's something I actually like, and luckily it is. Other big decisions I planned far in advance. I have two kids, and I planned each of their conception dates so that they'd have summer birthdays and be the youngest in their grades at school because I've always thought it was an advantage to graduate high school at 17 rather than almost 19 (like I was).

I suppose smaller every day decisions I don't really plan for. I love trying new things and being responsibly spontaneous. I'm up for a spur of the moment weekend road trip, or trying new foods, or trying new activities. I love to experience anything new, I don't want to miss out on something that could be really fun.

Schedules are very useful in certain circumstances. At school? I want to know exactly what is expected of me for the entire semester. I need a detailed syllabus with what is due when and what topics will be discussed in class on which day. It really stresses me out if I don't have this. I'm okay with a change in plans, that usually doesn't bother me too much, if at all. So, in a professional setting, I expect a detailed schedule.  But, for leisure, like vacations and such, I don't like to have a schedule. I like to have a list of stuff I want to do, and then do it when I feel like it.Can you tell me why you think I'm a Si-dom?  And why Ne/Si over Se/Ni?  I'm really trying to understand myself, and I can't seem to come to any conclusions on my own.Is that the only example?  I developed that consciously as a defense against failure. If I'm given too much freedom, I take it and run with it and eventually end up failing.  

Other than that, what you said about Si fits with my personality, but I don't think those traits are exclusive to Si.

The reason I'm hesitant to accept Si is, other than not fitting any of the stereotypes or type descriptions, I've never fit in with the majority of people.  I've always been a little weird and annoying to most people. I know this has to do with my personality, and not just behavioral traits.  I know and love several ISxJs, but we usually don't really click once the conversation moves past everyday pleasantries. I've been told I read too much into things, and I'm a deep thinker, whatever that means. I'm very resistant to traditional social structure (the whole atheist/socialist/feminist thing), and that freaks a lot of people out.  I especially don't fit in with other women, which makes me very sad because I would love to be part of a group, and not just a tag-a-long, or the token weird girl.  So, that's my reasoning why I don't think I'm Si-dom.  Does that make sense, or do you still think ISFJ?I think I annoy people with my strong opinions, and by asking too many questions about their opinions.  I want to know why people think the way they do.  I want to know how they came to their conclusions and why their beliefs are their beliefs.  Most people take this as an attack, when it's really just genuine curiosity.  I also jump around in conversations, and I don't always pay attention to what the person is saying, I'll be off on tangent in my mind, thinking about something they said, what they meant (academically, not emotionally) by it, going through what I know about the subject and trying to put together an idea.

I've been reading about the quadras for awhile, and I either fit in Alpha or Delta, but I don't really know the difference between them.

Also, if you know anything about enneagram, I know without a doubt that I am a 9w8.  I don't know how much that correlates with MBTI, but it might mean something.Any idea of what type I might be after all this?  I guess maybe I should study the quadras a bit more to see where I fit...Yeah, I'm reading more about alpha Quadra and that really sounds like a fit for me.  Thanks for all your help and insight, I truly appreciate it.It depends on what kind of spy work you're talking about. Most spies sit in a dark room behind a computer with headphones on listening to whatever they're supposed to be spying on (enemy combatants, friendly allies, you on your cellphone).  Or, are you talking about the "spies" you see in the movies who wear a trench coat with all sorts of gadgets and do awesome things in the name of (insert noble cause here)...

The latter would probably be STPs. The former can be anyone. Any personality type can collect data and put it together to tell a coherent story. NJs would probably be the best at taking that data and making accurate future predictions with it (because Ni).  But I could be wrong.After our chat I started looking more closely at ISFJ and Si in general.  I found that I really identify with Si, but not Fe at all.  I need to be me, a very Fi thing, I've come to find out.  So, I tried doing some research on ISFJ vs INFP to tell them apart and I found [this blog post very helpful](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/116554559570/since-mistyping-between-infp-and-isfj-seems-to-be).  So, Si-Ne and Fi-Te leave me with xSTJ, which is not a match at all.  Or xNFP.  I'm definitely not an extrovert, I very much process things internally before I do or say anything, so that leaves me with INFP.  I don't really fit the stereotype of INFP, either, but it's as close as I'm going to get, I think.Religion started as a way to explain the (at the time) unexplainable. It is primitive and simplistic and makes unnecessary rules. It promotes bigotry, specifically misogyny, and it has no place in modern society. I'm a reluctant agnostic atheist, because I can't for sure say there's no master creator of the universe, so there's that, I guess.

But, that's just my opinion. If you're religious, good for you, to each their own. As long as you're not hurting anyone, believe what you want.You're so feisty lately! 

I agree about Rick and Jerry, and for all the reasons you said. What about the rest? Is Morty ISFJ? I think Summer is ESFP. Beth maybe ISTJ?First of all, OUCH! I hope you're better soon.

I never thought of INFJ for Beth. Honestly, it's the type I know the least about. I don't think I know any irl, so I have no clue how they might act (not that behavior is the best typing tool, but it helps a little).

The quote by Summer which, I think, sums up her personality is when they are stuck in the elevator and Morty has to pee, and Summer says, "Just pee your pants. I did the minute we got stuck." (and after a negative reaction from the rest of the people in the elevator) "Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose."

I guess Morty is probably INFP.  He has a few epic Fi rants in the show. [Here's one of my favorites](http://imgur.com/gallery/SIIt2S9). I think it showcases a pretty good example of inferior Te.

[And there's this one](https://youtu.be/E_qvy82U4RE).

I don't know, I just love this show.When I'm in a loop or grip I call mine my baby function and my caveman function.

Si: Something reminded me of something I don't like. I'm going to wear my favorite sweats and watch Titanic on repeat for 3 days while eating pint after pint of chubby hubby.

Te: ME SMART! ME IN CHARGE! LISTEN TO ME WHILE ME TELL YOU WHY YOU IS STUPID AND WRONG!

But usually it's not like that. My tert Si is my memory for detail instead of misplaced nostalgia.  My inf Te helps me pull my head out of the clouds long enough to take care of the boring practical things in life.I sit in the seat closest to the door. When class is over, it's time to *go!*I've noticed this, too. I don't really know how objective it is, but high Te users tend to be prone to rbf.This is not an iq test. But I love tests, so I took it anyway. 135. I think that was 3 wrong, and I guessed on 3 because I didn't feel like thinking too hard. Excuses, excuses.Good video; pretty simple, but gets the point across. I know that technically there is no such thing as an ambivert in Jungian psychology or mbti in general, but I still consider myself a social ambivert. I love people and parties and adventure, but I equally love my books  and TV and sitting alone on my couch.Mmmmm.......no.The only function I can guess is Fi for your brother and Fe for you. And, because of the depth of your concern for what other people would think, I doubt you are an INTP. If you are 100% sure of your type, then I apologize, but I think you're probably an FJ type.R/enneagram was very helpful when I was figuring out my enneatype.  I'm an INFP 9w8. I have seen a lot of INFP 6s, tho.This makes more sense. Inferior Fe is more like an afterthought of what others would think, but anxiety is another beast altogether.Lolz.  That's not what I meant, I promise!I was just talking to someone about this. When I read, I am so completely immersed in the book that I don't even see words on a page anymore. I'm living the book in my head. It's so much stronger than a movie; it's like second-hand real life. I was incredibly surprised to find out that this isn't everyone's experience. It was another INFP who told me that this is also how she experiences books, but not everyone else does. I've always been a slooooooow reader, slower than everyone else I know, so maybe this is why. It's also why I don't read a lot of books. I get so emotionally invested that I need a cool down period after each book.It's been a while since I watched this show, but I love it!

I think Clarke is ISFP.  She's pretty action oriented and has strong inner values.   

Raven is probably ESTP. She seems like a daredevil, and has that strong Ti mind and is able to fix almost anything. 

I've seen Bellamy typed as ENTJ, but I don't really like that for him. I think he might be ISTJ. There's that "sense of duty" there to take care of his family and strong Te that makes him a good leader. 

I thing Lexa might be ISFJ. She really cares about her people, and she trusts how it's always been done, because it works.

I think Finn was ESFP. I got sociopath. I'm really not surprised.

&gt; You are confident and capable of social interaction, but you prefer the silence of dead bodies to the loud, twittering nitwits you normally encounter in your daily life.

OMG! How did you know!?Whenever I'm doubting my type, I look for video examples. This is one of my favorites!Do you mean could *have*?

If so, then yes. Audrey Hepburn is an ISFP.  I'm pretty sure the rest are INFP.I like these. Very good descriptions with little stereotyping.

&gt; It’s worth noting that when we talking about Feeling (Fi or Fe) as a cognitive function, we do not necessarily refer to emotions. Emotional experiences or expressions can be related to Feeling (Fe or Fi), but they are not the root cause of the cognitive Feeling. The root of Fi or Fe boils down to a person’s values, meaning what a person thinks is important based on their own conscience and the reasons they believe it’s important.

I wish more people were aware of this.Two famous ESTPs and the most evil ENTJ in history. Unless Gengis Khan was an ENTJ. It's possible, I suppose.&gt; Insist on debating factual information and insisting on accuracy. We can do it, but we greatly prefer not to and will avoid you if you won't drop it.

No. Just, no. INFPs can and do prefer to debate using factual information. And I always insist on accuracy.  Debating using emotional reasoning will get you nowhere, and it automatically discredits your argument.  I debate to get a better understanding of things, and to understand things you need facts and accuracy. Decide how you feel about it later.

e: Why the fuck am I being downvoted? If you disagree, tell me why. Don't be a coward and hide behind downvotes.ExxJs talk the most. They seem to be able to keep going without much outside input. ExxPs are second. They can talk a lot, but seem to run out of steam more quickly than EJs. Yes! You just explained being an introvert. We share *none* of the same functions, but I can relate to most of what you wrote here. Introvert doesn't mean shy meek wallflower. It just means you experience the world in your head (mind) first, then externally.Yeah, I can relate. I've learned not to use any personal qualifiers to my arguments.  I don't say "I think..." or "I feel..." or "to me..." Then I'm taken more seriously.

I think the key to debating is to talk to other introverts. I *always* get talked over by my extrovert friends. It's pretty frustrating.I'm getting dizzy trying to listen to this, so I only made it 5 minutes in. Very interesting, though, I actually like both sides for different reasons.

I like the straightforward manner of the woman's speech. I like how she appears professional but not businesslike. I like how she is presenting her information in terms that are easily understood, but not dumbing it down.

I like the man's voice slightly less because he sounds a little combative at first, but after about the first minute he settles down a bit and seems less confrontational and more informative.

In order to take a side in the first place, I'd have to watch the original video. It's hard to be objective when he is interrupting and refuting her (correctly or not) after every point. I looked for the original, but it has been set to private (which tells me a lot).

Edit to add: I do agree that environmental determinism is probably fact, but I like to hear dissenting views. The picture is always bigger than it seems.I think [this](https://youtu.be/E_qvy82U4RE) about sums up my thoughts.Your mom sounds awesome!Not usually, no. But they're fun anyway! I can tell you were brutally honest! Did you learn anything about yourself by doing this post?

I'm going to agree with a previous poster on ENFJ, and for all the same reasons. Ni is *really* hard to pick out, but I think you use it.

Also, please make your mental health a priority. Treat your anxiety now, so you can enjoy the rest of your life to the fullest.ExFP. Probably ESFP.

There's a lot of Fi in this post, but I really think you lead with Se. 

Does that sound right to you?&gt; Out of topic but Harry Potter and Hunger Games are shitty series.

Now that's a bold statement. What is a good series, then?I agree, there are a lot of shit posts here. To express my rage on this I usually head over to r/shittymbti and vent my frustrations.Coolio. Those are some good movies. I thought you were talking about books, tho. The Hunger Games is one of my favorite book series. I haven't read Harry Potter, tho. I watch Groundhog Day every year on Groundhog Day. It's pretty awesome. I have two kids. They're pretty young, so I might be wrong, but I  think they are ExFJ and xSTP.  They're pretty awesome, so I guess I lucked out on the whole kid personality type thing.Sounds about right, actually. Actually, that's not wrong at all. You have a better understanding of Fi than most Fi users I've come across.I think I have an example that will help:

I have a group of close friends: INFP (me), ISFJ, ESTP, and ESTJ. 

We were talking one day over drinks, and I said, "Hey, did you guys see that funny .gif?" I pronounced it jif, with a soft g. 

My ESTP friend tells me it's pronounced gif, with a hard g (like gift). 

I then inform him that I listened to an interview with the creator of the .gif, and he says it is pronounced with a soft g; like jif the peanut butter. 

ESTP proceeds to lecture me on how in the computer people community (of which I am not part) pronounce it with a hard g, and if you pronounce it with a soft g, then you just look like an idiot. And, it doesn't matter what the creator says it's called, it's gif with a hard g because that's how everyone else says it.

I say to ESTP, "If you think I'm going to do something just because everyone else does, you don't know me very well." and "The .gif was this guys creation, and he calls it a jif." Because, in my Fi mind, to stray from something that the creator says is true is betraying, for lack of a better word, the authenticity of it. And doing what everyone else does just for the sake of not looking stupid doesn't make any sense to me. I'm staying true to what I know is right.

ISFJ sided with ESTP (love that Fe). ESTJ (inferior Fi) sided with me.I get that. My point is that neither pronunciation is technically right or wrong, but the reasons to choose one or the other can be explained as Fi vs Fe. Fi is personal and Fe is group oriented.

&gt; Especially since the reason for the soft-g pronunciation was only to paraphrase a peanut-butter slogan

No, the creator pronounced it that way from the beginning. [source](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/battle-over-gif-pronunciation-erupts/?_r=0)Did you downvote me? :-(I've been struggling for a while trying to figure out my type, and I think putting a name to how I think might help.

I have a hard time communicating things I've learned and things I think about because I don't think linearly.  I can't just see a problem, then think of possible solutions or logical conclusions, and then make a decision. Instead I just have lumps of information floating around in my head.  I call these my thought bubbles.

My thoughts are organized into related facts and conclusions that stick together inside a "bubble."  They float around and come to the surface when I'm trying to figure something out.  The bubbles of information can collide with other bubbles and form a bigger bubble of related information, and that is how I figure things out.  But, I have a hard time communicating what I've figured out unless I talk about it out loud with someone who knows something on the subject, or if I write it down.  If I try to explain something to someone on the fly, I end up confusing them and myself because my thoughts aren't organized in a way that fosters effective communication.  My thought bubbles are not set, they change and form new ideas as new information is gathered.

I hope this was clear, because, as I said, I have a hard time communicating an idea.  I don't know what function this fits, I have been typed as almost every type and I'm hoping someone can give me some clarity on what my brain is doing.I'm ENTP.  I'm sure.  If you want to know how I typed myself, let me know.

~~After a lot of searching and researching and re-researching, I've narrowed down my type to IxTP.  I know there is a HUGE difference between Ti-Ne and Ti-Se, but there is some overlap in my personality that I could use some help in clarifying.  Also, there is a very low female population in these types, so that makes research more difficult.  TL/DR at bottom.~~

~~INTP:~~

~~I love research and analysis.  I can sit on my computer for literally days researching a topic I find interesting.  It's usually history or philosophy; or the history of philosophy; or the philosophy of history...you get it.  I go down the rabbit hole and when I finally dig myself out I have pages of notes and I need to take a shower.~~  

~~I want to know the truth.  The *real* truth.  I want to know the facts and why they are the facts and what the facts mean and what it means to be a fact.  I want to read research and read about the process by which other researchers came to their conclusions.  There are no simple answers; every answer is another question.  THERE IS NO TRUTH!~~

~~ISTP:~~

~~I love to move.  I do my best thinking while doing a repetitive physical activity like walking, running, or biking.  I love being outdoors;  I camp and hike in the summer and I downhill and cross-country ski in the winter.  I love trying new physical activities, just to see if I can do them.  I tried powerlifting for a while. It was AWESOME! I love to do those obstacle course races like Warrior Dash etc.  I'm a cautious daredevil;  I know my limits, but I love to take chances.~~

~~I love to figure things out.  If I see something I like, I try to make it.  I taught myself how to knit and crochet and I can make some pretty cool stuff.  Mostly I love figuring out music.  I haven't met an instrument that I haven't been able to figure out how to play.  Not well, I just learn enough to play the ABC's, but that's good enough for me, as long as I figured it out.  On the instruments I am skilled, I love figuring out songs I hear on the radio.  I'm not very good at it, but I still love to do it.~~

~~The biggest thing that steers me away from ISTP is that I live in my head first, and the real world second.  I like repetitive or simple physical activities because it lets me zone out and think about whatever I feel like thinking about.~~

~~In addition, if it matters, I ruled out Fi-dom because I am very unaware of how I feel about things.  It doesn't occur to me that I feel a certain way until it's slapping me in the face with tears or rage or any other unhealthy expression.  (don't worry, I'm working on it)~~

~~TL/DR:  INTP:  very cerebral and lost in thought a lot. Research addict.  ISTP:  love physical exertion, being outdoors, and figuring out how shit works.~~
Any chance of something like this being done for ISFJs?

Also, I really liked the feeling vs emotion part. I think that's a very important concept that confuses many people, myself included.I hate to be that person, but where exactly is this going? Is there going to be a way to filter people by type or other categories in the browse section once there's many more users? This isn't really about Si, but I'm pretty sure my dominant function is Si so maybe this will sound like Si.I don't really use analogies to explain things unless the other person really doesn't get it and I think I know them well enough to come up with an analogy they'll understand. Oftentimes, an analogy that makes perfect sense in my mind doesn't have the same connection for someone else. If I'm trying to explain something, I usually just break it down into the simplest terms possible and give a longer, more detailed explanation. Texting because I can think about what I want to say, and unless we're both texting each other right at that moment I don't have to respond right away. Calling someone just also feels kind of weird/awkward to me.The best example I can think of for this is how I kind of adapted to my new environment/life when I went away for college. For me, a new reality is usually a new environment or large life course change. I usually start off by continuing to live my life the way I did before, and seeing what still works and what needs to be changed. So when I got to college, I pretty much tried to do what I normally did in high school - create a routine for studying and go to the library a lot, exercise, and mostly keep to myself. Usually I just need some time to myself so I can think about it and figure out what I can keep from my old way of living and what needs to change, as well as how I need to work to accomplish that change. It didn't quite work because I had a roommate who had other ideas as to what college life was supposed to be like, and the more tense my living situation got despite trying everything I could think of to ease that tension, the more I just kind of stuck with my old ways and the less I adapted to everything else.

I'm expecting this year to go much better, since I'll be able to have time to myself to figure out everything I need to do, and I won't have another person imposing their lifestyle on me and stressing me out. I wish my roommate hadn't had such a negative impact on me, but unfortunately she did. Since this was such a big change, I really did need a decent amount of time to figure it out, and I only partially got that.

If it's smaller like my boss asking me to stay an extra 4 hours at work or something, I just need a few minutes to figure out if I can actually do that on the day they want, and then to get used to the idea and I'll usually be fine. If the new reality involves something I don't mind doing or I see as beneficial in some way, I'm usually fine with it.&gt; So by comparison; When i moved away to study the first thing i wanted to do was explore (people, places, activities), and rather than adapt my lifestyle and routine i just scrapped all routine and start from the ground up.

I wish I could have done that, but I just kinda ended up doing what I was used to and tweaking little things as needed to adapt. It helped having the built in schedule of classes as a constant from high school to college, and then I worked around that.

&gt; I'm also assuming that this circumstance did not challenge your understanding of reality? The irritation has been accepted into your perceived reality but would be avoided in future due to Si.

It didn't really change my reality, I just learned to accept it as a part of what living in my dorm was like, despite how much stress and anxiety it led to. There wasn't much I could do other than fill out a request for a change of rooms and hope that a spot opened up somewhere else (it didn't, or at least I was far enough back on the waiting list that I never got one). It was annoying because I had such high hopes for a good freshman year in a fun dorm, but it turned out to be a horrible fit for me in general. As soon as we could choose housing for the next year that I chose a single room in a dorm that I knew would be better suited for me.

On the subject of Si-Fe vs Se-Ti, what do you think you would have done if faced with a smilier situation?Just one roommate I had to live with last year. I tried not to let her get to me, but she got so rude that I just can't describe my feelings towards her with any word other than hate. Luckily it's over now and I'm pretending it just never happened.INFP -&gt; ISFJ -&gt; ISFP -&gt; ISTJ -&gt; ISFJ again, but I'm still trying to figure out ISFJ vs ISTJ. I see a lot of evidence for Fe but it could also be Si + Te, and I also feel like I use Fi, so I'm just confused. But I'm kind of tired of trying to figure it out so I just stopped trying :pWhat types would you say the other characters in the rest of the show are?I agree with those who say the wording of it is a bit odd, but I get the general idea of what the quote is trying to say and I agree with it.I can kind of see what they're getting at, and I agree with the point that people should avoid using types as a method of determining careers. 

The point about generalizing people by type can be true of those who don't really know more about MBTI, but for those who know it's not about behavior but cognition probably fall into that trap less. Two people can follow the same method for perceiving and judging information, but that doesn't mean they'll perceive it and judge it the same way, or reach the same conclusion.I would be wary of any typing/tests you took in high school, and possibly even college as well. When I was younger, I tested as INFP all the time. You mentioned the Barnum effect, and I think that could come into play because a lot of descriptions are so vague that they apply to a person the first time, and a person doesn't think to question their first typing (unless it's wildly off).

As others have mentioned, types don't change. However, as you get older, you'll get better at using functions lower in your stack, which is likely responsible for the changes in results you got. Also, online tests look at each of the four letters alone, whereas in reality all the functions interact with the other functions you use, so you can't just separate them like that. And a personal pet peeve, they take introversion vs extraversion in a social context, whereas MBTI takes it as your direction of focus.

&gt; Reading the description for ESTP, I do find it fits my current personality and outlook more than ENFP currently does.

Test results can change based on the little things going on in your life - even what mood you're in. I'd recommend looking into the 8 cognitive functions a little more, and trying to determine which of them you use to perceive and judge the world around you.&gt; They had their expectations clearly defined, did well at time management, studied for everything. Si-Te in some order. 

This. Once you figure out it is the teacher or professor wants, just replicate the format for the next assignment, changing the actual content to reflect the point of the assignment.

I wouldn't say I'm smarter than most of my other classmates, I just know how to create a system to produce a product that most professors will view as "high quality work." Throw me a curveball question in a discussion and I'll just sit there and try to piece together words in a coherent manner.I like those questions too, and they're definitely important to think about, but I can't come up with what I feel is a solid answer without having time to think it over and gather my thoughts. I hate people telling me what to do, but I don't mind being given directions/tasks/assignments in work and school (as long as it isn't too much).Any idea how to get around the obstacle of certain mental illnesses making it hard to type oneself?Someone on a personality cafe thread mentioned that she has an extremely strong and self-defined moral compass that usually guides her actions. Also, she doesn't seem interested in how things work in a stereotypical sense of Ti. I'm on mobile now but I'll go find that thread later and link it for others to see. One other thing that stuck or to me from it was the idea that she's not a stereotypical INFP, and serves as a great example of how type doesn't determine behavior. 

Although if we are going to go off stereotypes, she uses writing to work through her feelings and whatever is going on in her life, which I believe is something people attribute to INFPs. &gt; Considering her situation where she has no other place for guidance wouldn't anyone? Ti users aren't psychos, and Te users aren't ruthless tyrants...

I never said they were, but in episodes like the one with the poster contest, she's willing to sabotage the poster she made with Jane because they're changing the message she was trying to send. I wouldn't see someone with Fe doing that, but maybe I'm relying too much on the stereotypical description of Fe.

Also, this is more of an opinion than anything, but I wouldn't call describing one's family dynamic evidence that she uses Ti - do you have any other examples? A lot of people have spent enough time with their family that they can describe the relationships well because they've observed it for so long, at least for the people I know.

&gt; Yeah, how often do we see that? It's not a focus by any means, if you're given a writing assignment with whatever you want, hell yeah you'd vent out your frustrations.

I could see this, I guess I just interpreted it as her using the writing assignments as her go-to for working through things in her life, rather than talking with people. She obviously does that with issues that really get to her, as anyone would do, but I just saw writing as her default and connected it with introversion.Helps me forget how tired I am and upsets my stomachThe more I read, the more I realize there's so many points of view on every issue, and none of them are necessarily wrong or right to the person who holds them. We all have experiences that have given us the views we have (although some might be viewed as more legitimate than others, such as a personal experience vs the experience of having a parent push their viewpoint onto you). This led to a kind of overwhelming feeling that ended in me saying "why even bother" and just closing all the news articles and their respective comment sections.

I also have a really hard time making up my mind. So I just decided to stop trying. I agree with your comment about Facebook - it's just aggravating. 

&gt; While I never reject the arguments I see, I have a personal issue with people blindly defaulting to certain sides of the playing field without critically thinking what they, themselves, truly believe in as individuals.

This also sums it up nicely for me.I always related to Raven from Teen Titans when I was younger. Other than that, no one else has really resonated with me that I can remember.I'm pretty sure I'm an INFP, and unless it was a self-defense or some other legally justified/excused murder situation, I'd probably send a letter to the local police. I don't think I could keep something like that a secret.Modern. Color scheme would be grey, black, white, and either a lavender, red, or matcha green tea color for a bit of an accent in each room. I really want one of those zen/rainforest-like bathrooms with a waterfall shower too, like [some of these](http://www.freshdesignpedia.com/interior-design-ideas/modern-bathroom-ideas-getting-closer-to-nature-on-the-market-can.html).

There'd be lots of high-tech appliances, especially in the kitchen.

No clutter, everything looks well put together, and some nice accent pieces in every room as long as they don't look out of place.

All walls would be as sound proof as I can get them.

A yard isn't a must - I could see this being in an apartment building as well.

Ideally, it would include an elliptical and a treadmill that are somehow wired to use the energy generated from working out to help provide electricity to the house.

It would probably cost more than I'll make in my life, but hey it's fun to imagine.

INFP female&gt; For Ni, experience can be (or yield) information and for Si, information can be (or yield) experience.

Could you maybe expand a bit on what you mean by this? I'm having trouble distinguishing between the two, especially since I relate more to the idea of experiences being information/informative.
I need to have a deadline in order to even start it, regardless of whether or not I want to do the project or find the topic interesting. Once I have that, I'll procrastinate for as long as I can, but I'll never leave an entire thing until the day or night before it's due. Most of the time I'll need more than a day to do whatever it is that I have to do, and I generally have a sense of how long things will take me and I make sure to start early enough so that I have that amount of time.Drinking seems to calm me down, but I'll add that I've never had more than 2 drinks at a time. It also kind of makes me sleepy. It's actually kind of nice.ISTJ- psychology and statistics, hoping to go into Industrial/Organizational Psychology.I have a lot of emotions that I feel very strongly. It's not fun.I started in high school with face powder to hide acne. I always wanted to do eyeliner but then one time I wore it and then worked out and wiped my face with a towel and that was the end of that. I still wear face powder (daily) because acne, but I never do a full face unless it's a super formal event. Eyeliner is my favorite part, a mauve pink would probably be my favorite lip color, and eyeshadow is weird on me, but if I did it, I'd probably just do something basic and neutral. It'd probably take forever because I'm really bad at putting on makeup.I'm ISTJ and I got INFJ. Anecdotal answer: I learn best when I can see an example/actively engage with the material. I learn nothing from just reading about something, especially since I don't really absorb what I read. I also have a really hard time writing papers without some sort of example shown, or at least a rubric.

I was the kid who liked active reading in school because that was the only way I could remember what I read and actually learn what I was supposed to learn.I've had something similar happen. I'm always around 50/50 on both F/T and S/N. It changes depending on when I take the test and he mood I'm in. 

When I started looking into cognitive functions, I had a really hard time with whether or not I'm Fe/Ti or Fi/Te. I'm still not sure. It kind of feels like I switch between the two, but I'm leaning towards Fi/Te. The only advantage I can think of is that I stopped caring so much about what type I am because I was always questioning it. The need for security (financial or otherwise) and a slight desire to have meaningful relationships with others. I've done it (just completely stop trying to cooperate with the person and then cutting them out of your life in every possible way as soon as you can) with a roommate a little bit before our lease was up. The last month was awkward and full of rudeness from both sides, but I hated her so I did it. (For any/all characters): What do you want most in life?Time and distractions work best for me - maybe they'll help you too. Just keep busy with something (usually work or school for me but sub in what'll work in your situation), and let some time pass. Exercise is also good too.&gt; Meditator. 

&gt; Meditators often combine two features that are rarely seen together — a relaxed, big-picture worldview and a strong propensity to question their own judgments. This mixture inclines Meditators to ponder life's big questions, which they can consider in great depth if they choose. Approximately 6% of the populace are Meditators.

&gt; You are Reflective: You dislike jumping to conclusions quickly. You’re adept at reflecting on your own thoughts. When it looks like your intuitions might be leading you astray, you don’t have a problem overriding them — instead, you take the time to re-evaluate the situation and figure out the wisest course of action.

&gt; You are Subjective: People and stories interest you more than facts and figures do; you focus on the essence of ideas over the details. Your mind is more qualitative than quantitative. This trait lets you focus on the big picture over the nitty-gritty.

&gt; You are Carefree: You tend to live in the moment. You don’t waste a lot of emotional energy fretting about the future. Instead, you focus on getting the most out of life right now.

&gt; You are Open: You're not an aggressive skeptic or naysayer. You tend to consider information without immediately disputing it unless given clear reason to do so. Proving people wrong is not a high priority for you.

The first two points are mostly true (I do focus on details and wording/word choice a lot), the second two are debatable. 

I found the part about getting the most out of life right now to be interesting, since I answered later for all the money/other prize thing questions.

Edit: Changed a couple answers I was waffling on and got executive. This time I also said I was already on the email list instead of saying no to subscribing, but I doubt that changed it.

There we go.I do that too, even with books. It's just uncomfortable to watch/read, even though you know it's not real.Based on what I think Si is, my Si moment was when I was walking along a lake at school, and I saw a playing card just laying on the ground. Although instead of thinking about the card, I got hit with this memory of a friend I had in high school who was super into magic/card tricks. I don't even remember what the card looked like, or which side I saw. I just remember being hit with a bunch of memories of him doing card tricks at various times in school. And now every time I think of Si, I think of seeing that card.

Although this is based off my understanding of Si, which isn't super well-researched, so this could definitely be something unrelated to Si.I exercise more for physical stimulation (I get restless a lot), but if it makes any difference, I get need music or something to watch while I exercise. I guess it could be mental stimulation in a round about sort of way.Logic/math, self, and body/kinestheticCurrent type: ISTJ

Other introverted type: INTJ

Extroverted type: ESTJFor the most part, I enjoyed school. I liked the structure and did pretty well in my classes. The social aspect was okay - it was probably a good thing that I was forced to make friends and stuff.

People who are strong in logical-mathematical intelligence are good at reasoning, recognizing patterns and logically analyze problems. These individuals tend to think conceptually about numbers, relationships, and patterns.

Your strengths include:

Problem-solving
Thinking about abstract ideas
Conducting scientific experiments
Solving complex computations

* It helps me feel better about how I look
Oh my gosh yes. I've been trying to type myself for almost a year now, and nothing really feels quite right. I relate to certain parts of certain types, but nothing has ever made me really think "this has to be my type, no questions asked." For example, I relate a lot to the description of inferior Fe, but overall people say that I seem much more Te-Fi. I also don't relate to Fe in any position other than inferior, but I'm pretty sure I'm not a Ti-dom, so I'm not really sure what to do there. A lot of people have thought I was an ISTJ, so I just kind of settled for that and tried to care less. It's still in the back of my mind though.There’s also the majors that INTPS choose. At the university I go to, most stem majors have average GPAs that are lower than social science &amp; humanities majors. I have to look further at the dissertation to see if they looked into this. 

Edit: It doesn't look like they did any analysis past comparison of types to base rate in the population - nothing seemed to look at the relation between major and GPA and whether or not that mediated the relationship between type and GPA. If I missed it and someone else sees it in the paper please let me know, I'd love to see what that analysis revealed.Order a prep book on amazon or from target. If you get the year 2017 one it’ll probably be less than $20 and just as good as any new 2018 one, since for some reason there’s a new one every year regardless of if there’s any changes to the test. Work through the quantitative chapter - it breaks down the types of problems and how to solve them. I really struggled with the questions where it’s like A and B can weed a garden in 6 hours. C can weed a garden in 15 hours. How long will it take them all type questions, and the book I got broke those down and explained how to solve them and variations of them. 

The quant section is weird but many programs think it’s indicative of potential success in the more quantitative fields. I’m retaking the test in a couple weeks to try and get my score up since it’s the only section that matters for programs I’m looking at. Sometimes it feels like luck of the questions though. 

Good luck!I started watching Daria this past week, and I've been trying to figure out the types of the characters. I ended up searching some personalitycafe threads because I gave up, and it seemed to be people arguing INTJ vs INTP vs INFP. I'm inclined to believe INFP myself, but I was wondering what you all think. I'm also curious about Jane, since she's my favorite character and there wasn't as much discussion about her.I know we have breakdowns of the percentage of the population for each type, but does anyone have the numbers for what percentage of the population is Fe or Fi, and same with the other functions? Sorry for any typos but I'm on mobile at a party so I'm not proofreading. Thanks!
Same. I feel like a bunch of the types would just take turns playing with the dog.To be fair most people in /r/INTJ aren't even INTJ so it can still apply.Extroversion and introversion have different connotations in mbti than they do in popular usage. Rather than meaning socially outgoing or withdrawn, it describes whether your orient your energy through your inner or outer world. The I and E in your types just shows whether your dominant function is an extroverted (Te, Ne, Se, Fe) or introverted (Ti, Ni, Si, Fi) one and doesn't explicately mean how socialable you are.

For example, the dominant function of ENFP is extroverted intuition, which deals with seeing the outside world through the realm of possibilities, ideas, and what could be. In truth, you can be an ENFP loner who stays in their room all reading, creating art, playing music, day dreaming, working on projects, discovering new hobbies, etc. Ne doesn't necessarily require being people-oriented but because Ne-doms like ideas and new things, this can translate to being socially extroverted. But I've seen ENxPs who like their alone time or may have trouble with their social skills.I originally got free spirit but when I did it again I got mediator, which I think fits better.  But who knows. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Like another user said, this test is kinda meh. INFP - Self, Music, LanguageAs someone who has suffered from multiple bouts of depression in my life, learning about cognitive functions has been helpful. I have a tendency to fall into a Fi-Si loop and knowing about it has helped me to step back, understand why my I'm thinking the way I do, and snap out of it. 

I know MBTI is not perfect and many misuse it, but I've benefited from it.Looking at your post history, all you do is post articles from Astrologian on different subreddits.

I smell a PR stunt.INFP and I received linguistic-verbal intelligence. I think it fits. 
I'm an INFP and I actually *just* got diagnosed as ADHD-PI (inattentive type - I'm definitely *not* hyperactive) in July.  I'm 35, so it took a *really* long time, but it makes total sense in my case and I'm in a trial and error phase with meds. I didn't go in seeking help/meds for ADD/ADHD. I went in with clinical depression and anxiety and the clinician I saw actually suggested that ADHD is one of my main issues resulting in the other problems.It depends on the circumstances surrounding the death. 

I had a friend die while I was in HS. It was unfair and unexpected. I mourned her for months/years. It was almost 2 decades ago, and I still cry for her on occasion. My wedding was difficult because she should have been there to be a bridesmaid. I crumpled when I saw her sister in the receiving line.

I barely shed a tear for my grandparents. They were old, had lived good lives, and it wasn't a huge surprise when it happened. In my grandmother's case, it was merciful because she had Alzheimers and we'd lost her long before she died. I miss them and think about them once in a while, but I am not preoccupied with their deaths. It was part of life.

My FIL was an interesting case. He had cancer and Parkinson's and unless he really doped himself on meds, he was in constant pain and couldn't really function well anymore. He took his own life to escape. We were shocked, but not shocked. I am a huge supporter of death with dignity and assisted suicide for cases like his, so even though I know my husband really misses his dad and we know he'd still be here if his health circumstances had been different, we know he's at peace in some way.I was socially awkward, very self-conscious, but I had some anger issues that I took out on the water when I swam.  I was raised rather strictly and I was scared to death to do anything "wrong"... I didn't allow myself to be creative or be a rebel in any way. I had a handful of friends, but we were a mix of kids that didn't really fit in with any of the other groups. It was nice to be part of a group that just accepted people as they were and didn't expect any conformity. I had good grades, but that's only really because school came relatively easy to me and I didn't have to try very hard, even in AP classes. In middle school and early high school I was teased a lot, but that died off a bit by senior year. I never really felt like I fit in anywhere.Me: INFP
Dad: ISTJ
Mom: ESTJ
Sister: INFJ
Husband: INTJ

It's an interesting life, for sure.They don't. Mom is very controlling and her and my sister have butted heads for as long as I can remember.Great. We're going on 18 years together. We balance each other out pretty well. My clutter/laziness drive him crazy, but we support each other and each others strengths.SO strict. If they said jump, I asked how high. They chose my college major for me and let me know, in no uncertain terms, they were "disappointed" when I opted for a different (read: not as prestigious) career. /r/raisedbynarcissists I'm INFP married to a INTJ. I've been with him for 20 years. I can guarantee he's not a chauvinistic asshole. He's more liberal than I am in many ways. I fear that many incels are INTJ and will give them a bad name.

 
I dated an ESTP for 3 1/2 years. It was really a great relationship in the beginning. We had basic values in common, but not much in the way of actual hobbies. He ended it when he realized I was too quiet for him and his friends and my dislike for social situations, and he couldn't change me no matter how much he tried. Also, he said we had nothing in common. I'm sure it could work if you can get past those things, but be prepared to face a lot of differences.On. Definitely love my music.ESTJs are really overbearing. Don't like them.I was just reading about being in the grip of types, and Thomas definitely sounds like he's in an Si grip, "they become defensive about and fixated on the facts and details, by over-preparing, being worried that someone may criticize their information, and habitually complain about others’ factual and detail errors." This would make him and ENxP, I'm guessing ENTP. "He enjoys learning new things and spouting these new things at other people in order to give them the impression that he is extremely intelligent" Also sounds like ENTP behavior. 
Cora sounds like an ISFP. There's nothing you mentioned that would make me think she's an INFP.Sounds like maybe an ISFP more than an INTP.I usually visualize when I'm reading literature, but if it's numbers, I usually have to subvocalize. I work with a lot of numbers in my job, and if I don't read them out loud, I can't remember what they are.
-_- Can't believe I'm actually typing this, but I had this on loop while I was doing some internet research: [Boat Dog - Markiplier](https://youtu.be/WLIfbiTUMiU)

If you don't count that as an actual song, then [Priceless - for KING &amp; COUNTRY](https://youtu.be/wX9oWOdZccA)I'll use an anecdote.

An older co-worker that we recently hired lost her husband a few months prior. My go-to for consoling her when she was having a sour moment of recollection was to go hug her and place my head on hers. The prominent thought that ran through my head during the conversation was "What can I do to make her feel better? What would I want if I were in that position? What would she like that I might not?" Sympathetic thoughts. So I brought her some dark chocolate during lunch and talked to her about losing my dad and how I handle that loss. (For the curious, this is non-romantic; she's double my age.)

Not to say there's no bottom-up thinking; I daresay it's my autopilot mode at work, and I don't rush to a conclusion just because I think (feel) it seems right/wrong, at least on a good day. But in spurs-of-the-moment or times where I have to contemplate something, I default to "How/why did/does/would this make me/them/it feel if/when...?" Or, in other words, attempting to be optimally sympathetic.Debatably true.[A similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/bpnsuy/what_is_it_like_being_a_feeling_type/) was posted a few days ago. Here was my response:

Or, in other words, attempting to be optimally sympathetic.As did I.While a being fake is annoying and not something I want around, it's not going to get me hating someone.

No, it's devaluing someone else's humanity that strikes a nerve. To call out someone, or, God forbid, punish someone for simply existing is mortally offensive. Every person has intrinsic value, and if another man or woman intends on stealing that value for their own gain, they are filth. They are still forgivable -- I wouldn't like to find myself a hypocrite saying they don't have value of their own -- but in that moment they are liable to get punched.I remember reading that on either 16P or personality cafe. And, based on the posts I remember seeing, r/ENFP would back it up in a heartbeat.You have me beat there.

Plus, I only listed one source. I should be skeptical myself of that claim, yet I find it a rather fitting fact for the ENFP I know. She' definitely not introverted, but far from the life of parties or center of most discussions. Still, small sample size, so I agree with your skepticism.To add to your second point, you describe my old college roommate in a nutshell. He was an ENTP who, true to the stereotype, killed in deep conversation and playing Devil's Advocate. But he wasn't one to seek it out. He didn't expect people to retort with the same passion and voracity for discussion that he had, so he developed a general dislike for the crowd and would stay quiet and reclusive, at least for an extrovert.

Except in engineering classes. He dominated class discussion. Our old, ornery, and decisively blunt Transport Systems professor actually befriended him for his tenacity and criticism. But I digress.Had an ENTP roommate, so not shipping, but having lived together I can see some of the appeal.  My experience showed both are willing to go off the deep end searching and discussing conceptual, metaphysical, or hypothetical topics, and exploring real life to find out how to make those ideas become reality. Granted, those explorations seldom amount to anything, but, in that relationship, it is entirely the thought that counts.

Housekeeping and some financial stuff were an issue though. And as for hosting parties and events, I was not a fan.Hi.

Ex-ChemE INFP here. Engineering was awesome. Growing up was not. Best advice I could give my college self is:

\- Be you, and be happy you are who you are, but *work on yourself*. Don't be fully complacent with bad habits that you downplay or sweep under the rug. Work on them a little. Find your balance between perfectionism and complacency. MBTI calls it working on your inferior Te. I call it growing up and becoming a responsible adult (at least responsible enough to survive).

\- Make a living out of something you can tolerate. Make a life out of something you love. Don't make them be the same thing. You will get tired of what you love if it is your occupation and then you will be left hollow, unfulfilled, and/or depressed. Keep your hobbies or passions outside work, as that gives you the liberty to explore, expand, and keep your passion satisfying.

\- Do not be pressured by society, by peers, or by any grand standards you have. College is not everything, nor is your career. If you can do better by it, **do it**, but *don't let it kill you in the proces*s. If it's even a little too much to handle, take time off, or switch. Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy with your schooling. If it's not going to payout financially, emotionally, and mentally, drop it and come back when you're ready or move on to something else (I had to, and I'm glad I did). For you, OP, that may indeed mean getting something that pays the bills while you devote your spare time to writing.

\- Network. Make acquaintances in good places. Get to know your professors and potential employers. Be a part of clubs and activities related to things you enjoy or are proficient in. I wouldn't volunteer for project lead or coordinator, but at least put your name and face out there. It pays off on the job search and on-the-job when you need advice/aid for a project or problem. This also applies for writing, writing groups, and publishers.

\- Do this all at your own pace. As was just mentioned, don't gauge your success by those around you and how far along they are. INFPs tend to be quickly overwhelmed by all the knowledge, critical thinking, socialization, and practical skills engineering requires to be successful, and may take extra time and effort to process it all whilst becoming a (semi-)responsible adult, but in return we make amazing problem solvers and passionate co-workers that are welcome to the industry. Alternatively, INFPs are stereotypically (read: I'm not, but many are) fantastic writers, so that should come naturally. Even so be prepared to fall down a tax bracket as economical success there is laden with variables you can't control, sometimes even pure chance. But if you love doing it, it may be worth the risk.Dadgum it. YesAlong those lines, brain damage/vegetative states. They aren't dead, but they're not "themselves" either, and they never will be. That horrifies me. I can't stand brain washing scenes in movies for similar reasons.Definitely the dog. That precious mutt is gonna drown in my affection while I pretend to ignore the dude 3 feet to my right awkwardly confessing his life secrets to me and his red solo cup.Sweet ***Dinner*** Rolls

Sour dough-buttermilk base, honey-butter glaze, baked, sometimes lightly toasted. Goes great with savory meats/soups/casseroles. Overall pleasant.

Compare to regular Sweet Rolls: sour dough base, icing, baked with lots of flavorings/chunks, and actually rolled in some fashion. Basically a cinnamon roll. Usually super sweet. Awesome dessert. Does not pair well with savories (unless deep fried instead of baked and glazed instead of frosted, but that makes it a doughnut).

Choose as you will, I am fine with being either.\****SMACK***\*

*"Get a hold of yourself chief this is WAR!"*

\- Some concerned, angry soldier somewhere.No that was Jonah.INFP is sky blue.

That strikes a chord with me.

It also annoys me.

&amp;#x200B;

Good chart overall, though it seems a bit like over-generalization-for-fun. Scaling factors like ambiversion across discreet steps in a spectrum seems really case-by-case and would only be accurate for the more extreme stereotypes. I still like it though. It's fun to compare and contrast.Right indeed! I am introverted, and have been that self-centered person in conversation. I will not defend that mindset: redirecting the conversation back to one's self is vain and does not build trust, but rather pride in the attention-seeker, which sets up for disappointment and spreads distrust. It's unhealthy for both parties. Key is to do like you said and just be active and interested, even if it is draining for us. The mutual trust is worth it.

^(Edit: Added that last bit.)
Yeah, my ENFJ mother was always good at getting me to let everything out, either by asking questions or by simply guessing.  I always felt like I needed to just be by myself until she'd come into my room and ask what was wrong.Yeah but what if one is from the presidentIt kind of depends on whether you're an extrovert or introvert.  If you're an ENFP or ISTJ, the Fi and Te are right next to each other, so depending on external influences, could get mixed up.

However, Fi doesn't necessarily only deal with morals, it's also a sense of identity and being.  Things that are important to you, not just on a moral basis, are VERY important to you, for instance, Fi, despite being "feeling," could take to heart being as logical as possible.

Based on that and the way you worded your comment, I'm going to say Fi above Te, but like I said, it depends on your first letter.

This post is definitely Fi and Te though.  You're looking to establish a sense of identity (Fi) through objective, fact based information (Te).Classic INTP.[lol](http://i.imgur.com/Wk5h8I0.png)

But really, I'd like to know how whoever it is determined this chart.  The first match is just the functional inversion of whatever base type which makes a bit of sense, but after that it just kind of goes to shit.  Are they really saying that I'm less compatible with another INFP than with an ENTJ~~, with whom I share no functions~~?

I dunno, I think this chart is just a half-baked idea.  I tend to get along more with other NFs than anything.Oh shit you're right, my bad.  Clearly I was the one that didn't think this through.  My last sentence still stands though.&gt;Captain AmericaI see nothing wrong with this.My dad is ISFP and has ADHD.  What this meant most of the time is that he'd "hear" stuff, but then forget it within the same moment.  Sort of like extreme short-term memory.  It really only manifested itself when he was absorbed doing something.  For example we'd say "Hey dad" to get his attention, and when he didn't respond, "HEY DAD," and then he'd be a little annoyed, like he didn't realize we'd tried to get his attention before.

But that's just my experience.  I'm sure different people can manifest different qualities.I'd say wanting it impacted is both Se and Te.  Depends on what type of "weird shit" we're talking about, but Te seeks to externally organize things according to systems, and in the case of xxFP's presents as a desire for the external world to match what Fi holds valuable.

The difference between Se and Ne in this case is that whereas Ne wants to do this by showing others different perspectives through ideas and talking about their "weird shit," Se will attempt to convince others by getting them to do it and find out for themselves.Dad: ISFP  
Mom: ENFJ  
Me: INFP  
Brother1: ESTP  
Brother2: ISFJ  

It seems pretty varied, but if you go out into my extended family, there's more similar personality types.  I could post those if you wanted.After much thought and investigation, I have come to the same conclusion.

Elementary, my dear Watson.&gt;dear diary…today i am going to love garbage

me_irlI do this, but only because when I try to think of something to say beforehand, I just end up trying to say every word at once resulting in something that sounds not unlike "wlehwnealk9biea" and then just winging it anyways.Are you Dwight Schrute?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yinDcFABc

The other is more general.  It's about determining validity based on a set of reasonings.  It doesn't have to be classically "logical," but the word for it is logic.  Everyone sees the world differently, and will come to different conclusions to different things.

To bring this back to the original topic, yes Fi is a logical function, just as much as Ti is.  For instance, "I believe that animals are intelligent and should be treated with respect, therefore I will not hunt animals."  Is that not logical?  Is there not a sound reasoning behind that?

The point is Fi is logical with its personal structure of moral beliefs.  Ti is logical with its personal structure of systems and facts.  Either type can hold beliefs or facts that from the outside make no "logical" sense, and either type can be "logical."
Your score is 32 out of 36.
The average score is 26.
I failed both...I'm great at reading people irl, I swear, haha.Idealism: 2.9

Relativism: 3.2

Puts me in the Subjectivist category, which seems fairly accurate. Casually Quaternarian-64% vs. 36%Curious about the world around them, and always willing to learn something new. I have a hard time with people who think that learning stops once they leave school and/or don't care about things if they don't personally affect them. 

Kind to others. 

They would have to share my desire to one day have children. That is one of the things that I look forward to most in life, and it's not something I'm willing to negotiate. And I wouldn't pressure someone else into making that decision if they held the opposite view. 

Physical attractiveness. 

Someone is who their own person, with their own passions and career goals. I wouldn't want to be with someone who loses their individuality in a relationship, or be part of a couple who seem to have merged into one being. Father: INFP

Mother: Unhealthy ESFJ

Me: INFP (I think; possibly INFJ)

Brother: ISTJHe seems more likely to be a feeling type. I've been thinking ISFP or ESFP; either way, it seems like Se and Fi are pretty high on his function stack. It's tempting to say ESFP based on his mannerisms when performing, but in interviews, he's often a bit more measured and reserved, and less theatrical. Phlegmatic by a narrow margin. 

Choleric-1.9

Melancholic-3.4

Phlegmatic-3.6

Sanguine-2.7Hey, why not?

1. I'm a 26 year old American female.  

2. I've been settled with INFP for a while, but sometimes I doubt my conclusion. There are elements of Fi that I definitely identify with; I usually know right away how I feel about something or someone, and I feel like my system of ethics is innate, and wasn't really influenced by the outside world. When I've taken function tests, such as Keys2Cognition, it yields high Fi and Ne, and also high Ni, Ti, and Fe. However, I also identify with elements of Fe/Ni. Even if I know how I feel about something, I won't necessarily say anything about it if I'm with a group of friends who are expressing the opposite opinion, and I'll usually come up with something neutral to say so that I don't come across as a renegade or party-pooper. But I've also been known to explain, "no, *this* is what is actually happening", and then am faced with "how did you know that?" questions afterwards. Maybe what's obvious to me isn't always apparent to others? People have told me that I have a very expressive face, which I think is associated with Fe (?). I'm very sensitive to the emotions of others, and feel what they feel, even if my internal state had been something else entirely. I work with the public, and will often sense someone's "essence" as a human being, which is overwhelming if someone's either a very good or very bad person. "There's a method to my madness" is something I often say to people, because they are standing there watching me work with a bemused or seriously confused look on their face. i also often feel detached from the world, and get lost in my own musings easily. I used to think I was an INTP when I was a teenager, if that's relevant. I think I was hesitant to admit to myself that I'm a feeling type, and INTP females are quite uncommon, which explained to me why I felt so unlike my classmates. 

3. Since figuring out what my MBTI type is has been an ongoing personal quest for years, it would be very satisfying for me, and give me a sense of closure. 

4. I'd probably spout off about how the lack of empathy will be the doom of the human race, for everyone to get off their cell phones, stop taking selfies, and pay attention to how the world is really structured. Division and hatred is manufactured and desired by those in control. Probably end the broadcast with Timothy Leary's quote, "think for yourself and question authority". 

5. I feel that people sometimes think of me as "shy" because I don't talk as much as they think I should, which bothers me because I'm not shy, just a little reserved. This quietness can apparently be intimidating to others, and can lead them to think I'm mean or something, which also bothers me. Physically, I'm pretty small (5'3", 115 lbs), and another woman who's over six feet tall and strong-looking told me this once. Also, more than one person has said they thought I didn't like them when we first met, and "-dyad- doesn't like anybody at first". I'm really not that callous until someone gives me a very good reason. I feel like I'm more analyze first, then act, and society tends to favor people who act first, and then think about what they've done. I've tried acting this way, because, hey maybe they're right in their approach, and disaster has always followed. 

6. My family life hasn't been the best, mostly due to my mother and her many dysfunctions, so I have become pretty good at disassociating, which isn't exactly healthy. However, it's had me very aware of when someone is attempting to emotionally manipulate me. As a response to my lack of control over my external environment, I had an eating disorder for a while, if that's relevant. 

7. Not going to link anything here, but thanks for taking the time to read my response!Mostly affiliative and self-enhancing, which is pretty accurate. It depends. 

Seriously, though, it is hard for me to answer in black and white terms sometimes, because that's not how I think. Moreover, it frustrates me sometimes when other people are unable to see the nuance of an issue either because they've already made up their mind or just don't want to really think about it. Playing 20 Questions as a kid proved difficult at times. Maybe it's a function of maturity for Fi users who make a huge deal about these types of things? 

I'm also vegetarian, but I don't make a huge deal about it; many people don't even know. When my friends and I are going somewhere, and they are worrying about what's available for me, I have to repeatedly assure them that wherever we go, it will be okay; I'm not picky. I don't want to impose my beliefs on others and don't want to draw attention to myself. ISTJ or INTP?ISTJ, i guess because they seem to be using a lot of logic and structure to try and figure out why they are feeling a certain way*. They are rationalizing why they are feeling content, despite the fact they didn't "accomplish" anything, and end the entry with a couple of definitive statements. And ISTJ because journaling is not something I'd expect INTPs to do unless it was for a school assignment or something. 

I might be talking nonsense, so forgive me for that. I got 35/65 INFJ. Maybe it's right; I've had my doubts about my INFPness for awhile, and your INFJ examples are more accurate for me. INFP-I love animals in general, but I guess cats. Mine is sitting on the back of my chair right now. INFP female. I don't really watch too many movies; it can be sensory overload for me, and a lot of them aren't worth it. 

The Prestige-I think sometimes this gets overlooked in favor of other Christopher Nolan films, like Interstellar and the Batman trilogy, which are great, too, but I love this movie. David Bowie plays Tesla, alongside Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as rival magicians. What more could you ask for?

V for Vendetta and Inglorious Basterds are also favorites. INFP, probably

The paragraph about Liberal Feminism is pretty representative of my beliefs, while the one on Radical Feminism is just as representative of what I don't agree with. This was an interesting, and accurate, little test. F, 27, I think I'm INFP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)#/media/File:Iris_latifolia-Lac_Aule-Laruns-2522~2013_07_29.JPGYep, this is a defense mechanism that many people use on a regular basis. But I tend to make "judgements" about how someone is feeling based on their personality, what I think may be going on based on past experiences, and the vibe they're giving off (the most important factor, because words do not always match up to what is going on in someone's head). It doesn't have to do with how I've felt in similar situations, or how I would hypothetically feel, because I intentionally try *not* to assume someone else would react the same way. Not everyone responds to the same stimuli in the same way. Idk, maybe I'm an atypical Fi user. 

My favorite defense mechanism is disassociation. I've no idea if this is related to type, but I have an almost unconscious reflex to get myself away from something that I feel is violent/gross/unnecessarily vulgar. If I can't just walk away, I tend to put my hand up towards my eyes or ears. Violent things bother me more than "gross out" videos and things like that, although a month or so ago, some people I work with were watching videos of pimple popping and I was repulsed by it and refused to look. They all seemed to enjoy it though. 

I think I just don't want those kinds of images in my head. I don't watch a lot of TV or movies because I feel many don't have a lot of value to them, and are often violent/gross/vulgarity trying to be humor. I'd never visit a subreddit like the one you mentioned. When I see roadkill, I'm upset about it for the rest of the day, and have cried in my car when it's obvious it was someone's pet (it's making me sad just typing this, tbh). Maybe I'm too damn sensitive. I don't know if it's related to type, but I often do the same sort of thing. I find that pretending to explain something to another person helps me understand it better. I also mumble under my breath a lot in general. There has only been one time when I don't remember large parts of the night; my friend and I both, apparently, hit the wall all of a sudden, like putting our heads down on the bar, and I remember not being able to walk. The whole thing was weird and I maintain something strange went on, because we hadn't had that much to drink. 

Usually, though, I get happy and chatty when I drink.Pretty sure I'm 6w5 and INFP. Kindness-to other people, animals, and the planet in general. 

Honesty

Integrity

Empathy-like real empathy, not the faux stuff that's often posted on social media after a tragic event. I'm sure some of those people do feel bad about it, but the attention seeking behavior of posting about it rubs me the wrong way most of the time. 

Humbleness 

Ability to accept other possibilities and that you may be wrong. 


INFP. I can't even do that in public restrooms unless it's an absolute emergency. I'd wait for the other person to leave regardless of whether or not I'd also stunk up the place. I also usually wait for other people to be done if they've heard me dispose of feminine products in the bin. Some of these I guess I relate to, like the headphones one, because I think it's rude to start a conversation with someone who's giving off strong signals of wanting to be left alone. 

But others I find a bit harsh, like not wanting to talk to people outside of given situations (of forced socialization) and the "burden" being all on the other person. If I've chatted to a classmate all semester and I see them at a bar or something, it would be rude of me not to at least say hi. I don't know, I think I find socialization more of an intimidating thing, rather than an unpleasant thing. Sometimes I want to talk to people around me, but I'm too nervous/feel too awkward to do it. Intrapersonal-3.86

Naturalist-3.86

Bottom two were Logic/Math and Spatial (both below 2), which is really pretty accurate for me. This is a fun thread! It's a bit hard to explain in words my reasoning behind these picks, other than the vibe they give?

Normal mode: [The Killers-Read My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8hbSM1zVo) One of my favorite bands. 

[Muse-Explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLsxkxh8Ns0) My favorite band. The existential melancholy is pretty representative of my feelings and what I'm thinking about a lot of the time.

[The Clash-Clampdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psB0cidB5bg)This is my own opinion on the issue, and I haven't done a whole lot of research myself, but I think it's a combination of nature/nurture, as well as how healthy the family dynamic was while the kids were growing up. In an unhealthy environment, it might happen that the kids will want to "reject" everything about the parent(s) who are creating the situation (addiction, abuse, etc.), and then go on to have a different personality. Conversely, a more stable environment where the parents encourage and support the children may make it more likely for them to emulate the traits of their parents, but also to feel comfortable and safe enough to become their own person. 

From my experience, the former is the case. My mother is a suuuper unhealthy ESFJ, and I have made an effort since I was around 12/13 to be nothing like her, even though we have always had very different personalities anyway. However, I have a great relationship with my dad who is also an INFP (I think), because he has always encouraged me to do what I feel is right for me and has behaved how a parent should. My brother is ISTJ and we are really close, so we share all functions with our dad. Red-Thinking

Blue-Intuition

Yellow-Feeling

Green-SensingThank you! It's such a tiring stereotype, even though I know it's very much based in reality. 

Being what's now labeled a "socially and economically conservative" INFP can be a lonely place. For the record, I did get suspended on Twitter for 12 hours once.I really think it's a biological thing. Women have been caregivers and the main ones raising children since the dawn of humanity, and this same behavior is seen across the animal kingdom, including in apes and monkeys. Women also tend to choose jobs that have lower wages than jobs that are primarily occupied by men (day care workers, teachers, service industry vs. corporate jobs, hard physical jobs like plumbing, construction, etc., pilots). Many of those high-paying jobs are also dangerous and/or require a lot of time spent away from home, which is something women in general are less likely to be willing to do. And when women have children, they often decide to work part-time to spend more time with their kids, if it's possible. 

Everything doesn't have to be 50/50. It's also really tiring to hear that women are at a disadvantage in Western society because ~sexism~, meanwhile there isn't much said about countries where women are actually oppressed, like many countries in the Middle East.Panic and then call AAA.Odds are pretty good. 

I've never done that, but I have forgotten to put the gas cap back on, and drove home with it hanging out of the shut compartment. I had to stop at a road project and was the first car in line; I wondered why the stop sign lady kept looking at me funny, lol.I thought it was asking if we pay more attention to people or the hierarchies people work within. Or people first, facts second/vice versa.I thought a birthday cake would be a person who is open, whose personality always shines, what you see is what you get, while a fortune cookie would be a person who has a "shell" they hide in around most people. Openness vs. being mysterious.I think adverse childhood events have more of an influence on addiction than personality type. Personality might influence how their addictions play out, for example in a high Se user, it may be obvious they have a problem (the people whose mugshots are shown on local news), but high Si users might be better at masking their problems (middle class people who abuse prescription medication/alcohol but are able to maintain job/family life until they reach a breaking point).I have a visceral reaction to those facial expressions. Bleh.Not disagreeing with you, but could the small amount of ISFPs in a liberal arts student population be due to ISFP artists being less likely to go to formal schooling to practice their art?Mental diagnoses don't change your type.That's interesting! I stand corrected. Thank you.I would think so. I hope you are doing better.INFP, conservative. Not a member of any party. 

There was a time when I was a teenager and was exposed to "liberal" ideas and agreed with them, but I've changed my views as I've gotten older; I'm now 31. Actually, it might be more accurate to say that "liberal" ideas have gone further and further off the rails (imo, obviously). 

Probably one of the more significant changes has been my view on abortion. I think many young people learn about it in health class, but the details of the procedure aren't addressed, so it becomes normalized and a lot of people don't see anything wrong with it. Also the whole gender issue is beyond me. I guess this is hate speech in some quarters, but I don't care.People are dumb. Humans go outside.Yes.I post on reddit more than anywhere else, and post on Instagram maybe once or twice a month. Usually it's my cat. I haven't posted a status on Facebook since 2016, maybe? I just lurk and like/comment every once in a while. I hated when people would ask if things were on the test, especially in college classes. It's so rude to the teacher and other students, like you're only there to memorize things for the test and forget it when you leave the room, and that you only care what they have to say because you need the grade. It's especially bad when the teacher is clearly passionate about whatever they're talking about, and then someone has to burst in with that bit of self-centeredness. Of course, I've thought things like, "this is boring", but I'd never say it out loud. 

I care about learning things, not just passing a stupid test. Sorry, guys, I really just needed to get this off my chest. I've only seen a few of his videos, but I think he talks way too fast and a lot of his expertise seems to come from that. I'm not stupid, but I go, "Wait, what?" after a couple minutes. I think if he rethought his approach in communicating information it might be better. 72.14 

High Complexity, Paradox, Abstraction, and Curiosity. 

Above average Boldness, Perspective, and Connection. 

Average Persistence. I go full-on protector mode when somebody's going after someone I care about; I don't back down that easily if it's just verbal conflict. It seems I have a knack for knowing what to say to diffuse the situation. I was very quiet, chubby, and had a hard time making friends. I hung out with people at school, but I never felt like they really cared too much for me and that I was a burden to be around, and I didn't get invited to anything outside of school. My family situation was messed up, still is, and I think that just made all of my preexisting traits (i.e. quietness, being a loner) worse. I wanted to be normal and have an experience I imagined other people were having, but I didn't get the chance to have carefree teenage years. Kind of still envious of those who did. 

Classes: some pre-IB and IB classes, which I did well in. I loved Spanish and Psychology. 

What I want to be when I grow up? Ten years later and I still am not sure, haha. But I have made progress on not assuming everyone hates me, and I'm not chubby anymore, so there's that. I'm really interested in psychology in general, and personality psychology has always been one of my favorite areas to learn about. When I was in high school, we took the dichotomy test (I know) and it spurred my interest in learning more because it seemed like a useful way to understand other people and how they perceive the world. I remember a lot of my class came out xNFJ and xNxP-I got INTP, which probably was not entirely accurate, but I could see that this system might be a good way to understand people and the societies at large. I also enjoy delving deeper into the theory because there's always more to learn and different perspectives to consider.

I also really appreciate having an online community to talk about this kind of thing with, since many people in my real life don't really care too much haha. 

It's a little strange that the cashier would tell you that a customer yelled at her after you left, especially since the cashier is the one who had the lady wait until you got back (maybe the cashier has low Fe?). I have worked in retail for a looong time, and in this situation the transaction should be voided/suspended, like someone else mentioned. I also don't speak poorly about customers to other customers, regardless of if they're a "usual". It looks bad and it's not a good habit to get into. 

In any case, the woman who got angry was angry with what the cashier did, not what you did, so there is nothing for you to feel bad about. TBH, I think many people would be annoyed with having to wait for someone else to go home and get their money; berating the cashier, however, is not acceptable. And to answer your question, this seems like an Fi thing because it seems to be affecting you a lot, even though you did nothing wrong. I am INFP and I frequently have this problem of ruminating on feelings of guilt even though I did not do anything wrong. 

I could be wrong, but you should not be carrying around the responsibility of what happened when you weren't there.Orphan Black-I like conspiracies, especially plausible ones, and this is rife with them. Also the acting is amazing. 

Game of Thrones-I really enjoy watching the characters and their relationships develop over the course of the series after everything they've been through. Everything about the show, really. 

Community-This show is hilarious! And each time you rewatch, you catch another tiny bit you missed before. I honestly related to Annie quite a bit, too.I don't know about favorites, but I enjoy seeing ESTJs and ENFJs in action. 

ESTJs just tend to give off the vibe that they have all their crap together and have a plan of action for whatever's coming next. I used to watch Martha Stewart shows when I was younger and felt like I had no control over my environment and needed structure. It's impressive to me, because I could try so hard to be like that but it would never work out. 

It's also quite something to watch ENFJs be so socially adept and able to manipulate (for good and for bad!) those around them. Again, I guess it's kind of an aspirational thing where I could try to emulate what they do, but it would not be the same.Obvious stereotyping, but I don't think many INTPs would remind teachers about forgotten homework assignments for the reasons you gave or want to be a hall monitor to enforce school rules. 

Have you looked into functions tests? [Keys 2 Cognition](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm) may be helpful.My first relationship lasted around three years. We ended up living together and getting a cat, but looking back, it definitely was not "great". I think my reality was replaced by an idealized version of what was going on, and I kind of threw myself into the relationship completely and lost my sense of identity for awhile. Guy broke up with me a few days after my birthday, but I got to keep the cat. 

My intuition is right more often than not, and I often trust it and act on it. 

I guess people think I'm a little strange; I feel like an outsider in most social situations, but I've learned how to fake it. People have told me I'm hard to read at first and can be intimidating, which I find funny because I do not see myself that way.Jon Snow and Margaery Tyrell are my two favorites. *Cersei is a narcissist and a super exaggerated version of how my own mother views her children and everyone around her, so she has been my least favorite from the start. Excellent villain though.

My brother is ISTJ and he's said Bronn is his favorite. I know a probable ENFP and her favorite is Tyrion, and an ENFJ who likes Dany.Wolves and elephants. Elephants seem to have more emotional capacity than many people I meet and it gets to me in a good way. Also red pandas.I agree about NFPs perhaps not being as "nitpicky" about the finale. I don't need everything explicitly spelled out for me ( &gt;!Azor Ahai definitely happened in the finale, and that seemed lost on some!&lt; ) , and I do not care too much about characters traveling too quickly or whatever the latest thing is. The possibility of no one getting the iron throne in the end seemed likely to me a few seasons ago, but I think that was part of the problem for some people. I like stories that make me reflect on the characters, their journeys, myself, and the world at large. Some people watched just to see the dragons and other cool stuff, but I think the heart of the story is with the former. My ISTJ brother didn't seem too keen on it, though, and he's been complaining about what I think are trivial things for awhile. 

I was satisfied with the ending, and it was about as happy as it could get for a show that's put us all through the emotional ringer for a decade. I only cried once while watching.INFP female

A man being healthy looking, in that he's not overweight, and has good hygiene, clean/matching clothes, and generally looks like he cares about his appearance is very important. Also having kind eyes and a kind smile. I also seem to prefer guys who aren't super tall (&lt;5'10" maybe).I would probably think about it, but it would depend on the teacher and the class. I'm leaning toward no, most likely, unless I got along well with the professor. But I also think many teachers would let you keep the original score if it was their mistake because there have been times when the professor has written the problem wrong or done the math incorrectly and then just given everyone full credit for that question.When I played soccer when I was younger, I took the approach of "let's just have fun" unless someone on the other team made me mad (for example, being overly aggressive when we're playing in a rec league, intentionally trying to hurt me or my teammates, etc.). Then all bets were off and I was usually successful. It's also not unheard of for me to get a little over-excited about trivia games.

I'm usually an easy-going person, and I've learned that trying to "compete" against other people in personal or professional life leads to many negative feelings for all parties, so I try not to do that.I agree. Most of the ESFP managers I've worked with have not been very good managers, and certainly did not act like TJs at work. There was often more loud gossiping while standing around looking at other people do all the work than any managing going on. 

There's a time and place for gossip, and during Black Friday prep when there is a ton of freight and your crew is busting their butts trying to get it done ain't it. Maybe more mature ESFPs would be good in management positions, but that hasn't been a good combination in my experience.Obviously not knowing the whole situation, blah, blah, but...this seems like a one-sided relationship. You're spending a lot of mental energy and actual money trying to make her happy, but I'm not sure how/if she show she appreciates it. 

It's curious that you're helping her with car payments and other expenses when you make $20,000 a year, and that she's so adamant about not moving to the UK. Has she visited you there? Idk, man. I'm a woman and I would never treat anyone this way, let alone my fiancé.I've read NFs are more likely to be left wing/SJW, which is probably true as a general trend. Maybe throw in SFPs, too. 

SJs are probably more likely to be fully intrenched in either of the two main parties in the US, perhaps with SFJs more likely leaning Republican. 

I'd imagine STPs and NTs being apolitical and/or jaded by the system. They may decide to identify as Libertarian or support Pres. Trump in response to what they see as two sides of the same coin represented by the Democrats and Republicans. 

These are my opinions of general trends among the types, based on my observations of politicians, activists, and the people around me. There will obviously be exceptions to these trends-I am INFP and I strongly dislike much of what is said and done by left wing people in the US.Focusing on social justice issues (reparations, gender pay gap, gender in general, the patriarchy oppressing women, gun control, etc.). I abhor the identity politics games they play (which both major parties play, but I think it is more prevalent on the left), where people are reduced to superficial characteristics like gender and race, and there is less focus on the merit of their ideas. 

As far specific people. AOC, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren. Not Hillary Clinton, as she is not left wing.I don't like people I don't know well touching me, but if someone puts their hand on my shoulder or something it's not that big of a deal. I understand that some people have a more physical communication style and most people don't have bad intentions. 

But if you're getting too close to me waiting in the checkout line, you're probably gonna get a look.AOC being considered "right" in any sense on the political spectrum is interesting. I've not heard anyone make that claim before. I get what you're saying that there are other groups like communists to the left, but I would hope communists never have any sort of real influence on the political and economic system in the US. 

I don't think the left really dislikes identity politics. More than anyone else, I've seen people at Anti-Fa/anti-Trump rallies be wrapped up in that ideology, usually resulting in the disliking of straight white males and therefore believing the opinions of those men count less than oppressed groups. Relatedly, there has been a trend of censoring conservative on social media sites, as well as manifesting in real life through taking away PayPal accounts and things like that, which I do not see many of the left condemning. 

Nothing will eliminate racism, sexism, et. al., and I don't think there should be a redistribution of wealth or massive economic policy changes to that end. Humans will always have biases and there will always be awful people who judge others on physical characteristics alone. To me, intersectionality and identity politics are strongly correlated, and I'm not sure how identity politics seeks to divide us, but intersectionality does not.~~Today~~ This year was pretty rough. This was nice to see. Thanks, man.Personality differences have always been a topic of contemplation for me, and I noticed that there seemed to be certain archetypes that many of the people I knew fit in to, at least loosely. I guess I was interested because I have felt like an outsider my whole life while seeing others around me being more successful in friendships, relationships, life in general, and I tried to mimic their behaviors with varying amounts of success. MBTI/Jungian theory put these patterns I'd seen into a system that makes sense.If the rules are not stupid, and the people enforcing them aren't doing* so arbitrarily, I don't have a problem following them.It's not painful, but there is no hope of having a civil, educated discussion between people who disagree. The main politics subreddit is just an anti-Trump hate fest, which is fine, I guess (but the name should be changed to indicate this), but I don't need other people to validate and reinforce what I think. Twitter is worse than reddit in this respect. I've seen way more idiotic things on there.I try to find things that will make the other person happy and feel appreciated and/or loved, but I have a hard time making a decision because I am afraid they won't like the gift and then they'll hate me forever and I end up waiting until the last minute to figure it out. Some people seem naturally great at giving gifts and I envy them.My brother is ISTJ and he does not really care about MBTI at all. He read an ISTJ profile, said it sounded right, and never read anything else about it as far as I know. He tolerates it when I talk to him about it, but I can tell he does not really care.I think it's an Ne thing. One of my favorite hobbies is getting 1/2-3/4 through a book and not finishing it. As far as improving on my problem, I've been more selective about what I've chosen to read and that seems to help.I think it's a little hard to break it down by letter. SPs are likely more chaotic, and SJs are likely more lawful, but they* are both sensors. If I continue by temperament, I think it might go a bit like this:

NFs-lawful good/neutral good

NTs-chaotic neutral/true neutral/lawful evil

SJs-lawful good/lawful evil

SPs-chaotic good/chaotic evil/true neutral

This is what I think the temperaments would *most likely* fall into in terms of alignments, so there would obviously be exceptions and I'm not trying to single out any temperament/type.Joke's on you, I am a Boomer.I think all INFPs experience similar feelings of frustration, isolation, not belonging, it just varies what/who those feelings are directed at. I get more frustrated with being lumped in with millennials because I don't feel a real connection with my own generation.aww, thanks :)Not having an internal monologue would not mean someone is unintelligent on its own; I think there would have to be a cluster of factors. You do not sound unintelligent based on what you wrote here, and it seems like you're able to think critically and abstractly without an internal voice guiding you. 

It's both fascinating and concerning to me that some people apparently go around not experiencing something I thought was universal. I have wondered if cell phones, Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, and other technologies have something to do with this, or if it is perhaps related to autism and other conditions, or just different thinking patterns.bioluminescenceISTPs seem to fit pretty well into the prepper stereotype, so they'd be already bugging out before most people are even concerned, by which point it's too late. 

I disagree with ENTPs being the ones to tout the "it's just the flu" line, since they are born skeptics and the media didn't decide to make everyone panic until the last week and a half or so. I think ENTPs have been refining their theories on where the virus came from and what the endgame is for months. Similar thing with ENFPs with paranoid tendencies. 

ESFPs as a whole do not seem like they would thrive in a pandemic situation. 

As an INFP, I've never felt the urge to run away into the wilderness as strongly as I do now.Quiet side character who interacts more with animals than the other main characters, but supports her friends during the climax of the film.It is hard to resist Sawyer or any other ESTP giving bedroom eyes.Hi!Yeah, people don't hear me very well sometimes. It's also physically very difficult for me to yell.This is what I've thought of him as. I think Ghislaine could be ENFJ.Getting ignored in real life is even better!This is why I get so annoyed when INFPs are, often rightly, stereotyped as being into the social justice lifestyle. I acknowledge that the tendency is there, but I do not agree with many of those ideas, and it irks me that I might get lumped into that group in some people's minds by default.Cuts a little too deep for some, I suppose. 

I think it's twisted and funny.I am sorry you're experiencing this. I went through a similar things when I was a child/teenager, and I know how painful it was for me. Don't convince yourself that no one likes you, because that cannot be true and is not helpful. 

As I've gotten older, I've accepted that I don't necessarily fit in with that many people, to the degree that we are friends, but my social skills have gotten better after working with the public for years, so practicing interacting with people, paying special attention to how others might perceive your actions (like being on your phone in the corner), could be helpful. But I also have realized that being around people who are dismissive of me, do not listen, etc., makes me feel more alone than if I were actually by myself.Real: INTJ, Fake: INFP...

I am pretty sure I am INFP so idk what to do with this, but I should not have taken this when I already feel like I've gone off the rails.Poor ISFJ :(There was a period when I thought I could be INFJ (don't we all go through that?), but then I read more about how the different types act when they're under stress and INFPs and their "Te outbursts" resonated with me to an extreme degree. It's happened to me on a few occasions when what's happening around me goes so far against what I believe in, or is so blatantly absurd/untrue, that I go on mini-rants that make me seem like a pint-size ESTJ. It's so unusual for me that people around me are taken aback by what I've said since I'm usually so quiet and amicable.I am pretty sure this would just stress me out more. But then again, "clear your mind"/meditation type stuff has always seemed like it would be stressful.Where do these types come from? Ron is ESFP and Dumbledore is INFJ-those two stick out for me. I am not sure what type Pettigrew would be, but he does not seem like an ISTP. 

Harry is ISFP, like many protagonists in Hero's Journey type stories.Joe Biden is likely an Fe-dom, probably ESFJ. He sets off my Fe politician pandering alarm bells so bad. I can't say for sure about Bernie Sanders, but I don't think he's a high Ne-user. Seems like an Ni-dom if anything. 

Trump is just such a clear ESTP that it's hard to get that wrong.Very much how I've acted in those kinds of situations, and then I feel bad for being so mean to people.Thank you for saying this. I was going to say that people often think ENFPs are flirting, but they are not, it's just how they are.I just want to be sure it's the right man and only do it one time.Happy Thanksgiving!This is an interesting observation, and I think you may be onto something. Si/Ne users seem more likely to judge new experiences based on past ones or based on existing norms/structures. High Si is more likely to rely on structure and tradition, while high Ne is more likely to seek out new experiences and can perceive "normal" things as boring. I don't think many ENFPs would be caught dead with a "Live, Laugh, Love" home decor item, but ISFJs and ESFPs would be more likely to appreciate such things.I'm just sitting here trying to figure out why the intuitive is a dinosaur and the sensor is a dog.Easy there, Mr. Gates.I know way too many NFPs that run around talking about socialism, and sometimes communism, for this to be accurate. ESFJ would be about the least likely type to be in favor of communism imo.I don't like my birthday because I don't like all the attention. When I was a kid it was fun because I got to have parties at Discovery Zone and stuff, but the fun wore off by the time I was 14 or so. My dad doesn't care about his birthday really either, and I think he's also INFP. 

This past year did nothing to help this, seeing as that the only thing I would look forward to is dinner with my family, and everything was closed and at this point I just don't want to deal with the mask charade any more than I have to.I think the hatred for small talk that people like to complain about on the Internet is a function of immaturity and/or social anxiety. It's easy to dismiss others as normies and boring people because they tend to talk about things that are going on in their own lives, TV shows, or whatever else because you don't fit in. And I am calling myself out, too. When I was a teenager and in my early 20s, I used to think this way, but a lot of life has happened since then, and I have gotten much better at connecting with other people. 

Small talk is a way to gauge whether a person is a good listener and if they even will care if you want to talk about other things with them. I've learned that if someone doesn't even want to listen to me when I ask how their day is, and doesn't ask me the same, it's not likely that we will have a meaningful relationship. This doesn't mean that I hate them.I just don't watch those videos because I know how it would go. Yesterday on Instagram I saw a video about someone who was stationed in the Middle East and there was a stray dog that would wait for them every day and loved the person so much. The person found a way to bring the dog to the US and then showed clips of the dog at home. I about lost it. They are so happy!Not recommending this to anyone: I rarely studied for tests that weren't math or science, and then I would just do a bunch of practice problems/rewrite my notes and reread stuff. Like OP, I remember what the teachers would say in lectures and that was a big part of how I learned. I did this in college, too, and my GPA was still really good. Again, I would strongly suggest developing better studying skills at least as a fallback plan. 

Hearing my classmates talk about how they studied for hours stressed me out.I agree. I also respect that she's never caved to pressure to apologize like so many public figures do when they say something that offends people.There are genocidal dictators and terrorists who were INFJ, but I guess having different opinions on Twitter is worse.I feel like I see a lot of INFPs who get along easily with ESFPs. Am I the only one who struggles with them?So tired of anti-social behavior being condoned and laughed off as "introversion". 

Also beyond tired of vaccine propaganda EVERYWHERE.How are you Si if you're an ISFP?You're getting downvoted for saying accurate things, which is silly. In general, women are more nurturing, and there is a biological basis for this. Female apes are more nurturing than males, and the same pattern holds true for nearly all mammalian species. Males are more often in charge of providing food, shelter, and protection. Evolution would suggest that this trend would hold true for humans as well.

*if anyone downvoting this comment could tell me why, I would love to talk about it.Thank you. I am not sure why saying there are biological differences between men and women, and these are often seen in behavioral differences is proving to be a controversial idea. I am not saying all men or all women are this way, just that there are general tendencies .I did not say anything about emotion, although I do agree women are more emotionally expressive. The SFJ types are known to be nurturing, so it makes sense that many women would be these types from an evolutionary perspective because women, traditionally, are primarily in charge of raising children, taking care of the sick, maintaining the household, etc. The career choices women make also back this up. Women occupy many of the positions in the care-giving professions, like nursing, teaching (especially young children), and social work.This is what I've always assumed. But I don't think it's helpful to call anyone a sheep or a weirdo in this context. 

MBTI by nature is abstract, and can be unclear in defining terms, which leads to different people having different explanations of the same things. In general, Intuitives are more comfortable dealing with things like this, but not always. Intuitives in general are more drawn to psychology, especially the NFs.INFJ, checks out. 

I feel I should be concerned with how close my responses matched with Che Guevara.This is very true, especially the manipulation part, because that can be either conscious or unconscious on our part, but the result is the same. 

Realizing how much my self-destructive behaviors were affecting other people was the most important factor in me getting it together and changing my behaviors at least twice in my life.INFP female, 30. This is an interesting question! Thank you for asking it!

I have definitely gone through phases with my style. I used to wear a lot of cute dresses, mostly a-line dreses from Modcloth before they became too expensive and too kitchy for me. Now I wear more of what I feel looks good on me, and if it's on trend, that's cool too. I mostly wear Levi's high rise skinny jeans with whatever top, and Bobs/Toms*/adidas/boots depending on the season. (Fi/Si, imo).

 I like black, but don't wear much of it because my cat's hair gets all over it. I've done research into color seasons, as well as Kibbe body types, and those have both influenced how I dress because they explain why certain styles and colors don't look the best on me, and how I can flatter what I have to work with. My closet has a lot of neutrals, mixed with jewel tones, some patterns like camo, flowers, and stars, and loose, boxy tops, boyish cuts, nothing too frilly or lacy. If you know about Kibbe, I'm likely a Flamboyant Gamine, and look like a girl playing dress up with her mother's clothes in styles that are super feminine like that. I like to look good, but I also don't want to stand out too much, if that makes sense.On Twitter, and online in general, there seem to be opposing forces of xNFPs and xSTJs arguing with each other, with the NFPs wanting change in the status quo, and calling people who disagree with them disparaging names, and with the STJs mostly adhering to traditional viewpoints, and calling people who disagree with them disparaging names. 

A lot of SJW vs. politician conflicts, which have similar manifestations in real life, too.
INFP. I wish I could be an INFJ; I admire their organization and self discipline. I consider my lack thereof to be my greatest weakness.Doesn't seem like a good idea to have a thread about shit talking other personality types haha
Yes I am down and I have other people who might be down as well in my group. We are all English speaking Americans though. God you sound like an immature fucking clown, I bet you're going to look back on you're post history in shame someday when you grow out of this retarded "I'm so random" attitude of yours.  Oh fuck off with that. The way you percieve the world doesnt effect how good you are at doing certain things, it only effects your preferences. 
INFP here. It depends on the topic they cannot stop talking about. I have no problem being the listening ear,  I prefer that honestly. If the talker allows me to ask good questions, there's no problem for me usually. If I'm not feeling the person or their subject,  like if it seems they are just rambling to ramble and not actually there to converse with me I will either slowly slip away or slowly pull out my phone and that ends it eventually.Nicely said. This is me exactly.INFP here. Just took a test and my results are:

Visual: 100%

Auditory: 68.75%

Kinesthetic: 62.5%INFP married to an INTP. We get along really well. Both very easy going and lax on a lot of things. I feel like I don't always express my constant emotions enough, which of course is irritating to him. But as we both grow older we have learned to  communicate our differences better which makes things a lot easier. 

I tend to fantasize of him being a bit more romantic, but I have to remind myself that over drawn romantic gestures just isn't him and he shows me he loves me in little practical ways. 

I appreciate his type. He helps me to get out of my head a lot of the time, which I need. And I feel like I help bring out some emotions and feelings in him sometimes. Honestly we are a great match. We just have to make sure we actually speak our minds and communicate them so we (mostly me) doesn't start to resent each other or make up problems in our minds.
I think being ENFJ would create interesting life choices. 

Second choice would be Godzilla ,   I could break stuff and just not care. Fire breath and laser eyes. 
INFJ. I did not know it was the easiest to get, but you've got it. I'm not the expert you're looking for, but kudos for stepping out of your comfort zone. Here's hoping mbti is helpful on your search. Keep in mind type and functions are mainly a set of terms anyone can use to comprehend personality/self-expression. In the INFP subreddit, for example, we marvel at our similarities but we also recognize there are infinite types of people. I've seen MBTI broken down into 64, 128 or more subtypes. The experts also disagree on shadow functions, whether you can have and use 4 functions or 8 (which I believe in) and whether type can change over a lifetime or a traumatic event (doubtful). 

Lastly, identifying your type (INTJ) and others' is not an exact science nor is it the most valuable lesson you can learn here. Dirty? Rules? I'm a pacifist but I used to be a sensitive boy at school and got into quite a few scraps at the bus stop, etc. In a street fight there are no rules, but if there were I would break them. In the words of the immortal James Brown, "I don't know karate but I know ka-razy!"Classic ESFPWhat's that? I think when you put a bunch of one type in one room they diversify. If you locked up a bunch of INFPs some of them would serve serve as all of the other types. We wouldn't all be poets but some of us would be.  The *extroverted* function is perceptive (S/N) if the type ends in P and judging (T/F) if the type ends in J. As an INF**P** my extroverted function is iNtuition and my introverted function is Feeling, and because I am an introvert my introverted function is dominant.  You got meI'm a lifelong hero worshipper and what I've found many heroes (and bluesmen) have in common is the great suffering. Perhaps this suffering provides a needed perspective. Perhaps nihilism is the phantom suffering of a person who doesn't have to fight for survival. Possibly your malaise is the opposite of PTSD.  INFP and I avoid attack videos as well as their comments. &gt; I always live in the present moment, I love to get involved in what's currently happening.

This is Se so ESFP would fit. Frankenstein's monster is my go-to answer for this question. He means well.INFP and I would say it enhances them. Enhances all of them. INFP. You'll have to be blunt. A character who doesn't fit an MBTI model is realistic, just as there are folks who hang around here for years who can't be sure of their types. As an INFP I can certainly use Ni and Fe even if they aren't in my primary function stack. Having that sort of balance is the goal of healthy maturity, not an anomaly. 

It's not as though every individual of a type is identical, in fact quite the opposite. In this world of individuals it is helpful to lump everybody into 16 types so we can understand people better and communicate about the psyche, but in reality we should properly recognize everybody as being unique. Good old FiNeSiTeI don't his temperament is going to change lol. At 18 he's still discovering his type but it has certainly been established. We'll need a bit more to go on. You can describe what you've learned so far, or post some results, or post one of the essay tests (I forgot their name) that float around this subreddit from time to time, or just describe yourself with a little more detail (how you describe yourself, the style, is more important than the substance). I won't claim online topology is perfect (and I'm not very good at it) but by the time a post is a day old I find people around here can usually come to a consensus. The order of your functions really won't change over time. You will strengthen different parts of your identity, and you could have setbacks, but how you fundamentally interact with the world is set as a child. Coming to terms with who you are does  take a little more time. 

Of course we're more complicated than a 16-point test but it's a good starting place and MBTI gives us a common language that we can use to discuss our differences. Those tests can certainly be tricky. I almost invariably come up roughly 51% Perceptive (49% Judging) for example. It starts to make more sense when you start looking at the individual functions. 

Just on what you've shown in this post I'm confident that you're introverted, feeling and perceptive. It's not easy for you to talk about yourself, especially in concrete terms,  and you show a preference for emotions. You are highly self-aware/self-conscious (Fi) and perceptive which could certainly make the yes/no questions difficult. 

&gt;1\) I am a live and let live kind of person I am certain about that, *(IxFP)*
&gt;
&gt;2\)Have mood swings,
&gt;
&gt;3\)Hopeful but inconsistent....................Do you want me to go on? *(xxFP)*

I think you've got good reason to suspect INFP or ISFP. Although you're tagged as ISFP, I don't see any hard evidence one way or the other in this post. Are there any other types you're considering? 

To narrow it down between those two we should focus on Ne vs. Se, which can be easily contrasted:

- Extroverted Intuition (Ne) expresses as a tendency to see "all of the possibilities." I brainstorm, a lot, and I tend to see every possible outcome as equally valid. We "live" in the future and have a hard time focusing on the details. 

- Extroverted Sensors (Se) live in the moment and have a strong awareness of their surroundings. They prefer to just take life as it comes and get bored by planning and theorizing. They learn from hard facts and practical application. 

I admit I had to brush up on Se since it's not one of my higher functions, and it seems to line up with your statements. I can tell you my ISFP wife and ISFP best friend have definite mood swings. In my experience they have more colorful emotions compared to the more subdued INFP (my mood is more stable on a typical day). 

I could go on but does any of this help? Definitely read up on the functions if you haven't already. I've found MBTI to be a fairly simple and useful theory even though we're all so unique as individuals. We humans are actually more alike than different but it's fun to explore these differences. No pro, just a lurker but thanks! Let me know if you have any other questions. A person who challenges cherished beliefs and institutions. &gt;The Ne will not be bothered by this, repeatedly implying that the passed topics are finished and require no more discussions.

On the contrary, all of the topics are one. All of the ideas are connected. I gather that introverted functions are harder to identify. That said I have no problem identifying my Fi.Fe is still high in my stack, apparently because Fi is my primary function. Do you experience Ni?Is this an Si trait?

Relating concepts by first telling where you heard them or read them, for example, "My father told me this joke..." See title for other examples.I still think there's time to rename "Cancer".ENTJ is in two placesWe agree on principals even though we think differently. We come from two different directions but keep arriving at a common point. I think it's obvious that I exhibit Fe even though Fi is my dominant function. I am much more aware of Fe than say my third function Si (which is completely alien to my understanding). Maybe INFPs who are more introverted don't use Fe the same. I am clearly dominant introvert but close to 50% extroverted and also borderline P/J. MBTI doesn't really have a way to explain these nuances. If we are all unique then MBTI is just a framework for communicating ideas. We have the same respect for values (F). Fe does it because it's "what's right" by societal norms. Fi does it for personal reasons and to hell with society. Stereotypically that's the INFP. INFP(m) + INFJ(f) I proposed to her on our first date and we've been practically attached at the hip for 20 years.EditedIf you could (had to) be God for a day, what is the first change you would make?I'm not familiar with this site but yes, it seems odd to have such high Si and Te, and your Intuition seems off as shown by the image. Your balance doesn't quite fit any single type so some more digging is in order. Possible fits may be INFP (but Sensing looks very high) or ISTJ (with strong Feeling).

- INFPMaking a schedule and stick to it. Stop procrastinating. Speak up. Not being disappointed when things don't work out. Not think of the worst possible outcome by default. Eat healthier.First time hearing of this, and correct me if I'm wrong but HSP sounds  like something someone would label himself for attention or as an excuse "I'm so sorry, it's just that I am SOOOO HSP"; "Being an HSP is the best/worst/both"

I can see if you're emotional or sensitive; I get sad as well, but that doesn't mean that I have to label myself for it... I don't know; we kinda fall to this with MBTI but... don't entitle yourself to something just because you think that makes you a special snowflake. Oh OK, I see it now ...

That's very interesting. And re-reading my comment that part where I said "I get sad as well".... sorry about that, that didn't come out as I would have wanted to.

What I tried to say is that we all have feelings and we react to them in certain ways; being so alert to your surroundings and react in a way that others wouldn't, in my opinion, is perfectly acceptable; even in those moments we break down.

Now, if being a HSP gives you a better understanding of yourself and how you approach things then what I said doesn't apply to you; I had in my mind that it was an "OCD" type of situation; there are people who genuinely have it and they struggle because of it and some that they like the idea of being special and proudly announce they are (even if they're not).That sounds harsh... what an emotional rollercoaster; I hope you have friends who both comfort you and listen to your observation with a wide-eyed interest. Having that level of emotional sincerity is amazing; having a friend like that would really be priceless.Please do! 

I hope you also type characters from recent tv shows and movies for that view count ;)INFP

- People who are close-minded.

- People who act condescendingly. 

- People who lack empathy.

- People who base their self-esteem in social status and like to treat like crap at people "below" them.

- People who are dishonest, even with themselves. 

- People who look at other people as "investments" towards the goal of personal satisfaction (I still remember a "motivational speech" at my school that was about being succesful in life; if I could resume that speech it would be "Be a greedy douche")

- People who complain too much on Facebook yet fail to see the wonderful people they have around them.

- People who would never move a finger for the people they love.That's the reason I still haven't played Undertale.

ESFJ (my best friend), ISFJ, ENFP, INFP and ENFJAs an INFP crushing on an ENFJ this came out of the blue. That's so awesome hahahah

My mom is also an ESFJ, as is my best friend. ESFJs, thanks for calling out on us during our "woe is me" situations and put us back in our place, the fact that you're always there for us even when we're on our worst is greatly appreciated &lt;3ESFJ mom is best momyay...1. INFP
2. Yes. There are obviously people that are best in some areas than others, but we have all have a different set of strengths, weaknesses, hobbies and life experiences to call our own.
3. I mostly feel inferior to others but that's more because of my shaky self-esteem.
4. They're definitely not, not only because of their different virtues but also how mentally healthy/unhealthy they can be.
5. No; we're ill-fated for simple day-to-day interactions, but at least for me I enjoy myself in taking good care of my close circle and as long as I do something good to someone, then that day is not wasted at all. As long as you're at peace with yourself, you shouldn't envy others' types.They were like animals, and I typed them like animals!INFP programmer here; I love it!

It's very bumpy at first and even today it's all trial and error, but the feeling when you get code that's more and morr complicated compiled is great!

Programming has a side of creative writing, which may be why I'm drawn to it. The hardest part is sticking to deadlines though; but that can apply to pretty much any job. Good luck out there aspiring programmers!Oh I don't know... Can't decideHow do you behave towards stressful situations? I want to see how much different it is between types.As an INFP this is my experience with girls I've dated. (although it still varies from person to person)

INFP: Great sense of belonging, but mood swings and lack of motivation from any end can kill it though. Pretty good chemistry for being close friends but not much else.

ENFJ: She'll talk to you for hours about hobbies and opinions, struggles with heart-to-hearts.

ESFJ: If she is fine with you having no solid grasp on your plans (having to improvise) and there is mutual understanding in one's way of processing things, it can go from a really close friendship to an actual match.

I'd love to hear feedback on this.Useless fun fact: My step-aunt is the extra dancing behind Extroverted friend.INFPs + quotes/references out of context

Name a better duo, I'll wait"People-pleasers ESFJ, am I right?"INFP: "Daydreaming won't solve your problems"Fieona!
That's absolutely true. Personality types don't serve as identities. Everyone is unique in their own stupid way. But the fact that personalities are categorized in the first place implies that there are general ways that people can act. And sometimes it's fun to take what makes one type differ from the others and turn it up to 11.

I agree that there aren't any "dead giveaways", though. None that would be specific enough to really matter, that is. I guess if anything it's relatively easy to tell if someone is more extroverted or introverted.The INFP silently pondering what makes a squirrel a squirrel and hoping the squirrel finds enough nuts before winter.i got 17 of themI like the idea of learning more than learning itself.I wish I could. I really do, but the truth is I still have yet to figure out how this works.

I'm a very "feelsy" person. I could listen to people ramble on and on about a topic that they're passionate about teaching for hours. Just kinda... absorbing. And I guess I get so distracted by the thought of "absorbing" knowledge that I forget to actually absorb the knowledge.

If you want something similar check out Balloonshop on Youtube.Well why not?
INFP? Same story xDSensors out there living their lives.
Same here :/
my loose guesses: 

Mytoecold: INFP, possibly ENFP

iDubbz: INTP

Maxmoefoe: ENTP

Ethan Klein: ENTP

Filthy Frank (as a character): ENTP

Joji Miller: I think he's fairly more complicated to type than the average YouTuber, but I agree so far with the INXX guesses I've read. 

Penguinz0: IXTX (I know a lot of people type him as ISTJ, but I'm not sure.)

YourMovieSucks: INTX 

Shane Dawson: XSXP

Jenna Marbles: EXFP

TheNeedleDrop: ENFJ (tested as one, at least.)

Danisnotfire: INFJ (tested as one.) the best. Interesting topic. In the context of summer vacation, I usually begin listening once I'm officially "up" for the day, or am relaxing in bed (which I do less these days).  I listen throughout the day to both new stuff and stuff I already love, while I do whatever I'm doing that day (writing, reading, drawing etc.) Mostly a pretty even mix of various rock genres (alt rock, post-rock, punk, experimental, orchestral, folk, indie) and classical/instrumental, including film and game soundtracks! 


For me, what makes a favorite is various things - I personally really like complexity in lyrics and instrumentals, concept albums, both technical and artistic/creative skill, and atmospheric stuff. As for being adventurous, I'm always open to new music. Recently, I've been getting into modern folk, such as Joanna Newsom. I really enjoy the story-telling behind it, and her philosophical lyrics about the cosmos and existence, all that stuff.  


And if you want recommendations, in general: http://www.scaruffi.com/music/   I've discovered a lot of great stuff with Pietro Scaruffi's website! As for type - not 100% sure - but INFP. Not before today; nice! INFP; my favorite genres for TV shows and movies are the same literary &amp; art genres/themes etc. I enjoy: horror, sci-fi, psychological thrillers, philosophical, abstract, experimental, dark and high fantasy, suspense, adventure, surreal, mystery, absurd, speculative, and animated Japanese films (mostly from the 90s, such as Perfect Blue). There's so much interesting stuff out there, and I couldn't even begin to list my favorite movies here lol. 

In terms of other TV shows, for comedy I like It's Always Sunny, Parks and Rec., Portlandia, That 70's Show, The Eric Andre Show. Correct!I've wondered before if there's some kind of correlation, but I don't think it'd be very simple to pin down any solid patterns or cause-and-effect type thing. 

Mother: "unhealthy" ESFP

Father: ISTP

Brother: IxFP 

Me: INFP

Dad's father: ISFx

Dad's mother: ExFJ

Dad's brother: INTJ 

My mother and I get along better these days now that I'm no longer in the same house as her, but before, it was insane. We don't have anything in common at all, either. My parents have been divorced for a long time, and still very much dislike each other. I get along fine with my dad most of the time, and we have some things in common despite seeing a lot of things differently. I'm pretty close with my brother, as we have some interests in common. I generally do not get along with my grandmother, but it's usually good with my grandfather. My uncle and I have interesting conversation, and he's generally nice to hang out with. My cousins are too young to have their types determined. 


If anyone ever decides to do full studies on that subject I'd be interested to see the results. 
Thanks for the response!

I had always thought xNFJs were not too assertive and more people pleasers due to their Fe...

Either way it looks like you've clarified Fi-Te, so INFP does also seem like a good fit. As for the Se, this doesn't necessarily stop me from playing with other people on the courts and having a good time, it's just kind of a source of anxiety for me.

Regardless, would you say Ne-Si over Se-Ni for me?First off, thanks for the response, I appreciate it! So far I've gotten 4 responses from people on reddit; ISFP, INFJ, ENFJ, and INFP.

The main reason I believe that I am an INFJ right now is primarily because of this description: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/31-INFp-description-Filatova

I pretty much relate with everything being said, and socionics INFp goes Ni-Fe-Si-Te, so I'm pretty sure that would translate to INFJ.

I'll answer your "shallow" questions though lol

-It would offend me more if someone called me Fake. I try to be kind and genuine towards people, and calling me fake would just kind of be like a slap in the face. If someone called me selfish, I probably would not care as much. I can be a little selfish at times, but everyone is, and I am also pretty generous...idk selfish would just not offend me as much.

-Some values would be Kindness, Being helpful, Keeping peace, and Generosity. I think these are all essential to just making more good than evil in the world.

-This is kind of a difficult question for me to answer, but I'm not really sure why. I try to do what is expected of me, and probably do it a lot in terms of dropping everything to care for other people and put others needs before my own. But I'm not exactly sure if I do it because I believe it is what's expected of me or if it's just a part of myself..

-I would say I have an opinion on everythingHaha thanks for the input. It's just weird because if I relate with Ni-Fe and Si-Te, it makes me like half INFJ and half INFP...

Socionics is really complicated though, but just in general does that description and my answers seem more NFJ or NFP to you?infpIt seems like you're intoverted and use Se, from your answers...can't tell if you use Ti or Fi though so I would say either ISFP or ISTP :)Thanks so much for the in-depth response!haha i get what you're saying. I just wanted to see some personality traits that resonate which each one. for some reason I can't decide whether I relate more with the ISFP description or the INFJ description You sound like an ENFP to me :)Yeah, I'm not an expert by any means but you seem like a Feeler-dom type. Not sure if you use Fe or Fi, but you sound like you could be an NF to me. 

Maybe ENFJ could be your type, but I'm just getting an ENFP vibe from you.

ESFP or INFP could be possibilities, also.haha i feel that.

Do you mean the Alpha, Beta, etc. Quadras? I checked those out and I can relate to Gamma and Beta a lot, lol. I think that leaves  NFJs, NFPs, SFJs, and STJsyeah, you're not the first one to be confused by Fe/Fi lol.

To simplify it, 

Fe- concerned about other's feelings, universal values

Fi- concernd about own feelings, personal values

ENFPs have secondary Fi, while ENFJs have primary Fe.

I would decide whether you think you use Ne, Fe, or Fi prinarily and go from there. Fi would point to IxFP by the waygot you 👌🏽this gave me some weird results lol.

I tallied it up and my top ones were

1. ISTj (ISTP) 9
2. ENFj (ENFJ) 7
3. INTj (INTP) 6
4. ESFp (ESFP) 6
5. ENTp (ENTP) 6
6. ENFp (ENFP) 5

Well...i never get thinker results on tests...could I actually be a thinker? I don't really know what to think of this lol. 

ENFJ and ENFP are the only ones I rarely get on tests (tests usually type me as INFP)haha that would probably be more helpful rather than fitting into one lol.

that being said i think I do fit into more NFJ traits...i'll have to look into mbti a little more.

typing myself proved harder than i thought in the past year and a half I went from 
enfp-&gt;infp-&gt;isfp-&gt;infj-&gt;enfj-&gt; ?yeah i just get confused because i always get varied perspectives on what my type is and I don't know which one to go with. One person will say they see clear Ne-Si, while another one highlights everything as Se-Ni hahacould I PM you one of my type me threads?I'm in the same position but xxFx leaning towards IxFx

Functions confuse me because I've gotten typed everywhere from ISFJ to ENFP

Or maybe I just suck at consistently describing myselfDon't know my type yet, but still wanted to write a poem. If for some reason the writing reminds of you of a type I might be, let me know lol.

We can never know what the future holds

A sentinemental flow of the blue jay's woes

A heartache that keeps you awake at night

And now that you've lost me

I'm wating for tommorow

But tommorow never startsthanks, i appreciate the feedback! and it's definitely about a specific, personal situation lol I wouldn't expect many people to relate. Thanks for the input, can you explain why you see Fi over Fe and Ne over Ni?  

if not, no worries!On another post I made, someone asked me some questions about INFJ vs INFP and I responded with some more info about myself...

Would you still say INFP for me after reading this? 

When with friends, I usually worry about if they are feeling a little down, and I will usually attempt to put them in a better mood. I will also get down on myself if I say something stupid.

I would say I think my face is more animated than it actually is. I'll usually think something is really funny in a serious situation and imagine I look amused, but in reality, my face remains stoic and emotionless. A lot of people have said I look really sad or pissed when walking with a neutral face or just listening to music, though.

I put others before myself, but I wouldn't say to the point where i feel i am being taken advantage of. If anything, I am a lot more likely to go with the flow rather than push my own agenda.

Travelliling suddenly without planning is not something I can do. I would want to know the plan first. However, small scale spontaneous stuff, I love. Like if someone calls me and asks me if I want to go see a waterfall with them, I would usually be up for that

For Fi vs Fe, I do have personal feelings about everything and am pretty sensitive. But i also strive to keep group harmony and make others happy.

For Ni vs Ne, I tend to have random hunched that come out of nowhere that tend to be right and like to have set plans for the future. But I also really enjoy making metaphors and connecting to things that aren't similar at all.

For Si vs Se, I tend to be really nostalgic about the past, i don't get overly bored with routine. But I also, really enjoy the idea of being outside and going on adventures (even though I don't necessarily do it much) and I am pretty risky and impulsive at times, and while I am unaware of my physical surroundings, I still enjoy interacting with them.

For Ti vs Te, I am not so sure the difference between the two. I know Ti tends to work efficiently rather than work hard, and that id definitely a trait of mine. And as for Te, I like planning out things but hate organizing the external world. I like doing things that make sense, but I don't have the hardworking and conservative nature at all that i see in Te types.


Hopefully, this provides a little more insight.you definitely have an istp vibeESFJ is the perfect type to feed them the attention and laughter the ENFP and ENTP need to keep that banter going, honestly.Mom- ESFJ
Dad- ESTJ
Me- INFP
Brother- ENTPMe- INFP

Mom- ESFJ, I get along with her alright, but don't agree with a lot of her motivations for her actions

Dad- ESTJ, I don't get along with him at all. I have plenty of ESTJ friends, but with my dad he is just so agressive, narrow-minded, and tries to bully everyone in the family...we just don't have the best relationship

Little Brother- He's just in 3rd grade, but I am pretty sure he is Ne-dom. He is definitely extraverted, but I think it's too early to tell if he is an ENFP or ENTP. Since I am 8 years older than him, we don't really have any deep interactions. I try to provide him advice and a caring environment if he ever needs one.this is good advice. thanksI've talked with my INTP friend on how he would parent his children. He always said he would be pretty relaxed with their actions while at the same time, teaching them the right things to do. He also said he would take more of a distant/friendly approach rather than a close/strict approachyou got ithaha it is indeed an ISFP descriptionyupyou're right :)ISFPSeems like ESFP to meHave you considered ISTJ?the stereotype that all STJs are duty-fulfillers who need to complete every task in the universe isn't really true. I know 3 ISTJs and one of them doesn't get anything done. 

Read up some non biaaed descriptions of the functions i see Si and Fi...maybe INFP? ISFJ could probably be a good fit for you also...God, I love Pixar movies. They're just so easy to watch and heartfelt...

Inside Out, Wall-E, and The Incredibles are actually my 3 favorite also.

On a side note, my favorite disney movie of all time is Lilo &amp; StitchISFP and ISFJ aren't really talked about too much.

INTP and INFJ get a lot of talk here.Lots of ENFPs apparently mistype as INFPs, sometimes I wonder myself if I might be an ENFPISFPINFP, could be INTP but i'm 80% sure you are an INFPNot really haha, i feel like you are an infp.

do the INFP personality descriptions resonate with you? INFP

Lou Reed, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobainin my opinion, you totally seem like an ISFPThe Go-GettersINFP, and ENFJs for meINFJFor the INFP PoLR, when it says INFPs do not seek any stimulating experiences, do they mean like thril-seeking stuff like rollercoasters and sky-diving?

I've always sort of romanticized the idea of sky-diving, and even though at first, I was deathly afraid of trying roller coasters, I genuinely love them now. I still get really nervous before trying something new like anyone does, but I'd usually be down to do almost anything to go with the flow.

Does this make me an INFP, still?I relate with this so much. What is the point of having any competition over someone's own viewpoints? We're all our own individuals who lived our own lives with out own experiences. 

Why do we need to judge someone else or pride ourselves just for having opinions?thanks for the input! 

I guess I go with the flow, because I don't really want to cause any trouble or disharmony. Modern Treehouse

Donald Trump is an ESTP, if it interests anyone.Maybe that guy who started Virgin airlines.There's nothing wrong with being nervous.  It shows someone you're interested.INTJ

If Ovama was an INFP, nothing would have gotten done.  Political jokes aside, INFPs write fantasy stories and engage in heavily empathetic occupations like counseling.  Obama signs off on drone strikes that kill innocent civilians.  An INFP would struggle too hard with that.  Calvin Coolridge was an INFP President and he's remembered as having gotten little done, but having a great understanding of the people.

He was also very reserved.  One time at a function a woman approached him, "Mr. Coolridge, I bet my friend I could get you to say more than two words."  To which he replied, "You lose."  Obama is more open than this in his encounters with media.  

He comes across as empathetic to the people because of his tertiary Fi, but his Te and Ni help him see and make moves.Only their 2nd and 3rd functions within the stack differ.     

INFP: Extroverted Intuition (Ne) and Introverted Sense (Si)    

Vs

ISFP: Extroverted Sense (Se) and Introverted Intuition (Ni)

Focus on the first one of each comparison: Ne for INFP and Se for ISFP; as the 2nd function in the stack, it's more likely to be developed than the third.    
Se has a high focus on the visual.  Like if you were robbed you could recreate the thiefs image by all the details you experienced in the moment: 6'2", 280lbs, white Nike shoes size 12, scar on left cheek bone, pacific north islander, blue jeans with rip at right knee, wife beater shirt that had black smudge of grease, etcetera.  Ne would use situational context to understand the event: "Okay, we're in the downtown area.  A news report showed a similar story that happened to a couple around here.  Maybe it's related and the police already have a sketch of the guy."    
The INFP is naturally comfortable communicating in metaphors and imagery.  An SP might use more immediate or visual objects to express ideas.
Also, this might sound dumb, but those with Se love candy or any other "glutinous" treats like alcohol.  They interact with external stimuli more easily.  An INFP might like a peanut butter cup because of attached childhood memories, but an ISFP eats it because it tastes amazing!There's a great YouTube video that explores the differences between Fi and Fe through analyzing an interview Andrew Garfield (INFP) and someone else (INFJ) did for some movie.

Fi is a well of emotion, values, and beliefs.  You may never see it, but it's intense if experienced.  It is fairly independent from others' opinions, whereas Fe is constantly accommodating for and cognizant of everyone else's preferences and moods.  An Fi is more likely to come across as "weird" simply from a lack of external attunement to others, but authentic for acknowledging the things not said.&gt;I would caution to say that it is all that accommodating    

Fe is foreign to me.  Thanks for sharing your experience.Your friend is using Te and Si by following logical steps and a proven, structured form of learning: gather data, decipher importance, and deliver point.  She is ESTJ.    

You are obviously using Fi, but if ignoring your flair: key words and phrases carry meaning to you, each activating a host of decisions you've made about the subject as you learned about and processed it during the research.    


*These are arguments for my opinions.  I have no idea what the truth is.How is she when it comes to emotions?  Spock from Star Trek is the stereotypical ISTJ.As an Fi dominant you nailed the struggle with Fe users.   Also, it's the fact Fi creates its own authentic beliefs from observation and experience, whereas Fe is constantly assimilating to society's dogma.  Sometimes their principles overlap, but Fi will always have reasoning whereas Fe will point to what they've been told through family, friends, articles, books, etcetera.

*Sorry if this comes off as hurtful, Fe's.  I'm still processing the differences.Aren't you supposed to get along with your opposite?  Sociological calls it the dual.  Every time I meet mine I fall into rhythm or love with them.  They generally admire me, too, since we share values.

Edit: sociological should say socionomics.Well put.  I relate to the flaw-blinding idealist perception.  An ESTJ could rob me at gun point and I'd still date her.  You mention maturity as a relationship success factor, but, granted competent levels, do you believe the dual to be most fulfilling?  I'm not against a little ego stroking.

&gt;disclaimer: i'm still hot for se-doms ok...     

Does Jim Carrey do anything for you?  Or Kate McKinnon?Can't tell if sarcasm...I haven't had sex in over seven years as of this Halloween.  ...Fuck I'm starting to cry.I thought the same, but a poll of the INFPs showed zero interest.I noticed this in a College-humor sketch.     

People think taking some online test will tell them everything they need to know, but learning the functions is most helpful to understanding people.INFP response - It's FiNe.&gt;&gt;Yeah what? I am constantly taking my values and questioning them. I do not believe everything I am told or that I read. While things I am told or that I read do cross my mind, Fe users can think for themselves, and I find myself looking at my beliefs, objectively to see if I still find them reasonable.     

This is reasonable, but the difference between Fe and Fi is that you compare your current beliefs with those around you instead of what's inside.  That's what bothers us Fi users: we're constantly pushing the boundaries of society, where as Fe is currently enforcing the status quo of morality, etiquette, etc.

&gt;&gt;I hold a very different belief system than my parents and today's society. And I am constantly evaluating which scenarios and what I would do in different situations.

Your parents do not inform your perspective as greatly as your peer group and your schooling, especially when you are young.  In fact, you're probably at odds with their ideals specifically because you've been encouraged to do so by those around you, rather than drawing on your own inner sense of judgment for guidance.  Again, this is not a judgment against you as a person.  It's the difference between Fe and Fi.

&gt;&gt;Make sure you check your source for research.. sounds like you are doing a lot of "believing what you have read" yourself.

INFPs rely on their own feelings before "sources."  It's very Fe to rely on anything outside one's self for moral judgements.  I made all of this up based on my own experiences.    

I'm sorry my post hurt your feelings, but there's really no reason to feel stupid or bad.  Fe has a great role in society: a sort of sheep wolf that keeps others in line with what has been established already.  I was merely addressing the struggle Fi has; we're essentially in constant conflict with you and trying to explore things you deem unnecessary.     

If we're going to have a trolling war, count me out.  I love INFJs (are you introverted?) and have nothing but admiration for every one I've met.  They strive to make the world a better place and constantly encourage those around them.  We're just different, which has its challenges.That bit about puzzles is induction vs deduction logic.  Ni deduces a solution from information whereas Ne induces by postulating possibilities until an explanation makes sense.Yep


Btw, cool post.  I caught myself thinking about it today.Dream career.I got INFP.  Seems accurate.The ESTJ one reminds me of Mean Girls.  Regina Wild (the queen and ESTJ) gets called out for not wearing a particular outfit (she was too fat) and isn't allowed to sit at the "cool table" that day.Spiritual / TheistCan I divert to talk about how the CW's Flash is played by an INFP when the cartoons clearly show the character as an xSFx?    

I think Hollywood just enjoys overusing NFs, which is why the rare instance of an ISTP excites audiences and cements their celebrity status: Jeremy Reinner, Jack Nicholson, Robert Dinero, Bruce Willis, etc.Yeah, that makes more sense.  But the point still stands that xSTPs in entertainment elicit greater responses simply due to their rarity.What is a personal example of your dominant Ti in everyday life?  Any trans?  Wondering if there's any correlation with MBTI.  State your type if not flaired.I think you can do art: sculpt, paint, draw, etc.  my INTJ mom is repainting some of the rooms in her house and she completely changes when talking about it.  She reminds me of a friend's ESFP mom growing up: more in the moment, spontaneous.Metaphor belongs to the realm of NF, the combination of intuition and abstraction.INFP has Fi-Si loop where it is "stuck" running through what has worked in the past and attempting to apply it to the present.  INTJ has Ni-Fi where it is running through a series of paths forward that comply with its morals.  The difference between the two is Si and Ni; one is a collection of past experiences and the other is a series of visions for the future.This dude is ESTJ.  Gut-instincts are more aligned to Si.  Being prepared with back-up plans is Ne because it is concerned with possibilities whereas Ni would be hyper focused on one outcome and sacrificing whatever is necessary to achieve it.Yes!!! Your ideal partner is an ISTP by the way.  It’s called duality in socionics.Please stop attacking me.An ISFP would jive with you personally as your dual, provide a powerful Se for in-game skill, and maintain positive team morale through Fi.Fi is my hero function and I don’t even know how to describe it.  Think abstraction, the accumulation of all your knowledge distilled into a single coherent philosophical statement you use to dictate your every belief, but that’s constantly being refined.  It’s like you’re perfecting a mathematical axiom that could one day be used to explain the answer to all problems.  This is why Fi lends itself well to spirituality since in most stories a priest, hermit, or monk gives a generic “non-answer” that eventually ends up being exactly what the hero needed to hear; it can be applied to his circumstances

I think your aloofness is actually because of your dominant extroverted perception function: Se.  You’re taking in lots of information instead of giving orders or directly interacting with people as a Te or Fe dominant would.Surprisingly no.  I’m like the only INFP without a novel.His charm comes from the tertiary Fe.INFJRobert Downey Jr defies this stereotype.

Accurate thoINTJs, maybeA) Ridiculous, surrealist visual humor.

B) Dark, offensive and politically incorrect comedy... as long as it's done right (ie: South Park).

C) Ironic social commentary in general.

INFP. Fav comedian would probably be George Carlin.The first impression people get on me is that I'm extremely cold so not really. But it depends on the person.I'm normally aloof IRL but on the internet I do tend to be on the "cute" side, usually. At least with friends and in generally nice communities.

But... I do have my inner "coldass brutal jerk" side too. It pops out when I see something I personally hate -a good example: self-righteous people who want to become Internet's moral guardians with their holier-than-thou attitude-. I've had heated debates with them, and all that "F" just disappears, as I champion in the name of logic and facts, with an admittely biting and harsh attitude that I usually hate but the frustration just makes me become like that.

Remember, INFPs have inferior Te, which can manifest itself... rather harshly. And Fi isn't exactly a "cuddlyness function" either. Being cuddly depends on the person: There are "cuddly" Thinkers as much as there are "jerkass" Feelers.ISTP 5w6 (dad) and ESFJ 2w3 (mom).

My first sister is ExTJ probably 1w2 or 3w4, second one is INFP 4w3 or 5w4, third one is probably xSFx 7w6, I'm INFP 4w5 and my brother is ENFP probably 7w8.INTP or INFJ, to be honest. Althought the closest I get is ENFP according to tests. Which might be true... albeit I'd be a ridiculously introverted ENFP.

And according to descriptions, in socionics I'm more of an IEI (MBTI INFJ) than EII (MBTI INFP) to be honest.Quoting:

Noise, crowds, interruptions, being talked to suddenly, too much attention, having to lead, feeling like I do all the work, lack of common sense, shallowness, conflict, hypocrisy, fakeness, unnecessary offense/insults and actually *lack of logic* tends to stress me out too. And losing, I hate losing and underperforming.Inferior Te.

Kinda obsessive about what I say "making sense" and "not being wrong".

&gt; I tend to not care about learning about the entirety of a system and only about the parts that are important to me.

Also this90% of r/INFP = ISFJs

Also I mistyped as INTP at first. I've also mistyped as INFJ, ISFJ, INTJ and ISTP.I think the best way to confirm your type would be looking at your tertiary and inferior.Least: Sensors
Most: Every INxx97% of them are ISFJs but shhhhhFavorite: Inside Out (An INFP? LIKING INSIDE OUT? *WHAT A SUPRISE!*). Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 2 come next.

Pixar can tug my heartstrings, and that's truly something as I don't like crying to movies. I love every one of their movies, even Cars despite Cars 2 and the rest fucking it up. This is bogusA lot of ISFJs mistype as INFPs, and to be honest the stereotypical INFP description would be more fitting for an ISFJ. Plus, Si-Fe can look like Fi. There's also a good deal of ISFPs and even some INTPs, ENFPs and ISTJs too, though.

Even a friend of mine (who, based on cognitive functions, is probably an ISFJ) mistyped first as INFJ and then as INFP. I'd love to meet more ENFPs. They seem fun.cuz *NO OPINIONS ALLOWED*. Seriously, the downvote system should just go.

I think the main difference between ISFJs and INFPs is that INFPs (and ISFPs too) can be *very* caustic, while ISFJs are more "peaceful". A lot of ISFJs relate to the descriptions of INFPs -which are partially true but INFPs don't extravert their feeling, and therefore can appear aloof unless they're with someone they're comfortable with-. That, coupled with the iNtuitive bias online is what generates confusion. Still, I think ISFJs need more love online, they're great people.

Maybe 90% is too much but you know, extrapolation. I'd say at least half of the subreddit are ISFJs, ISFPs and other Feelers -maybe even ENFPs... and btw, a lot of ENFPs on r/ENFP would be INFPs and other Feelers to-I laugh. A lot.Is Jonathan Joestar there? If not, then he's probably another ENFJ for that list.I know at least one ESTJ woman IRL. My sister is another TJ -not sure if ESTJ or ENTJ-. I hava ESTP female classmates too.I don't have any problem with the emotions. Sometimes we need a venting space, after all.Myers = INFP
Briggs = ESTJAn INFP with a cause they fight for, hands down.One word: Perceiving.

Or want two words? Extraverted IntuitionUnrelated to the topic but I love your username!Because according to MBTI stereotypes INFJs are this *mystical guru who is literally Jesus and Gandhi (or Hitler if you like evil) at the same time and is the most perfect type omg combining high intelligence with sensitivity and long range planning unlike those pesky, careless Ps or cold, assholish Ts!*

When in reality INFJs are like any other type: A lot of cool people and some awful people.Well, depends. Was the murder justified? And even if it wasn't I'd probably turn the friend anonymously.ISFJ: Wants to give you soup and kiss you goodnight and read you bedtime stories.

ESFJ: Likes gossip. A lot.

ISTJ: Enjoys paperwork.

ESTJ: Enjoys firing people.

ISFP: Hippie artist who says "duuude" all the time and smokes weed.

ESFP: Your typical Valley girl.

ISTP: Cool dude who enjoys bikes and road trips.

ESTP: A thug or bully.

INFJ: Mystical guru or literally Hitler.

ENFJ: Literally Jim Jones.

INTJ: Chess Grandmaster.

ENTJ: Corrupt executive who will betray you for power.

INFP: Depressed poet who cries a lot.

ENFP: Pinkie Pie.

INTP: Mad, lonely scientist.

ENTP: Mad scientist who is also an internet troll.Weepy SJW :'D

(big irony, I abhor SJWs)It's all a huge chess game. And we're the pawns.To be fair tho, unhealthy Fi is the most likely cause of SJWism.It's not an attack, it's the truth.

But the same can be said about Fe (and the other functions)Let's see:

Martin is an INFP, but might as well be an ISFP with well developed Ni.Emotional overreacting, oh GOD emotional overreacting... I can get irrational over silly stuff. That's a fatal flaw.The first time (we were together twice) I was the one breaking up and it was mainly because she refused to let go her past. The second time she was the one breaking up and it was because "it wasn't working" and she still has feels for her first boyfriend (despite the guy being abusive). And yet we still talk, althought I'm much more cold and reserved now. So, unhealthy Si I guess?

Also, sweet natured and nurturing. That melts me.Extroverts have more energy, I guess?

Ironically what I'd say it's the happiest person I've ever met is an ISFP. Maybe introverted intuitives are more likely to be negative?Maybe ESTP. I'd fit in within my society but... it would be so *un-me*...An insane need for comfort and pleasure. A feeling of nostalgia. And I tend to find too much change overwhelming.

Eh, any NF or IF could be.Sounds ISFP.Josuke seems ESFP or ISFP.I would play thisbetween INTP and INFP. I'm now around 98% sure about INFP. But there might be a chance that I'm actually an ISTJ.Probably handling criticism*INFP: As selfish as any ENFJ, but we're actually honest about it!*Nature, language, logicIf they have different values**Your current awareness level: 5D**

5D consciousness is when you actively avoid straying away from your core beliefs, values, tastes, loves and interests, even if it goes against what others might think or feel. 5D is the consciousness of independence of thought and action. Even if there’s some difficulty in releasing the grasp of peer pressure and the values of loved ones, family, and society, it is the 5D aspect of the self which seeks liberation from these elements.

The minutia of interpersonal interactions and relationships in the human existence can be very tightly conditioned by a large degree of expectations, emotion, and dependence, regarding others, that more often than not goes unnoticed. When widespread, it leads to a generalized loss of energy, and makes it hard for one to be truly genuine and pursue one’s true interests in life. 5D consciousness is the energy aspect of the self that makes sure one’s own inner spiritual connection is kept intact and active even in the presence of the expectations and values of others, adverse circumstances, or self doubt.

You may have also scored this level because you hold a mixture of higher consciousness perspectives, with lower 3D and 4D beliefs from unhealed karmic memories and external values imprinted by family, society, role models, and figures of authority. The resulting “average” will score 5D in the quiz. This would represent you’re standing midway between a reality designed and directed by external and “common-sense” values, to one that is directed and designed from within.

A ‘full-blown’ 5D person, so to speak, can very well appear as an oddball personality to others, spiritually-inclined or not. At some level the person stopped guiding its behavior through other’s opinions, feelings, or the morals of that’s right or wrong. This doesn’t mean the person doesn’t care, or is not affected, by what others think or feel. It’s just that he/she has realized going out of one’s own way to please others or to be in conformity with the collective, is a profound act of a self-unloving nature, an unjust and unloving disservice to Self. In 5D there is an underlying attitude of rebellion of some kind, be it with loud screams of revolt, the desire to break free from constraints and limitations, or with silent, assured certainty and assertiveness.

A common trait of an active 5D consciousness is feeling aggravated by what is felt as mellow, shallow, deceiving, or otherwise superficial and meaningless behavior from 3D and 4D consciousness, otherwise know as “bullshit”. As one awakens, the tolerance for meaningless things diminishes. As the 5D being finds itself often in the need of having to confront others’ expectations in order to remain true to itself, there’s also a propensity for a degree of impulsiveness, rashness, and even anger, in this being’s inner self and to this acting. He/she may decide to go away into some form of seclusion or isolation, as a defensive measure. The 5D being simply can’t get along 3D and 4D beings without loss of energy, and it will dread the prospect of becoming more mellow, in fear of being controlled by others.

Many people in the 5D spectrum of consciousness realize in one form or another that the socio-economic systems are not based in integrity and do not serve the best interests of the individuals. Many take activist roles and more aggressive resistance towards the usual state of affairs and the powers that be, for example affiliating with animal and nature rights groups, truth movements, hacker behavior, or “conspiracy theories”. However, there’s also a large degree of frustration in these messages, which works against them rather than for them. The lesson for the 5D consciousness is, ultimately, that there’s a limit to what fighting the negative can achieve. Beyond a certain threshold, continuing doing only fuels the negativity and keeps it in place. It’s the lesson for the 5D being to acknowledge that the negativity, anger, and loss of energy when facing others, is draw to him for his own negativity that is kept inside.

The challenge for a 5D being is not to ‘mellow’ its rebellions energy, in the sense of dropping back to 4D mellowness, but to acknowledge and come to terms with his own anger and dissonance. The primary focus of attention and change now makes a turn inward, now striving to generate a true change within rather than outside. At this point, there will be no need or desire to indulge in anger directed outwards, as it’s recognized as a temporary imbalance to be faced, primarily, within.
This.
No help with the typing, but I am an INFP (completely, based on MBTI tests and a proper cognitive functions reading), and Every Single "cognitive function test" online always skews Fe and Ni. Most of these tests put me as an ENFJ (which I am certainly Not), or even a socionics INFP (which drives socionics people mad).In high school, I tested as ENFP (but barely on the E side of things.)  as an adult, I'm pretty firmly INFP (and probably was in high school as well.)

There are children that exhibit extroversion vs introversion traits, and any parent of multiple kids can tell you that personalities are different, and often from infancy.  The full MBTI stack probably isn't set until high school or so, because it requires looking at abstract thought.Mom and sister: ISTJ
Dad: ISFP
Me: INFP
(my husband is an INTJ, and I'm kinda hoping our future kids are introverts :)Anecdote: I was typing some co-workers in a volunteer organization.  Most were N types, with a few S types.  When I told the S types that friend groups tend to have the same N/S designation, he had many of his friends take the test, and all but 1 were S types.  (all of my friends are N types with a few exceptions.)  So, it may be peer groups.But if you are "typing" them based on public interactions, you kinda are.  

Semi-related, but young girls who are autistic are often misdiagnosed, because they were socialized early on to "fit in."  They very clearly are autistic, but it isn't necessarily noticeable.So the question is:  is this from observation?  From discussions with the women in question?  A delep understanding of these women including socialization?Using the pure letters, Extroverts need social time to recharge, but that's not the same as liking large crowds of random people.  Conversely, introverts need alone time to recharge, but can sometimes enjoy large crowds of people.It can happen.  When I tested in high school I was on the extrovert side (by a little).  I'm now very much firmly an introvert.  I'm also of the "your type can change slightly over time" camp, and not the set in stone.Tests are just guidelines.  I am firmly an INFP by binary letter tests, but all cognitive function tests type me as ENFJ, and socionics tests type me as also an INFP (which according to them shouldn't be possible.)

my partner is an INFP, but on the T/F axis.  when we really looked at how he processed his emotions and feelings, we realized that he was exceptionally good at Fe, which we originally mistook as Fi.

For you, is your first reaction to things an emotional response, or do you attempt to rationalize it?  In a group situation, are you more of a lecturer or a peacemaker?  In relationships, is talking about your emotions easy, or do you read your partners emotions and attempt to rationalize your response to them?1) if you don't have time to read in depth about function stacks, perhaps you should not make sweeping generalizations as in your post.

2) the "dichotomies" model is fairly inclusive in its own right, aka, extrovert vs introvert, thinking vs feeling, etc.  having an argument over which form of T and F one has is secondary to which comes more naturally to someone (aka, are you more emotional or logical).

3) Jung proposes that we all use all of the functions, we are just more adept at using some more than others.  So of course we have both Ti and Fi,  but one is usually more accessible  (aka, if you need time to process Fi, it may not be a primary function in the same way it is for me (INFP, where Fi is my main way of interacting with the world.).As I stated above, all people have all functions (according to Jung).  Thus everyone has Ti and Fi, with one being more accessible than the other.  Your comment about needing to be alone to process your Fi leads me to think that Ti is probably a bit more accessible, as compared to my primary function of Fi that is easily and readily accessible.INFP, and team blue (because of ingress.)This isn't an official MBTI assesment, it's a manager attempting to type his minions without any of the MBTI training.  If it's an "all in fun" thing, that's fine, but I would hesitate if the manager seemed likely to read into stereotypes. 

(BTW, my husband is a programmer and 90% of his office are introverts, and a good majority of those are INTJ.)I can appear extroverted (my therapist was surprised when I said I was introverted.)  In certain groups I can be very animated, and spending time with people I'm close to is important, but large crowds are really bad for me.  I need time alone to recharge.I'm an INFP, and the test put me at Ne, Se, Fi, Te. 

It did get the Fi, which is usually what gets messed up by cognitive tests.
It's been said that if you change the first and last letter of a type, that type is compatible with the type you started with. For example, INFPs are compatible with ENFJs. Or at least as far as I've heard. Usually N's and S's seem to do better with their own. And dominant thinking and feeling functions don't tend to mix well, especially in romantic relationships. Yeah, it's definitley possible :) I've had experiences and relationships like that too. But it just seems like a pattern. I'm sorry you also suffer with that, it's really tough but we both will make it :) And I've been vegetarian for 4 years (since I was 12) and vegan for a little over a year. I have very little motivation to get up and do something but I help with the organizations in my area. I feel uncomfortable pamphleting and talking to people about causes but I do spread the word on social media and try and talk to my friends and family about things and stuff. I procrastinate like crazy and my Ne is very strong, no doubt about that. I score INFP on basically every mbti test I take. I'm honestly like 90% certain I'm INFP but just wanted to see what other people would think. This post was sort of impulsive lol. I do sometimes see a slight dominance of Ti over Te, however. Also, sometimes I think I could be INTP. But my Fi is just so. Strong. And it sucks. Sorry, I'm babbling. Omg i just realized I didn't answer most of those questions and kept the ones I copied and pasted from the linked post. Sorry!!! Most of those answers are not me!!! Maybe i'll edit it and re post. Interesting that you guys are discussing this. I'm in this subreddit because I'm actually doing this study for pre calculus. I just need to find a legitimate way to quantify happiness or test for depression online and for free. I was going to administer the test in the subreddit. Will post results after research is done!Hello everyone... This project for my class is due in February and over winter break I did no work at all but when it's done I'll post what I find here! It probably won't be for a while though. I'm trying to find the correlation between MBTI type and High School GPA. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/MDRKYH9 Please take this survey!!!I'm INFP and have showed a lot of friends/family the MBTI. I have yet to meet a confirmed ESTP. However I suspect ESFPs and ESTPs refuse to take the test more than other types. They seem to not have the patience. Most of my friends are ENFPs and ENFJs. 
My favourite type is Rock.   Looks like we have a bit of a problem :pIt's important to distinguish between libertarians though.  Do you mean traditional left-leaning libertarians or modern right neo-libertarians?I become both daring and gullible and daring.  If you tell me a lie, I'll believe you.  If you dare me to do something that doesn't majorly hurt somebody else, I'll do it.
I also feel like I become an extrovert, although by the end of the night I become self-conscious about having been a 'lad' while drinking...  *shudder*Is there a link between what MBTI type you are and what political/social opinions you have or taste in music/videogames/other ?
New to this whole thing.Sorry for spam questions, I'm new to the whole concept.  Basically the questions in the title.  Relates to poor mental health but also to the odd mental disorder.
Please keep thread respectful.
Hah, well, INFP for about the 20th time, although I do think that was a new test for me. I got ENTP once upon time, but I only related slightly to it, and forgot all about mbti for a few years until I got INFP. Then I got super interested. I should just stop self-doubting and fully accept that I really am INFP. No use in thinking anymore that I'm not good enough for it or something like that. By the way, I have sort of a soft spot for INTPs, it's a great type :)Nice collection; I'm going to go the projection route and say INFPI'm not sure where the stereotype comes from. Sure, we can be pretty sweet sometimes, but no one's ever viewed me as some sort of cuddly teddy bear. I would think ISFPs are a lot "lighter and fluffier" than we are. INFPs are probably darker than a lot of people expect.Why, then? Hmm, well, you are confusing, but that's what you're going for. I have seen you around (like everyone has), and I always believed your flair, although it did strike me how... INTPish you were. I just saw you as sort of the antidote to the "all INFPs are cute and cuddly" stereotype. But in any case, I'm assuming you're 5w4? That would make sense to me. And another question, why are you so interested in feeling types, then? Specifically INFP and INFJ; you tend to go to those subs a lot.Haha, that makes sense. And yeah, I checked your post history to see how far off I was. If I'm not mistaken, it was just one letter? That's not that bad.INFP, but I didn't really do any of those options. At the beginning I scrolled to the end to see how long it was, but I didn't read any parts. Then after debating whether I should read it or not, I started to, but soon lost interest and started just skimming it. Until the part where something caught his eye, that part caught my interest and I started reading again. So I skimmed until about just before halfway, maybe? And then completely read the rest of it. And appreciated the nice shitpost ending, of course. Type me.  
  
**Note:** 11% of you will read my comment, but writing this note appeals to the tl;dr people who skip to the end. And they may go back and read my comment. So this note makes the percentage 22%.The greatest similarity between INFPs and INFJs are that they are not INTPs.Lol, what is this garbage?  
https://youtu.be/94NxF2F2BuY  
Were you trying to symbolize something? If so, then who's the demo?Ha, and the Thinkers are the spies in mine, so superior in every wayYes, it means you are part of 22% of people who will do great and influential things in life. Whether you use that for good or evil is your path to choose. But great and influential are two words that would not be inaccurate to describe your deeds. But as an INFJ, I guess that was a given anyway.This is really cool. Thank you so much. I don't have much to contribute, other than that I would agree with this. I commented because I really like this, and I figured you should knowShit, dude, as an INFP (let me remind you), I think I have the majority of thisScarily accurateI'm curious. Do you believe I'm mistyped?Duuuude. I've still got a question. I'm really curious  
  
Edit: Lol, well, I'll take your silence as a kind of opinion.Well, I took it twice, once giving myself the benefit of the doubt and once more harshly. So I guess I fall within the 11-18 range. Which I suspect is kinda high for an infp, so I guess I must be exceptional :pI apparently read this just in time before this was removed. Fuck censorship, jesus christ. So what's going on here? Why was he banned on /r/infp? I'm honestly pretty surprised; that seems pretty un-infp-ish. Or maybe I'm being too idealistic about what an infp sub (and subs in general) should be. And why is he fed up with the mbti sub for that? And why did yet another person delete their accounts in the comments? As usual, I've got a lot of questions. But maybe you guys have answers. What's going on here?How about INFP?97%Well, hunter 1 seems pretty fun, although very taxing, so probably not that one. Dominion seems pretty fulfilling, but also very taxing, so probably not that one either. They all seem pretty entrapping to me, actually. You can't escape from any of them, not even Escape. And they also all sound appealing for various reasons. I just can't handle feeling trapped, though. But if I had to pick, I think I would pick Nakama, despite the fact that the 13th life is the worst out of all the choices, in my opinion. After that, probably Healer. As a third, I suppose Escape would be intensely interesting, although lonely as hell.Huh, I got the functions in this order: Fi, Ni, Fe, Ne, Si, Se, Ti, Te. And overall it typed me as INFPI've read type descriptions for ages; constantly doubted stuff like "Am I an INTP? Am I an INFJ? Am I Fe dominant? Or maybe Ni dominant? Which is interesting that those two are apparently what I got 3rd and 2nd. But I do feel like I keep coming back to thinking that Fi is my dominant function. I guess i should mention that there was a bit of a gap between my Fi percentage and my Ni percentage. Not that matters so much, as tests are rarely super precise. But I mean, I constantly do self-analysis, and although I am nowhere near to understanding myself, I do feel fairly confident that I'm an INFP, I guessHaha, of courseHerITT: people who dislike their type's sub. That seems about right, since people usually tend to find what's wrong so much easier than they find what is right, which I think is what's going on in the infp sub. People find what's wrong with their lives, and post about it for sympathy and advice. I guess we're not really a tight enough community that we feel as comfortable sharing our happinesses. That's my take on it, anyway. But then in the same principle, people tend to see the negative of the infp sub more easily than they'll see the good. Which, this may be a stereotype, haha, but it seems kind of like an infpish fi thing to do. It's interesting to me how notorious the infp sub is for this phenomenon. This is the fame we never asked for but perhaps secretly want ;) I guess just take it for what it isHmm, the thing i don't like about it is that i feel it implies a vast difference in goodness between the types. The first two seem pretty negative, with the last one seeming the best. I also think it's too general. I can't type myself as one in particular; I find parts of myself in all of them. Don't get me wrong, I do find what you were doing interesting, it's just that i think it could use some refinement. Out of curiosity, which type do you think you are?Ah shit dude. Perhaps I'm an INTJ after allINFP: Please just don'tNo, no, no, don't do that. Tbh that hurts so much worse. It's very confusing, and I really hate being confused. And you start to suspect that the other person was sabotaging the relationship, so you start to wonder if maybe it could have worked out had the other person been sincere, and on and on. It hurts a lot. In all seriousness, at least for me (and probably a lot of people, not just infps), be honest about it, and clear and direct. Blunt if you have to. As I said, I hate being confused, and the more direct it is, the more I'll understand why it's happening. The more clear it is, the more finality there is to the relationship. Which may hurt, but it's better than drawing out the agony of hope/despair and wondering if it's really over. And the more honest and open it is, the more I can learn from what happened. Which is something I value quite a lot. I want to know what went wrong this time, so I'll have less chance of feeling broken again in the future. I mean, eventually a relationship has to work, right? I know it doesn't have to, but I really hope so. And the more I know about what I can keep from fucking up on, the more chance there is of an amazing relationship happening.Hmm, what would be my fursona? And what would yours be? Maybe your name is a hint for yours, idkNah mate, deadly's got a point. I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of S types mistyped as N, but is it so much as you seem to think it is? Sometimes I get the feeling that you don't believe that *anyone* that calls themselves N here is right. I know that's a bit extreme, and I know it's not true; I'm sure you have people that you believe to be intuitives. But the impression still... gets impressed on me sometimes, if you will. And I do believe that intuitives are probably likely to be attracted to places like these more than sensors. So although in the world sensors are way more common than intuitives, i think it's a bit more normalized here. I doubt it's so rare here to find oneThis is a really cool concept to me, the only thing is that I'm an INFP and a textbook melancholic. Of course,as a general rule, a general rule will never apply to every specific person. Even so, I think a lot of INFPs will generally relate with the melancholic temperament most of all. I can't really speak for ISFPs, though, I don't know. That being said, Orpheus is one of my favorite myths, and I appreciate the association :)Not your personality type, but your individual personality. Although I'd like to know your type too if it's not in your flair.Apologies is this kind of subject is from repost heaven (or purgatory, if you will), but I've only ever heard anything about Fi-Si loops. And I also wonder what the escape/antidote is for these. Is it Ne for Fi-Si?As you may have heard from me in my title, I have a had a great deal of trouble in typing my pet rock. And it makes me feel like maybe I just don't know it well enough, which breaks my heart. So please help me.  
  
All right, first thing you need to know is my rock is very unconventional, she's not like most people, so I'm possibly looking for a rare type here, an intuitive perhaps. She doesn't conform to gender standards, not at all; she has a very firm conviction that genders are human constructs and don't apply to her. That's okay, but her unconventionality gets a little frustrating when it comes to her age. She indicates that she has no age, but I don't believe that. Nonetheless for the love of God I can never tell her age just by looking at her. She seems to quietly enjoy that, it's apparently very amusing.  
  
Now, at this point I would think Fi is somewhere in the mix. However, there are some telling signs of Fe, and we all know we can't use *both*. He's the sweetest goddamn rock you'll ever meet. He always seems to be aware of the feelings of anyone he's around, and somehow knows just the way to make everyone feel better. If you're feeling sad, he provides comfort; if you're feeling happy, excitement; if you're feeling fear, protection; if you're feeling aggressive, power. But he always checks that power before it hurts anyone; my little rock's an altruist.  
  
She loves going on walks, which can be a bit problematic, tbh. I mean, I think she might be paralyzed. Maybe just lazy, idk. I'll still indulge her, though, we go all over the place, and never the same place twice. She loves the breeze washing over her cool skin, adores the rain blowing all over her dirty curvature. The warmth of the sun is such a welcome feeling, especially since her blood is definitely not 98.6°F. She just loves sensation so much. And yet, despite the obvious Se, when I look at her... It just seems like there's so much memory stored there, so many years (I just wish I knew how many) that have gone by and stuck within her consciousness and shaped her into the rock she is today. It's truly awe-inspiring. Oh yeah, and I think she has Si.  
  
Ah, now for the type of intuitive that he inevitably must be. I think he must be Ne. It's pretty plain to see, or at least it is to me. Such an adventurous little rock. As I mentioned, he never wants to go on the same walk twice. And he's always wanting to go to amusement parks. Not that I'm complaining, although my wallet does a bit. I just tell it to shut up. It's not my wallet's special trip, you know? Anyway, my pet rock wants to go on all the rides, which the attendant invariably says that he's too short to go on the ride. But he always finds his way on, the sneaky little bastard. Wait, Ne is more about connections and patterns, isn't it... Maybe none of that has anything to do with intuition... Okay, the truth is, I don't like talking about his Ne. For some reason, it *always* takes the form of innuendo, and it makes me really uncomfortable. You know that phrase earlier about adoring the rain blowing all over his dirty curvature? That was him, he fucking begged me to put that in here. So I'm sorry about that. I prefer his Ni. You should see how many internal connections it takes to make up a rock's atomic structure. Not to mention, I have no doubt that my rock has a clearer view of reality than me. Ah, Ni... Love it. It's so beautiful when you can't understand it.  
  
Okay, this may be a disappointment, but I have to say my pet rock is 100% a feeling type. I can't see any signs of thought whatsoever. I'm afraid my rock's a bit of a dunce. Totally brainless, and even more illogical. I don't mean to be offensive, it's just the truth.  
  
Now that you know a bit about my dear pet, please try to type it, I can't seem to figure it out at all. I would think it was like an avatar and possibly the savior of humanity, if only it wasn't missing thought. Do rocks' mbtis maybe work differently? I don't know, it's up to you. Well, as long as you don't say it's one of those *sensors*, hahaha ffs. Also I already know it's a weak feeler type, so you can work from xNFx template, if you please. Please validate my pet rock, and thank you for your participation :)
Just out of curiosity...what specifically made you think "Se, Fi, Te, potentially Fe"? I'm trying to understand how to identify each of the functions and it would be extremely helpful if you explained how you sensed those, if you don't mind.Lately I've been experiencing a lot of confusion about my Myers-Briggs type. I consistently type as an Enneagram 4w3, and whenever I take the Myers-Briggs test I waver between INTP and INTJ. Yet I feel like both don't fit me fully. I've tried looking deeper into the Jungian functions but I don't think I have a solid understanding of it yet.

Most descriptions seem to indicate that INTPs/INTJs are very interested in science and mathematics, yet I despise both math and science and am solely interested in music. I write music as a form of artistic, emotional and personal expression. I'm very in tune with my personal emotions and the emotions of others, yet I am also in tune with what is logically sound and what isn't. I am a dancer, so I guess that means I'm somewhat in tune with my senses, but I very much live in my mind and am focused on the future rather than the here and now. I consider my entire life a work of art and seek to direct my life and personality according to my artist vision and sensibilities. It is very important to me that I am fully expressing myself artistically at all times, often to the point of obsession. I have a strong desire to perform and feel deprived if I don't perform every once in a while, yet I strongly identify as an introvert.

I am very concerned with my appearance and style of dress, and I refuse to go outside unless I look a certain way. I love beauty and am captivated by beautiful things and people. It is important to me that people regard me as attractive or think that I look impressive, yet at the same time I am extremely introverted, very shy and would much prefer being alone than being with people. Social interaction is very taxing for me, and I'm prone to lots of introspection and brooding. I also tend to be very temperamental and experience loneliness and sadness often.

I relate to the INTP descriptor in the sense that I am constantly generating ideas, analyzing things, and "living in my own mind", so to speak. I'm just not sure if it's as prominent in my life as it would be for a normal INTP. I often score 50% on the judging/perceiving side, and sometimes only slightly prefer intuition to sensing. Could someone help me figure out this mess? How do I decipher what personality type I possess?
INFP here! Haven't gotten into a fight since middle school and I'm glad for it. But if I had to, I'd search for a blow that would end the fight quickly without injuring my opponent too severely.Fi-Dom here and I always reflect a lot over what I send before I send it. I think a lot about how what I say could be interpreted, whether good or bad.Yeah, it sucks putting out a really coherent message only to find a mistake or typo in it later. By the way, does anyone know how to get the tag for your mbti type behind your username?Just talk to him in person, and makes sure he knows you just want something casual. Physicality with no strings attached is pretty appealing to a lot of guys, and I'm guessing it goes double for ESFPs. If it doesn't work out, you're going to college soon anyway. Plenty of fish in the sea.I enjoyed the story, but I don't think I'm comfortable enough with MBTI to type anyone yet, even if the characters are fictional. I did get a strong ENTP vibe from Mr. Perozo. And Mrs. Perozo definitely struck me as more of an Extroverted Sensor, my best guess being ESFJ. Great story, and I hope you'll post more in this subreddit.Moderate - INFPThat's two words... Cheater.The funny thing about the trigger warning is that the offended INFPs can't come out and say that they're offended lest they prove your point. Well played xDSorry, I find it hard to take anything that has the label "trigger warning" seriously. The way I see it is that people can take offense to literally anything, but that doesn't mean that slapping a trigger warning on everything is necessary. I actually tend to believe that these trigger warnings actually inhibit discussion because they allow people to shy away from views and beliefs that they don't like or agree with, but that's just me.Haha neither do I. Just joking around.He definitely seems more like a sensor to me, but the I/E is tough, because a lot of introverted comedians can project extroversion onstage. Definitely xSTP, if that narrows it down.^^ My exact thoughts on homework to this day.Dad: INTP. Get along with him fine most of the time. I like to be alone more than he does, especially when I get home from classes, but we share a similar sense of humor, have some shared interests, and we have pretty awesome discussions sometimes (especially since I just started college).

Mom: ENFP. Love my mom and we can sometimes talk and laugh for hours. I get along very well with her. The only real rifts between us are when religion comes up, and even then it doesn't come up often.

Me: INFP

Younger Sister: INFJ. Extremely smart and very introverted (like her big bro). We enjoy some of the same TV shows and movies, and since I've been picking her up from school we've gotten more chances to talk. We're by no means extremely close as we're both very introverted and keep to ourselves quite a bit, but we get along ok. She also used to serve as the mediator between myself and my youngest sister, but she's had her own problems with her more recently, and I've seen some resentment built between them as of lately. 

Youngest Sister: ESFP. Very extroverted and the only sensor in the family. With my youngest sister, we're usually either laughing our butts off together or at eachother's throats. She's a bit immature (as expected with her age), and doesn't really know when pestering someone isn't funny anymore. She's quite well behaved at school as far as I know but at home she can be quite bratty at home if she doesn't get her way. Meh, if they don't like your personality, screw em. That's their problem and not yours. I'm not saying be rude to them or treat them badly, but if that's what they're doing to you, then they're not the kind of people that deserve to be in your company. I've had a pretty long history of being bullied/teased/ignored/avoided as well, and my best advice to you is to find a solid group of friends that accepts you for who you are, quirks and all. Once I had found that group, I'm not really sure if the people causing me problems just fucked off or whether what they thought just didn't matter to me anymore. As for the socially unaware problem, maybe get someone honest who cares about you (preferably a close friend), and ask them for advice on what you can do to improve your social game. Bottom line though, you shouldn't be ashamed for being who you are.

EDIT: My bad on the close friend part. Sort of blazed through it. Learning to read social queues is sort of an trial and error process. It has a lot to do with paying attention to people's reactions to what you say and adjusting accordingly. Paying attention to facial expressions, body language, and tone of speech sometimes really helps. Some people are naturally good at this. I wasn't one of them xD I'm still wouldn't consider myself an expert today, but these are the things that helped me a bit.I believe he prefers "Mr. Stokes".This describes my INTP buddy perfectly.If I don't know them, I'd probably feel a bit bad. If they ask me for help, I probably will. If it's a recurring thing where they're responsible for constantly putting themselves in a bad spot then I'll get annoyed and cut them off. 

If they're my friend, I'll help em without them even asking. 

If I don't like them, and they ask for help, I'll probably help just to get them out of my hair. Hmmm, if we're basing this on past experience, an ENFJ was the worst person I've met. Everyone's different though, so this is a bit of a loaded question. There are very good and very bad people in every single type. I actually strive to be more apathetic or objective in daily life. Sometimes I feel so intensely that when something goes wrong and I end up shut off all my emotions and I stop caring about anything. This can happen for months at a time.

In terms of perfectionism, I have the "if I'm not great the first time I don't want to try it ever again" syndrome. But I'm pretty sure that has less to do with my INFPness (teehee) than it does my personality in general.I don't care all that much about offending people. I think that political correctness is for the most part a waste of time and often just impedes real, productive discussion. I'm not overemotional! Why would you say that??!!!!

The green thumb thing is pretty accurate in the sense that even though I don't garden, I have a strong love for animals and nature. I'd argue the overemotional and hopeless romantic, though. I usually just use emotion for comedic or dramatic effect.Internet veteran. I gotta remember that one xD
:D Haha thanks.It depends on the person. One of my closest friends is an INFP and we get along amazingly. I guess there are certain qualities I dislike that I have noticed more frequently in INFPs such as:

- Oversensitivity
- Acting as though they are morally superior 
- The "special snowflake" attitude
- Placing feelings on a higher priority than objective truth
 

Fucking genius, man. Loved it.Introverts vs Extroverts

Intuitives vs Sensors

Thinkers vs Feelers

Judgers vs Perceivers

Which team would dominate each season and why? Also, if you have an opinion as to which individual type would be best at survivor, feel free to comment that as well. Here are my personal thoughts: 
(Note: I'm no expert in MBTI, so these are just my personal thoughts about it. Also, I'm going to be generalizing the types just a little bit. I realize that not all Sensors, Perceivers, and Feelers are the same.)

Introverts vs Extroverts: Extroverts. Often the team that bonds better early on is the one that succeeds in the first few challenges and steamrolls. There is a chance that the extroverts bigger personalities may clash with eachother, but due to social skills coming more naturally to extroverted people (on average), I'd give it to them.

Intuitives vs Sensors: This is a tough one. I think that the sensors would excell more in the wild than the intuitives would. Sensors tend to be a bit more hands on and I'd expect people like the ISTP to find simple solutions for most of the problems they'd run into in the wild. They'd also probably be a bit more detail oriented than the intuitives. However, when it comes to challenges, a good deal of them are puzzles or have puzzles in them, and the puzzle is often the determining factor. And due to intuitives being more big picture oriented, I think they would pull ahead in that regard. Tough one, and I don't think either team would steamroll the other. But if I had to pick, I'd give it to the intuitives just because of the nature of Survivor's challenges.

Thinkers vs Feelers: Another tough one. At first I was inclined to say that feelers would get along better because it's easy to associate an F with emotional sensitivity. However, thinking more on it, the F and the T just refers to how people make their decisions. Thinkers on average do so more rationally and feelers do so more emotionally. Even the emotional sensitivity would be a downfall because it would easier to offend someone in a group of eight feelers. I think there would be more drama among the feelers and an overall less cohesive environment. Thinkers.

Judgers vs Perceivers: With Perceivers, you're more likely to have fewer people trying to take charge and more people doing their own thing. This means that teamwork may not be as prioritized, but schedules will probably be a bit more relaxed and everyone will be a bit more flexible with eachother. Judgers will have more people taking initiative and trying to take charge, but that doesn't necessarily mean a better team. The phrase "too many cooks" doesn't come from nowhere. If the Judgers can establish a solid leadership then I think they could edge out the Perceivers, but I would be more inclined to give it to the Perceivers. 

Agree? Disagree? Neutral? Any other ideas for survivor matchups? Feedback is much appreciated.
INTP: adorable nerd

ENTP: loud nerdENTP bias!!!Eh...you're bearable in small doses ;)

(but you have to admit that the comment was most likely written by an ENTP. ''Must think of the most negative thing I can say of my own type!! You're pretty funny and should probably be a comedian. Oh wait, the worst? You're lazy, I guess")

:D↑↑The Wall of Shame.↑↑

(/u/Kbnation, I have seen your face three times now, I think, but I still can't get used to the fact that that's you.)&gt;what was your expectation?!

http://imgur.com/pBhnuxH&gt; And it's bigger!

Like the [Egyptian god of fertility](http://imgur.com/CM7JYPr)?  Or more like a [centaur](http://imgur.com/jJqL0sg)?Judging by the subreddits of each type, INTJs seem to make the most value judgements of all thinking types, and seem to be among the most short-tempered of all types. INTPs seem like the most conventionally emotional of all thinking types.

Adjust this comment based on which types you think frequent the aforementioned subreddits the most...

From experience, xNTJs *are* the most prone to emotional outbursts and value judgements. INTPs mostly seem like they are genuinely trying to figure out relationships, their own emotions, etc., but if they can't 'Ti' it out, they are often left confused. Also, they seem to be the most likely of thinking types to get sad (often about imagined scenarios). xSTPs...have never caught them being emotional haha, although they can sometimes be found brooding over something. ENTPs are outwardly like xSTPs, but will be more open about their emotions one-on-one. ISTJs often come across as reserved/withdrawn NFs at first.I never belonged to a specific clique, but people saw me as a nerd/bookworm, I guess? (Mostly in middle school, now I think I am seen as 'a girl who can be nerdy and reads a lot', which I think is 100x better :D)

Anyway, are social groups really such a big deal in America/the Western countries? I thought it was a Hollywood thing. There were some emos/goths, nerds, 'jocks' etc., I guess, but the absolute majority of people did not adopt any specific identity, academically inclined people were friends with the sportsmen, popular people were friends with the goth kids, and everyone sat wherever at lunch haha.Is 10k the threshold between a good and a bad subreddit?

Tune in to find out!&gt;Or you can make a lady more drunk than the finest glass of wine!

"Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do".

&gt;Define "conventionally" emotional? SFJ housewife emotional? :]

Feeling a lot of emotions. In the human sense ;]Should I order them based on which colors I like the most in general, or the specific examples of the colors given here? (e.g., yellow is not my favorite color, but I like the example of yellow/light green the most in this example)Granted, it's been a long time since I read the book, but why do you think Anna Karenina is a Fe dom?

ESTP makes a lot of sense for Vronsky.Great post! :) But sorry, I saw this line " SJ's ime are enamoured with their tertiary/inferior", and I think I have a theory that is barely related to the main text.

So, everyone knows how there are certain stereotypes attached to each of the functions. Se means 'being in the here and now', Ti means 'being highly logical', Ne means 'being creative', etc. Obviously, once you look into the theory, you understand that these stereotypes have little to nothing to do with the actual functions: any person can be logical, creative, or like physical activities. Functions describe the way we take in and process information, not behavior, and, when typing people, it is less important to consider *what* people say/do than to understand how they come to their conclusions, and relying on the stereotypes leads nowhere.

However, I think an exception can be made for the tertiary function. As the child function, it lacks the depth of the first and second function. The tertiary function does not always seem present, but can come in strong flashes, and is reflected in behavior, not thought patterns. And I think that the manifestations of tertiary functions are what the stereotypes of functions are based on.

For instance, Si is my tertiary function. I have read many well-written descriptions of Si that are not based on stereotypes and that resonate with high Si users, but I do not relate to them at all. Si is not really about memories and nostalgia, but the moments when I am overwhelmed by memories of something that has happened are the only ones when I can clearly identify Si in my function stack.

Similarly, Te is not really about being organized, but the ExFPs I know can get almost obsessive about, say, organizing their book collection by alphabet or colors, or making sure that every utensil is in its right place in the drawer.

Fe is not really about being socially outgoing, but the ExTPs I know can be charming as hell, and are at the center of attention at almost any event.

Se is not really about sensory pleasures, but all the ENxJs I know like to indulge themselves into good food, expensive clothes, fast cars, etc.

Fi is not really about being stuck in your ways, but... (you can fill out the rest of the sentence)




(I am mostly kidding about that last one :D)&gt;I have a feeling that your favorite colors are your expertise, and I am seeking your expert knowledge of them.

This...seems very sarcastic hah. I don't think you screwed up at all! I am not even sure about my favorite color, it's just that one color can look so different! There are so many variations of blue! I even love gray, it can be so calming and smooth! 

Maybe I am just over-complicating the issue.http://imgur.com/NJGvlHcI don't remember much of the rest of the characters, but your typings for Hazel and Gus seem accurate :)Hmm, I have often read that using the dominant function is 'as natural as breathing', so you often don't even notice that you are using it, and you are more aware of the use of the auxiliary function (and apparently that can lead one to believing that they use their auxiliary function as their dominant). If you are open to suggestions about your type, maybe look into the ExTP types as options?So everyone ~evolves~ into a Fi user before they are 48? Fi is clearly the superior function then :p

(Also: my Fe is apparently older than me. Like 100x. Guess it's right what they say about all INFPs actually being ISFJs).&gt;'Fe [..] Is right based upon the external values an environment has set.'
&gt;"Drawing from Te [..] what's right is often externally set."

Could you elaborate on the differences between these two, please? As far as I understand, the Fi-Te axis means 'I create my personal (subjective) values based on observation of the external environment'. The Fe-Ti axis means 'My values of what is right and what is wrong are in accordance with an external moral standard', right? Where does Ti come into play here?Sorry, I wrote this late at night when I should have already been asleep for hours. I just wanted to distinguish between observing a person (their actions, but also what they say and how they behave in interaction with other people--including participating in one-on-one conversations) vs. figuring out their cognitive functions in a detached manner...eh, I don't make sense. What would be some ways to determine a Fe-Ti vs. Fi-Te preference through a conversation?Who would be more likely to 'stand up against the system', then(here I mean a system of moral principles in particular)? Fe-Ti or Fi-Te? Say, if the society as a large believes that X is immoral, who is more likely to develop opposing views? Intuitively, I would say Fi with its individualized approach to morality, but Fi necessarily comes in a set with Te which judges things based on the external reality. Ti, on the other hand, is more likely to develop subjective, personalized systems of logic and might argue against view X if it doesn't conform to their system of logic, but Ti necessarily comes together with Fe which acts based on objective moral 'goodness'...I guess my question is: what is the fundamental difference between Fi-Te and Ti-Fe, if both axes come with a subjective, personal judging function (Ti, Fi) and an objective, reality-oriented judging function (Te, Fe)?&gt;Likes weird things: Ne, Ti "Whale tapeworms are cool!"

*Looks at the tag*

So tell me about these tapeworms!\#relatable&gt;Additionally, if you didn't know what type I was, what type would you think?

Because nobody else answered this question: the Fi-Te axis seems obvious, but I can't decide between Ne-Si and Se-Ni. 

As for myself, I constantly score something like this in the cognitive functions tests: Ne~Fi&gt;Ni&gt;Ti~Fe&gt;&gt;Si&gt;&gt;&gt;Te&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Se (some tests indicate that I prefer Ni over Ne). Various socionics tests actually see me as either a xNTP or an INxJ (when converted into MBTI types). INFP is simply the type I have the least resistance seeing myself as (I do not relate to some significant aspects of each of the other types), although I am not entirely sure that I have Fi as the dominant function, either. I am relatively sure about the Ne-Si axis, but that's pretty much all. But people have overwhelmingly typed me as an INFP, so that's what I accept as being the truth for right now, and that's what I have put as my flair to at least pretend to be somewhat sure about my type (doesn't mean that each time I find some information that contradicts the INFP typing I do not start immediately doubting everything I know about my type...)

To answer the question directly: I think either INTP, or ISxJ (although I don't relate to the descriptions of Si, even the non-stereotypical ones), or (far less likely, and only because of the outward similarity and because INFp fits the best in socionics) INFJ.&gt;FYI Robin Williams and Louis CK are both SJs.

Controversial! Why do you think so?&gt;If someone really likes an aspect of themselves it may be relevant or it could be an idealistic impression of 'best'.

Mhm. I think, when attempting to type oneself, it is important to be especially careful with the functions (or even letters, if one is typing by the letters) that one idealizes. Same with typing others, but then you also have to be mindful of the functions/letters that you dislike if you are typing a person that you dislike.

So, say, if a person thinks they are INTP (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe) but they also have a hard-on for ENFPs (not just romantically, but if they generally consider that to be the best type), then I would say that it is pretty likely that they use Ti and Fe (as there is no bias towards these functions), but that they should be careful when deciding whether they really use Ne-Si, or if they just want to be more like their ideal type. Or, say, an ESTP who dislikes Fi should be careful when typing all the people they dislike as Fi-Te users, and vice versa :D&gt;John is beginning to form the preference Ti-Ne [..] John is interested in space.

&gt;Tom is beginning to prefer Fi-Ne [..] Tom is more of a humanitarian.


Would the conclusions of your post have been different if you had set the INTP in your example as the humanitarian, and the INFP as the one who is interested in space? You could make the argument that NTs might be more drawn towards STEM and NFs might prefer humanitarian work (and I am not arguing against the possibility), but then I would expect some proof of that (I think it's actually provable by merely looking at the nature of Fe/Fi vs. Te/Ti, I am just arguing against you using an example of a humanitarian NF/logical NT to prove that certain types are more likely to develop certain traits: if I disagreed with your post, I could say that you are using stereotypes to prove stereotypes).

So, without the knowledge about whether Ti or Fi is more likely to be a humanitarian, and who is more likely to be interested in space, let's suppose that the INTP is a humanitarian, and the INFP is interested in space. Same scenario, but reversed: "Due to their preferences which they understood, and were very clear while young, [the INFP] knew he had to get perfect grades in Science and Math courses. He went to space camp. He took a logic course his high school offered and excelled. [The INTP] was focused more on the social sciences, and putting his efforts to the help of people by volunteering at many places. A soup kitchen, an old folks home, and a big brother program to help underprivileged children."

*Now* let's ask the same questions: Who has a better chance of becoming a scientist? Who is more likely to understand the implications on decisions on human life, and their value? Would you expect the INTP, who naturally has preference towards creating elaborate logical systems to have a higher chance of becoming a scientist, or the INFP, who has always had an interest in space, has excelled in the logic course, has been to a space camp, etc.? By the way, it's already included in the premise that the INFP is *good* at what they are doing (they excelled at the relevant courses at school, managed to get into a space camp and so on), so, *independent of whether or not they use Ti*, something in their function stack (or some unrelated factors, like intelligence) makes them successful at it. Same with being a humanitarian: would you expect the INFP, who naturally has a preference towards making value judgments, to be able to better 'understand the implications on decisions on human life'? Or someone who has continuously put his efforts towards helping other people, and has experienced the various paths a human life can take by volunteering in an old folks home, by helping underprivileged children, etc.?

By the way, I largely agree with your post. I just think life experience may play a larger part in determining a person's character than their cognitive functions (although I am willing to be proven the opposite). I also think that a good way to develop as a person is to take on roles that do not necessarily fit the things you are supposed to enjoy, based on your functions. As an example: in middle school, I applied for a very prestigious school in my country. To get into that school, all students had to pass a very rigorous mathematics test, and only a very small portion of the people who had applied for the school got in. Now, perhaps unsurprisingly, I would say that the majority of the students who got into the school were thinkers, and they were all intelligent and interesting people, but their hobbies were mostly limited to math-, science- and IT-related topics. Most of the 'feelers', on the other hand (although they had the necessary interest/knowledge about mathematics to 1) pass the test and 2)continue studies at the school with good grades), were primarily interested in other subjects (literature, history, etc.) and generally came across as more well-rounded individuals *in this setting* (I know this sounds arrogant, but I am not including myself among the well-rounded feelers, as I was struggling with depression through high school, and never felt like I belonged (intellectually) among these people I still consider among the most intelligent/interesting ones I have ever met).

Now, I am studying foreign languages at university. The requirements of the program are to learn three foreign languages to fluency, among other subjects, so after the first year or so, the people who had thought that studying languages was just an easy way to get a degree have mostly left the program, and it's reasonable to expect that the people who have remained are more or less 'suitable' for the program. Again, perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of the students that have remained are 'feelers', so the situation has shifted, and the *'thinkers'* are now the ones who are more well-rounded, as they have enough of the qualities (whatever they are) to be successful at a stereotypically 'feeler-populated' program, but they also have a way of thinking that is different from most of the people that study here, as well as (mostly) differing interests. And if, in the future, they get a stereotypical 'feeler' job, they are less likely to be defined by their job, and more likely to have interests that go beyond what they do for living: in short, they're less likely to get stuck in a rut.

Also interesting to note: while some of the thinkers in the thinker-heavy environment were 'stereotypical thinkers', and some of the feelers in the feeler-heavy environment are 'stereotypical feelers', I think both the thinkers in the feeler environment and the feelers in the thinker environment mostly adopted 'the best of both worlds': none of the feelers in my high school were the stereotypical 'easily offended, irrational' type, and thinkers in the feeler environment were all very kind and socially well-developed people, while not losing the best qualities of their respective cognitive preferences.

**Edit:** Oh no. I just saw that /u/madsweet stated the same point much more eloquently, and not in a rambly manner like me ( ´•̥̥̥ω•̥̥̥` )&gt;we can safely assume there is no S and N IQ difference because with the way the MBTI tests are provided no person of very high IQ regardless of S or N preference will get an S

I wouldn't say 'no person', but of course! Haven't taken a letter test in a long while, but if I remember correctly, the questions in the 'letter tests' that determine N/S preference are basically 'do you like to think abstractly?' 'do you enjoy theoretical pursuits?' 'are you fascinated by knowledge?' etc., all of which will (quite obviously, I think) correspond with higher IQ, but have little to nothing to do with actual sensing/intuition functions.

And the Big 5 test, which is widely considered to be the most reliable psychological test, is not any better. Iirc, openness on big five is the strongest indicator that the person has high IQ, but to get a high score of openness, these are some of the questions you have to answer positively: 'are you ingenious and a deep thinker?', 'are you sophisticated in art, music and literature?', 'are you original and come up with new ideas'? and so on. For me, answering positively to these questions would indicate a high confidence in one's own (intellectual, creative, artistic...) abilities, and not necessarily actual ability. Plus, finding that people who answer positively to these questions also score higher on IQ tests seems hardly surprising to me.&gt; how easy is to see oneself in every personality disorder out there?

Right? I took a test at school back when everyone went through a mental disorder craze after taking a psychology lesson, and apparently I have a dependent *and* avoidant personality disorder.

Anyway, the link is pretty RAD.I truly believe that 80% of the problems in my life are caused by PoLR Se.&gt;The closest 2nd i usually get is ENTP

&gt;pushes [..] ESFP possibility

Hmm, high Fi and Ne...what if you were actually an INFP all along??Hmm, I don't know a lot about university clubs in America (or wherever it is that you live), they are not really common here. Other people are suggesting general activities that everyone could enjoy, but shouldn't you focus on MBTI-related activities?

Anyway, here are some suggestions:

* Divide people in groups based on their dominant functions (or function axes, or temperaments, or whatever). Give the same task to each of the groups: e.g., writing a short story, or solving a logical puzzle, or preparing a meal, or drawing something, or discussing a current political issue,or whatever. Compare the results between the groups: focus not only on the end result, but how each group reached it.

* Take other tests and compare the results (because most everyone loves tests). Here is a good site that lists some more and some less accepted/serious tests: http://personality-testing.info Big five is among the most widely accepted psychological tests, but there are also some less serious ones: are NTs really the group which is the most likely to self-identify as a nerd? Who is the most narcissistic type? Most melancholic? (obviously, you have to remember that the results will  only reflect the preferences of the members of the club, not the specific type as a whole). Another test that is not included in the page: the enneagram test.

* If you are academically inclined, set a goal of reading a few pages of Jung's Psychological Types before each meeting, and then discussing the ideas and how/whether they apply to your type.

* If you 'believe in' socionics: each week (month), let a different socionics quadra organize an event. Because each quadra strives for a different group atmosphere, I believe that each event would be quite different in nature (e.g., how Betas-xSTPs and xNFJs- vs. Deltas-xNFPs and xSTJs- would organize a social event.) However, you would have to keep in mind what you have learned about different types, and try to be accommodating to everyone, so all types feel comfortable and joyful (I.e., the event is neither overwhelming, nor boring )

* Devote each meeting to a different function (or an axis, since functions operate together). If you choose, say, Te, ExTJs could talk about dominant Te, IxFPs could talk about inferior Te, IxFJs could talk about PoLR Te, etc. Try to avoid stereotypes and acknowledge the importance (but also drawbacks) of each function, maybe types with a more developed function can teach other types how to better utilize that function, while types for whom that function is lower in the stack could offer their perspective (how to consider ideas from different angles, how to not overly rely on one function and balance it with the other functions, etc.)

Hope some of this helped :)&gt;~ OMG! DO YOU KNOW HOW COOL TAPEWORMS ARE! ~ 

Is..is [this](https://reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4nbqgj/why_are_intjs_weird/d42mfra) some kind of a meme now? :DI took the survey, but, since your post was downvoted, you will probably get few responses. Maybe try /r/SampleSize? :)I don't really think it has anything to do with being exclusive. It's just that, when a person completely rejects the idea of being a SJ *because of the descriptions of SJs they read online*...then there's a pretty big chance that they are basing their conclusions on stereotypes (and what's more attractive: the description of a 'mastermind' or the description of a rigid rule follower?) In that case, it just seems likely that they're not giving a fair chance to all types (as they are immediately writing off certain types without further investigation). If I had a greater confidence that OP had looked into and understood what Si means (past the stereotypes) and *then* made the conclusion about their type, I would be more inclined to believe that their assessment of their own type is correct.Your flair is inaccurate. While it is true that all sensors and feelers are less intelligent than intuitives and thinkers, it is a well-known fact that introverts are smarter than extroverts, thus making ESFJ the least intelligent type. I would suggest that you read the book 'Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking'.&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3You can go on thinking that you are ESTP, but from now on I will read all your comments as if you were an INFP :D

Anyway, are all INFPs necessarily creative? I guess I did not get the memo. Then again, I possess all the negative qualities of a stereotypical INFP (crybaby, *really* emotional, ...) without any of the good stuff.

&gt;Would an INFP break up a fight by yelling louder than the ppl fighting?! Cos I kinda did that yesterday!

Hehe. I don't think I have ever yelled in my life, actually. I was so quiet until I was ~12/13 that my sister's classmates thought I was mute, and my ENTP friend (acquaintance? well, a classmate either way) had to take me under his wing and teach me to speak louder, look people in their eyes, etc. I credit him for having any kind of social skills at all.If I were in a relationship with a person who enabled me to do whatever I want to do, I would probably come out a worse person from that relationship.

(This sounds like I dream of doing bad things to people, which is far from the truth. I’m just a low-energy person most of the time, and I need an outside force to get out of my comfort zone: basically, I need a [Ms. Norbury](http://imgur.com/nG8UhJJ) )

**Edit:**  I only just noticed what an utterly terrible gif that is.&gt;I think i'd get on better with my sister (enfp) if i was infp

How can you *not* get on with ENFPs? They're the best!

Come to think about it (though I may be biased about it for obvious reasons) I don't think I have ever had any problems getting along with people who have Fi as their dominant or auxiliary function at all. That's why I'm always so surprised when people talk about how negative their experience trying to get along with Fi-heavy people has been. Maybe it *is* a matter of miscommunication between different axes.  I can imagine that people think that they have offended a Fi user when no offense has been taken--the only person I regularly argue with calls me stubborn because I have a tendency to just exit an argument with her, but that's because arguments with her are just so drawn-out and senseless that I see no use in continuing to argue with her.

&gt;Walking away works!

Yeah! (see? that's your Fi in action :p)

&gt;I can tell who is interested in talking to who by position, expression, how 'into' the conversation they are... are these things not obvious to everyone else?
Realistically... can you tell when someone you just met fancies your friend?

Interesting that you mention it. I was reading the 'ESTP dealbreakers' thread and saw this comment: "People who [..] imprint emotive intent on my words." And that's definitely something that I do (not just in interaction with other people, but also in observation of others), although I am aware that that is an annoying habit. I always attribute emotive intent to people's actions/words, and sometimes it works in my favor (mostly because I get to say 'I told you so' when two people get together weeks after I had predicted it--and because people in real life tend to get drawn to people who can 'read them well'), but sometimes I think I imagine feelings that probably do not even exist, so I have been learning that not everything I think I am seeing is actually real.

&gt; i'm really good at shit talking!

Now *that's* a valuable skill!
😱 My original post was a joke based on a joke flair (it said ISFJ: the lowest IQ). The flair has since been removed. The joke was based on the fact that introverts, intuitives and thinkers are all stereotypically regarded as more intelligent than (respectively) extroverts, sensors and feelers, and I included the book 'Quiet' in the comments because I think it perpetuates the myth that introverts are more intelligent or 'deeper' than extroverts.

I have nothing but respect towards both sensors and feelers!I don't understand the emotion that this gif conveys.&gt;The facts can be wrong!

Well, of course. That's why I specified that, in this scenario, the person has no reason to doubt the validity of the facts.

E.g., I am fully aware that sometimes my treatment of facts is not completely objective: even if I accept some data as being true, I will try to understand the context/underlying reasons why these facts do not change the truth as I know it (most of the time I am fully willing to consider an issue from all sides--but I am aware of the fact that it's hard for me to stay objective when I'm heavily involved in some matter emotionally/morally). So, for instance, I hate when someone tries to 'intellectualize' hatred by using facts/figures to justify, say, racism or homophobia. In that case, I will accept that the concrete figure may be factual, but that will not change my opinion about racism on a larger scale.

Does it make sense? As a Fi user, I can accept that something is factually true but still reject the conclusion that the other person makes based on the same facts because it stands against my beliefs. So, analogously, if a Ti user accepts something as factually true, is there any reason why they may still reject these facts as irrelevant for some subjective reason?&gt; To achieve said "integrity" it has to be formed as an infallible, ideal principle to allow flexibility for the variable facts of reality as counterbalance.

Would you say that this is where the subjective nature of Ti comes into play? In determining what makes an infallible/ideal principle? 

I have a number of general moral rules against which I measure the moral 'rightness'/'goodness' of the situation. And, if asked to evaluate a specific situation, in most of the cases I could tell you whether I find it moral or immoral, based on these rules. But the general principles are axiomatic, and I could not explain why I think following exactly these principles makes something bad or good, they are just general rules that I have formed over the years by observing how the world works.

Is it in any way similar to a Ti user? Or is there some overarching logical system that explains the validity of even the most basic principles?My experience with psychology:

1) Ahhh, so everyone does that

2) Wait...that's not normal??My condolences.=(To the F ;)&gt; fwiw the only other person whose results were that inconclusive was an ESTP

When I took that test, I think I got Alpha-5, Beta-1, Gamma-1 and Delta-5. At least it kind of confirmed that I use Ne-Si over Se-Ni axis, but also highlighted why I have been having such difficulties settling on my type.

As a side question: you are involved in the video typing group, right? :) I wanted to ask about your typing history of the people who have asked to be typed: are there any trends? I am just curious about what the distribution of the types is like when typing with cognitive functions vs. typing with the letter test (even if it's just within the boundaries of Redditors who are unsure about their type).Thank you for the link! :) Hmm, I think I fit in the Delta quadra slightly better than in the Alpha quadra. Now just to decide between xNFPs and xSTJs...

And the statistics are really interesting! What are the types of your team? And do you think that high Fe or Te could maybe be more apparent in a person than Fi/Ti when typing through videos?
There are certain INFPs that I find to be very funny on this sub, but I suspect that's partly because I agree with most of the things they say, and I only find people I agree with funny.

ESTPs are also consistently funny.

And I have a soft spot for INFJs :)Depends on the type of memes.

/r/me_irl are the ISTJs

I think there are a lot of ESTPs in /r/blackpeopletwitter

/r/adviceanimals...the xNTPs 😏I think he definitely uses Fi and Ni. Have you seen his Twitter rants? I know people don't really believe in dominant-tertiary loops here, but [this](http://personalitycafe.com/articles/25205-dominant-tertiary-loops-common-personality-disorders.html#/forumsite/20588/topics/25205?page=1) seems quite accurate:

"These types are your typical conspiracy theorists; they cling deeply to their personal values and can find a conspiracy to assault or attack those values everywhere they look. Chronically distrustful of others' intentions for no legitimate reason, these types are certain they are the only ones who really know "the truth." The inferior function, Te or Se, can sometimes lead to an unconscious desire to attract the attention of or lead/organize others in efforts to expose the nefarious conspiracies they invariably see everywhere. If Te/Se were doing its job, these types would be able to look around them and observe empirical evidence that most of their theories are probably not reflected in reality, but as they rely almost entirely on internal validation, Ni will go to any lengths to justify Fi's emotion-based suspicions."&gt;Same with Taylor Swift 

Isn't Swiftie (commonly considered to be) ESTP?Define SJW ;)&gt;Why not at least mention who they are! I think the people who submit good content like that should be recognized! 

There are many people on this subreddit that I consider to be intelligent, funny, and excellent contributors to this site (including you :D) The problem is, if I wanted to name them all, I would end up with a list of a few dozen people, accidentally forget to include someone I admire, and finally just write down everyone who has ever participated in this subreddit out of fear of disappointing someone.

That's the same problem as with wanting to upvote ~just one~ picture of an adorable kitten on /r/aww!

Plus: if I don't name any names, everyone's free to imagine that they are the funny and intelligent user I am thinking about :)I take offense...on /u/Kbnation's behalf!Ah, so I am in the clear :)I have to reach my daily 'offense taken' quota. If not enough people offend me that day, I get offended on someone else's behalf ;)You are the king of vaguely related sexually charged jokes in this subreddit.&gt;I know lots of INFPs that really loved Inside Out 

You can add another one to your list. I watched the translated version in my local theater and later found out that I had missed out on many great jokes, but it was still a very, very enjoyable movie.&gt;The salt-of-the-earth types who stick by you no matter what. The ones that do your taxes for you. The ISTJs and ESTJs and ESFJs.

Ahaha. This is wonderful.

Have you noticed the same thing? There is an intuitive bias on this subreddit, sure, but at least people admit that the SP types can be funny, intelligent, interesting, etc. With SJs, even when trying to talk positively about them, the general message that is being communicated is still 'but they're so grounded! What would we do without SJs, who would do our taxes?'. As if SJs were somehow unable to be interesting or intelligent (past simple memorization of what is being taught: in any education/intelligence thread the NTs will admit that SJs did a better job at school than them, but that's because they are the lazy genius, while the SJs are just a 'better fit for the current educational system' and simply memorized the course material)

Does it have to do anything with exposure to positive examples of each type?The comments about the xNTP types and Ti always tend to get upvoted to the top.

Least discussed: xSFPs. Maybe because Fi is harder to observe through Se 'action' than through Ne 'word/idea diarrhea'?&gt;Did I miss someone?

INTPs that pose as INFPs&gt;I wonder why...

I don't have Ti, I'm no good at riddles. Why?I...genuinely have no idea what you're talking about.Betas: the lovable lunatics.&gt;Ramblings of a crazy person.

ESTP...crazy person...isn't that redundant? :p&gt;Just so I can have arguments with people on r/mbti without them automatically assuming that I'm getting emotional or "butthurt".

Sorry that that has been your experience :(

To answer the question, I would love to be an ENFP. The best type!! Or ESxP, for something completely different (dominant Se? How does *that* sound?)&gt;So I pretend there's nothing at stake. No deadlines, no disappointed parents, and no chances of running away to see the world. The world is closed for visitors this week. Very sad. And, look, how interesting is that question about obligations?

I love this. Thank you! :)&gt; (and alsho horny)

only 60% horny? :oI used to be a 'suicidal ideation' drunk lmao, now I am a 'can't shut my mouth' drunk. I can't really decide who's less pleasant to be around (but my friends like to get me drunk, as I do it so rarely).&gt;% smiles recieved

Aww, what a nice guy :)I adore the mutual INFP-ENFP love :)Is making wild generalizations about a huge part of the population based on one negative interaction with a representative of that group inevitably going to happen with Ni Te types?:D

Can Te operate on a single data point?&gt;N dominance

What's that?So wait. What *is* your stance on INFPs? I thought you were mocking them? 

(explain the joke pls)I meant the bigger, overarching joke with the INFP tag and everything.I liked the other ones, but the INFP description reads too much like a horoscope (generic statements that could apply to anyone): 'Someone who can bring order, but also a world of possibilities. Can help figure out what they want, but at the same time not limit them. Realizes alone time in a relationship is just as important as time together.' etc.

(I do not like to criticize things, especially since you said that you worked hard on this :( Some of the descriptions are very accurate to the people I know in my life, I just did not really relate to the description of INFPs :/)No, I usually get IAUML (or its equivalent), which corresponds to ISFP, due to the way the questions are phrased.

By the way, I know that Big5 is considered to be the best/most widely recognized psychological test there is, but I have some objections to the way 'openness' is measured. Here are some of the statements you have to agree with to score high on openness:

I have a vivid imagination.

I have excellent ideas.

I am quick to understand things.

I use difficult words.

 etc.

Think of a person who would 'highly agree' to all of these items ('yes, I have excellent ideas'). What do you think is more likely? That they are "open to experience, [..] intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty and willing to try new things"? Or that they are just a bit too arrogant? I.e., I think this factor measures how assured a person is of their own intellectual/creative abilities, rather than how 'open to experience' they are.

(And because this sounds like I am bitter due to getting a result that corresponds to a different type: I have nothing against the idea of me possibly being a sensor, but in that case I would definitely be a Si, not a Se type (like ISFP). I don't have a single Se bone in my body)Ah, so the INFPs (ground sirloin) strive to be like the ENFPs (ground beef).I recently read On The Road, so I am going to nominate Dean Moriarty for ESTP.&gt;Ne-doms, especially ENTPs, may look you directly in the eye while talking and won’t break eye contact for half a minute, which is kind of irritating to be honest, but it always feels like you are just an anchor they address when they themselves are focused inwards.

omgTo be honest, I think you are taking the wrong approach here. Why not just try to determine whether the person has the qualities you are looking for (creative, analytical, etc.) through the interview? Why is your primary focus on finding xNTPs, instead of finding suitable candidates for the job?

(I just re-read the post and noticed that you are not the interviewer, and this is just a hypothetical question. Eh. Still leaving this up in case you decide to apply the post to real life)&gt; Ne is already like the most idealized function, second only to ~~Ni~~ **Ti**.

FTFY ;)What would you say are the differences between ENTJs and ESTPs? I am trying to type a person I know, and I think they are definitely an ExTx, they also definitely use Se-Ni, but I am stuck between those two types. They seem to value both Te and Se, and I can sense some Fi, as well, so that would point to ENTJ, but they seem to fit into the Beta quadra (xSTPs and xNFJs) better than in the Gamma quadra (xSFPs and xNTJs).Thank you, this is very useful :) The links to the description of INFP-ESTP and INFP-ENTJ relationships especially confirm that the person I was talking about is an ENTJ (the description of a semi-dual relationship fits to a tee!) The both of us are also always drawn to discussing 'Fi topics', which never happens in my interactions with ESTPs haha. However, do you have any idea why an ENTJ might seemingly fit into a Beta quadra better than into a Gamma quadra? Is it because of the strong Se? (the person is older than me, so it's no surprise that their tertiary function is well-developed)The whole description of the beta quadra fits the person very well, but I am going to copy the most relevant sentences (from sociotype.com):

-Beta types tend to enjoy group activities where the whole group participates in generating a common emotional atmosphere, as in laughing at jokes, etc.

-Beta types tend to give more value to feelings when they are demonstrated with clear emotional expression, and tend to increase the level of their own emotional expression in order to get a reaction from other people.

-Beta types tend to describe personal views of special meaning with "poetic" or "dramatic" expressions and language.

-Jokes are loud and general, often about stereotypes. [..] In more subdued moments, discussion of ideas involving present trends and political implications, with strong views voiced.

- Betas restrict long-winded stories to one-on-one conversations.

-Beta romantic relationships tend to start from intense exchanges of emotions, either of a playful, aggressive sort, or of a more "tormented" sort based on personal images of special meaning, "romantic" in a 19th-century sense. The two sorts merge together to make Beta the quadra most inclined towards "romantic courtship" in the everyday sense of the term. A relationship is felt to be "lacking" if not accompanied by intense demonstrations of emotions. [..] Betas are the most intense of all quadras in terms of exchanges of emotional and sensual interplay.

(Thank you! :))ExxPs (except for ESFPs, which I have only had as friends) and INxxs (except for INTJs...sorry! Though I have liked an ENTJ).Nooo, a real INTJ. I feel bad :,(What's interesting that most of the top replies consider people whose dominant function is the respondent's fifth/sixth function to be weird.

An ENTJ has Ne as their sixth function, considers Ne doms to be the most weird.

An ENFJ has Fi as their fifth function, considers high-Fi types to be quirky.

And INTP has Ni as their sixth functions, considers Ni doms to be esoteric.

An ENTP has Ni as their fifth function, considers Ni types to be among the weirdest.

An ENTJ has Ne as their fifth function, considers ENFPs to be among the weirdest.

etc.

Just a coincidence? (^I^think^not^:p )If it makes you feel better, I can almost guarantee that it is due to no fault of your own (and that the Fi user likely feels very sorry about their behavior).

For an insider perspective: When I am in a 'dark phase' in my life, there are periods when I feel the need to retreat from everyone for *months*. I don't answer any e-mails or text messages or calls, I don't accept any invitations to go out, and my life consists of home-university-(work)-home. (is that a Fi-Si loop? idk) When I finally force myself to face the consequences of my behavior,  I usually spend weeks fixing relationships and going the extra mile to meet all of my friends!! attend all the social events!! That continues until I find myself overwhelmed by everything again, and feel the need to hide away. All the while I am also feeling terrible for abandoning my closest friendships like that again.

Honestly, the only reason I still have any friends is that there are people who constantly show initiative in approaching me, time and time again, even when I haven't responded for weeks. I am eternally grateful for that. OP, it sounds like you're doing everything right and more, and I bet that your friends really appreciate you for that.

(eh, and I am sorry that I wrote such a stereotypically depressive INFP comment. you can imagine that i am your least favorite type. or that my shitty behavior transcends types ;))I think it's a bit over-complicated way of asking 'in what situations would each of the types thrive?' ;)That's interesting, because I recently had a very similar conversation to the one you linked with an ISTP I know, and I sided with the ENTP in your example, and he sided with the ENFP in your example (i.e., he does not support changing 'the system' to even out inequalities caused by upbringing and does not believe in the concept of privilege (he also mentioned people who have started from the bottom and worked their way upwards to success); I admitted that there are some cases when people might break away from the constraints caused by inequality, but that by and large factors like race, social background, gender etc. impact a person's chance of success and that there is an urgent need to level the playing field).

Not saying that you are wrong in your assessment of the persons' type, and definitely not saying that I am 100% sure of my own typings, I just find it interesting that people with the same judging functions might still hold very opposing viewpoints :)&lt;3I would be willing to bet that the creator of that presentation thinks of themselves as an INFJ.I might be very wrong, but I think that, if people are complaining about "an immature use of [function]", there is a very low chance that that function is the person's dominant/secondary function.

The dominant function is the one that a person has literally spent a lifetime mastering. The secondary function is also very likely to be well-developed in adults, with the added benefit of the person being aware of their use of that function. Why would it be the case that a person showcasing an immature use of a function would have it as their dominant/secondary function? Isn't it more likely that it would be their tertiary 'childish' function, inferior or seventh (PoLR) function? The most immature 'Fi' behavior I have witnessed has come from some IxTJs. The most reckless 'Se' behavior: from ENxJs. Etc. If you want to point out the flaws in IxFPs, you are most likely to find an immature use of Si, Te or Se, rather than Fi or Ne.

At least that's what I think.Hey now, it can be fun to overindulge in sad/melancholic things when everything seems to be going wrong. Not helpful ~~per se~~ at all, but fun!But drinking makes it wooorse :,(

Anyway, what is it with xxTPs and wanting to pat people's head? Does Fi bring out (p/m)aternal instinct in you? :pAwww, inferior Fe is so adorable *pat, pat*Hold on, you're Russian (or Slavic, at least)? 

(The chain still works with Latin alphabet, like this Ne-&gt;No ;))Whichever quadra has the xSTJs.

Oh, that's us, what a coincidence. Guess I am a winner by default ;)

On second thought, maybe the disadvantage of switching xSTJs for xNTJs is made up by the benefit of having xSFPs instead of xNFPs in your group. So Gamma?Hmm, interesting :) What if I doubt my type, but hardly ever my introversion?&gt;from what I can recall from bumming around this sub, I haven't seen anything from you that struck me as inconsistent with a grounded INFP

Thanks, what a relief ;)

&gt;what quadra do you think fits you best?

Alpha or Delta. So the Ne-Si axis, basically. Alpha fits my public persona better, Delta describes me on a more personal level, and since I spend more time at home than in public, I guess it gives a slight edge to the Delta quadra.&gt;Now this is something I will gladly validate.

I *thrive* on validation, so thanks ;)

I actually wanted to tag you in this post because you have a sensor bias and if you wouldn't disagree that I might be an INFP, I would be more comfortable with my typing. But I didn't want to pull you into this involuntarily and figured that you would find the thread anyway :PGet a room ;)&gt;Our thoughts

Awww

&gt; I think perceiving dominant types are incredibly more likely to achieve a successful dual interaction

Perhaps that is the case, or perhaps you will support any theory that suggests that ESTP and INFJ are the ideal pair ;)

Personally, I don't have anything against Socionics, but if so many people talk about experiences with their dual type that are contrary to the theory, are we just supposed to assume that they all haven't matured yet? That they all have mistyped themselves? 'If it doesn't look like a duck, doesn't swim like a duck, and doesn't quack, then it's probably not a duck' ;) Though I am willing to accept that many of the stories of conflict between dual types come from people relying on their first impressions and not willing to give a chance to relationships that seem doomed to fail from the beginning.

By the way, I carried out a survey a long time ago and it seemed that, by far, people seem to be the most interested in their own type, or the introverted/extroverted version of their type. Everyone's a bit of a narcissist, I guess. But identical/mirror relationships are probably the opposite of dual relationships: huge and mutual initial attraction, but the relationship offers no opportunities for growth because of how similar the people in the relationship are. A good middle ground, I think, is relationships between people with judging functions that have swapped places in the stack, and with perceiving functions of the other attitude. Like this:

INFP=Fi-Ne-Si-Te ENTJ=Te-Ni-Se-Fi

So the pairs would be:

INFP-ENTJ

ISFP-ESTJ

INTP-ENFJ

ISTP-ESFJ

INFJ-ENTP

ISFJ-ESTP

INTJ-ENFP

ISTJ-ESFP&gt;Can you give yourself an intervention?

It can't be that bad!

&gt;Although, personally, I would choose another ESTP over an ISFJ any day of the week. ESTP master race, represent!

Now I got to ask (though I highly suspect that I know the answer already): ISFJ, INFJ and ESTP. F, M and K. Which one is which? Throw an ISTP in there as well, if you wish.Sorry for the late reply!! Why do you think INFP? :)Thank you! :) Do you want to explain why you think so, or is that just a vibe you got from my post?&gt;ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

&gt;This is ESTJ material. Does Te have to enslave you for you to recognize it?!

I thought I was going crazy ha. This post is *full* of Te. Definitely Ne/Si axis, as well.I was mostly kidding with that previous comment, you know ;)Admit that you (kind of) like being INTP, and I will forgive these damned lies.&gt;empathetic boys attract more female friends

[..]

&gt;if you're a conflict-adverse, harmony-seeking male idealist in touch with his fee-fees, you're leaning towards the friend zone.

So, how the hell did you manage to turn 'having more female friends' into a negative thing? At least 90% of the men who I know who have great romantic success and who attract many women also have female friends. It's the people who see women as some other species that they are afraid to approach that have little to no success in dating. A lot of the traits that make a person a great friend also make them a great partner. In fact, I would say that 'agreeableness' is the trait that is the most common to all the romantically successful people I know, winning over even extroversion. And this includes agreeable people from all types, not just feelers, including the aforementioned 'badasses/assholes' ESTP, ENTJ, etc.

'Dark triad characters in a softer form' will trump when it comes to one-night stands, but it is far from being some RedPill-esque conspiracy about women preferring abusive assholes over genuinely nice people: when it comes to short-time sexual encounters, confidence, high impulsivity, low anxiety etc. are just traits that make it more likely that a person will approach another person that they like, and a higher approach rate and lower anxiety obviously lead to a higher success rate.Skeptic

(Welcome back! :))

**Edit:** Adding some more information.

I think the test would have seen me as less rational if I had not known the answers to the 'tricky maths questions' before. I also saw through the economics-based questions, but attempted to answer honestly anyway. I am aware that I do not act as rationally as an economics textbook would want me to. Also, I am terrible at planning time, but I guess that it will be a common point among most of us here.&gt;Before lunch: Journalist

&gt; i have recently noticed (in reflection) that i make really really unintelligent decisions sometimes due to hunger

lol the implicationLol. 

Actually, I would have never imagined that ESTPs dislike xNFPs this much if not for this subreddit. My relationships with ESTPs are mostly respectful if not friendly (well, at least since high school), and the ENFPs I know are all buddies-buddies with ESTPs.

My only 'point of conflict' with ESTPs IRL is that they are all very...tactile people, at least the men (so much touching!!)~~The highest of honors~~

I do have an edge, you wanker.  A lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.I expected you to be better versed in [classic goth memes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6829556/2/My-Immortal)

Can I be an extrovert, too?Don't call me buddy, you big^lumbering^fuckface^(sorry)(Thanks for referring me here, /u/CritSrc, though I am unsure about how much I can help OP given that I am not even sure that I am an INFP. Also, feel free to not read any of this: I have not yet reached enough self-awareness to distinguish between  'INFP way of thinking' and 'my individual way of thinking', so everything that I am going to write here will refer very specifically to OP's post)

Hey, /u/such-lame, I am not sure how much I can help you, but I noticed quite a lot of similarities between us both when reading through the post. I will try to comment on everything one point at a time to keep the comment more or less organized, and then you can see for yourself how much of what I wrote resonates with you. :)

&gt;**I suck at brainstorming and coming up with new ideas for things**

Are you referring to situations where you are asked to come up with ideas without any prompt at all? Idea generation still feeds on some source of inspiration, whether it be memories, the concrete world around you, some mental associations, or the like. Even Ne-doms don't just generate ideas from thin air, there will always be ties to other physical/mental happenings, even if they are very subtle/seemingly random to the observer. I definitely need some context/prompting to generate ideas and brainstorm, though I usually operate with mental associations (I noticed this one thing, it brought this other thing to my mind (Si-inspired association?)), rather than draw inspiration from the physical world. I think Se-based inspiration is more direct and concrete; more vivid but less abstract and limited in scope to the observable world. Which do you relate to more?

&gt;**I really like the feeling of nostalgia**

I wouldn't say that I *like* nostalgia, but I definitely feel its influence in my life. I can be easily overwhelmed by imagery/sensations from the past. Dwelling on the past can feel comfortable when I am in a bad place in my life, but it also comes with a feeling of helplessness/loss of direction, so I try to force myself to not fixate on the past.

&gt;**I'm a very literal person**

I wouldn't say that I am a very literal person. It takes some effort for me to communicate/verbalize what I want to say in a coherent way because my thinking is based on fleeting impressions/feelings. I often know exactly how i feel about something, but if I try to explain it to other people, it falls flat. It is easier for me to express myself in writing, because I can prepare for it in advance, but I guess the way I express my thoughts is still a bit odd. My literature teacher liked the way I write, but she said that my writings are 'odd/distinctive' (there is not really an equivalent word for it in English, but literally you could translate the word as 'of their own nature'). My mode of thinking is verbal, but i do not think in full sentences. I wrote [a post](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4lshob/do_you_think_in_words_concepts_pictures/) about it earlier on this subreddit, the relevant sentences are these: "Most of the time, my thought process is a mix between verbal and conceptual thinking. My mind is full of half-phrases that I have to focus on in order to put into words. If someone were to record my thoughts, they would be full of single words and tangents, but I attribute meaning to these words that goes beyond the words. [..]When my mind is in a free mode, I tend to think in concepts, but the sentences in my mind start to get more complex/structured when I move away from the abstract to deal with the reality: brainstorming for a work project, thinking of a reply in a fast-paced conversation, writing down my thoughts or solving a problem. So, basically: when my mind is left to wander completely freely, I think in concepts, but the more I focus, the more 'verbalized' my thoughts become."

&gt;**I can relate to the idea that information/ impressions are categorised internally. But it is not a very organised system where I can just pull information from at anytime (and it's difficult to explain what sort of information it is comprised of, but I think the words; impressions, feelings and vibes, explain it a bit)**

I kind of touched on this point in the previous paragraph, but my mind is not an organized system. I do have a very specific/detailed system of judging the morality of certain actions/behaviors that should theoretically cover most cases from the very general to the specific (I am constantly trying to improve/polish my understanding of morality and adjusting the system accordingly), but, truth be told, I do not actually refer to the system when trying to understand my views on some issue (instead, I 'feel' a certain way, although I guess that the 'feeling' internalizes my systematic understanding of morality)


&gt;**Would NEVER describe myself as someone that is afraid of change. I like new experiences (especially trying different foods).**

I would say that I am quite adventurous. I am aware of the limits between where something stops being fun and starts being dangerous, but I sometimes purposefully overstep these limits as a way of testing myself/fate/whatever.

&gt;**I am very oblivious to my environment (often clumsy too), have a horrible sense of direction and daydream a lot.**

Yes, yes and yes.

&gt;**My memory regarding small facts is horrible**

My memory is also pretty crappy. Moreover, I have a very poor understanding of the passage of time (I could not reliably tell you how much time has passed between the present and some event in the past. I often freak out when someone mentions how much time has passed since some event, until I remind myself of everything that has happened since then/try to sort out the events in the past chronologically. Then again, I can be very good at remembering small details to which I assign some emotional importance (because then I have the tendency to mull over them repeatedly in my head), and sometimes I vividly remember something that happened &gt;10 years ago and that I had long thought forgotten.

&gt;**I am not a very dedicated person and I rarely see tasks/creations to their completion because I lose inspiration/get bored (unless there's some sort of deadline or its rly rly important)**

I usually slack off and *always* procrastinate, but I can force myself to really put in effort if I set very specific tasks for myself and force myself to commit to a deadline...however, if I deviate from the plan even a little bit, it is very hard for me to find the motivation to attempt to do the thing again. Basically, I can do a lot if I break down the task in very specific sub-tasks. It kills the creativity, but gets the job done.

&gt;**the biggest thing stopping me from thinking I'm a Fi-dom is that I don't think I have any specific values [..] and I don't think I believe in anything enough to the point where someone can't change my opinion about it (I can be swayed by others opinions very easily is what I mean)**

Well, I do have some pretty strong opinions that would be hard for someone to change (not fact-based, e.g., scientific opinions, but more abstract ones, so if someone were to argue with me, they would argue against principles, not facts), but I often avoid getting into arguments about these opinions. I am kind of mad at myself for not standing up for my views more out of fear of appearing disagreeable, but I am a very conflict-avoidant person, and I have learned to recognize the situations when it is better to keep my mouth shut (as a mostly liberal person living in a conservative country, etc.)

&gt;**I do have a tendency to sort of mirror people I admire or want to be like, which I suspect is Fe. But I think that everyone should strive to be themselves instead of changing to fit in.)**

I also do that, kind of? But unconsciously. Not copying their opinions on things (although people I admire influence my understanding of the world, for sure), but subtly mirroring their gestures, mannerisms, way of speaking, etc.

&gt;**I suck at games where you need to think ahead; like chess (or is that more Ni than Te?)**

Surprisingly, given the people I have been surrounded by throughout my life, I have never learned to play chess, but I have never lost a game of checkers hah.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to address every point! I see a lot of similarities between you and me, but I am still unsure of my own INFPness. I hope you found anything of what I wrote useful :)&gt; I thought there was NO way I could be an intuitive since I don't have the ability to conjure up ideas from nothing that transcend the restraints of reality that only a select few are capable of even beginning to comprehendbl,ah blah aalfashf whatever it's meant to be idk it's so ridiculous

Well yes, it sounds ridiculous because it *is* ridiculous ;) Intuitives do not have any magical abilities,  they are not in any way better or more intelligent than sensors, they just happen to have the Ne or Ni function high in their stack.

Could you take [this test](https://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/socionics-quadra-values-test) and report the results to me? It's okay if you're not familiar with the terminology, in fact it is better if you aren't.

And there is of course the [cognitive function test](http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html): it is longer but could be useful in narrowing down your type :)Well, for what it's worth, your result corresponds to the xNTP and xSFJ types. Do you remember if any of the other results were close in score to the Alpha quadra?

And yes, please do take the second test and report back the results, as they could be quite telling :)Well, Alpha and Delta both share the Ne-Si functions, would you agree that you use Ne and Si over Ni and Se? (Remember that functions come in pairs: so don't think, e.g., 'do I use Fi?', think 'do I use Fi and Te?')

Have you read into [inferior functions](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119442161307/accurate-typing-the-inferior-function)? Some people find it easier to identify their inferior function (which manifests itself under stress) than their dominant/auxiliary function.

Also re:your other comment. When taking the cognitive function test, was it easy for you to identify which function corresponds to which question? It is better to take that test without that knowledge, because otherwise you will unconsciously choose the answers that support your preferred result, that's true. I can say that our test results are quite similar, although your Se is quite higher than mine (could be why you thought you may be ISFP), and my Ti was higher than yours.

For what it's worth, this far I have not really found anything in your post/comments that would go against the INFP typing. Just in case you want to take more tests (although it is not really necessary at this point, I think), you could look into [big five](http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/) and [enneagram](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/dotest.php). Also, the lovely /u/peppermint-kiss is typing people right now (at the moment it is the top post on the frontpage of /r/mbti, you should find it easily); she typed me as INFP ages ago, and I think I have finally settled down on the type after months of self-doubt ;)That's ESTP vs. ENTPI don't think that ENFJs are seen as flawless, at least not in this subreddit. I have seen them described as manipulative, pushy, illogical, etc.

I'd agree with you that xNTPs seem to be among the most idealized types here, though. The only criticism I have seen is presented in a sort of...'me_irl' manner, if that makes sense. Like 'we never finish projects because we just have so many ideas'! And then the rest of the xNTPs agree 'yeah, that's totally me!' I have seen it more in their respective subreddits than here, though. There is also the belief that xNTPs are almost the only types capable of being funny.

This probably sounds overly critical of the xNTP types, and it is not meant to be: all the xNTPs I have ever met are genuinely great people! I just think that each type would benefit from recognizing where their real issues could stem from (most likely Fe and Se for INTPs and Si and Fi for ENTPs). I think MBTI can be a great tool for self-awareness/'self-help' if used correctly, but too many people of all types would rather just find a community of like-minded people and categorize their flaws as unchangeable/part of who they are.Ahhh, I accidentally deleted my comment. I will try to recreate it as well as I can. 

&gt;If you are uninterested in something, do you feel like it requires effort for you to generate multiple ideas for it?

For me (and if I understood correctly, you are similar in this regard), 'creativity' is almost only possible if I am not forced to be creative. When my mind is left to wander freely, when I am joking around with my friends, dreaming about the future, thinking about some hypothetical scenario, etc. When it is *required* from me that I am creative, I actually find it off-putting and stifling. Think of it like being asked to come up with a joke: even a very funny person's mind would turn blank if put on the spot like that. Another example: at school/university, when I was asked to write, say, an opinion essay, it would even be filled with (often unnecessary) metaphors, references, etc. But if I was asked to do some task that was designed to 'increase creativity' or whatever (say, writing acrostic poems), I could do that, but that seemed like a very artificial definition of 'creativity', so I thought that the task was boring. Same with creativity tests like 'come up with as many uses for this [object] as possible'. I can do that, but it's just boring/not fun. Are you the same?

&gt;I also suck at considering all the possibilities that could go wrong or how a plan is not a good idea, unless someone mentions something, but that seems like inf-Ne's specialty

Yes, that's inf-Ne.

&gt;The only time I can generate multiple ideas constantly is when I'm really excited about something, or if something means a lot to me, and then the ideas will just flow and I'll have all of this motivation to try and implement them (but after a while that wears off).

Ha, I call this the 'ENFP mode'. When I am happy/excited, I can almost appear to be a Ne-dom. However, while this mode does not seem to be artificial at the time, I feel exhausted if it continues for an extended period of time.

&gt;Ne types were able to effortlessly generate ideas about anything and everything because that's just how their brains are?

Well. You seem to have a slightly idealized image of Ne in your head :p A good explanation of Ne I read somewhere on this subreddit was that Ne users don't just randomly 'generate' ideas from nothing: real Ne users see all the possibilities as part of their reality, with each possibility having about an equal chance of being true. Ne users don't actually see a book and think 'this is a shape-shifting alien that is hiding from intergalactic war in my bookshelf'. Or something like that, things that are commonly associated with 'randomness'. When you think 'random', you should actually look at ESxJs who have Ne in their tertiary, 'child-like' position. Ne users see a book and they see a number of possibilities surrounding that book, that's true, but they are 'realistic' possibilities, for a lack of better word, or at least *realistic to the Ne user*. [This](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4flv6d/is_this_how_the_world_looks_through_ne_eyes/) is a very good description of Ne, I think, but keep in mind that it is coming from a Ne-dom. Ne in INxPs will be quite a bit more subdued, I think especially in INFPs who are described as a 'serious' type in socionics. I think a good advice for you would be to observe INxPs: and not in their own subreddits, as types tend to exaggerate their behavior in individual subreddits, but here in /r/mbti. You will probably notice that, while ENxPs *do* usually have a playful/'bouncy' vibe, INxPs' Ne is not quite as loud and noticeable as you would think.

 &gt;The only way I can connect it to Ne, is that the amount of time it takes for me to figure it out is because I'm trying to think of all the stuff they could be trying to say until I finally realise what they're actually saying or implying, as Ne focuses on multiple possibilities first right? [..] Or is the correctness(?) irrelevant?

That actually sounds a lot like Ne! Like I said, Ne considers all possibilities to be about equally likely, and it is the task of the judging functions (Ti or Fi) to narrow down them to the most likely one. In the case of ENxPs, it will look like throwing out a lot of possibilities until one sticks as the right one; in the case of INxPs, there will probably be an idea of what the most likely possibility is, but Ne will provide multiple alternatives. And about how good you are at figuring out the 'right' answer, I think it has little to do with functions, and more to do with experience/having dealt with a lot of similar situations in the past :)

&gt;you know AmazingPhil?

I am aware of him. Isn't he a Ne dom? In that case, it would make sense why his Ne is more obvious than an INFP's Ne :)

Sorry for any mistakes, I wrote this quite rushedly. Hope you found anything of this useful :) By the way, I don't think I have asked: what age are you? :)INFP-T (what I test as on 16personalities) is actually the most popular type where I come from! Interesting! :)Sorry, I should have specified! :) Sure, in the four function model Fe will be the weakest function for IxTPs and Si will be the weakest function for ENxPs, but if socionics is your thing, the seventh (PoLR) function is generally thought to cause the most difficulties to a person. That would be Fi for ExTPs and Se for INxPs :) [Here](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4rubsm/the_tertiary_inferior_and_polr_functions_and_how/?ref=search_posts) is a good summary of the tertiary, inferior and PoLR functions :)Hmmm, I am honestly not sure. I am still leaning towards INFP, but I think the best fit for you would be auxiliary Si and tertiary Ne. Which would be ESxJ, except I don't see you as a Te or Fe dom ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

When you have some free time, could you look at these videos and see which one you relate to the most? They are all long-ish, but I think they are worth seeing.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgZsN8nh2AE INFP

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_SB6AbFyb4 ISTJ

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZJsVyJptCM ISFPHmm, ISTJ? :)

Te is pretty inarguable haha, but I narrowed it down to ISTJ simply because you sound *a lot* of my ISTJ friends, and you come across more like an INFP (FiNe) than an ISFP (FiSe). I think I have briefly considered all of my ISTJ friends/acquaintances to be INFPs at some point haha. That whole 'quiet but affectionate and sensitive when you get to know them better' thing is *very* characteristic of ISTJs, and comes across as INFPness on the surface.

What type are you? :)I would say xNFP: a reserved ENFP or an INFP with a well-developed Ne."People usually say I'm basically the definition of my type"-I'd say your description fits the stereotypes of ESFPs the most :p

But I would say ENFJ, perhaps? Fe and Se in some combination, and seemingly leading with Fe...ESTJ?You actually sound like an INFJ :) If I understand Ni at all, that is.With the added information, I am considering the xSTP and ENTJ types as possible alternatives. ISTP is the only one that is 2 letters off, so that?1. Logic/math

2. Nature

3. Language and Self (equal scores)
I looked at the responses in this thread, and here are the top strengths of some of the types (these who had enough responses to make somewhat reliable conclusions):

**INFJ:**

1) Self

2) Language

3) Logic/Math, Social and Nature

**INTP**

1) Logic/Math

2) Self

3) Music

**ENFP**

1) Social

2) Self

3) Language

**ENTP**

1) Social

2) Music

3) Logic/Math

**INFP**

1) Self

2) Nature

3) Language

**INTJ**

1) Self

2) Logic/Math

3) Language

**ISTP**

1) Logic/Math

2) Music

3) Nature

I will keep this updated!

(Some observations: everyone seems to have high intrapersonal intelligence, except for ENTPs and ISTPs. Logic and mathematics are highly valued by INTP, ISTP, INTJ, ENTP (all have thinking functions in dominant or secondary positions) and INFJ (tertiary Ti). Language skills seem to be an NF (or feeler) thing, with the exception of INTJs who also have a high linguistic intelligence. High musical intelligence has a high correlation with Ti. And social intelligence, of course, is found among the extraverted types and in INFJ (high Fe). Naturalistic intelligence is among the top3 strengths in INFPs, INFJs and ISTPs. Body/kinesthetic and spatial intelligence is not represented among any of the types. Please notice the lack of certain types in this summary, especially the under-representation of sensor types.)&gt;He

Sexist!!

(I am keeping up just fine ;))Thanks, sis!Jung: Self-improvement comes though unity; personality is manifested through wholeness; overvaluation of certain functions leads to neglection of other aspects of the personality, etc.

Certain intuitives: I have a sensation function in my stack? Let's forget about that! Anyway, back to why sensors are dumb...Maybe it's just that I have been lucky to have been surrounded by generally intelligent and likeable people through my life, but I have never met an unintelligent ESTP. Like, especially 2 ESTPs that I know irl could set the standard for a person we should all strive to be like (they are both intelligent, personable/agreeable, funny, successful, physically active, popular and generally have their shit together).

I don't actually think I could tell the difference between an ESTP and an ENTP online (except for the fact that every time someone uses the phrase 'play the devil's advocate', there is a 90% chance they think of themselves as an ENTP). In real life, the difference is obvious, though, but mostly comes down to different quadras, I think.Hmm, I see 5 INFJs who have listed math/logics as one of their top3 intelligences. 3 of them had it as their highest rated intelligence, as well :) I am counting replies to comments, too, as long as they are not repeating.Sorry for the late reply!!

Did re-watching the videos help you come to a conclusion? :) 

&gt;Can you explain what Fi is like for you?

Good question haha. It's actually quite hard for me to explain Fi: when I try to do that, it comes across more like a filter of reality (a la introverted perceiving function) than a framework of some kind (as an introverted judging should be). But [this](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4z3w4d/how_would_you_describe_fi/) thread does a pretty good job of explaining it, I think :)

If you are not completely bored by this whole thing yet: could you look at [this](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/information_elements) socionics description of each function in their position? And write down which descriptions you relate to? (That is, read the description of each function in various positions and write down which parts of the text you relate to like this: Ti: Suggestive and Ignoring function, Ne: suggestive and mobilizing function, etc.)? Again, it is okay if you don't understand some/any of the socionics terminology: in fact, it is better if you don't.I type you as a Te user ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&gt; I will spend all day (or several days) rearranging something in my office at work because I'm determined to actually be organized. Within a week I'm back to where I was, perhaps a little bit more organized. 

Ah, so that's the difference between ENFPs and INFPs. My random bursts of energy never last a whole week :P&gt;Wait....*I'm drowning?* **WHEN DID I EVEN JUMP IN THIS POOL?!**

Good to know that I am not the only one who often finds myself is situations/places I don't remember going to :DSuch a great comment :)

I definitely went through the first (unhealthy) stage in my teenage years, but I am gradually working towards self-improvement. Comments like these, and this subreddit in general definitely help! :)&gt;INFP - Like to spend their time in "their world", because the outside world is too insensitive. Can successfully do nothing all day long. Will cry if a dog dies in a movie. Are emphatic towards rocks and other inanimate objects, but savagely murder insects without a second thought.

I never murder insects, but the rest is 100% accurate.

Shall we play the 'guess OP's type' game?&gt;INTP


 &gt;Not participating in groups where there is free exchange of positive emotional expression.

How very un-alpha of you :pPsychopathic: what INTPs and INTJs wish they could be like, and what only xSTPs actually are :D

&gt;if the OP was accepted and seen as a false mockery rather than the reality :(

Should all the responses be prefaced by 'I am aware that this is a satirical/purposefully offensive description of types based on OP's interactions with a limited number of dubiously typed individuals, but in that light here is my opinion on the post'? (;I am conflicted. On one hand, I have participated in a mosquito killing contest and have eaten a few ants on a dare. On the other hand, I decided that I probably shouldn't kill mosquitos a few years ago, and I still keep by that principle :DI just don't kill them, I still chase them off. I live in a relatively cold country, though: maybe mosquitos are more of a problem elsewhere? They're just a minor nuisance 2-3 months a year where I live. And I don't think that the amount of mosquito bites differs between me and other people who do kill them.

Honestly, it was just one of these principles that I come up with on a whim from time to time and decide to stick with them for no reason.I hope you will figure out your type :) I think the best thing to do is to get away from MBTI for a while and just observe your thought patterns without trying to ascribe them to certain functions. And then try to type yourself in retrospect. And I would not throw away the INFP possibility yet!
 
By the way, [here](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4gueyh/can_you_tell_the_difference_between_infjs_isfjs/?ref=search_posts) is a discussion on the differences between the IxFx types: since you have considered the INFP, ISFJ and ISFP types :)Seems like the tool is very NT-leaning (based on the responses here and my own results). I decided to test some of my Reddit comments, and got three different NT results: INTJ, ENTJ and INTP. The only INFP score I received was for a (well-structured and impartial, I thought :o) conclusion part of a data-based university paper. And I asked my very-obviously-ENFP friend if I could test a fragment from her blog (and she writes using a lot of metaphors and exclamation marks, and she describes her emotions in great detail), and the site typed her as an INTJ.

The accuracy: dubious.(The thread is full of joke comments, but I decided to actually answer seriously)

There isn't any type that I have had overwhelmingly bad experiences with, ISTPs included. The ones that I know are self-sufficient/independent enough to not care about gaining attention by acting out or being assholes. They just seem content to do their own thing, and that's actually quite appealing to other people, usually. That said, sometimes the inferior Fe is obvious in the way they don't really care about stating their opinion in a way that does not offend other people (and I am sure that many of them don't really see the ability to state something in an inoffensive manner as a *positive quality*;  they might even take pride in being purposefully offensive). These ISTPs can come across as crass and uncaring. But mature ISTPs (just like any other type that does not neglect functions past their auxiliary) tend to be really well-rounded people, 'the best of both worlds': independent but aware of social norms, nice without being insincere, etc.

By the way, I sometimes see your comments on this subreddit, and I might notice a healthy amount of Fe (perhaps more than expected from IxTP types) and briefly wonder about it until I remember that there are some well-rounded individuals that have managed to develop their inferior function to a level where it is not a nuisance but actually useful and pleasant to oneself and others lol...ISTJs and INTPs.The INTPs I know usually have a lot of feelings that they don't quite know how to deal with. It's [adorable! :D](https://postimg.org/image/nm85qs9ov/)Get it all out, buddy! :DImagine the confusion they must have felt!

'*All* of these comments consider thinker types to be the most sensitive ones? Not even a *single* feeler? Cmon folks!'There was a similar thread about a week ago, and I looked at the responses to find the top3 strenghts of each type. These were the results:

**INFJ:**

1) Self

2) Language

3) Logic/Math, Social and Nature

**INTP:**

1) Logic/Math

2) Self

3) Music

**ENFP:**

1) Social

2) Self

3) Language

**ENTP:**

1) Social

2) Music

3) Logic/Math

**INFP:**

1) Self

2) Nature

3) Language

**INTJ:**

1) Self

2) Logic/Math

3) Language

**ISTP:**

1) Logic/Math

2) Music

3) Nature

---

If I include the responses from this thread, as well, there are a few slight changes:

**ISTP:**

1) Logic/Math and Music

2) Nature

3) Body

**INFP:**

1) Self

2) Language

3) Music

**INTP:**

1) Logic/Math and Self

2) Music

3) Visual/SpatialHey, it's me again! Sorry for the late reply, but I think you could actually an ESFJ, based on this thread. I see a lot of Fe and Si, idealization of Ne (that I also saw in your previous thread), some signs of inferior Ti. You could also be ISFJ: again, I am relatively certain of the Ne-Si axis, your Fe is strong, and it's likely that you have PoLR Te. Can you read [this](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/ESE-ESFj/) and [this](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/SEI-ISFp/) and tell me which description you relate to more?Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I saw a lot of Fe in your  post, but on second thought it's probably not your dominant function, so ISFJ is the more likely option.

(The first link corresponds to the ESFJ type, and the second link: to the ISFJ type)

PoLR (also called vulnerable) function, to simplify it quite a lot, is the function that you are the least confident about, and that you have the most difficulty using. Which one is it for you? (And please try to figure out the answer before you read the rest of the comment where I explain *which* function is the PoLR function for each type, because I don't want you to be unconsciously influenced by that)

PoLR function is the function with the opposite attitude of your tertiary function. For instance, ISFJ's tertiary function is Ti, so their PoLR function is Te. For ESFJs, the PoLR function is Ni. For INFPs: Se. For ISFPs: Ne. Etc.

Maybe you could try taking [this](http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/socionics/84404-accurate-socionics-test.html) test? Again, don't look at the answer key before you count up the results ;) It's like a cognitive function test, but a little bit more accurate, I think, because the questions are a little less obviously about certain functions.These are quite peculiar results hah. The only thing I am relatively certain about is that you are a feeler type ;) And I am pretty sure that you use Ne-Si: the only Ni-Se type I could see you as is ISFP.

If that helps any, I also only 'get' Ni on a theoretical level and it is also very strange to me.

And God, I don't even know what I should ask you next haha. There is a group of people that type others based on video/audio recordings, if that is your thing.

Also: ignore all that you have read about intuitives being smarter, Ne types being tireless idea generators, Si users being boring rule followers, etc., and ignore the voice that tells you 'I am not interesting/smart/curious enough to be an intuitive'. Which is the type that just feels like the best fit, despite all of this?This didn't come across as aggressive at all, don't worry! :) And the last thing I am trying to do is to force my opinion of your type on you: if INFP is the type you see yourself as, that's the one you probably are! The most I can do is to give you some pointers or link you to tests/articles that could help you in self-typing, the final decision must be your own :)

But the reason why I was kind of cautious to type you as INFP wasn't because of your strong Fe (most INFPs can utilize their Fe quite well, just as INTPs are usually adept at using Te, etc.): it was because it seems that you seem to *perceive* the world before you *judge* it: it is actually more apparent in this thread than your previous one. But I might be wrong: how accurate do you think is this assessment? Is everything you do preceded by a judgement of the 'value' of the action? Are you able to not listen to your inner voice? And are you capble of acting completely spontaneously?Sorry again for the late reply, I took a break from the Internet for a while!

And sorry that I wasn't clear in what I said (rereading my comment, I see where the confusion could stem from)

&gt;Are you saying INFPs judge before they perceive? (How will you know what you're judging then? o_o Or am I misunderstanding what this means?)

Of course you are right. It is not possible to judge something before it has been perceived; my choice of wording was wrong. What I meant was that, *in my experience*, perceiving function doms are much more comfortable with *just* perceiving the world without judging it, categorizing everything, deciding 'how they feel' or 'what they think' about something, etc. And again, I perhaps used the wrong wording: it's not that judging doms are *less comfortable* with 'perceiving without judging', it's that it is *impossible* for them to 'just' soak up what's happening around them without fitting that into a certain framework, classifying, arranging, breaking down, and so on. That's why I asked you about spontaneity! I can pretend to be spontaneous, but that is really just an act. I can ran into cold water on an early spring day in a seemingly spontaneous way, but in actuality that will *necessarily* be preceded by an assessment of the situation from all angles. Meanwhile, I talked to an ESTP on this site and they said that they are capable of completely spontaneous actions: they decide to jump into a pool, and they just do it, and reflect on that later.

Keep in mind that I was mostly thinking about the extraverted perceiving functions when writing the previous paragraph. Introverted perceiving functions are more abstract than the extraverted ones. Yes, I think that to some level at least, Si is more abstract than Ne: Si is a filter of reality that is very subjective to its user; Ne is multiple interpretations that diverge from actuality.

Also, since you still seem to be deciding between INFP and ISFJ: I think Fe and Te users (xxxJs) are always striving to have their ideas actualized in reality, Fi and Ti users (xxxPs) are meanwhile very okay with ideas for their own sake.

And again: I don't even really have a clear idea of your type in my head. Everything I say is meant to be a guide that you can use in self-typing (I still believe that only the person themselves can make the final decision on their type) :)28/36

I remember taking the test a while ago and getting a dramatically low result, so at least my social intelligence is increasing!

I think I do much better at recognizing emotions irl, though; in the test the emotion I *thought* the people were feeling was often not among the four options. Plus, I thought that half of the women looked interested or flirtatious (what does it say about me? :D)Mia Wasikowska (above average on openness, agreeableness and neuroticism, below average on conscientiousness and extroversion).

Cool!&gt;Think about your inferior function. INFP's often mistype themselves as INTP's because they feel like they're more logical then other INFPs

To be honest, I don't understand why this is so often repeated as a fact. Do a lot of INTP mistype themselves as feelers because of their inferior Fe?Some of the stock photos cracked me up :)

About the comments on the albums: I don't think they are mean-spirited MBTI enthusiasts, rather just confused imgur users (I might be wrong, but I think that everything that gets posted on imgur to be linked on Reddit can also be seen by the imgur community: see [this part of imgur which has no idea that Reddit exists ;)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IgnorantImgur/))

And I really liked some of the images in the INFP folder! That forest seems like a great place to get lost in :)So F-T mistyping is extremely one-sided because of a fundamental misunderstanding of what 'feeling' and 'thinking' means in the context of MBTI? Can't say that I am surprised, no :)

&gt;Ne quips, playful attitude and **respect of social settings**

hm&gt; They're kind of the same "loser nerd" stereotype as INTP

Hey now! :-{{It's pretty easy, actually. When talking with people online (and this is not just limited to IxFJs, it applies to all types), you will be separated from them by a screen. In IRL, the IxFJs will usually be standing 0.25-2 metres from you, depending on the situation. You will observe more differences among types here: IxTJs are comfortable with talking to you from the other side of the room, while ExTPs will often be found in the 0.0-0.25m territory (known by other people as 'personal space'). In in real life, you can see people, hear them, smell them, even touch them (only with permission!); doing the aforementioned things online proves to be hard to impossible. 

You will figure it out eventually :)I don't really see you as an INTP functionally. I mean, you kind of fit the vibe of an INTP more than the other types, but functionally I see you as an 1)ENTP (most likely) or ISFJ (less likely).

I know that these are two seemingly quite different types, but here's why I think you are one of them:

1) I just don't see how you could be a Fi-Te type. Ti-Fe seems quite obvious

2) It's also fairly clear to me that you're one of the Ne-Si types

3) You fit in the Alpha quadra very well. Usually, the quadra descriptions favor one intra/extraverted pair more than the other: Alpha quadra seems to describe xNTPs more than xSFJs, Gamma quadra focuses on xNTJs over xSFPs etc. Your use of the judging function seems well-balanced, and that's why I am more sure that you belong to the Alpha quadra than I am about your dominant/auxiliary functions.

4) From this also follows why I think you are an ISFJ or an ENTP (and not an INTP or ESFJ): your Fe does not overpower your Ti, and your Ti does not operate at the expense of Fe. You have given me no reason to think that your Ti is weaker than your Fe, that's why I am leaning towards ENTP, but Ti auxiliary-Fe tertiary seems like the more likely option than Ti dominant-Fe inferior.

Also, I think I started to doubt your INTP typing a few weeks ago. INTP seemed like as good a type as any for you before that but I noticed that you started over-emphasizing your Ti in your comments. Specifically writing out 'this is what Ti feels like to me', 'this is my description of Ti', 'I agree with this as a Ti user' etc. (paraphrasing, of course. You probably wouldn't say 'Ti *feels like* this to me hah). And I haven't read all of your comments so maybe I am taking a few of them out of context and basing my conclusion on that but...people usually aren't this aware of their dominant function, to the point where they are capable of analyzing the mechanics of its use. In my experience at least, when people try to describe their dominant function, it's full of uncertainty (think: 'am I really describing the use of this function, or is that how everyone thinks?') Using the dominant function is supposedly so effortless for people that I am actually kind of suspicious of the typing accuracy of everyone that is able to describe it detachedly hah. Meanwhile, ExTPs *love* their Ti. Everone probably likes their auxiliary function. It's in that nice position where it is pleasant to use *and* you are aware of its use (and likely to dedicate posts/comments to it), the attitude towards the dominant function tends to be more indifferent. ENTP is a type I would definitely consider.

**TL;DR:** ENTP. Or ISFJ, I guess.If you want to, you can disregard the socionics, Ne-Si and even the dominant function part; the part of my comment that I am the most convinced about is that Ti and Fe falls in some order (that I am betting on being Ti-Fe, not Fe-Ti) in the *secondary-tertiary* positions.

By the way, I am not sure how to feel about the other comments in the thread (the idea that ISFJs 'put on an intellectual front'). That 'reeks' of a presupposition that ISFJs/Fe in general is less capable of intellectual interests and needs to 'compensate' for something. Eh. Please be aware of the fact that me suggesting the ENTP and ISFJ types is not a form of Jungian elitism :p

Good luck with finding your type! :) And if you settle down on the INTP type after all, feel free to disregard *everything* I have written because I am a firm believer of the idea that each person has the final say in their type. One question, though (because it could reveal some interesting information): if you are the most comfortable with the INTP type despite what other people have typed you as in the past, what motivated you to create this thread?I just read the other comments in the thread. The arguments for you using Ni are very convincing, I must say. The thing is, I don't see you as a Te dominant type (ENTJ), and you do seem to be a thinking type. What about INTJ? I still see more Ti than Te in you, but Ti is supposedly the second strongest function in INTJs if you subscribe to socionics.

Which you don't! And that's okay, but I liked the idea you mentioned elsewhere of  your first two functions being Ni and Ti. ENTP seems like the best fit for you under the most commonly accepted function system (IEIE or EIEI), but NiTi or TiNi describes you well: maybe even in a more complete way than NeTi or TiNe.

&gt; You might remember that we actually discussed this at one point, but I mostly hang out with the STEM sorts of people and mostly with males since they predominate in those fields

Yeah I do! I was talking with a female friend of mine (an INTP) a while ago and we started discussing a very similar topic. I remembered our conversation while talking to her.

&gt;I lack information about where my personality, habits, and tendencies lie in an absolute sense.

I understand (well, Reddit, and this sub in particular, also probably attracts more of a certain type, but that is inevitable in any community). FWIW, you seem more 'N' and more 'T' than the average person I encounter in daily life. From the people I have had the chance to get to know better (but this will probably be subject to selection bias as well), you are about as 'intuitive', slightly more of a 'thinker' than the average, and actually slightly more extraverted (this can be hard to tell over the Internet).&gt;I'm still amazed that this (and Fe, apparently) is something so many people see. 

Well, you seem to be more extraverted than my friends not the general public, and my friends (though with some very notable exceptions) tend to be introverted. Just so you know what you're being compared against: if I had to 'average out' the types of my friends (going by letters not functions here), the resulting person would probably be an INFP or an INTP, even though I don't even think there is an INFP in my friend group. What about you, what types do you usually encounter in your daily life?

And NiTi does seem like a good fit, although I am of the opinion that every person extraverts something. I don't think it is Fe for you, though: perhaps Ne? Or Te?That comment is very, very, very reminiscent of what my ENTJ friend is like. Very Te+Ni. She studied in a completely different field from you, but she has an insatiable need for knowledge. I find conversations with her to be intellectually stimulating, and I might disagree with her *interpretation* on some subjects, but I often feel intimidated by the sheer *amount* of knowledge she has. And she is not a 'jack of all trades' type of person, either: I think she strives for a *complete* understanding of the world/'God's view', just like you. (That's why I think she is an ENTJ, not an ENTP, for example: she gathers information from a large number of external sources to create a *single* interpretation of the universe. Her ideas of 'what the world is like' change quite often, in fact, but they all have one underlying theme, and the changes are all really just adjustments of the main idea)

Did I misinterpret your comment, or can you relate to what I wrote? I thought that you definitely used Ti and Ne because it seemed like you were comfortable just entertaining ideas for their own sake, without any concrete purpose. But the comment you linked makes it seem like there is a reason why you feel the need to accumulate knowledge, and there is even an ultimate goal that you are hoping to achieve (I think you may object against this, so I want to clarify: when I say a 'goal', it does not necessarily mean a practically applicable, specific one like 'advance in my career field'. It can be a bigger, overarching ambition, like the 'God's view' you mentioned. Perhaps 'purpose' or 'objective' is a better word)

I guess your answer to this question could be quite telling: Do you have any interest in subjects that others (or even you yourself) may regard as *trivial*? That is very subjective, of course, but let's define 'trivial' topics as ones that do not help you in furthering your understanding of the world (or whatever you define as your main purpose in life). Let's suppose that you don't have any interest in Avril Lavigne (the teen pop singer who was popular in 2000s) and you don't think that her songs are particularly meaningful but you stumble across an article describing a conspiracy theory about her death and how her record label replaced her with a surgically altered lookalike. There is just enough information that you don't immediately disregard the article as complete bullshit, and there are several links at the bottom of the article to forums discussing the same conspiracy. How likely is it that this would capture your interest and you would spend a non-negligible amount of time investing the theory?

If conspiracy theories about teen pop stars are immediately off-putting to you, feel free to discuss any other example of a 'trivial' interest. What's something that is completely unrelated to your main area of interest that you could spend hours researching? Could you hold your ground in a conversation about, say, literature or theater? (These are not trivial interests in my view, but they seem to be far removed from your main area of interest) Have you ever spent several days reading all you could find about some niche subject that is not related to science?I did not want to imply that your interests are not diverse at all! They just seem united by a similar theme (vaguely: learning about the world from a mechanical perspective). Saying that STEM subjects are all the same or that your interests are extremely specialized would be like saying that law and linguistics are basically the same thing because they are both humanities subjects. Your interests are very diverse, but they can be tied together under one theme. Meanwhile, I think I use Ne, and while the majority of my interests center around the field of humanities, I have taken a more or less deep interest into all fields of science. But my understanding of science is very incomplete: I have read some articles about one subject, watched several videos on another topic, listened to discussions about something else, but I don't have a clear understanding of how the world functions mechanically beyond what I learned in high school science.

I really think you use Ni now. And am relatively certain about Te. These parts especially:

"I'll skim many sources on one subject so that I can weave together a personal synthetic picture or story of the subject and how it relates to my worldview. The picture can change, sometimes dramatically, but I try to make it all coherent. I accumulate knowledge about my picture of the world because I feel like I have to. Not for, like, a concrete goal, but because I feel that it's very important that I do so. I don't know why I have this need. I ignore most things that are irrelevant to it."

"But I guess I'm a bit of a one-track-mind... whatever I'm trying to accomplish at this point is what my interest is."

"I guess... really reflecting on it... I don't really look into much that isn't building my worldview or somehow technically useful."

seem very Te and Ni (though you seem to describe the 'everything towards a single vision' approach in a somewhat negative way. I don't think it is a bad thing at all!) So I guess I have changed my opinion completely since my original comment (when I guessed ENTP). What do you think yourself at this point?&gt;I'm utterly unable to engage with them because I just don't know or care to know about those things

Have you considered that perhaps you are putting unnecessary constraints on your interactions with other people because of some thing that is so unimportant it's almost irrelevant?

People with completely different interests are capable of being friends :p Common interests is a beginner level conversation topic. (Here I mean things like favorite movies, songs, books etc--not broader topics like science, literature, philosophy and other things that can actually be discussed) They are a way to begin a conversation, but nobody actually talks about movies/books that both conversation partners have already watched/seen unless there is a complete drought of other conversation topics.

And believe me, I should know: I spent most of my childhood reading books and so I have never seen Harry Potter, or played Pokémon, or watched most of the things that are considered the 90s childhood classics. I have still never once played a video game. That alone probably reduces the potential intro level conversation topics with people my age by half. And I have still managed to make friends with people with different interests, and now am much more open to various modern media that I used to look down on. Plus, people love acting offended when I tell them that I haven't seen their favorite childhood movie, and that's a great reason to meet up and do something together.

The only *real* requirement to establishing friendships with people is being a nice person, and you have that figured out :) Being interesting is a plus

&gt;TeFi has always felt like it was off my radar.

Embrace the Fi!!

Talking about that: I don't remember you having discussed Fi at all. Does it figure in your life at all?

&gt;I'm a lot more nerdier, neurotic, squishy, and nicer than the Stalin-istic stereotype. :P

Stalin was an ISTP anyway :p xNTJs can definitely be neurotic...Nerdy and squishy are probably words I would associate with INTPs more so than INTJs, though :D


This may be a very 'treat the symptoms and not the causes' type of solution, but if you visit any other subreddits apart from /r/mbti, you could subscribe to some subreddits that are relevant to the interests of your university mates. If they often discuss recently released movies/music for example, you could subscribe to /r/music and /r/movies. Thus, for just 15s extra of your time each day (if you only read the titles) you could gain an insight about what your 'fellow kids' are interested in.

But I really don't think this is necessary. The thing is, though: your university mates have all chosen the same study field as you, supposedly voluntarily, and have kept enough interest in the area to not have dropped out yet. There are very few circumstances in life in which you could find yourself surrounded by more people who share the same interests and goals with you. I do think that you are an interesting person (we have had several lengthy conversations about a subject that is not related to the 'STEM box', after all) but even if you really feel that you are unable to think of a conversation topic that is not directly related to your interests, the university environment is perfect for finding people that would be interested in what you have to say (unless you really think that their choice of university was motivated by completely different reasons, like perceived prestige, or desire for money).

About Fi: yeah, I also don't see any of it in you. Not even as an inferior function because that function is still present in a person's life, just usually undervalued or even consciously pushed aside if it stands in the way of the dominant function. But in your case, you just don't seem to consider things from a Fi perspective (at the same time without viewing Fi with hostility like ExTPs might do).

By the way, have you read what Jung wrote about the 'pure types'? That could potentially be very interesting to you.Hey!

I saw your comment in another thread, and you wrote that you have settled down on the ISFJ type. I just wanted to congratulate you on having made a type decision that you are comfortable with: I know that for many people, it is a much longer process :) (even if it felt like it took you *forever* to find your type haha)I really enjoy our conversations, too. I appreciate hearing your perspective on things we discuss: you have an unconventional way of seeing many things, and I often find what you say interesting/thought-provoking. 

&gt;I honestly do think that if we knew each other in-person we'd actually be really great friends

Yeah, for sure! Only if the fact that I am of the female gender did not deter you, of course! :D Do you want to move to private messages perhaps? Remaining in this thread does not bother me--after all, at this point no-one else is probably reading this thread, as you said--but private messaging will probably be the more convenient path if we want to continue the conversation :)

&gt; So the "college" phase of my life is basically over and I'm about to enter the real world. Granted, I'll be at work around other STEM people, so perhaps my situation won't really change. But it's a world of possibility now.

It seems like you are right on the path to success. People around me seem to be unable to decide on what they want to do with their life--and at this age, it is only normal--but it is great to see that you know what you want and are doing what you like. And I am sure that your workplace will appreciate someone with your level of knowledge and passion about the field, as well.

&gt;While at its worst it can be completely closed off to external input, at its best it's what really takes an interest in people being naturally themselves.

I think this can be said of all introverted functions. The focus of Ti, for example, will be different, but the principle holds the same.

About Fe: I don't think that it's fair to assume that just because you are warm to people and have a social filter that you must necessarily use Fe. I still think that it is more likely that you use Fe than Fi but every adjusted person has a social filter, and Fi users can definitely be warm people (some ENTJs I know even more so than Fi-dominants).

About 'pure types': I read Jung in my native language, so I might have confused some terminology. Skimming through the English version of 'Psychological Types', Jung does discuss pure types but in a different context. In the current meaning of 'types with both extraverted or both introverted dominant/auxiliary functions' the phrase 'pure types' has only been used by a few  Jungian typologists; I will have to reread the book to be more precise. [Here](http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/jthirdprinc.html#TWO) is one source discussing pure types as commonly understood now, [here](https://books.google.lv/books?id=yb_Vwmf1G6QC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=jung+pure+types&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dJfUOaLo7f&amp;sig=tOCk4KwZ95twE1k5LNfqFxygWQY&amp;hl=lv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizspuo9ZHPAhVD2ywKHREjBY44ChDoAQhUMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20pure%20types&amp;f=false) is another one. I do think that the second souce is overly negative regarding the pure type, but I also think that an extraverted function is necessary for a balanced person (discounting the theories that Jung himself was a pure type). 

&gt;I want those things so badly to be the day-to-day world we live in, so with rapid progress so familiar that it's not questioned.

This is very, very interesting to me. One question: is it necessary that *you* experience this progress for your wish to be fulfilled? Would you be satisfied if science advanced to the point where everything you described was available to the future generation: but you would not get to experience it?

By the way (and I'll be honest at the risk of being seen as a terrorist), a 'sterile' and 'efficient' world seems unpleasant to me at a gut feeling level...although rationally I understand that people would adapt to the new world order without losing their sense of self. I guess that is the difference between Fi and Ti/Te hah. Don't get me wrong, I am very supportive of technological/scientific advancement in all forms, and I also support the use of embryos for stem cell research/the use of nuclear energy but I am the opposite to you because reaction to the ethical implication of certain actions is what naturally comes first to me...rationalization of the practicality of the action comes afterwards.

But I really, really do find what you wrote interesting. It's fascinating. I like that your vision seems grandiose in its aspirations, like something from a far-away future, but with how rapidly we are advancing as a society it is something we might actually experience in our lifetimes. And I like it that your vision does not have an end, i.e., you are not striving for something constant, but instead continuous progress is *part* of your vision. Thank you for telling me your motivations, I really do hold the fact that you wrote this comment in high regard :)You are right, my observation of /u/MetricExpansion's relative extroversion *is* inconsistent with the suggestion of the NiTi type (my assessment of his type is constantly changing, and I think I am too easily swayed by the opinion of people who are more knowledgeable than me). I am just not sure which statement I am more willing to give up.

You commented that you think he is an INTP: do you still stand by that belief? I was convinced of his xNTPness, but a few comments in this thread (posted by him or other people) seem very indicative of Te and Ni to me. Despite the obvious differences between the types, would INTJ (ENTJ?) be something you would ever consider for his type?Obliger.

I am the sheeple.Almost everyone's saying ENFP. I love my ENFP friends dearly, but my first thought was ENTJ, or maybe ENFJ.Socionics is the practically applicable supplement (can I say supplement? maybe alternative?) to MBTI/Jungian theory. Why don't you like it?

Maybe the different attitude towards Socionics can be explained by cultural differences... but a lot of it has been extremely accurate, in my experience.&gt;I don't really mind staying in this thread. It's basically as good as a PM as far as I'm concerned since we're waaay past the thread limit.

Sure, that's alright with me! Though it limits our conversation to 6 months haha. But, seeing how this thread is already nearing 100 replies, this could very realistically become the most popular typing thread in /r/mbti history (what's the record?)

&gt;I think it's a good start. But I realize it's a stepping stone and that to really do what I want I'm going to have to extend past it

Best of luck with that :) Everything you have told me this far seems to indicate that you are capable of achieving whatever it is that you set your mind on.

&gt; I think people here take the system very literally and they're unwilling to think outside the box as to alternative or more free models. They're operating within a very strict calculus of functions.

I was just thinking that. Obviously, there is only that far that we can move away from the original theory and still call it MBTI, but Jung/Myers and Briggs obviously based their theory on observation of real people at least in some part. But they met a limited number of people in their life, and their descriptions, while sufficiently objective, are still inevitably influenced by the people they have met (yes, Jung describes functions not specific people but these descriptions are still ultimately really condensed descriptions of the impressions people of each type he had met left on him). Meanwhile, we have several Internet communities for MBTI enthusiasts with thousands of participants each, and every one of them has interacted with hundreds of people. Yes, each individual person has an understanding of MBTI that is heavily filtered through their experiences with people in their lives, but if we treat these thousands of people, and their interactions with other people as data points, and certain trends emerge time and time again, I don't think we should reject these observations just because they do not fit with the original theory. Instead, we should perhaps expand the theory to accommodate these observations

&gt;I can sometimes feel like I was born a little too early.

If that's any solace, think about it this way: if you would like to live in a maximally advanced world technologically/scientifically, but your ideal world is also in continuous progress, you would feel like you were born too early no matter when you had been born. If you had been born a few decades earlier, the world as it is now would be much closer to the ideal world than it would have been at your birth, and a few decades from now the world will be much closer your imagined ideal world than it is now.

&gt;I think that people would finally be able to live the lives they want [..]

That does sound nice, although I don't see how a few primitivists choosing to 'go their own way' stands in the way of this goal. Have there been any significant/effective attempts by this group to stop scientific advancement?

&gt;That's funny. My process is exactly the reverse of that.

That's the point! :D (although I am not sure if that points to Ti or Te)
 
&gt;I wonder if we're trying to fit a square peg in a round hole!

At this point, I am not sure of anything in regards to your functions. You do seem like a NT type, though. 

Hey! Now you can make a thread about how 'I don't know my type but I am definitely N and T'. People love those! :DThat's a good point, but I don't want to abandon socionics so I'll try to refute it :,(

What if the specific details necessarily arise from the generalities? This way, the system could still describe (nearly) 100% of people while still keeping the specifics. If, for example, we suppose that the Jungian system *can* describe how tertiary Si acts like in interaction with auxiliary Ne (and we imagine Ne-Si like a scale where a stronger use of Ne necessitates a weaker use of Si), maybe Socionics supposes that Si and Se is on a different scale, where a person's weak use of Si predicts a behavior of similar strength (i.e., weak) but differing attitude. Thus describing the PolR function.

(So: if we can describe a person's use of Ne, we can also describe the use of their Se even though they're not on the same axis because how Se acts is directly based on how Ne acts)

Does that make sense?

**Edit:** Or with numbers: let's reduce the MBTI/Socionics theories to 'how strong are my functions' for simplicity's sake. Obviously MBTI/Socionics will also describe other things, but we are using a simplified model here. Let's suppose that MBTI told us that the 'strength' of 2nd+3rd function must add up to a certain number, say 50 [unspecidied units]. Let's say that the strength of person's X Ne is 40 units, and so the strength of their Si must be 10 units. MBTI will stop here and say 'Si and Se are on a different axis, we can't predict the use of a person's Se based on how strong their Si is' (or will reject the idea of a person having Si *and* Se completely). Meanwhile Socionics says 'if a person's tertiary function is x units strong, then it follows that their PoLR function is -x units strong'. Or maybe they use a different formula. And you might disagree that this is the way how a person's use of Ne (and Si) impacts their use of Se. But the point is, under their system, there is a way to describe shadow functions that arises from the person's use of their first four functions.Damn, that's a lot of requirements. Mine are:

* Be at least somewhat nice and interesting

That's it. I am willing to listen to people's crazy, factually inaccurate conspiracy theories for hours if they're interesting enough and the person is otherwise a pleasant conversation mate.Oh, sorry, I interpreted [this](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/52aa2p/its_finally_time_type_umetricexpansion/d7j8b7u) comment as you saying that /u/MetricExpansion is an INTP.

Anyway: what makes you think his Fe is stronger than his thinking function? Skimming through the thread (please let me know if I passed over something important), there is one convincing piece of evidence that makes me consider that he may be IxFJ (namely, this quote "It censors, from my speech and actions, my cold inner monologue and what I really think, preventing me from acting rationally and in my best interests") It does sound like Fe, and admittedly even like Fe overriding Ti. But it is one comment versus a thread with ~100 comments where people are digging up his comments/threads from several months in the past. If he is putting up a front, he is doing that very convincingly.

I just don't see a lot of feeling judgement, that's all. Here is one description of extraverted feeling: can you point out instances of it in any comments or threads, apart from the one already quoted?

"[The nature of extraverted feeling] has freed itself as fully as possible from the subjective factor, and has, instead, become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object. Even where it seems to show a certain independence of the quality of the concrete object, it is none the less under the spell of traditional or generally valid standards of some sort. I may feel constrained, for instance, to use the predicate 'beautiful' or 'good', not because I find the object 'beautiful' or 'good' from my own subjective feeling, but because it is fitting and politic so to do; and fitting it certainly is, inasmuch as a contrary opinion would disturb the general feeling situation. A feeling-judgment such as this is in no way a simulation or a lie -- it is merely an act of accommodation."

I could find examples to the contrary, actually, e.g., [this comment](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/52aa2p/its_finally_time_type_umetricexpansion/d7lm8m2): feeling alienated from university mates because of a lack of common interests. Namely, this part: "Even the "geeks" around me can connect with each other and other people over this stuff... I can't. [..] I have a very hard time engaging with most of them because of this." And, following that: "I try not to make it a constraint, but all too often I find myself at a loss for what to say. I find myself really having to think very hard when I meet those people. I'm literally sitting there thinking "WTF DO I SAY?" ... it's tiring. Those topics tend to be the biggest problem when I'm in a group, because guess what, that's what they talk to each other about and I'm sitting there like "wut say?" :/"

This does not sound like a [feeling judgement] that is free from the subjective factor and "has, instead, become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object" and is "under the spell of traditional or generally valid standards of some sort." The fact that he keeps quiet is nothing more than a social filter--and as I said before, I do not think that having a social filter and being warm to people necessarily equates having Fe.

(Yes, this is a very literal interpretation of extraverted feeling, but it comes from the original Jung text. If you want to argue for IxFJ, I'd like to hear your definition of Fe, and then I will consider it)&gt;I'm not sure that I should admit this, but I took steps before and during this life of this thread to make sure I got a good response.

Tell me about it (stud)! What did you do to guarantee the response? I have created some 'type me' threads but kind of lazily/without putting much thought into them, and the essence of the comments in these threads was 'oh, you think you are an INFP? Yeah, I guess you are one'. I wanted someone to provide convincing evidence that I am an ISTP, damn it. *That* would be interesting, and through trying to prove that I am not actually an ISTP I could become more convinced of my own typing.

&gt;Yeah, I think it's important for people to realize that this is a model. It's not gospel.

Yup, and there are actually very few people on here that keep to one model only. There was [a thread](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/50dg6f/overview_of_popular_function_models/?ref=search_posts) posted on here recently discussing the different function models: if the psychology type 'purists' want to keep to the original Jung text only, there is barely any discussion of the function stack at all: auxiliary functions are discussed, but it is not clear whether or not an introverted function can follow another introverted function or not (Jung only clarified that the auxiliary function of a judging dominant type cannot be another judging function, and the same with perceiving functions)

&gt;There's a part of me that just wants to see them try to live their lifestyle and fail

There are probably a few people who have managed to leave the modern civilization behind, but yeah... they are likely not the ones bemoaning scientific advancement on the Internet.

**Edit:** By the way, it seems like this thread is *still* gaining attention from people and getting replies that are not mine. Truly legendary!&gt;I think I understand you... you can understand an INTP's use of Se by looking at through Si's relationship to Ne. Se has a covariance with Si, which is repressed by Ne.

Yes, this is exactly what I meant. Or at least: 'Socionics claims that one can understand an INTP's use of Se...' I am not making any judgements about the accuracy of Socionics (well, I did say that I have found a lot of what Socionics has written extremely accurate, but that's personal): I am simply suggesting that maybe it is possible to create a new, more specific system from an already existing, inclusive one without sacrificing this inclusivism.

&gt;The problem with Socionics is, for example, labeling an INTP's Te as the "critic" function or their "Se" as the PoLR. You're giving them very specific roles. Just saying that Se is "weak" is something that has room for interpretation and allows for some generality.

[..]

&gt; I guess one way of describing the difference is that you're taking a quantitative difference in function strength and mapping it to a qualitative difference in how that function behaves (a "role").

Well, I did say that mine was a simplified model and I was only using function 'strength' as an example. I think it is possible that the same principle applies if we use qualitative descriptions instead of quantitative ones. So we know that an INTP's Ne functions in a certain manner, according to MBTI. Based on how their Ne functions, we can also determine how their Si functions. But then Socionics introduces an additional dimension/scale that describes how Se functions, based on how Ne (and Si) functions. And then based on this, they give each function a role, and name it.

&gt;What if there's an "INTP" who thinks Ti-dom and Ne-aux are a very good descriptions for him, but thinks that actually his PoLR would be Fi while acknowledging that his Se is weak but in a different way? Socionics says "too bad, you don't fit in the system."

Same thing. Let's say that socionics is a system that predicts how certain functions will operate in interaction with each other. It's possible that an 'INTP' will feel that Ti-dom and Ne-aux fit him but not PoLR Se and Role Fi: Socionics is not fully able to predict the arrangement of his function. But it's also possible that a person with Ti-dom will feel like Fe is his auxiliary function, or maybe Fi, despite MBTI theory claiming that such a combination is not possible. And MBTI would not be fully able to predict the arrangement of *this* person's functions. You could argue that MBTI's arguments for why the function stack is the way it is are more convincing, but then to some level it comes down to personal preference. I don't think that a general model should be discarded of because it does not perfectly fit all cases-especially in a non-exact science, like psychology.

About Reinin dichotomies: I may disagree with *how* each of them was assigned to specific functions, but I don't quite agree with your assessment. /u/jermofo explained it better than I ever could, but the dichotomies are not independent: not all of the 32752 combinations will be meaningful.Hmm. I still only see the arguments for him putting up a NT front-and not evidence that he uses Fe over thinking functions. At this point, I don't even have a clear idea of his type, I just don't see how he is 'very Fe'.&gt;So it's a matter of how far are you willing to go with "reasonable assumptions" and, indeed, your definition of "reasonable"? And every assumption you make increases the chances you are wrong.

I think this is what it all boils down to and what explains our differences in the perception of Socionics: I am more lenient in my definition of 'reasonable assumptions', while for you it is much more important that everything is logically consistent. Which is an admirable aspiration (and I mean that most sincerely) but unfortunately makes you miss out on some imperfect (but fun!) systems/concepts like Socionics :D

&gt;Reflecting a little more, it looks to me like it boils down being along almost the same lines as the religion vs science debate... because science doesn't have all the answers, does that mean religion is an acceptable alternative?

That's not a fair comparison because (i) *neither* of the systems has a scientific basis and (ii) Socionics and MBTI can easily co-exist, so I don't even have to choose between the two of them: instead I can use them *both* as a way to increase my understanding of human psychology!

Plus, the *best* thing about science--and perhaps the only thing that really raises its value above religion and other belief systems--is that science does not require blind trust. At least theoretically, every experiment/study should be replicable, and every theorem should be written in a way that *anyone* reading the paper would come to the same conclusion. But psychology is not an exact science, so Socionics and MBTI stand on a pretty equal footing in my mind: until proven otherwise!

Other than that, I see where you are coming from :pBelieve me, I know the hermit/ghost mode all too well but what you have written here seems to suggest that everyone should just accept it as a fact of life and continue reaching out to us until we decide to respond...I think we should realize that the people on the other side of the conversation are real human beings with the same fears and anxieties as we have, and continuous lack of reply to repeated attempts to contact someone do seem like an unwillingness to maintain the relationship from the perspective of the other person.

Sometimes I feel like my personality (including the habit to isolate myself for extended periods of time) pushes people away, and they have to make extra effort to remain in contact me. The fact that they are willing to do this for the...uh very minimal reward that is my friendship just makes me appreciate them all the more. I just don't think I know how to keep people around, and that is something that concerns me and that I would really like to change. I think the least we can do is show the people who have not given up on us that we value their friendship--even if we only respond to them weeks or months after they first wrote to us.Individuals vs. the humanity/society, I presumeInteresting site! My results were Fi&gt;Ti=Ne&gt;Si&gt;Se&gt;Te=Ni&gt;Fe. On other cognitive function tests, I usually have a higher score for Fe and Ni, and my Te and Se tends to score lower (I also think this is the highest score for Ti I have ever received), but the placement of Fi, Ne and Si seems about accurate.Aww, fix it? I was ecstatic that I finally had a well-developed Ti :p

But maybe don't fix it yet? You could wait for some other replies and then see if any of the functions are unexpectedly high/low in most of the respondents' results, and *then* perhaps adjust the results.

Interestingly, I think my top intelligences in the regular 8 intelligence test were logic/math and nature, higher than even intrapersonal intelligence. What would that make me in your test? :) (an ISTP? ;))I see :) Good luck with your project! When you fix the bias, I can retake the test (if you post the link again/reply to this message) and tell you my updated results, if that would interest you :)&gt;ENTP: ENFP but cooler

Objection!

This is true, though:

&gt;INFP: ENFP but sadderI don't have time to write an elaborate argument, but I think she is an INFP: Fi because she has a very clear idea of what 'justice' is and how the world should look like, and then takes it upon herself to avenge the unfair treatment of the grocer's assistant, or set up her coworkers, or realize her father's dream ('taking direct actions to influence the world around oneself' does seem more like an xNFJ, not INFP trait, though)

Ne because of her inner dreamworld, and how she sees the whole world as ground for possibilities, and how things capture her imagination intensely but only for a short period of time (like a collage of impressions) unless she sets her mind on carrying out some project.

Tertiary Si for the attraction to things for sentimental reasons.

I could also see an argument for ENFP: especially if it is true that our dominant function is the only one that is developed through our childhood (then I see how it could be said that Amélie was a typical Ne child), but overall her demeanor is more INFP than ENFP.Fall has to be SJ because of how comfy it is. So is Christmas time, but that's not a whole season.

Spring is the NF domain.

And then summer is SPs, of course, and winter is NTs.Isn't the validity of the digit ratio theory pretty questionable?

Let me guess your hypothesis! Higher exposure to testosterone in womb leads to a development of certain personality types (I assume thinkers)?

(Nice hand!)I have found ENFPs and ISFPs to be the cutest ones: ISFPs more deliberately so than ENFPs.I just did! :)

The results did not change much: Fi&gt;Ti&gt;Si&gt;Ne&gt;Ni&gt;Se&gt;Te&gt;Fe.

I actually think I agree with the original results more. Hmm. What did you change? :)

(If you change something in the future, I can take the test again! :))Well, FWIW, [here's](http://similarminds.com/jung/infp.html) how similarminds.com describes INFPs. 

Or rather, how INFPs describe themselves, relative to the other types ([here](http://blog.similarminds.com/similarminds-personality-descriptions-are-too-negative/59) is more info on that)

Notice that a lot of the words/phrases in the description paint a rather dark picture: loner, attracted to sad things, can be overwhelmed by unpleasant feelings, prone to feelings of loneliness, solitary, low self confidence, emotionally moody, can feel defective, wounded at the core, feels shame, prone to sadness, familiar with the dark side, hermit, can sabotage self, prone to crying, prone to regret, prone to feeling discouraged, frequently second guesses self, can feel victimized, can be pessimistic, etc.

(The other type descriptions are also very interesting but obviously not as glowing/positive as the typical type descriptions: enter at your own risk)

So this does not exactly explain *why* INFPs tend to be sad (although I'd say that the combination of high Fi and Ne and low Si/Te/Se lends itself very well to depression/anxiety), but it seems to answer your question: INFPs are described as 'sad' because they see themselves (/are) sad.Long fingers are majestic! It's just a waste that I don't play piano anymore.

Sorry that you did not find any significant results! (That reminds me that I still have the spreadsheet with the results of a survey I haven't got around to summarizing/posting ;_; It had more than 1000 responses! Maybe I should do it over some weekend)&gt; I should become a hand model

You should! Imagine if all that education culminated in you becoming a hand model! 'All my life has been leading up to this moment!'

&gt; I believe it's very important to report null results.

Yes, of course...but statistically significant results are more fun!

&gt; I assume not mbti related?

Related! It was from about half a year ago when I had just recently discovered MBTI and asked everyone about their preferred types.

I just looked at the document and found that my memory vastly oversold the number of results my survey received (there are just a little more than 300 responses). And I think I accidentally deleted the file where I had already started some analysis of the results...I only have the raw data now ;_;

I *will* have to get to that when I am free-er from other responsibilities...
&gt; Though this kind of requires psychopathy, which for Fi user is quite the extreme possibility.

So...is there any type that you haven't labelled as a (secret or overt) psychopath yet? :pYesss. Please propagate this belief until it becomes accepted as truth.

And then I will need to introduce some ENFPs to the MBTI theory :DCoincidentally, Ti falls into the best of both categories :p

Everything I have read about the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths boils down to this:

Psychopaths: cunning, calculating, highly intelligent people manipulators

Sociopaths: dumb and reckless

(weirdly reminiscent of another branch of psychology, no? :p)

And aren't sociopathy *and* psychopathy both subcategories of antisocial personality disorder? Actually, I don't even think there are any actual definitions of the terms in psychology.

But let's set factual accuracy aside for a second ;) I'd actually sort Ji in the sociopathic category, and Je among the psychopaths. Je has more regard for social expectations and a better understanding of what's needed to get ahead in the real world. Ji is more independent, and in the more extreme cases has absolutely no regard for conventional morality. So Je is psychopathy: knowing how to manipulate social norms for one's own benefit. Ji is sociopathy: what happens if a person is *unable* to keep oneself in check/adjust to society's expectations.

&gt;which can be convolutedly justified with a bit of mental leaping, instead of a lot.

So feeling is a lot of mental leaping? I can't really argue with that :DAh, so we're on the same page!

Was I wrong in my understanding of the difference between socio- and psychopaths? (I very well may be!)I'm going to try this because I was accused of being a xxFJ type, and the seed of doubt has been planted.

And because you can't really go lower in rank than an INFP type, so I've got nothing to lose! 

1) Describe your inner world.

I've been thinking about this recently, how perceiving is defined as a filter of reality, and judging is more concrete, deliberate, like a framework. And that presents a problem, because everytime I have tried to describe my Fi, the first words I want to start with is that it is a subjective filter through which I perceive the world. Here is one example of how my Fi (or whatever the hell it is) works: if I go to a movie with my friend, what I end up watching is not the movie itself but my thoughts on the movie. It's like I am 'once removed' from the actual movie-watching experience, and the movie itself is just grounds for interpretation. What I end up watching, in no specific order, is 1) a movie review/critique of sorts, wherin I analyze the believability, 'moral standing' (hard to explain in a few words...I can elaborate if you want to), themes, context etc. of the movie, 2) a collage of other movies/books/artworks that I have seen/read that relate to the movie, 3)random things that something in the movie reminds me of (I will as if drift away from watching the movie while continuing to soak in what's happening on the screen), and much more. I will also spend a considerable time thinking of how exactly I want to formulate my opinion on the movie, because I know if I don't do it, the best I will be able to come will be 'it was nice'. This all happens simultaneously.

By the way, I thought this fell into the 'universal human experiences' category until I talked with a few people and found out that it's not the case. This happens with everything I do, whether it be playing a sport, or talking with a friend, or whatever Just a constant feeling of 'once removed from the reality'.

As for what I think is my Ne, it can be best exemplified by me writing an essay or an Internet comment. When it comes to essays, if for other people it is difficult to come up with ideas for the essay, for me it is a challenge to narrow it down to something coherent and laconic. As for Internet comments, I have barely finished writing a sentence when I already have several other ideas that are rarely funny or sensical to anyone but me and then I have to 'work backwards' and narrow it down to a comment of a normal length.

Another example of what I think is Ne: I live in a somewhat remote area, and I have to walk ~20 minutes to and from the bus to the university (hardly any students own a car here). So these 40 minutes each day my mind is just left to wander freely, and I come up with conversations, jokes, songs, solutions to all of my problems, etc. Walking is automatic for me, and I 'notice' but don't take note of my surroundings. For instance: I'd notice it if I crossed paths with a tiger who had escaped from a circus, but I couldn't tell if you if the car that just drove past me and is now out of my eyesight was red or black. I also play out a good part of my thoughts with hand gestures, laughs or frowns, my lips are moving...it's a good thing I rarely pass any people on my way.

2) What excites you?

Few things really excite me: not to say that I don't find anything enjoyable, it's just that the aforementioned filter prevents me from a true excitement. I think the walks to and from the bus (or any other time when I'm left alone with my thoughts) is the only time I can feel genuine excitement.

What I *enjoy*: I guess I could summarize it best as 'sudden release of long built-up emotions'. Reading a book and coming across a line that explains the essence of the book. Receiving a message from someone I've been thinking about. Things you could find in /r/frisson. Feeling sad about something and then coming across a comment that describes these feelings perfectly. Things like that.

(Sorry for the long post!)&gt; Infps at first glance will appear more serious than an intp (in my opinion they are )

I think it's the difference between Fi-Te and Ti-Fe.

If you're into Socionics, the [Reinin dichotomies](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Reinin_dichotomies) describe Fe-Ti types as merry, and Fi-Te types as serious, which I have found to be generally accurate.&gt;I found this interdasting. Posted for comment.

Isn't this a given whenever someone posts a link on here? :p

I think some tertiary functions are much more obvious than others: ExTPs' Fe and ENxJs' Se is often immediately apparent, while I have observed barely any hints of Ni in some ISxPs. Then again, it makes sense, since Fe and Se are very extraverted functions, while Ni is very introverted.

I think ESxJs especially might have a tendency to confuse themselves for ENxPs, since the tertiary function is often described as childish/infantile, and Ne is very child-like anyway.Pluto, because I like the underdogs!

Speaking seriously, Venus is pretty cool.In an opinion that is unrelated to my own type, I would propose that weak/ignored Fi is linked to 'sociopathic' traits.There was [this INTJ starterpack](https://imgur.com/IETfPLc.jpg) posted a while ago.

It's obviously very stereotypical...but I can appreciate the humor.Notebook and candles?And here I thought that you'd 'rage against' alterntive medicine and horoscope, not 'notebook' :DYour list includes all but four types (INFJ, INFP, ISFP and INTJ) :pAre you an ISFJ now? :DAww, and I hoped that I finally knew a grumpy ISFJ!

I thought you were following the trend of all IxTPs switching to, or being accused of, being IxFJ types!
No, that *used* to be your job.

As a Fe-aux type you can't do that anymore...what if you disrupt group harmony? ;)&gt; Using harmony against me betrays the concept of harmony

Pfft, my Fi doesn't care! I'll just go on to further my own selfish agenda.&gt;You're the antithesis or r/infp

That's because I'm actually an ESTP.

Shhh!Talented memers.♫ How many roads must a man walk down? ♫&gt;are we just being offensive to INFJs?

You'll have to get used to jokes about your type if you want to keep the INFJ flair.  You are a 'feeler' now, after all :p

You fell from the top when you abandoned the INTP type :,( You should have been an INTP and an ESTP for a maximal density of stereotypes.

**Edit for clarity:** To make the comments funnier/more stereotypical (since we're talking about stereotypes in this thread!), the 42 comment should have been made by an INTP, and the 420.69 comment should have been made by an ESTP.Sorry man. See the edit for explanation.Omg this exchange was too cute.

I'll have to go look at some kittens and puppies now.:o :o :o

I think this is my favorite thread I have ever been in! &gt;And it's not that Ni users are always convoluted, but at times your bouts can be quite the headspins

I find this funny because I find your comments to be the most enigmatic ones :p

I know you use shorthand and are confusing on purpose sometimes...or maybe it's just the great Ti/Fi divide!

**Edit:** Lately, people have been telling me that I am a FJ type, though. I have strong suspicions that you think of me as an ISFJ, too. Don't spare my life, please, tell me the truth.This is a perfect example of what I was talking about :p

(Nah, I'm kidding. I can understand metaphors!)

See my edit pls. I won't be able to sleep with the thought that I might be an ISFJ :(I am very okay with being a cool Feeler!

&gt;I  haven't really observed you closely as you would think

Are you telling me that all the hours I have spent stalking you have not been reciprocated? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Good night, I can now sleep tight!Outwardly at least, I think these are the types that 1)share the perceiving functions and 2)have the same E/I and T/F preference.

So that would be:

ESTJ-ENTP

ESFJ-ENFP

ISTJ-INTP

ISFJ-INFP

ESTP-ENTJ

ESFP-ENFJ

ISTP-INTJ

ISFP-INFJ

If we ignore behavior and look at things from a cognitive function perspective, the I/E pairs are the most similar.
&gt;And actually i might be introverted because it does make me nervous to stand in front of 200+ people and give a presentation. Sort of excited nervous. Adrenaline... yeah ... ok whatever.

I am pretty sure this is not introversion lolPersonally, I find it the easiest to communicate with ENTJs and ENFPs, but our relationships often get too intense too fast. All my friendships with ISTJs started very quickly and effortlessly, but it seems like there is always some barrier that prevents us from freely discussing our ideas.

It is very easy for me to talk with xSTPs in real life, but I think we are too different to pursue friendships past meeting for a drink every few months.

xSFJs can be very funny. ISFPs are probably my favorite type to just spend a relaxed day with. INTPs are strange: we are so similar in so many ways, and it's so easy to befriend them, but in conversations it always seems like we are coming from very different places.

And I met a girl who I strongly suspect might be an INFP recently (the first one I have typed as such, other than myself), and I find her to be one of the most adorable human beings I have ever met! 

I think I can one-up the trigger.

'T-oriented my fucking ass'&gt;where some ENTPs came out as believers of horoscope

Personal anecdote time! I know *seven* TPs who believe in horoscopes (*five* of them are ESTPs, one is INTP or ISTP, and one is ENTP), and they all said the exact same thing to me (paraphrased): '*Of course* I don't believe in the horoscopes they print in newspapers or magazines. But there are people who do astrological readings, and it seems quite accurate, you know? They do exact calculations based on your birth date, time, place and the position of stars/planets above you when you were born, and it seems like they actually know what they're doing.' I know at least five of them have had the astrology reports done for themselves, and again, they all said the same thing 'I was skeptical at first, but the reports are really scarily accurate'. What's more interesting is that TPs are the *only* types I have heard making similar statements...I know three other people who trust horoscopes, but they also believe in other esoteric practices. 

I don't know how it happened that so many of them, otherwise very logical and rational people, all had astrology readings created for them and fell for it (belief in astrology and similar fields is unfortunately rather prevalent where I live, but not *that* widespread). I also don't know how it happened that I have talked with so many of them about this subject (I initially thought of three TPs like that off the top of my head, but then I just kept on remembering all the ESTPs with whom I have talked about this hah…maybe it’s my ~fate~). Maybe there is something that makes TPs extra susceptible to believing in horoscopes. Maybe Ti likes all-encompassing systems that attempt to explain the world and are less likely to care about the factual accuracy as long as the system is internally consistent? (that would explain why TPs are so drawn to MBTI hah hah hah) 

I know that ENFPs are stereotypically the ones most drawn to mystical things like astrology, but it does not match my personal experience. I mean, ENFPs still have Te, even though it’s in tertiary position, and Te makes people reluctant to accept beliefs that are ‘clearly’ (read: widely accepted as) bullshit.I have a few friends and *a lot* of friends of friends, acquaintances and previous classmates in the IT field. In my experience, the types you are most likely to meet in IT are INTP, ISTP, ISTJ, a few ESTPs and ISFJs. IT is the most 'T' dominated field, I think, even other STEM fields attract a larger proportion of feeling types. I suspect it's because it's easier to find a 'F-based' motivation to study science, mathematics, medicine etc. than to study IT.&gt;have you even fucking checked?

That's a Te thing!

(I kid, I kid)

&gt;I don't know what Fi even is

A landmine!Noo :(

(Go to sleep! :D)&gt; I'm a teenager who dresses in a (within my circles) memetic black longcoat and top-hat, has an obsessive interest in both acting and writing, pretends to have a British accent for no reason, writes grimdark fantasy for fun, spends time doing in-depth analysis of fictional characters, and just generally fits the bill for the angst teen stereotype. Except that I'm not actually that stereotype personified. I'm just similar enough to it on the surface that I can walk around mercilessly parodying it.

I want to befriend you (´･ω･`)&gt;realistic N type

Is there such a thing?So are ExTJs the easiest to talk to for you? Or is communication with FJs/TPs easier?Hmm...the second question *does* have a place for a short reply.



:D

What about your [resolution](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/53x4j6/when_sines_hate_on_senis_and_vice_versa/d7xc5pm)?Same here. My score was 4, but I really had to reach for even that result.What about creating a new subreddit where people would need to have been typed by the mods to get an invite and be able to participate?

People would message the mods to get typed, or a typing thread could be created in the existing subreddit for convenience.

It does kind of sound too much like an 'exclusive secret club' for my liking, but it would get rid of the need to enforce a new system/rules in /r/MBTI, especially since some people might not be satisfied with the new system. If it is a new subreddit, the people who want to get typed would be able to, and these that couldn't care less would go on with their life as usual.&gt;For contrast, I tend to write long rambly sentences with a lot of commas.

I always enjoy your comments. Just the way they're written, they're very pleasing to read.  I think there is a certain serenity to your writing style.Are you talking about /r/mbtiplus, or are there any else? /r/mbtiplus is neither secret nor mod-invite only, but I can't think of any others (because I haven't been invited ;_;)It's okay

*sniff* I think the motto can apply to any type. It's just that different types' (/people's) interpretation of what a 'better person' is and what is the best way to achieve self-improvement will differ.&gt;Jokes aside, it's not a great test. My father is a narcissist but one of my role models growing up (ENTJ and one of the best people i know) would probably outdo him on this test because he's very self-confident.

Yeah, I think I agree. I also know an ENTJ that would probably score very high on this test. She is a very confident person, but she's also highly self-aware, perfectionistic and self-sufficient. She holds everyone to high standards, but that includes herself. All of these are traits that would probably mean a high score on the test, but I don't think she has NPD. 

The only person who I suspect might actually be narcissistic (an ESFP, I think) would probably get a lower score. She would agree with statements like "I have a natural talent for influencing people", " I know that I am good because everybody keeps telling me so" and "Everybody likes to hear my stories", for example, but she also believes herself to be 'essentially a modest person', would probably say that she 'tries not to be a showoff', etc.Well, the average score was 10.1 points (with 72 replies so far), but there was a noticeable difference between the average result of intro- and extraverted types (15.0 average for extraverts, 8.8 average for introverts). The only introverted type with an average score above 10 (from these with enough replies to make somewhat reliable conclusions) was INTJ, with 14.6 average. From the extraverted types, only two types had enough responses: ENTP with 17.8 average, and ENFP with 14.0 average (you're not an ENFP, though!!! :D)

&gt;My score is healthy given that a lot of the questions had to do with self-sufficiency and confidence

For sure! The test measures some traits that are *associated* with NPD but that are also common among confident and self-sufficient people. It's not like you can determine if you have a personality disorder through an online test, anyway.

Do you remember in which categories you scored the highest?I would choose healer for the ability to heal people and the heightened intuition/insight into human nature. I do not hold any religious/spiritual beliefs, but I like the idea of reincarnation based on good deeds.

One downside to this choice would be the fact that I do not think that I am an inherently good person, and if I were to be reincarnated in poor circumstances after death, it would probably be less likely that the spirit would judge me as a compassionate person at the end of *that* life, and it could feasibly turn into a downward spiral.

Nakama would be my second choice, followed closely by The Road Eternal.

Fisher King would be exciting for about a month, but I'd quickly grow to detest my prisoner-like status. 

I would not choose Dominion, Hunter or Escape.

What do I think my choices say about me? Well, they are probably very typical feeler choices--and show that I have no desire to dominate over the world.&gt;Now you make me want to find my own INTP to be a socially-awkward shut-in with.

INTPs are great! 10/10 people, would recommended.

ENxP and INTP could be a potentially very interesting/fulfilling dynamic!

I don't think two INxPs could realistically be in a relationship, though. *Too much* awkward shutting in on both sides.Several reasons!

* It's a world that is largely limited by my own intelligence and imagination. I believe that a human's mind (or at least mine!) needs input from the external world: perceptions and impressions to feed imagination. I would not mind being detached from my physical body, but I would lack out on new sources of inspiration.

* I am a rather emotionally volatile person, and I often experience intense negative feelings (depression, anxiety etc.) 'My world' would consequently be unstable and gloomy: I predict that without outside influence, this world would soon resemble my inner world at times when I feel the need to withdraw from everyone and become a shut-in...which is not a good place to be. Or else, it would be like a constant state of derealization, which I find to be an incredibly offsetting feeling.

* This just sounds depressing: "If you create a person, they will act out the role you give them in your mind but have no true intelligence of their own" and "few of [dreamers] will be lucid enough to hold meaningful conversations"

* I am not a big fan of living for an eternity anyway!&gt;bonus points if certain songs relate to your tertiary/inferior functions

Sorry about the long list, I was just excited about this question lolMaybe IxxP types?ISFP seems likely.Three IxFxs?

How nice and sweet, and potentially disastrous :D&gt;Lately I've been coming across more and more discussion about how "Socionics has it right"--that if your first cognitive function is an introverted perceiving function, you are a Perceiver. While this makes sense to me on paper, in actual day-to-day life I feel like the traditional MBTI J/P dichotomy is way more applicable.

I agree. I also think that IxxPs fit the MBTI 'perceiver' traits despite being Ji-doms, and IxxJs fit the 'judger' traits despite being Pi-doms.

Why? Well, it is often said that the J-P dichotomy describes whether the first extraverted function is a judging or a perceiving function. And that is true. But I think that a better (read:more suitable for this very specific question) way to look at the J-P dichotomy is to see whether the first judging function is introverted or extraverted. If it is extraverted, a person is a 'judger'. If it is introverted, the person is a 'perceiver'.

Before you start writing an angry reply lol, I want to emphasize that I am not talking about the distinction between judging and perceiving functions, as described by Jung. I am talking specifically about the stereotypical 'J' and 'P' traits, as described by Myers and Briggs: being planned, orderly and organized vs. being flexible, spontaneous and adaptable.

So I think that people whose first judging function is extraverted (xxxJs) will fit the MBTI 'J' traits better because extraverted judging is more restricted and dependent on the external environment. (**Edited to add from a previous comment I made**: Je has more regard for social expectations and a better understanding of what's needed to get ahead in the real world. Ji is more independent, and in the more extreme cases has absolutely no regard for conventional morality.) Here's how Jung describes extraverted feeling, for example: "It has freed itself as fully as possible from the subjective factor, and has, instead, *become wholly subordinated to the influence of the object*. Even where it seems to show a certain independence of the quality of the concrete object, *it is none the less under the spell of.traditional or generally valid standards of some sort*". Because Je is more constrained than Ji, xxxJ types will appear to be more 'structured and decided'. Meanwhile, introverted judging is more unhinged, 'free', less attuned to external standards and demands. Because of this, xxxP types, whose first judging function is introverted, will appear to be more unstructured, flexible and adaptable.I think that usually you can at least tell what their AxxB 'temperament' (EJ, EP, IJ or IP) is. &gt;If someone voluntarily sacrifices herself or her infant, that's a different story.

Interesting. Why do you think a mother (and only the mother) can make this choice for her infant?Okay, but the question remains almost exactly the same: why do you think the parents can make this choice for their infant, and nobody else?

If you've already decided that the common good justifies the torture of the infant, does it really matter if a few more people are going to be in pain over the death of the baby? It's still the interest of the few vs. the interest of the many.

And if you think that it is justified to kill the infant if the parents volunteer the child, when do parents lose the right to decide the fate of their child? Could parents volunteer their adult son, for example? Would you be okay with a whole country voting on a person to be tortured to death for the benefit of others?

I do not necessarily disagree with your opinion btw, I just want to understand other people's viewpoints on this question.&gt;What if everyone knows that you tortured it, but no one knew why?

&gt;What if you were the only one who didn't benefit from the baby's suffering?

I'm curious: do you really think that there is anyone who *would* be willing to torture the baby to death for the benefit of the humanity, but would choose to *not* do it because of something as comparatively inconsequential as social standing or personal benefit?

If someone has already decided that the greater good of the humanity justifies the killing of the baby (i.e., the benefit to the many is greater than the suffering of one), would personal considerations like that really tip the scales enough that a person could decide 'one baby's death can be justified for the enhancement of the future, but one baby's death *and my social standing* is really too much of a sacrifice to make'?


&gt;I personally don't feel that making men/humans happy is an important enough goal to torture anyone for.

&gt;though I don't have time to read the chapter, so may easily be missing the point here

No, I think Dostoevsky would agree with you (if we suppose he sympathizes with Ivan's, one of the main character's, opinion in this chapter, which I think he does).

Ivan argues that harmony cannot be achieved if even one innocent person has to suffer for it. He discusses the idea of Heaven specifically, how it is said that 'in the end' "the hind [will] lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his murderer". Ivan claims that no-one can grant forgiveness to the torturer in the child's stead, and if the world is not cleaned from the sin of the child's death, then harmony will always be incomplete:

&gt;"And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don’t want harmony. From love for humanity I don’t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it’s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it."I'm having a typological crisis!

Pi+Fe makes sense (I think), and I have always been relatively sure about being on the Ne-Si axis, so ISFJ fits.

Right now I am just trying on the flair, though. The main thing I noticed is that I don't even feel that weird about the idea of not being a Fi dom, but I definitely have trouble accepting that Ne could be any lower than an auxiliary function for me.&gt;If I tell you killing a life would ensure the happiness one person, would you allow it? Yet we have it everyday, in abortions.

&gt;we would look to our "real world" and see abortion is an unthinkable act.

You are positioning an unborn fetus against a living human being. In the original scenario, the child has a consciousness/'personhood', so I don't think it's fair to compare these two situations.&gt;However, good thread OP.

Thanks! I am happy to see so many different opinions about the question (including the replies from users who think that asking such a question is pointless ;))Thanks!

Upvotes are pretty much irrelevant, anyway: the thread has 50+ replies, and that is the important part :)This is very interesting because I could see this reply used to defend both positions.

To torture the baby: you should sacrifice your own peace of mind (i.e., sacrifice yourself) to guarantee the happiness of the humankind

To not torture the baby: a human being can only volunteer oneself for a sacrifice like that, and forcing others to undergo such a torture against their will is not permissible.

Which of these opinions is closer to your line of thought?&gt; PS: /u/crowdedhighways wanna see Ni? 

Miraculously, I could follow the conversation quite easily (except for that one part in the middle of the chain where everyone seemed to be confused about what was being communicated).

I also immediately understood what was meant by shared meta-values vs. shared regular values, so I wonder if the distinction has to be made between Fi and Fe, instead of S/N (so a question back to you, do you differentiate between 'meta' and 'regular' values?)...even though the original comment was about differences in communication/value perception between an INTJ and an ISTJ (two Fi users), so I am not sure.

On a personal level, the people with whom I have most often felt that we're in accord on a surface level but coming from completely different places are ISTJs. I have also observed a similar tendency: the ISTJ will be much more satisfied with reaching an agreement and moving on, while I would ideally keep the conversation going until we have understood where each of us is coming from. Unfortunately I don't even know my type, so it's hard to say what this means in terms of interpersonal dynamics (do we share the same functions but in a reverse order? Are our judging functions same or different? etc.)

I think your analysis of the INFJ and ISTJ mindset/approach to problems was pretty much perfect. I find super-ego relationships fascinating in general (how close they are to a relationship of conflict, and yet how there is often a strong draw to the super-ego partner. I think the main attraction to super-ego partners is a desire to figure them out, but the differences only become more apparent as time goes on--which, of course, can make the relationship even more compelling)From recent ones I have read, Albert Camus' *The First Man* (a largely autobiographical novel) manages to capture IxFP mindset the best.

I also think that *The First Man* is his best work (apart from this book, I have read *The Stranger*, *The Plague* and *The Myth of Sisyphus*), so I'd recommend it even if you're not interested in a portrayal of Fi.Going by the simplest definition of intro/extraversion, social interaction tends to wear me out. I relate to the need to meet new people somewhat regularly to avoid mental stagnation, but I am much more *comfortable* staying at home than going out.

At the same time, I draw energy from being around people retrospectively. One example: I go to a friend's house to celebrate her birthday. She is a very affable person, everyone likes her, so there are several dozens of people at her house. It is very possible that I will feel awkward and out of place the whole time. But I love this friend, she just radiates love and energy, so my mood will be elevated for several weeks following this social gathering.Casually Trinitarian (56/44)Fooling the *what*? :pI was trying to come up with something and then I realized that I *am* a stereotype :(Extraverted people are just as capable of being intelligent, empathetic and 'deep' as introverts.

Assuming that someone lacks depth because they are extraverted is shallow by itself, anyway.

Try to avoid doing this, though, it is not a good thing:

"I, personally, as an ENTP, romanticize sadness because it has more dimension than happiness"

It's incredibly easy, even appealing to let sadness consume you completely.

And I know it's not as easy as 'just be happy, man!!' to snap out of that attitude. But realizing that sadness/existential depression is a negative, destructive emotion instead of romanticizing it for its beauty does help.
&gt; I'm not sure what to make of that!

That there are probably more male INFJs than female INFJs on this subreddit? :p&gt;Yeah I know sex but what else is there.

Warm, fuzzy feelings? :DAdmittedly, the borders between intense platonic and romantic feelings are very fluid for me.

Maybe that's an [INFP/IxFx thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/56qowo/intense_platonic_feelingsrelationships/)?People whose thought patterns differ significantly from what's expected socially (especially with regards to gender and the T/F divide) are more likely to be interested in communities/theories that attempt to explain these differences? For women, I have observed the same thing with the ISTP type (there are probably more male than female ISTPs in real life, but the majority of ISTPs online seem to be women).

And INFJs are commonly seen as the most logical/least emotional feeling types, so men are more likely to see themselves as INFJs over any other feeling type if they are willing to see themselves as feelers at all.

(I am talking very generally here by the way, not about anyone in particular.)

What's your opinion?

&gt;social outcasts/wannabe outcasts who've been given a reason to contemplate their social interactions and difference

Y-you too ;_;

---

Just kidding! I agree with you agreeing with me! :D&gt; What really needs to happen is that we get all of the intuitives on say, a farm, and start breeding them. 

I predict that this would have the opposite of the intended effect. All intuitives would go extinct within about 100 years.To counteract that comment, I really appreciate your presence on this subreddit :)&gt; Plus... if you look at a different sample group (taken in Europe and outside work places) it comes up as a 45-55 split between N and S types.

The most common MBTI type where I live is apparently INFP! :D

I have only typed one person as such this far, though :( A very interesting perspective, thank you for sharing.

I'm sorry--I know you said that you're tired of talking about this--but could you elaborate on the ways that the Ni outlook is erased in the American culture, please? And is there anything that *I personally* can do to avoid misinterpreting or distorting Ni perception of reality? I am asking sincerely.

Or do you think that this is something that only happens on a larger social/cultural level?&gt; that was a pretty raw deal I think

Could have more to do with them being 'narcissistic, ultraconservative and massively religious' than their MBTI type, no?Thank you, that gives me a lot to think about!

I understand if you don't want to answer the first part of my question: I am more interested in your personal experience with Ni anyway.

&gt;it is far worse for me when people believe or assume they understand but don't

I try to not assume other people's intentions, but it is hard for me to *not* attempt to categorize everything (people/things/ideas): it is something I have to consciously avoid doing. I am working on it!

---

By the way, I typed myself as an INFP for a long time but recently changed my flair to ISFJ. After your comment and several other conversations I have realized that I underestimated how much I actually use Fi, so I will change back to INFP. Thanks for that, too!I think that your description is very accurate to how I operate.

It's interesting, because looking at Ni doms *from the side*, it seems like they have a much more...stable understanding of the world and their place in it than I do, despite me being (I believe) a Ji dom. I don't know if it feels the same way from the inside, but Ni doms seem to have everything figured out. It's as if they are content with themselves (in the best way) and there is much less yearning for something different and dissatisfaction with the current state of things.

Sorry, I am just rambling...Maybe I am completely wrong! And maybe being confused and in a constant search for something better is just what *every* young adult experiences, and I'll grow into a greater satisfaction with life later on.

I really appreciate this conversation, by the way.There's [this](http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/myers-briggs-and-jungian-cognitive-functions/73348-type-lesbian-gay-bisexual.html)cool, ~~bro~~ fam

They're an xSTP type now!I don't know fam. How spoopy are you? &gt;I take it you've never been personally close enough to a Ni-dom to really get a feel for the chaos of the Ni-dom inner world?

I have only got close to one Ni-dom in real life, I think. She was an INTJ and quite a troubled person (her words, not mine)...there were a lot of communication differences and it was a very hurtful relationship but she impacted my life like very few people have. I would like to renew that connection, but I am afraid that it's been too long and I don't know if she even cares at this point.

&gt;You have the internal structure, we have the external structure.

What if I lack both the internal and the external structure hah?

But I think it is a very good way to sum it up anyway.

I know my experience is limited and I only have one point of reference, but the INTJ in my life was very definite and determined externally but I also got to experience the inner chaos as we were very close at one point and she used me as someone towards whom to direct all of her negativity, confusion, fears etc. And I was very easily malleable, so I absorbed all the chaos within her without having the capacity to deal with/stand against it. I also looked up to her very much due to her role in my life, and so I accepted every bad thing she said about me as being the truth and let it become a part of my self-view...Definitely an unhealthy relationship, so I am fascinated by Ni perspective and want to extend my frame of reference past this one relationship.
&gt; Perhaps his/her observation is that their personal experience of love seems to be more intense than others they've talked to about it, or watched through their actions

Well, I wouldn't expect a *recountal* or *observation* of how love feels like to other people to be as intense as actually experiencing it myself.

I.e., just because someone's story of how they experience love pales in comparison with my actual experience of love, it does not mean that their love lacks the depth of the love that *I* experience. &gt; S profiles are usually pretty badly written and unattractive. (Not all SJs are religious traditionalists. Come on.)

Can you link me to any SJ type profile that describes them as religious traditionalists? 16personalities describes ISTJs, for example, as dedicated, responsible, logical and goal-oriented, none of which are negative qualities. You can associate 'dedicated and responsible' with 'boring and traditional', I guess, but not any more than you could associate 'shy, misunderstood and guided by their principles not logic' in the INFP description with being a weird loner.

That the MBTI *community* often takes the type descriptions and portrays all sensors as imbeciles and all intuitives as deep and intelligent people is something that I am willing to agree with.



&gt;I'm 6'4" on a good day

Well, *I* am 8 stories tall and a crustacean from the Paleozoic era on a good day.That's adorable, but you can't use the word *fam* unless you flair as a TP type.

I am an exception because I just made up that rule.Hmm, you're probably right. I very rarely type people as Ni doms because admittedly I don't understand Ni at all, but I was quite sure that *she* is definitely a Ni dom.

And I didn't mean to say that Ni is emotional (or that any cognitive function can be emotional, in fact). *The person* was very emotional, but I do not attribute that to her Ni. 

**Edit:** Upon some further thought, I probably typed her as INTJ because her way of perceiving the world was so alien to me while I found many similarities in expression of Fi-Te. I.e., I typed her in relation to myself, which is of course not a good way to type people.&gt;But is very INFP IMO

Good point ;)

Thank you for this conversation! I think I gained some understanding...but I mostly benefitted from letting go of certain misconceptions of mine :)&gt; My graph was also very unusual. I started off great...

I didn't expect you to have done *this* great at the beginning, even though I read your comment before I saw the image :)

And I thought that the point of a 'gut feeling' test was that you should *not* overanalyze it :p&gt; the value of the cards certainly changed once in a while

Yeah, each of the cards had a certain *chance* of 'bringing' sunny or rainy weather, so it's possible that a card could bring rain nine times in a row, and then suddenly cause sunny weather.

I think that was the point. If each card *always* caused either sun or rain, it would be much easier to figure out the pattern quickly, and then it would be a test on logic, not implicit memory (or 'gut feeling' if you will :p)NICE POST(?!) THANKS

(MY COMMENT WAS PRETTY NORMAL, FOR SURE NOT SPECIAL ENOUGH TO SAY TO COMPLETE STRANGER THAT YOU AGREE...)
&gt;The difficulty usually lies in [..] not knowing how to put my feelings into words. They are much safer in my mind. If I say them aloud, they are there, known, I am vulnerable, and I will be bound to these words forever, words I may not be confident in because they don't truly describe what I mean. In my mind, my feelings can change and I can refine them freely, without making them scarily permanent by saying them.

Yes, all of this. I think it happens because feelings are dynamic and multiangular in people's (/my?) mind, and putting them into words necessitates that they be captured in a static, one-dimensional state. Like taking a single picture of one of these sculptures that change depending on the perspective from which they are viewed and expecting the other person to be able to understand how they look from all angles.

I don't know how a complete connection to another person can be possible even if they're both completely open about their experiences and observations, if I can view something I have written a few minutes ago and already feel that it lacks all the nuance of what I actually wanted to communicate, and I have possibly already discovered some new perspective that is contradictory to what I said initially.

I.e., even if you can fully understand the static 'me' that I was a minute ago, that does not mean that you understand the 'me' that I am now.&gt;The INFx types are very similar.

I wouldn't say so. Outwardly perhaps, but in my personal experience, the differences become obvious when we (i.e., me, supposedly an INFP and an INFJ) try to reach common ground. 

I am ready to take all blame for the communication difficulties on myself: with most people, I try to not *assume* what their perspective is, but the Ni-Fe worldview is so alien to me that I find myself *appropriating their point of view for my own understanding*. That's something I have to consciously avoid doing-- and is perhaps a thing I do with other types as well, but it's not so obvious because there is a higher chance that what I *assume* they wanted to communicate is, in fact, what they wanted to get across.

When I talk with INFJs, it's like we are speaking two different languages with a translator relaying the message from one person to another. There is a certain barrier that cannot be overcome--I am not seeing the other person's opinion 'as is', I am seeing *my own interpretation of it*. It becomes a problem because I usually see Ni-doms' writings as extremely interesting and illuminating, and I *think* that I have understood what they wanted to say but if I start a conversation with the person, it turns out that I have looked at the question from a completely different angle and that I have actually not understood their perspective at all (which is another problem because my Ji dominance means that I am not satisfied with just taking in information as it is, I feel a need to understand, to put things into context, while I imagine Ni doms are just as frustrated with someone trying to (incorrectly) anayze and classify their raw perception). So I'd summarize the experience as enticing yet frustrating.

Would *love* to hear INxJs' (and especially INFJs') thoughts on this!Hmm, will have to see the Delta album, but I largely preferred the Beta (Ni-Se) paintings to the Alpha (Ne-Si) paintings despite the fact that I am fairly certain that I use Ne-Si (even if I'm not necessarily an INFP).

Maybe Ni-Se just befits art more than Ne-Si? ;)You just made me realize that there were more *individual* paintings that I liked in the Alpha album, even if I far preferred the general mood of the Beta art.

(Sorry, I couldn't put the images in an album for some reason, and I chose six paintings)

If it helps, my favorite artist is [Nikolai Ge](https://www.google.lv/search?q=nikolai+ge&amp;oq=nikolai+ge&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2267j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), my favorite art genres are Russian art and religious art, and what appeals to me in art is *both* authenticity and dramatism. 



Hmm, ISTJ? Very strange, but that would definitely explain some things. I was considering the ISFJ type for a while, but ISTJ fits much better imo (not sure about that auxiliary Te though)

And yes, Nikolai Ge is great! I didn't even know about him until last year but I stumbled upon his paintings while visiting the Tretyakov gallery in Moscow (probably my favorite among the galleries I have visited) and was blown away.&gt;Everyone here has had enough!

How many people does the 'everyone' include?2edgy4me, mate :pThank you for putting this together, I really enjoyed looking through all the albums :) Will be waiting for the gamma one, as well!

Though I must admit, I liked the beta art album the most, with the alpha album as a distant second. This one actually had the least paintings that made me stop to look at them closer. I guess I just prefer the mood of beta paintings (although I know one ENFP and one xSTJ artist, and their paintings resemble the beta art more than the delta art...any suggestions for why this could be the case? :))&gt;  I saved gamma for last because I bet it's gonna be fun

Yeah, just from the article, it seems like I will end up liking gamma art the most. I like the majority of the art styles and artists from that section!

(or was the smiley sarcastic? :p)

By the way, if you don't mind looking through some pictures, in which quadra would you put [Nikolai Ge's paintings?](https://www.google.lv/search?q=nikolai+ge&amp;client=ms-android-motorola&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisvPXJ49zPAhXCKiwKHT61BQoQ_AUIBygB) I'm not good at visual identification, but it seems like Ni-Se and Fi-Te, no?

&gt; Maybe we're drawn to art that has kind of an element of mystery or novelty to it - when it's too relatable, it becomes mundane?

Yes, I could see this! :)&gt;Oh wow, that artist is fantastic!!

&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

I *love* it when other people appreciate the art/music/literature that I like! :D

I had the opportunity to see the paintings in real life, and obviously it's 100x more impressive seeing art up close than looking at it online...if you're ever in Moscow, then I'd definitely recommend visiting Tretyakov gallery!! It would have been my favorite gallery even without Ge's paintings.

And gammas are great! :)



Yeah! Some people got really angry over the decision to award him a Nobel (if you look at /r/literature, right now *eleven* of the links on their front page are discussions about whether or not he deserves the prize, with articles like 'Why Bob Dylan Shouldn't Have  Gotten a Nobel', 'Bob Dylan as Publicity Stunt For The Nobel Prize ' and 'The World Does Not Need Bob Dylan'), but I do think that his songs fit the bill of "outstanding work in an ideal direction".This is going to be very gushy!

I recently met a woman who I am (for once) quite sure is an INFP, and she is *freaking adorable* :D

I think that despite my largely positive interactions with Fi doms on this subreddit, and despite the wonderful ExFPs I have the pleasure of calling my friends, on some level I was afraid that all the jokes about Fi users would turn out to be true when I met one in real life, and that I would be disappointed and our values would clash, and everything would be terrible (I, uh, now realize that I am quite a dramatic person).

But she is kind, and funny, and intelligent, and I was so relieved that the first INFP I identified as such other than myself is so *nice*, because otherwise the only INFP I knew was myself, and now I can *truthfully* say that I know positive examples from each type.

She is like me in many ways, but like me if I was kinder, more understanding and less confused about life. So talking to her is like looking at the person I could have been, which is at the same time incredibly depressing and motivating! :DI had heard the rumors but never really looked into them. [Here](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylans-greatest-lyrical-thefts-20110511) is an article listing a few examples.

Some of these could be instances of two artists independently coming up with the same idea, but others are undeniably theft.

To be honest, I'm not sure how/if that changes my opinion on whether Dylan deserves the Nobel Prize. I am leaning towards no.&gt;Do you care about your status in society?

No, but I do care about my status in social groups (among friends/acquaintances/colleagues/...) before I gain enough confidence about everyone's opinion about me. So it's not exactly a worry about my social status, but rather anxiety over whether I have correctly determined the level of friendship/intimacy between me and the other members of the group.

&gt;why do i have a love / hate relationship with social status?

Because you're a human being who lives in a society.

But if you're into Socionics, the 'love' part could be explained by you being an [aristocratic type](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/dichotomies/r2t3), and the 'hate' part by you being a human, or an ESTP, or by (stereotypical?) Se+Ti rejection of rules, or by your Ti being higher than your Fe (choose one/several/all).&gt; To me those seem more like he's making *references* to those other things, not theft/appropriation at all.

I was actually thinking the same thing, I just didn't want to get into technicalities over whether or not referencing another artist's work without directly acknowledging that they are the author can be considered theft (I think it's seen as more acceptable when the allusion is made to a work from the literary canon, while including whole lines from relatively recent works without acknowledging the author could be seen as something more questionable)

But I don't really have a strong opinion on the matter, either: I like some of his songs, and I think that it is cool that he was awarded the Nobel Prize, that's about it.I really like your photo!

The first picture your sister drew (she's very talented!) looks *a lot* like the paintings by my Delta artist friends (ENFP and ISTJ); the ISTJ friend is particularly fond of that style. They are both into line art, as well. My ENFP friend prefers more moody/dark/abstract ('Beta style'?) art, though, while the ISTJ friend prefers drawings with a clear theme and clean lines.

**Edit:** The ISTJ friend could also possibly be an ESTJ, I have not yet decided.I think you need a dose of /r/wholesomememes.

They help to fight the internal despair!
&gt;she's [a] bonafide, stereotypical TeFi type

[..]

&gt;she's famously hot-headed, neurotic, and reaaallyy opinionated

I see :D

(You're in a Gamma thread, though, be nicer to Fi-Te :p)

&gt;she desperately wants Te solutions to her problems, but she's very unable to come up with them herself

Yeah, sounds like lower-level Te. Does the Te part of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2c2yug/socionicsmbti_description_by_functions_infp/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2ebm4s/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_enfp/) description ring true?I think it's because people go to the /r/MBTI subreddit to discuss the theory/general MBTI topics, and  to the individual type subreddits to post things that they think would resonate with the people of that type specifically (for instance, an ENFP could post a general discussion thread here, and their latest painting/poem/existential musings in /r/ENFP). So obviously the type subreddits are going to be a collection of the most stereotypical posts.&gt; how they found out that their ex was an ESTP.

The *worst*.Yeah, hard to tell with this little information, but I'd guess ESFP for the sister and IxFJ for OP. I think I genuinely shed a tear of happiness when I found that subreddit lol.

&gt;I really don't think I could hate any of you in real life. &lt;3

Is this what happens when an ESTP embraces their  feeling side?

And of *course* we're not conflict types, *it must be the model that's wrong* &lt;3

(How serious is your new flair?)



Ha, I knew that most people perceive their intelligence as being above average, but I didn't expect so many *9s* in this thread. I thought that 7-8 was a solid 'I am confident about my intelligence' rating.

Realistically, if 5 is the average rating, my intelligence probably falls within the range of 4 to 6. However, my *confidence* about how intelligent I am varies greatly, usually between 3 and 7. &gt; Individual ownership seems so much less important to me than clarity, however it is achieved

I like your outlook on this question :)

(Although I imagine that it could be frustrating to have your work appropriated without acknowledgment, especially if the material is then used for personal profit instead of more 'noble' goals like spreading the original artist's message to a wider audience or striving to achieve clarity, as you said...personally, I think I would be flattered, mostly, but I cannot predict my actual reaction, nor can I, or wish to be able to, dictate how other people should feel about this kind of 'theft': i.e., if the original artist feels angry, or confused or even decides to sue the appropriator, then so be it, because it *is*, after all, their material)

But I am also just rambling.

Off topic, but I remember having read that your enneagram type is 6 (do I remember correctly?) If that is the case, could you, please, direct me to some resources that made you decide on this type? I am becoming increasingly convinced that I could be enneagram 6, but I have not read much into that yet. Thanks! :)What's with the very one-sided admiration between INFPs and ENTPs? ('The most highly rated Significant Other for the INFP is the ENTP [..] who gave their ENTPs an overall rating of 9.25. In return, the ENTPs gave [..] INFPs an overall rating of 5.25')

Ah, and I think I found a mistake. 

Statement 1: 'Overall, participants who are in a relationship with an INFP gave their relationship an **average rating of 6.79**'

Statement 2: 'As a Significant other, the INFP is **rated the best** by the ENTP [..] who have their INFPs **an overall rating of 5.75**'No worries! Is the updated version already available, or is it coming later? :)This is great, thank you so much! 

I think 6 might just be it.No pressure! :DWhy IxFPs?

I think from the feelers, IxFJs would be the best suited for spy work.&gt; i have a xNFP sister and she's a dozy woman.

Dozy...I like that description :)I like this! The 'IxxJ=anthropologist' categorization is a very interesting way to look at Pi doms, I think.

I can see where you're coming from with the 'NF=romantic' grouping, as well, although I think 'idealistic' expresses the same idea in a more neutral/universally applicable way (and without connotation to romantic love).
It's possible that this is a language/culture difference; where I live, I'd say the word 'romantic' definitely has a more negative connotation than the word 'idealistic'.

But I'm curious: which of the negative associations that the word 'idealistic' carries in your mind, the word 'romantic' does *not*?&gt; idealist also has the implication of purposefulness, someone who will act according to their ideals 

I don't see purposefulness or acting according to one's ideals as a bad thing (although it definitely *can* be)

But thank you, this is very interesting to me nonetheless. As I see it, idealists and romantics at their worst can both be irrational, impractical and lack a grasp of reality, but romantics at their worst also have the negative qualities of foolishness and excessive sentimentality.

When I think 'idealistic', my first thought is various civil rights activists/leaders, while my first association with the word 'romantic' is the moody and often times misanthropic/self-obsessed Romantic/Byronic heroes in literature (like the protagonists of 'A Hero of Our Time', 'Don Juan' etc.) In my mind, idealsts can actually effect change, while romantics are prone to aimless contemplation of life and its meaning.

That said, I realize that everyone will have a different interpretation of the terms, and I like the definition given by BlueOtterSocks and think it fits the NF types well.I love this!&gt;a man who is kicking someone in the head is asked why and answers "because I'm a patriot", and the psychoanalyst then responds "no, you're a patriot so that you can kick him in the head"

I really like this!

I don't agree with your view on idealism, but I think I understand where you're coming from.

You know, I actually wanted to say that I'd use the term 'idealists' to describe NFJs, and 'romantics'  to describe NFPs, but it seems like you view idealism as commitment to personal values, taken to the extreme. Almost like unhealthy Fi? 

Si-at times strong to the point of being overwhelming, but only sporadically. I'll have moments when I consider being a Si dom and then return to my normal state of mind and realize that that is not my natural way of thinking.

Te- shite. Only serves my Fi.*No way.*

...You're kidding, right?My world was already shattered when I found out /u/Friendly_Nerd's age hah.You're so young!I'd say:

Italy and Spain ESxP.

Greece ISxP

France ISFP

Russia xSTP maybe? But also very ESTJ at times.

Agree about German speaking regions.

Latvia is definitely ISTJ. Poland ISFJ? Estonia could be INTP, actually.Don't tell me that you come from *Lithuania*

But it's hard to tell. Lithuanians are somehow even more introverted than Latvians but also warmer and friendlier (in a quiet way). I also think Ti-Fe and Ne-Si. So ISFJ or INTP.

Wait, wasn't Socionics developed in Lithuania?
Cool! Ever been to Lithuania? And what's *your* opinion about the type of their culture?&gt; sullen neurotic gray people

Ahaha. That's Norther/Eastern Europe for you.

We're all sullen and neurotic. That's what lack of sun does to you.

&gt; Also, her being my opposite would be problematic when she becomes my girlfriend

I also type people based on how much I want to date them!&gt; An INFP might like a peanut butter cup because of attached childhood memories, but an ISFP eats it because it tastes amazing!

Sometimes candy is just candy.&gt; I apologize, but I think you're probably an FJ type.

Hehe.&gt;explain the metrics, methods, motivations and procedures that went into the type's placement

I want to hear an explanation about how ENFP can end up at the bottom of *anyone's* list :D&gt; In fact, I would say this is almost a **tier list for life**.

Deep.Any notable differences?*Nice*! :D

Unless you mean that INFP men would be significantly higher on the list, in which case I go back to being *deeply offended* :DHah. I like everyone! And you are part of everyone, which means I like you, through transitive relation. Isn't math great?

In my list, every type would be in the first place!

(can you tell I'm in a happy mood today?)



You're great! Everyone is great!

I just woke up in a happy mood! I have to clean the house, which is usually *a chore*, but now I am super hyped about this, *fam*! 

I am still taking breaks because *who among us can truly be said to enjoy housework*, but I'm not letting that stop me from enjoying life!

Did I get a glimpse of Se-dom life? Is this what being *happy* is like? I have not felt this way in a long while, but it's exciting and slightly scary!

Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow hating everyone!...But I'll make sure to exclude you from the list of everyone, then :D&gt; I feel like being happy is the opposite of being an Se Dom.

That's good because you're an INFJ, so you must always be happy ;)

(Are you okay?)

I am quite sure I wasn't drugged!

Why are you so cynical about happiness?&gt;???????????

ExFxSeriously speaking, I'd say xSFP seems like a good fit.&gt; Why are you not cynical about happiness?

*Good point*

Wait, no, actually.

I am not cynical about happiness because I woke up very happy yesterday, and it was great! I wish it would happen more often!Well, at least we both agree on the Ni-Se axis. Although I spot much more Se than Ni in your comment.

And the Fi-Te axis is something I feel quite definite about (your entire answers to the first and second question seem pretty Fi-Te)I am still happy! Just content-happy, not delirious-happy.

Life is much nicer when you're happy! I highly recommend it! :)It can be a long process!

Have you looked at Michael Pierce's type description videos on YouTube?I don't know!

Right now it seems like there are two options:

1) Inexplicably wake up happy after months of feeling shitty;

2) Get drugged (?)I think that this article is great: http://typeindepth.com/2013/11/a-place-for-all-types-of-learners/I hope you will wake up happy tomorrow!

:)

&gt;INFJ fits me like a glove.

Cool, so you're probably an INFJ :) xSFP was just the impression I got from this thread- but if you don't see yourself in the ISFP description, then you're likely not an ISFP!That's a loaded question!Hah!&gt; I doubt an ESTP would be that inclined to bully an INTP 

what about an INFP? :,(O-okay :(&gt; In fact, you could very well be the anti-Christ, as you are almost the exact opposite of everything Jesus was supposed to be. 

[..]

&gt;Your exact opposite is the Emo Kid.

TIL I am Jesus. And Jesus is an Emo Kid.&gt; they're just waiting, biding their time, in apprehension of me saying some awful shit about ... well ... everyone

That's true! But I never have to wait for long (look, now you're selling people for slavery!)

But I win this time because there are no bidders! Hah!

:(

&gt;But then i remember that most people IRL think i'm a super nice guy. Honestly i get this compliment all the time i'm starting to think people are giving it out of pity

Switch the genders, and that's me, too. Only I don't even have balls for anyone to play with if they're feeling sorry for me!Women?

On *my* Internet?I just come here to have a good time when I get tired of studying. Y'all are meanies D:

But what can I expect from xSTPs. *sigh*My experience would indicate otherwise! :DJust curious: would you say that you're more inclined to type disagreeable/abrasive people as Fi-Te users than as Fe-Ti types?

(In case this comment appears to be accusatory, it is definitely not intended to be! I just think that I have noticed such a trend, and wanted to find out the opinion of a Fe using type :))Thank you for the reply!

Ah, so do you type very few people in general? (mostly people in real life with whom you are/have been close and have perhaps had the chance to discuss their type with them?)

&gt; I find [..] the ISTJ in my life to be the least abrasive, gentlest person I think I have ever known

Probably not my place to say anything, but I always find it very sweet when I come across your comments about the ISTJ. :)With so many similar articles written in complete sincerity, I actually did not catch on to the humor until about the third/fourth paragraph. I was going to be *so disappointed* in you lolFi:75% Ne:65% Fe:55% Ti:50% Ni:45% Te: 40% Si:35% Se:20%
&gt; ???? what are questions like these measuring?

I love indie rock=Ti

I dislike myself=Fi

lol

But it's possible that the questions do not measure the strength of any of the functions, and are instead used to create [these](http://similarminds.com/jung/enfp.html) descriptions. [Here's](http://blog.similarminds.com/similarminds-personality-descriptions-are-too-negative/59) how they create the lists: it's possible that, once they have enough data to show that, say, people who get the INTP result on the test also disproportionately like indie rock, they will use this information to update the INTP descriptions.
&gt;Most SJ protagonists severely lack emotional or intellectual depth

I just looked at your profile, and you say that you're an ENTP.

Please explain why you think that Si doms would have less *depth* than Ne doms.ESFP mother and ISTJ dad.

(I also have two sisters, an INTJ and a ISTP).

There's too much Fi-Te in our family.&gt; SJ protagonists. Not Si doms irl.

Right, but do you think that it might be that OP types some characters as SJs *because* they lack emotional/intellectual depth?

Anyway, that was not even my point. What I hinted at was that introverted perceiving functions will, almost by definition, have more *depth* than their extraverted counterparts.

---

For instance, here's a description of Si vs. Se: 

"Introverted sensation conveys an image whose effect is not so much to reproduce the object as to throw over it a wrapping whose lustre is derived from subjective age-old experience and still unborn future event. Thus mere **sense impression develops into the depth of the meaningful**, while extraverted sensation **seizes only the momentary and manifest existence of things**." I have brought it up twice.

Once in a conversation with an INTP and an ISTP friend in a larger, conceptual discussion about human nature/personality. They are both very scientifically inclined (although the ISTP friend studies philosophy) and were quite skeptical, but we had an interesting conversation nevertheless.

The other time, I brought it up in a conversation with an ISTJ friend when we were discussing books we had both read recently. She seemed to be very interested in the subject, and we ended up talking about it for almost an hour; I explained the cognitive functions to her (she also identified strong Si, Fi and Te in herself), and she even remembered that she had another book about Jung at home that she could give to me. So that was quite cool!

I have also asked two people to take the letter test for fun, my ISTP sister (who received the same result in the test), and my xSTJ friend who I had thought was an INFx back when I didn't know anything about the functions, so I was naturally *very* surprised when she tested as an ESTJ (iirc). But, as I learned about the functions, I understood that, despite her 'introverted feeler'-like appearance, she has a very strong use of both Si and Te, so when I remembered her test result while trying to determine her type, it all made much more sense.&gt; This is your chance to think more about what you like, the path of self-discovery~

The Fi way!

:D&gt; then you go through my personal hell.

The 'personal hell' is you being quietly disappointed in your head, right?&gt;So this would force you to ask her all sorts of things about herself and ask clarifying questions (What do you mean by ...? Could you give me an example of...? things like that) to see if you really understand. In not relying on being able to read her, you may end up getting information from and about her that is different and deeper than you would get if you didn't get it directly from her.

Thank you for this! I don't know how to express this properly, but I feel like I grow as a person whenever I see your comments. (I hope that this doesn't come across as a weird thing to say: I am just fascinated by your approach to communication because it is so unlike my *natural/automatic* process of taking in information, but it is also the way I *aspire* to be, so seeing you write it out like this is very helpful and important for me)&gt;I so dearly wish that we could all just vote on issues like: should it be legal to pay a woman less for equal work? should gender-based intimidation be tolerated in the workplace? 

I might have misunderstood you, so please correct me if I am wrong, but do you really think that it's a good idea for the majority's opinion to determine the rights of the minority?&gt;The first ever test I took (on 16 personalities) gave me INFP

Join usssss

(We need more banter and less sadness)&gt;**ENFP:** Everyone loves us we're the BEST at reading people! 

This is true, though.

(And don't even *try* to argue with my subjective experience!)&gt; ENFPs are horrible at reading social signals

No

&gt;and sending out clear ones

Yes

(IME)

Sorry for the late reply!

*If* I understand it correctly (and I'd love to hear your input, especially if I am wrong), for Ni doms there is a *mass* of information in their heads that is sometimes blurry or chaotic, always kind of...buzzing at the back of their minds, not always understandable to even the Ni doms themselves unless they choose to focus on it, either by writing it down or talking it out, or even just taking the time to ponder over it alone. That mass of information/connections is *always there*, but it is not always *consciously accessible*, and Ni users require either alone time, or conversations with someone they know well, to anchor down these impressions, or they might experience something alike to mental overload. But usually/on good days the Ni 'impressions' (the mass of stored information and the connections between it) can be an extremely useful...guiding light/source of inspiration (this is the very vague impression I have of dom. Ni right now).

And then Ji dominance, by contrast, is like building an understanding of the world from bottom up. There is less permanence in our inner worlds: of course, there are the Fi moral and Ti logical frameworks, but as far as my experience goes at least, they are often nothing more than an attempt to *make sense of the world*, almost a pretense, something to hold on to when nothing seems to make sense (because the frameworks are stable but they are still just models of the world, they are not able to explain *everything*; the real world is too complex for that). I'd say that Ji dominance is like trying to draw a circle on a graph paper (or in MS Paint): the Ji user attempts to define every point of the circle, or to come up with a certain system to draw the circle, but the accuracy of their 'drawing' (i.e., the Ji framework) is limited by the grid: the resulting drawing will be circle-*like*, maybe it will seem indistinguishable from a circle if you don't look at it too carefully, but if you zoom in on the drawing you will see that it is not smooth and perhaps *not like a circle at all*. So Ji lacks the accuracy (the incoming data is not just taken in 'as is', but forced into a framework, thus losing some of its details), permanence and unity/cohesion of the Pi worldview. And I know that dom. Ni often seems chaotic to Ni users themselves, and perhaps not cohesive at all, but what I mean here is that there always *is* that net of perceptions to fall back on, while Ji identity is largely based on the frameworks that they build, and thus can be easily shattered by challenging these frameworks: unless they learn to employ their Pe function and *expand* their framework instead of seeing the world in strictly black-and-white terms. This could also be why (immature?) Fi users are often seen as conflict-prone and abrasive: they are defensive because they are afraid of their *identity* being questioned (which they may feel is happening if someone questions their views--perhaps there is a certain insecurity in an inability to separate oneself from one's views...I know that I often fall in that trap myself).

Okay, so how does it all relate to communication? I think that Pi doms are much more likely to approach a conversation with an 'open mind' and take in information, to ask questions, to not make (often inaccurate) assumptions, while Ji will naturally try to categorize, to place into a framework, to *understand*, which maybe works with Se (which *does* perceive information in an unfiltered way), but Ne-Si functions are much more subjective, less accurate perceivers. INPs' use of Ji+Si makes for a *very* biased view of the reality; I have to constantly second-guess my own perceptions: 'did it really just happen or did I just *want* it to happen, so I imagined that it did?' It requires a large amount of reflection to remain objective(-seeming) with the Fi-Si combination, and in conversations I have to always remind myself to not make any unfair assumptions, to not imagine things that are just not there.

&gt; Wondering where the line is between growth and trying to change something core to your actual self

You are probably right. I am just trying to get rid of certain negative/toxic thought patterns in myself (not MBTI related), and I guess I am looking for any sort of guidelines everywhere. I do sometimes feel like I have to rebuild my way of thinking from nothing to get rid of the negativity I have acquired over my life, so I have been so interested in MBTI (which provides information on these 'building blocks').I can't wait! Although it already feels like Christmas here. We have the snow, and I bought some gingerbread cookies, and now I am listening to my favorite winter album. I am such a sap for Christmasy things. I cleaned the snow this morning, and realized that it had been a futile activity five minutes after I had finished doing that, but do I care? No, because cleaning snow is great!!

I might make some mulled wine later for maximum Christmas feels.&gt; I've never really seen anything about INFP/ESTP friendships

I have an ESTP friend, and he's very fun. I went on a trip outside the country a few weeks ago with him and two other friends, and I guess it would have been much less exciting (more sitting in our apartment, less adventures) without him.

Though I do sometimes get the impression that he's half amused and half exasperated about the things I say or do.
I agree with this!

It reminds me of a discussion we had in a literature class in late middle school or early high school. We had just read Romeo and Juliet, and our teacher asked us to define what 'love' meant to us. 

So there we were, a class of teenagers trying to clumsily define love, when one of them said 'love is nothing but a chemical reaction'.

Which, fair enough. It is a valid answer. And I can understand why middle school discussions about love might not seem particularly interesting/enlightening to someone. But the same thing continues past middle school: okay, you dismissed the question with a straightforward answer. But you missed out on a potentially interesting discussion about how 'love' (or whatever else is the topic of the discussion) has been defined throughout history, what it means from a psychological standpoint, what is its cultural significance etc. Not interested in that? Again, fair enough, but why don't you tell us more about love from a biological perspective? Even if it's nothing more than a chemical reaction, *that* is also an idea that can be elaborated on past one sentence.

And the same is true from the other viewpoint, as well: somebody told you something that you disagree with on an emotional level. *Fair enough*, but there is value in considering that statement beyond a purely emotional reaction. Do you find the statement disagreeable? It could be interesting to analyze what causes this discomfort, what exactly is the reason behind you not being able to accept that argument on an emotional level (by the way, I respect the fact that some people feel uncomfortable talking about certain topics, and I do not advise pushing on when there's clear discomfort: here I am talking about people who disagree with something 'just because'). I think that we'd all benefit from being exposed to more people whose views we find unacceptable or just boring and trying to listen and understand their reasoning behind these views.&gt; For instance, a purely rational fact driven theorum won't do much for someone who is an F-dom unless they are either told of the implications that affect people or can find it out themselves.

I'd replace 'implications that affect people' with simply 'implications of the theorum', and then I think this would be the most eloquent way in which I have seen someone explain the differences between thinkers and feelers (as far as it relates to my own experience at least).


&gt;Has any thinking dominant had the audacity to proclaim that they understand the depth of feeling? 

I haven't heard any thinker proclaim that (but then again, I have also never heard any feeler type proclaim the opposite), but I think that they absolutely *can* 'understand the depth of feeling'. I am thinking of an ENTJ friend here: a person with an *inferior* feeling function.  Will they approach the topic differently from feeling doms? Absolutely. Will 'feeling subjects' be something that's usually pushed away as unimportant in favor of 'thinking subjects'? Probably. But I think that both feelers and thinkers absolutely *can* have an in-depth understanding of both value and logical systems.This is something that I have also noticed and I agree but:

&gt; So it's accepted that Thinkers will be very shit at comforting people, but it's not well accepted that Feelers would do poorly at, say, physics. 

I'd say that *largely* it is thinkers *themselves* who perpetuate the 'bad at feelings' stereotype (often in a very meme-y form), while feelers mostly have to deal with accusations of irrationality from the thinkers (and it is much less likely that they will bond over being 'bad at thinking'...with a few exceptions). So yes, there is an unequal distribution of virtues/weaknesses in the community, but I think that because there is a larger amount of people who identify as thinkers than feelers here, this trend probably largely reflects thinkers' own thoughts about their (and feelers') strengths and weaknesses.I have been Te'd!

He was a typical Ti-dom kid, though. It's very likely that it was really a case of 'middle school discussions about love [not being] particularly interesting/enlightening' to him. And despite what it might seem like, I was not even really comparing feelers' vs. thinkers' approach to discussions in my comment, I was just responding to the idea that different people value different things when it comes to conversations, and that it is easy to dismiss the other person's argument just because they prefer a different communication style (rational vs. emotional, straight-to-the-point vs. more elaborate etc.)

&gt; Of course, I think it's arguable that our pal Jung had a Thinking bias himself. ;)

What, with that glowing extraverted feeling description? No way!

**Edit:** But wait, if feelers are 'not adept at thinking' but also dismiss 'feeling topics' with reductionistic, 'nothing but' answers, then what *are* feelers even good at? \#existentialcrisis

Thank you for the reply!

Yes, I was probably unfair against Si: I was talking about it from the perspective of my own use of it as a Fi dom. Obviously, it is Fi (as a judging function), and not Si, which makes these (oftentimes inaccurate) judgments. I only mentioned Si because it, being lower in the stack than my Fi, is always dependent on/subject to my use of introverted feeling. I'm sure that it is different with Si doms.

 &gt; To be blunt here, from my perception it's like a little tin god

I see where you're coming from, but I think that it comes down to the confidence one has in their own judgements. I could see an overly confident Ji dom feeling god-like, because from their perspective perhaps the fact that they built their own understanding of the world means that it is 'their world' now? I definitely do not feel that way, but it could be because I recognize the uncertainty of my own judgements and that there is a much wider world beyond whatever I construct in my mind.

&gt; She has told me that I don't fit into her Si experience base. [..] who/what I actually am has been for her so improbable as to be discarded as infinitesimally low in the probability array

I don't think that I understand this. Could you explain, please?

&gt; I feel like as vastly different as Ni and Si are (and they are)

I know that this is a very broad topic, so feel free to disregard this question, but what would you say are the main differences between Ni and Si? I have realized that I've probably been viewing these functions through my 'dominant judging function' perspective, so I might be completely wrong in my assessment of them. Namely, my question is: if both functions *just perceive*, without any additional processing (by themselves), then how exactly do they differ? Is it that they actually perceive different *levels* of information (the actual realty vs. what Jung called the 'collective unconscious')?

&gt;It's like she doesn't want to submit to the larger world's reality, but rather wants to control her own perception by her own choices. Does that make sense?

I wish it didn't ;)


&gt; As for second-guessing, am I remembering correctly that you're an enneagram 6? If so, it seems to me (as I think about it now) that you're basically applying the 6 scepticism/doubt to the INFP self-frameworks on which you stand in terms of information processing. 

That's a very interesting idea! I think it might just be true.


&gt; The crowd I roll with simply wouldn't expect it from me that I'm into some pseudo-scientific analytic psychology from the early 20th century by a crackpot named Carl Jung!

Do as I do: surround yourself with more people who *would* absolutely expect you to be into some pseudo-scientific analytic psychology from the early 20th century by a crackpot named Carl Jung!&gt;And I wonder if the 6 in you is kind of longing for that net of perception as something perhaps more certain, something more to be relied upon, than your own frameworks/judgements?

That is true. Though I wouldn't say that I would like to lose my tendency of second-guessing; it is rather a desire to find, for one, stability (not a stability in the physical environment but more like...some mental anchors that I could always rely on when nothing makes sense), but, more importantly, some larger-than-life meaning, something that goes beyond my current understanding of the world. It's very possible that I am just idealizing the Ni-Se functions, but I just can't shake off the *very uneasy* feeling that I will never get to experience life 'as it truly is', on that (*to me*) almost mystical level to which Ni-Se users get to experience it because my view of the reality is limited by viewing it through the Fi constructs that I have built. And I am not just talking about Ni here: I was reading the 'inferior Se experiences' thread, and I realized that I have never even *perceived* the world without any additional processing/imposing my own subjective experiences on that perception (and that's just when compared to inferior Se, I can't even imagine what it would be like to be a Se dom).

I am sorry, this is probably a very 'the grass is greener on the other side' view of it all, it's just interesting to me that something that is so commonplace to you is so alien and fascinating to me (and others, as evidenced by all the threads asking to and attempting to explain Ni).

&gt; So it isn't any sort of solution to the 6 anxiety about having something solid to stand on

Have you found that solid ground in your life (if you don't mind sharing)? Has there been *any* time when you have felt completely at peace?

&gt; So again, the INFP had information coming from me that was outside of her Fi-Si reference points that told her "how the world works," and "how people are"

Thank you for sharing the examples. I relate to this process, and it's also easy for me to get stuck into the 'negative past experiences shaping my understanding of the current situation' trap, *but* if my Ne does not automatically provide different perspectives, I am *mostly* capable of consciously reminding myself that there is something beyond my perception of the world. Obviously, I don't know the INFP in your life, but I am curious (again, only if you're comfortable sharing): how did you see Ne in her? I don't know how you feel about the idea of going beyond the set function stacks, but is it possible that her Si might be stronger than her Ne?

&gt; My Ni-dom landscape, though, isn't something I can physically take someone to or into, at least not with the way our brains and bodies are trained in the dominant cultural system in which I live

Very interesting. Is there *any* way in which you *could* take someone into your landscape (perhaps if it was possible to 'untrain' the person's brain/body...with their consent, of course)?

When you say 'the dominant cultural system in which [you] live', do you mean the USA or Western Europe (I do not want to make the assumption that *everyone* on here comes from 'the Western world', as I myself live in Eastern Europe, but the majority of people here *do* come from the West)? If so, do you think that there is some *Eastern* philosophy/spiritual practice/... that could help a person who does not use Ni to access that landscape? 

&gt; Ha! Found it! Dark Orbit, by Carolyn Ives Gilman.

That sounds like a very interesting book! I'll try to find an online copy, if that's possible (*shipping* physical copies to my country has always been a long and bothersome process).

&gt; she has a sense of "her world" as the most central and reliable, and/or valuable to herself, reality for herself in a much wider world 

I wonder (although this a question that is barely related to the part of your comment I quoted, and more of a thought in relation to our whole discussion): what do you think about ideas like individualism, finding your own meaning in life and living according to it and similar concepts? Is it something that appeals to you at all, or do you see it as something inherently selfish//as over-emphasing the importance of the individual?&gt;ISFP: The one who dies first

Wait, why would the ISFP die before the INFP?...

&gt;INFP: The one who sacrifices themselves

...ah, okay. It checks out.&gt; I think it is pretty likely that you're idealizing the Ni-Se functions to some extent at least.

Ahh. You're right. I tend to idealize things that I don't understand, and it feels like the process of trying to understand Ni has been very 'one step forward, two steps back' for me.

(I *know* that I should probably stop trying to understand it, but I am vaguely *uncomfortable* with having a large blob of (often contradictory) information about Ni that I have gathered from reading theoretical descriptions, interacting with Ni users, etc., and not being able to put it all into a single understanding, however generalized, of introverted intuition)

Here's a question: when you first read the descriptions of Ni, did you immediately recognize it in yourself? Or did it take some time? More generally speaking, do you think that introverted intuition is so unmistakably different from all other ways of perceiving the world that the description (provided that it is an accurate one) will definitely resonate with Ni users, or is using introverted intuition so organic to NJs that it takes serious reflection to identify Ni in one's stack?

&gt;I have experienced flashes of whatever it is in me that 6s desire that we try to make up for with our quest for solid ground. 

So have I (although rarely). For me, it came from a combination of being in a comfortable place (physically and mentally), from being around people I trusted and from feeling engulfed by kindness/gentleness and the beauty of the world. I wonder if you have had the same experience? I felt secure in a very literal sense, but I also briefly felt very close to complete satisfaction with the world.

&gt;from what I can tell, sustained infusions of wanderer-experiences are what she really needs to keep Ne balanced and healthy in herself.

I can relate go this. I'll admit that I like familiar sensations and comfortable places (possibly in an attempt to replicate the feeling I described above), but I can't remain in this state indefinitely. I feel a need to go out in the world and soak up new impressions, and *then* I can return to my headspace and mull over these impressions.

&gt; Is there anything you do that helps keep your Ne active and healthy in you?

There is the need for 'wanderer-experiences', which provide me with actual new sensations/impressions (and in which I tend to indulge relatively often), but in my day-to-day life I am satisfied with the long-ish walks I have to take to and from university. While the actual route does not change, it is not important to me because I am completely unfocused to the external environment and instead 'play around' with the new information I have gathered that day. I really enjoy (and require) that time of the day when I am completely unrestricted to explore (and 'feel out') the new information.

&gt;And makes me want to win the lottery, give her a chunk of it, and say "Go! Enjoy! Send me a postcard every so often if you feel like it!"

This is very cute. :)
 
&gt; New Age stuff being a good example of the ick in that regard, IMO

I feel the same ick when it comes to New Age stuff.

&gt;Hmmm [..]

A very interesting view, thank you...I relate (perhaps unsurprisingly) to the importance the INFP you know assigns to individualism, but I think that I understand where you are coming from.

I'd consider INFP and ISxJ.

I see strong Si and strong 'feeling' which seems Fi-*like* (so both INFP and ISTJ seem like good options), *but* I also see a lot of Fe-like tendencies, and it seems like you approach 'feeling topics' in the slightly detached, analytical Fe-Ti manner.Hmm yes, the highly distinct choices of blue vs. dark blue vs. darker blue vs. muddy blue. :pHah, that's a good one.

No wonder that ENTP is called the funniest type!yoBut! I was serious! Every ENTP I have met has been funny. You are funny, no matter what your type is (I read about your typing troubles)!

I don't even know what I wanted to say with my original comment.Blocked on copyright grounds in my country lmao.

Is FOX run by oppressive Fe types?

&gt; if it makes you feel better I think most people are referring to Fe when they talk about "feelers" 

To be fair, bringing other types down in defense of mine does not really make me feel better.

&gt;When at no point was that explicitly said, and I doubt it was intended.

What seems more likely to you: that the ENTP came here to make a quip about feeler types, or to give genuine advice about interacting with feelers while avoiding conflict? I am asking sincerely: I think that the first option is far more likely, but then again I am a feeler type and am well aware that I search for, and attach meaning to words beyond their literal sense: sometimes to my own detriment, when there is, in fact, no hidden meaning behind the words.

But! I don't think that it's fair to attribute this difference in communication—taking things at face value vs. searching for hidden meaning—to the F/T division, at least not entirely. In fact, looking for meaning beyond what's explicitly stated is exactly what you did by assuming that TheSilverString's comment was sarcasm: what if they *actually* believe that their 'emotional feeler brain can't handle a rational conversation with someone with differing viewpoints'? Why did you read this comment as sarcasm, but were willing to take OP's post at face value (as a genuine observation about 'hanging out with feelers')?

Feel free to ignore this comment if you think that the 'search for hidden meaning vs. take things at face value' division falls along the lines of TiFe vs. FiTe (instead of T/F): in that case, I still think that it is an oversimplification of the issue but at least you'd fall in the 'search for meaning' group and this comment would make more sense. &gt; This is interesting - for me it isn't tied to the visible world around (place, mental state, people).

I suspected that my 'search for solid ground' would be satisfied in a much more physical way than yours: maybe it comes down to the difference between Ni and Si? Does your ISTJ girlfriend seek comfort in pleasant physical experiences?

Also! I find it very interesting that you consider 'mental state' to be part of the visible world. Thinking about it now, maybe it's because there's not much *beyond* my mental states *that I can access*? (Note that I am **not** saying that there is nothing beyond my mental constructs, it's just that I lead with introverted judging, while my introverted perceiving function (Si) is focused on the visible world, so I am not sure *how* it would be possible to access anything that's not tied to the visible world for me).

&gt;What kinds of wanderer-experience do you seek out/engage in when you d that part of your process, do you have any examples of what you've done?

Hmm, it's quite often literally wandering, getting lost (easy, as I am usually very unfocused on the physical world—the physical experiences I enjoy from time to time are just a way to anchor myself at times of stress) and then tasking myself with finding my way back.

Also, searching out new impressions in music, art and literature: I actually used to be closed off to media that did not fit in my strictly defined borders of 'good art', but in the last years I have found great enjoyment in art I'd have never expected myself to like before.

Then, looking for new experiences (ideally, experiences that resonate with me on an emotional level). Two examples: yesterday, I ended up going to a gospel music concert with a friend (we started out with no plan for the evening). Today, I watched a documentary about mass deportations to Siberia in the USSR (this was a planned event).

Is this what you meant 'wanderer experiences'? I might be looking at the question too literally. What are the wanderer experiences like for the INFP you know?

Also, for what it's worth, in case you're still interested in how INFPs process information (although obviously I do not claim or wish to represent all INFPs): the documentary I watched was very emotionally impactful to me for several reasons (firstly just because it was a good documentary, but also because it tied in with family history *and* my perhaps very irrational fears about my country's/family and friends'/my own future as an Eastern European living in a world where Russia/NATO relations are what they are now), so after watching the movie I went into a stupor-like state where it was extremely difficult for me to form responses to any of the questions I was asked or to participate in discussion with my fellow moviegoers because internally I was actively engaged in the process of reshifting/reframing/expanding my view of some of the values/beliefs that had been challenged by the documentary. It was quite a taxing process, both mentally and emotionally, and it put me in a high-strung state that I am still at now, several hours later. I am not sure if it's Fi or E6 related (or independent of both), though: have you experienced anything similar?Roughly:

Freedom

Compassion

Knowledge

Happiness

Humor

Solitude

Adventure

Faith

Creativity

Honesty

Justice

Popularity

Power

WealthI think that he is an INFP, yes.

IMO, it may not be fair to try to determine an author's type based on the fiction that they have written, but I read his novel *The First Man*, which is at least semi-autobiographical, and it seemed quite Fi-Ne to me. (At the very least, he's almost definitely an IxxP).

&gt; A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.

This seems like Fi ;)My attempt to explain how I see it: Si users, or at least high Si users, don't just perceive the world as it is; all the incoming perceptions pass through a filter of subjective associations related to the observed object, so Si users don't really 'see the world', they *see themselves watching the world*. It's almost a third person view, and there is a level of detachment to this perception.

I mean, at least that's how it is for me (tertiary Si, I think), but I would love to hear other people's input.

(I think that [this](http://i.imgur.com/gY7kF9N.png) picture from the /r/dpdr subreddit that was linked in the comments is an even more accurate visual representation of how it feels *to me*, but it probably differs from person to person).&gt; "I send you so many videos on Facebook because you like cats so much, and I like to show you I'm thinking of you. I don't comment too much, do I? Good, because I'm gonna keep doing it."

So freaking cute.

xSFJs can be some of the sweetest, most genuinely selfless people that there are.Glad I could help you!

Yeah, his autobiography really showed that he's a Ji dom imo (and if we suppose that our childhoods are the time when we experience our dominant function in its purest form (as the other functions haven't been fully developed yet), then it kind of makes sense why I'm so sure about him being IxxP but can't really tell what his auxiliary function is just based on the biography).

And if you're interested in the differences between Fi and Fe, then it could be interesting to compare the main character in *The First Man* with the main character of *In Search of Lost Time* (who is, in my opinion, an ISFJ). Reading both books shortly one after another when I was struggling to decide between the ISFJ and INFP types for myself really helped to settle on the INFP type.&gt; This inspires me to have the idea that this can be generalized to all the introverted functions in their domain of concern:

Yeah, I had seen this image in different contexts and I thought that it was something that all introverted people could relate to, but, looking through this thread, it seems like NJs and ENxPs (inferior Si) are mostly  confused by the image and do not understand what it conveys (at least not on a level of personal experience).

&gt; where "looking at yourself" would mean a rather explicit self-awareness of the process and a "third person" perspective of seeing how you relate to it and how it impacts you

Yeahhh I understand where you are coming from (as a Fi dom, I definitely relate to the 'explicit self-awareness of the [evaluation] process'), but you use Ti and Ni...as a Si user, at least for me, it's not just about viewing my thought process from a 'third person' perspective, it is also *quite literally* about how I view the physical world (although [this](http://i.imgur.com/gY7kF9N.png) picture describes it slightly more accurately).

As a Se-Ni user...do you see the *physical world* in this way?&gt; There was even someone in a Skype group that I'm a part of, and he assumed that I like beer because I'm an Se user.

Do you like beer, though?No, it was clear, I was just joking!

Stereotyping is fun! And SPs really do tend to like beer. ;)I usually pay more attention to the lyrics, but I do not judge them by the same criteria as I would a poem; I focus on *how* the words are sung and not the content of the lyrics. There is probably not a single song to which I know all of the lyrics from the beginning to the end, but I notice and appreciate nuances (such as how the singer's voice breaks while singing a certain line, for example).

(I think this may be a difference between [NiSe and SiNe](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/216-Art-Movements-by-Quadra): 'In music, literature, or other arts that involve a sequence over time, [..] Ni/Se is reflected in an emphasis on a narrative (long-term storyline) or formal quality (e.g., individual moments may seem bland except when seen as as building up towards something or playing a role within a larger architecture), whereas **Si/Ne is reflected in more momentary emphasis (e.g., compelling sensuous details, interesting clever ideas, playing with language and surface more than with long-term form)**.')

I don't remember *always* having liked lyrics, though, I think that my appreciation of them might be a learned trait (people like to sing a lot where I live, and they often sing the same songs, so I started paying more attention to the lyrics, *and* one of the ways I learned English (and continue learning other languages now) was by looking up and translating the words of the songs I heard and liked).

I have also noticed that Ti doms are often musically gifted and tend to focus on the instruments and the rhythm of the music.&gt;sarcastic

&gt;weird humor

Forget about ENTPs, I think that ISTJs might be the funniest type there is. All of the ISTJs I know have a wonderfully dry, sardonic sense of humor which I love.&gt; I'm my own

That's Fi style thinking; I told you that you should join the INFPs. :pNot at all! I think that ISTJ is the most underappreciated type there is; their descriptions really fail to show the diversity of the type. They are hilarious, and their sense of humor is understated, which I often appreciate more than the in-your-face Ne-dom style of humor (as much as I like the ENxPs in my life).&gt;"boring old ISTJs"

Yeah, that's just a stereotype. I know two very talented artists who are ISTJs (one might be an ESTJ), my dad is an ISTJ and has traveled half of the world because of his job, my favorite teacher at school (she taught literature and is one of the funniest people I know) is an ISTJ, one of my closest friends is an ISTJ...not a single one of these people are like the other, and none of them resemble the 'boring rule follower' stereotype (if anything, many of them resemble INxPs).
Hah, I had a biology teacher (I think that she might be an INTP), and she loved these kind of stories. She once told us about a birthday event that she had attended, and how everybody was making some BBQ near the lake, except for a couple who had gone to a smoke sauna. When people noticed that they had disappeared for several hours, they went looking for them, and discovered that they had died!

'Today we are going to talk about carbon monoxide poisoning!'

She always told the stories with a half-amused smirk, and the 'punchline' always left the class confused about what we should do (do we express sympathy? Do we just move on and pretend that nothing happened?) The way the stories were delivered in an almost deadpan manner actually made it hard to not laugh out loud, it was almost like a comedy routine, except for the fact that they all seemed like real events that had happened to her.


&gt;This seems pretty damn similar to how the INFP in my life experiences lyrics.

It's actually difficult for me to *not* focus on the lyrics. I might hear a song that I like in its entirety except for one line that stands out in an unpleasant way for some reason, and I will be very unlikely to include that song in my collection.

That said, I do appreciate songs where the words are stretched out to the point where they're unrecognizable (see, for instance, [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k1DxDmnrbbI) song performed by a chamber choir; I *know* the words to the song, but the *way* they're sung allows me to focus on the overall sound of the song).

&gt;But more directly, I do feel like "flow over time" (not sequence for me, but flow) is part of what music is for me.

I understand the appeal of 'flow' in music, but I have found that it's hard for me to enjoy music that has the same flow for more than 5-7 minutes. I can't really appreciate albums that are supposed to be listened to in full for this reason, and, while I like orchestral music (and instrumental music in general), it's hard for me to listen to full symphonies.

&gt;The sound becomes the context for the lyrics. The flow over time becomes the context for specific moments in the sound.

For me, I'd say that the melody is the frame for the lyrics (or rather, for the 'word sounds'). In instrumental music, I usually need to find something to focus on, such as the way the sound builds up or any associations I create with the music.

(Edited to add:) I sometimes add instrumental music to my collection, but, however much I might like that piece, I find myself never listening to that song again, and always skipping it when it comes on. I think that it's because listening to music is mostly a relaxing activity to me, but I have to focus on instrumental music to create imagery, and it can even be slightly draining if it's a longer piece. It's funny, lyrics are probably distracting to other people, but for me, it is the *lack* of lyrics that's distracting.&gt; the Fi-doms I know leave a lot of space for other people's subjectivity

I don't know a lot of other Fi doms, but I know quite a few ExFPs, and I completely agree. I know that there is a perception that high Fi users are argumentative/abrasive, but I think that Fi users are the most likely to check for biases in their subjective value judgments (just like Ti users are likely to check for biases in their logical reasoning): theoretically, high Fi users should be the ones most likely to accept opinions that are different from their own. (This is not to say that high Fi users are flawless, not at all, their faults would just more likely be caused by a weak use of the inferior function, for example.)This is a meme comment!:o

Take care!&gt;Some Fe-Si types

&gt;"The small item is by the [insert vague area], use your eyes."

That's Se, no?&gt; My XSFJ mom 

The Meme Mom.Hah, I was thinking about my mom (ESFP) when I wrote that, too. It must be a \#momthing. How do they always know the exact location of *everything*?&gt; FPs in Gryffindor

I can have Gryffindor? :D

I still feel the betrayal after my friend sorted everyone in our friend group in the Gryffindor house back in high school, except for me and one ESTP dude who got put in the Ravenclaw house. :,(

In reality, I am a Hufflepuff, just like every IxxP should accept that they are.&gt; enneagram might be a better one to look to

Yes, I would say:

E1: Gryffindor

E2: Hufflepuff

E3: Slytherin (or Gryffindor)

E4: Don't put a label on them! But probably Slytherin

E5: Ravenclaw (ofc)

E6: Gryffindor (the counterphobic 6)

E7: Gryffindor

E8: Slytherin

E9: Hufflepuff

Also, I haven't read Harry Potter, so I am basing my perception of the houses entirely on memes. 


Is he an ISTP?No. In fact, I become weak around them.For me personally:

The easiest: Se, Fe

Easy: Ne, Te

Harder: Ti, Fi

The hardest: Ni, Si&gt;who I'm pretty sure is an isfp, except for the fact he's super flirty

Hah! :D

Anyway, Se=flirting function. ISFPs are like INFPs who can flirt.I don't know, I think that it was a very accurate description.&gt; INTP

Surely you can't be serious!

(Actually, I am not sure. You obviously know more about Jung than I do. And Thinking dominance-auxiliary Intuiton makes a lot of sense, I think. And his thinking almost definitely seems introverted. I just can't see his intuition as extraverted.)

By the way, I have been trying to determine a guy friend's type for a while and I also can't decide between INTP and ISTP. Did you ever consider the ISTP type for yourself, and if yes, what made you decide against it?My mom's an ESFP. It's an experience.This is great, thanks!

Yeah, I think that INTP makes sense for Jung. I suggested ISTP mainly because I read a description of his childhood in some biography of his, and he actually seemed like an ISP type there. Quite oriented towards the physical world, despite his dominant Ti. And then the function descriptions in Psychological Types are actually quite literal (behavioristic), if slightly verbose.

But yes, INTP makes sense, given the particular circumstances.

My ISTP friend definitely has what seems to be a strong Se, but he also has some very abstract/esoteric interests, and has had since I have known him (15/16). I think he fits the ISTP description more, though.

&gt;Both are great at critical, amused eyebrow raises, which the INTP accompanies with a side-eye and the ISTP accompanies with pursed lips. 100% proven to work this is my magnum opus of type worship me.

hah, I know exactly what you're talking about with regards to the eyebrow raises, but I haven't met him in a while so I can't remember if he accompanies it with a side-eye or pursed lips. I think he does both? I should organize a meeting him and carefully observe his face lol.

also, I already worshiped you so this changes nothing
Me.

In the personality tests that I have taken, I almost never answer 'fully agree' or 'fully disagree' to any of the questions. It seems like a too definite answer, so in a test with several dozens of questions, I will probably strongly agree or disagree with just one or two answers.

In the 16personalities test, that one thing is 'If someone does not respond to your e-mail quickly, you start worrying if you said something wrong'. That's the thing that defines me as a person. My stupid anxiety over 'what it meaaans' if somebody does not respond to my e-mail. :p&gt; Secretly promiscuous is one thing, openly flirty is another.

Hah, this reminds me of the ['how the types flirt'](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5eb0cp/how_the_types_flirt/) (obviously stereotypes but pretty accurate stereotypes, IME :p):

"ISFP: Don't pay attention to me (please pay attention to me \*single tear)"Yay, just on the day when I am staying home! :D

I am not going to remove my flair, as you have already typed me several times in the past (I just want someone to suggest any other type than INFP or ISFJ for me...I need change D:)

Also, I have a headache, so I will not be as rambly as usual. I'll treat this as a multiple choice test. :p

&gt;A. Age, gender, and nationality

20/F/Latvia (with this demographic information, my [future](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail-order_bride) is already determined for me :p)

&gt;B. What kinds of things do you remember easily? What kinds of things do you usually forget?

Remember: information about academic theories (the gist of it), general principles

Forget: interesting facts, sensory information, step-by-step instructions, tasks to do, 'life lessons' (I never learn!)

Depends on my personal attachment to the information: details in personal stories, specific things people said, plots of characters in fiction, details about people

&gt; What kind of people do you feel most comfortable around? What kind of people make you feel awkward or uncomfortable?

Comfortable: chaotic, chill, confused, confusing, deep, emotional, friendly, oblivious, sensitive

Uncomfortable: amoral, bossy, can't compromise, fake, immature, rude, says what people want to hear, shallow

No preference: constantly changing their mind, embarrassing, loud, messy, neat freak, nitpicking details of what you said, off in lala land, outgoing, quiet, rational, shy, silly, simple, sloppy, smooth, snobbish, social chameleon

&gt; How do you usually handle interpersonal conflict or confrontation? How do you wish you handled it - what would you change about your usual approach if you wanted to improve?

Usually handle: withdraw into myself. 'Let's ignore that this ever happened'.

Wish I handled: acknowledge disagreement in a polite and friendly manner without imposing my own views on anyone, hopefully come to a compromise through a conversation where it's not about who's 'right' or who's wrong but about two (or more) people working together for the best solution (that's the dream :D).

&gt;How physically expressive are you?

Hardly expressive at all, unless I am very, very comfortable with the other person.

&gt;How talkative are you? Do you generally prefer to speak or listen?

I tend to be quiet. But there are rare moments when you'll catch me excitedly rambling about something that I am passionate about.

&gt;When you do speak, how loud or quiet are you?

Interesting question! I am mostly quiet, I think, people tend to ask me to speak up sometimes. *But* there was one classmate back in middle/high school who literally taught me to speak louder, and I think largely because of him I am much more open to people than I used to be, and I also sometimes catch myself talking loudly even when I hadn't intended to.

&gt;How "in the moment" do you tend to be - do you feel engaged with people or events around you, or more removed?

*Never* in the moment. It's actually kind of disappointing for me: I enjoy looking for new experiences, but I am always one level removed from them, never actually engaged fully. 

&gt;Do people think of you as more emotional or more rational?

I am very feelsy, apparently. I think people IRL see me as less of an obvious feeler, though (my Fi--if it is Fi--being more hidden)

&gt;Are you generally goofier or more serious?

Serious on the outside, goofy inside.

&gt;Do you stumble on your words? Do you think faster than you speak? Do you skip around to new topics, or skip to the next sentence? Or do you speak evenly and carefully?

Yes x3 and no.

&gt;Do you often forget what you were going to say?

Quite often, yes.

&gt;How often do you get excited? How do you act?

I would say that I tend to go through longish (several weeks) periods of a neutral-happy mood and periods of neutral-sad mood. In the neutral-happy period, I will usually feel from quietly content to exhilarated, but rarely sad, and in the neutral-sad periods I will usually feel from quietly dissatisfied to deeply depressed, but rarely happy.

&gt;How often do you get bored? How do you act?

From time to time. And I find something to do. The 'something' can also be simple introspection.

&gt;Are you often fidgety, average, or particularly still?

Very fidgety.

&gt;Do you find it easy or hard to get moving after a period of rest?

Rather difficult. Unless I am excited for what's to come.

&gt;Do you get antsy? If so, is it because you just want to "get moving", or is it more about feeling pressure to "be productive"?

I want to get moving.

&gt;How do you feel about spending a whole day just resting and not being productive at all? How often do you do that?

Me and you (as an ExxJ) probably have very different definitions of 'not doing anything (productive) at all'. :p

&gt; F. What kinds of things do you seem to notice more than most people? What do you more often seem to miss?

How other people are feeling (IRL). Miss: the physical world.

&gt; Analyzing and improving on complex intellectual theories

Okay in short bursts (I used to participate in a lot of mathematics competitions back in the day. Does that count? They lasted about 2 hours on average.)

&gt;Analyzing people's behaviors, feelings, intentions, and social roles (e.g. playing an RPG or gossiping). 

Okay in short bursts. Much more excited by this if I find the other person interesting, otherwise I'm rather indifferent (although I somehow ended up being the person that everyone told their secrets to in high school).

&gt;Analyzing the lessons or subtle meanings derived from an event or story.

This I like!

&gt;Being creative and surprising, such as through improvisation, stand-up comedy, making unique art, or writing a story.

Depends on the field. Only if I am allowed to do it in private and there is no pressure put on me.

&gt;Brainstorming multiple different ideas or possible approaches to a problem.

I am okay at this.

&gt;Comforting and providing emotional support to people one-on-one.

I wish I was better at doing it!

&gt;Completing tasks using pre-existing knowledge or instructors' expertise (familiar grammar drills, investigating evidence, building own furniture).

I mean, I can do it without a problem! I would just probably not find it very exciting.

&gt;Doing deep personal exploration, perhaps through journaling or art.

That's the fuel I run on. But I don't usually put my thoughts into a physical form (art or journaling).

&gt;Familiar daily tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc.

Again, I can do it and will do it, but it's not something I really enjoy. (No, wait, I like cooking. But that's because I used to take my little sis home from school and cook for us, and sticking to two or three recipes would get boring fast.)

&gt;Fighting for a social cause that's very important to you (protesting, writing, volunteering, etc.)

I do this quite often (through voluntary work). It's something that I really enjoy doing, too, but I wish I could do more and have a bigger impact.

&gt;Figuring out complex problems by looking at examples (new grammar drills, analyzing body language, IKEA furniture).

I like this.

&gt;Helping people smooth over a conflict.

I am pretty much useless at this (I wish I could do it, though: it could be very useful quite often for me).

&gt;Investigating unknown chains of cause and effect.

Cool!

&gt;Making personal or detailed aesthetic choices (decorating a cake, planning a sibling's birthday party, taking portraits of loved ones).

Nooo. But I enjoy looking at other people's work.

&gt;Making predictions or guesses about how things or likely to turn out or what will happen next.

I do that, but I am kind of terrible at it.

&gt;Making widely-appealing, popular aesthetic choices (putting together a fashion show, planning a work/school event, flipping a house).

Nah. (But again, I can appreciate other people's work).

&gt;Navigating complex systems and rules (bureaucracy, legal code, corporate culture).

Quite boring to me.

&gt;Physical activities that involve reacting quickly to unpredictable situations.

Lol no.

&gt;Physical activities that rely on a lot of practice and repetition to perfect.

I can do it! If I am allowed to do it on my own and at my own pace!

&gt;Putting together informative projects.

Cool.

&gt;Researching and writing reports.

I like this!

&gt;Solving challenging analytical puzzles.

Fun, but not for extended periods of time.

&gt;Supervising a large group of people and delegating tasks.

I don't like doing it, but somehow I have become the unofficial leader among my university mates when it comes to projects.

&gt;Teaching or explaining things to people.

Yes, I like it!

&gt;Working on a difficult, "unsolvable" problem.

It's something that sounds great in theory, but in reality my attention span is too short.
&gt;sorry to disappoint, but I think INFP sounds very reasonable 

Aaarggh!! :D

I think I need to accept my fate! Thanks a lot, really! You know that I like these posts! :)I haven't taken the MBTI test in Latvian (or any other language that I know), but I I took [this](http://www.watchwordtest.com) Jungian word association test, and, iirc, it typed me as an INFJ in English and ESFP in Latvian.

Also, I took a Sociotype test in Russian for \#authenticity, and it said that I was Byron (I think? Whoever was the ISFj/ISFP type).I am the same way, but I am also a hypocrite.That's what every Eastern European woman wants to do in her life. Haven't you seen the ads?

I already made my profile.Long time no see! :DAll of this reads like ISTJ to me.I'll focus on /r/INFP in my reply, because that's the subreddit I am the most familiar with.

1) I think that each type's subreddit will seem a bit like a caricature of that type because people will participate in more diverse discussions on other subreddits, and then will come to their respective type's subreddit to post things that other people of that type might enjoy. So an INFP might discuss music in one subreddit, participate in a discussion about politics in another, talk about the MBTI theory on here, and then submit a poem/quote/discussion about their feelings on the /r/INFP subreddit because they believe that it might be something that most other INFPs would be able to relate to. People who visit the INFP subreddit, and presumably do not look at the profiles of every user on there, will only see this side of the INFP personality on the subreddit, and will perhaps assume that INFPs are *only* interested in discussing poems, or depressing quotes, or their feelings.

2) I agree with the other replies on here: *most* people will find the content that is posted in their type's subreddit to be more relatable. For instance, I might find the discussions on the ENTP subreddit to be more interesting, but I think that the content on /r/INFP is a more *sincere* exploration of feelings/thoughts. Yes, I am aware of my own biases here: I understand that an ENTP will likely view the INFPs on their subreddit as playing to a certain image (namely, that of an always depressed, overly sensitive person). While I think that the posts/comments on the types' subreddits will only showcase certain, most stereotypical aspects of their personality (see above), I believe that most INFPs will relate to the stereotypical side of an INFP more than that of an ENTP.

3) Lastly, I do not think that the expression of thoughts/feelings on each type's subreddit should be restricted in any way (within limits, of course: namely, as long it follows the site-wide and subreddit rules). I also think that, while the subreddits only display a certain side of each type's personality, that the expression of the thoughts/feelings on each subreddit *will* tend to be sincere and natural. Take the /r/INFP subreddit, for example. Many of the posts there discuss anxiety and depression. Does that mean that every INFP suffers from anxiety and depression? No, because on a theoretical level, Fi has nothing to do with emotions at all, and the 'F' answers on the letter tests only show that a person prefers harmony over competition, mercy over justice, etc. A person might test as a feeling type on the MBTI test, they might identify Fi as their dominant function, and still be perfectly happy. However, it is an easily observable fact that many of the posts/comments on the INFP subreddit *do* discuss depression and anxiety. So, apparently, there *is* a link between testing as an I, N, F, P on the letter tests, between identifying the Fi-Ne-Si-Te stack in yourself, and feeling depressed and anxious. Not every INFP will be able to relate to the posts on the INFP subreddit, of course, but if they have come to the conclusion that they're an INFP type (through a letter test, through reading about the functions or otherwise), then I think that it is much more likely that they will find the INFP posts more relatable than the ones on, say, the ESTP subreddit. And maybe INFPs come to the subreddit because they find solace in knowing that there are people who feel the same way as they do, that there are people who will be able to comfort them because they have went through the same experience and, presumably (because of the letters or the functions), even processed and dealt with that experience in a similar way.

So I *do* think that the posts/comments on each type's subreddit are sincere, even if other types might view them as playing to certain stereotypes. I think that what you see on the type subreddits is something that will naturally happen if you divide people into 16 groups, determined by certain personality traits. And I think that, if this expression  of feelings/thoughts was somehow restricted (e.g., by limiting the number of posts about depression/anxiety), there would not be more posts about the happy aspects of the INFP life. Instead, I think it's likely that there would be the same amount of people who would turn to the /r/INFP subreddit for help and support, or just a simple commiseration, it's just that they would not find any.&gt;The way I see it in a nutshell, introverts don't require anyone to be "on their side." They are perfectly comfortable being alone in the world, and they might even thrive off of this lonesomeness.

Maybe, as far as not really finding it necessary that my values coincide with other people's. *Definitely* not in the literal sense that I do not want to be around other people whom I care about and who care about me.

Also, this might not really be a distinction between extraverted and introverted types, but rather one between xxxJs and xxxPs (namely, people whose first judging function is extraverted and people whose first judging function is introverted). I think that, theoretically, IxxJs would care more about other people's support for their ideas than ExxPs would (because of Fe or Te vs. Fi or Ti).Imagine that we already do. How would it matter at all, except for it being, you know, kind of *cool* that we're nothing more than just brains in a vat? My actions would still have an effect that I perceive as being real in the simulated reality. If I kill a man, I will still perceive the consequences of my actions as being real. Even if I *found out* that we're all brains in a vat, I would still not kill the man, because the other brains would still perceive the consequences of my actions as real (if we're all experiencing the same simulated reality). The only situation in which this discovery would have a real effect on me would be if I found out that this world is a simulation created by a single (my) brain, and that the other people have no real consciousness of their own. Even then, I would not kill the hypothetical man because that's not really something I want to do lol.&gt; INFP's drive me bonkers. It's impossible to have a rational conversation with one of them about any subject which touches one of their core values.

Being liked by INTPs is one of my core values. How D^A^R^E you say that you don't get along with INFPs!&gt; I get along really well with them, and they are a lot more tolerant than INFJs.

I have observed that it is quite common in this subreddit that any defense of Fi often comes at the expense of Fe.

I am not talking about your comment specifically--your experience with INFJs is your experience--but it's an interesting trend anyway, in my opinion. 

I really don't think that Fi and Fe are two functions that can't coexist peacefully or that will necessarily clash, so I don't see the need to put myself in the 'Fi defense camp' or the 'Fe defense team' (again, I am not talking about your comment here, more so the threads where someone claims that Fi is selfish, and then other people chime in and say 'you think that Fi is selfish? Well, Fe is fake and manipulative, and not capable of being genuinely caring!' Which kind of rubs me the wrong way because surely it's not the case that half of the world is selfish, and the other half is fake, and it should be possible to defend something without putting the other side down). Besides, we all use both a Ji and a Je function, so it really shouldn't be that hard for a Fe user to understand Fi: they use Ti, and Ti is to T what Fi is to F, so it's the same process, even if the focus is different.

Sorry if this comes across as an attack on your comment, it's really not intended to be! Just a vaguely related train of thought I had.&gt; **If:**

&gt; 1. This is accurate (especially the part I bolded)

&gt; 2. The INFP in my life is correctly typed

&gt; **Then:**

&gt; Wow. I'm not human.

Hah!

If it is any consolation (or, alternatively, sorry to disappoint you but: ) I consider myself to be an INFP and I barely understand myself, much less have an impressive and effortless 'understanding of the human condition'. I think that you can still call yourself human. :)

That description sounds like something Fe, and not Fi, users would be better at, anyway.&gt; Again, sorry.

That's what *you* said. :pWhoa.

Can we do more functions as videos?

Here's [Ne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7RgN9ijwE4), [Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxTngPDNqk8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=27) and [Fi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8DepwwXx3Y&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=126).Have you considered INFJ?

ENTP *might* be an option. I don't really see anything that would indicate that you might be an INFP.Ah, I see.

One trend that I have noticed with the cognitive function tests is that they're pretty good at determining your top functions, but not necessarily the attitude (intro/extraversion) of the functions. So an INTP might get a high score at 'thinking', but it will not necessarily be introverted thinking. A common pattern that I have noticed from the test result screenshots that I have seen is that the dominant and auxiliary functions in both attitudes will often be among the top five highest functions, and the lowest functions will be your inferior and your 7th (PoLR) function. For instance, I just took the similarminds test, and these are my results:

Fi-80

Fe/Ne-65

Ti-60

Ni-55

Si-45

Te-40

Se-25

As you can see, Fi/Fe and Ni/Ne all have high scores in the test for me, and Te (my inferior function) and Se (my PoLR function) are the lowest ones for me.

So if we now look at your results, your highest functions were Ne (intuition)--&gt;Fe (feeling)--&gt;Ti (thinking), which follows the INFJ stack order (intution-feeling-thinking), even if the test said that your intuition is extraverted.
Close! [Point of least resistance!](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/167-The-Hidden-Agenda-and-Point-of-Least-Resistance-(PoLR))

Probably the most useful thing from Socionics for me personally. If you search for 'Se PoLR' in that page, you'll find discussions about INxPs' PoLR function, Se.I think I know the post that you mean. It was about typing people based on their temperament, club, etc., and also included lyrics for each grouping, right? If I remember correctly, it was one of the top posts on this subreddit a while ago--but it seems like it has been deleted now. :(&gt; Tone of voice cues me into emotional states while my eyes look nowhere in particular.

I think that I am a visual learner, but I am the same way when it comes to voices vs. facial expressions. 

I think that I can read emotions quite well in real life, but I also rely on the tone of voice and not the facial expressions. I got a pathetically low result in the 'read emotions in the eyes' test when I first took it.

Anyway, voice!! That's probably my favorite physical trait in people. The first day when I met my ENFP friend, she admitted that she took an immediate liking to me because of my voice. Might be an xNFP thing. :p:)

I have the time to go into detail about why I think you're an INFJ, rather than an ENTP now, if that's something that would interest you.

'Social activity seems like a chore at times, but I'm also good at it'--this seems like something that an introverted person with a high Fe would say.

'I'll spare someone's feelings in lieu of winning an argument.'--Fe&gt;Ti (not really a good indicator by itself, it could also be caused by your enneagram, temperament, general conflict avoidance or an array of other reasons, but generally it's something that feelers might be more likely to say than thinkers)

'I don't really let my emotions control me or my opinions/decisions either'--emotionality/sensitivity is not *really* related to being a 'thinker' or a 'feeler' functionally (although it would probably be foolish to deny that there is a strong link between these two things). Besides, INFJ is commonly considered to be the least feelery of all feeling types, possibly because of how 'detached' Ni and Ti (and even Fe, to some extent) are as functions.

'I come off as angry or upset when people first see me, but that because I'm thinking about something else. When I realize someone is trying to talk to me or is paying attention to me, I take on a more "bubbly" or happy demeanor.'--Remember that your first extraverted function is how you present yourself to the world. So it's possible that Ni and Ti will be the function that you'll rely on when you're alone, and Fe will come in when you're around other people.

&gt;I definitely listen more. Not that I mind talking

[..]

&gt;I used to talk way too quietly, but now I speak at a normal volume.

It seems like you are introverted, but that you're an introvert who has developed her auxiliary function (Fe) well and has become more comfortable with social situations.

It also seems like intuition is definitely your dominant function, if what you've written here is an accurate representation of your personality. I focused on your Fe in this comment, but I could also do a summary of the reasons why I think you use Ni instead of Ne (despite some Ne-like tendencies), if you want to. :)


Aww. :)

So, perceiving functions are much more difficult to describe and identify than judging functions, so I am going to mostly focus on the external behavior that, I think, falls in line with you being a Ni (and not Ne) dom.

'I think I am introverted in the sense that I prefer to be alone with my thoughts.'--This is, I think, a quite obvious sign of you being a Ni dom. People might say that ENxPs are 'the most introverted extroverts', but they still need to collect new impressions, and a lot of them. Like Se doms, they require interactions with the physical world, only for them it's not about the actual physical experience, but rather about the possibilities they can discover. Yes, they will need downtime to ruminate on the newly collected information, but that's something that comes *after* they have played around with the world. Meanwhile, Ni doms (and all functional introverts) are much more satisfied just 'being alone with their thoughts', as they mostly rely on internal imagery, and interaction with the real world is secondary to that.

'I come off as angry or upset when people first see me, but that because I'm thinking about something else.'--This is something that is common to all introverts (and I believe IxxJs in particular, because for IxxPs their perceiving function is extraverted, i.e., focused on the physical, instead of the internal world). When a person is focused towards the internal imagery (in the case of IxxJs), it can be quite difficult to also be aware and in control of one's facial expressions, movements and other ways of presenting a certain image to the world. It's not that introverts are impolite or moody/angry/upset, it's just that there's some level of conscious effort involved in appearing cheerful and happy, and it's difficult to be constantly aware of this conscious presentation of self when the focus is elsewhere.

'I'm almost always thinking about possibilities and the future. My head is very much in the clouds.'--Again, this could just be something that's common to all introverts (or INxxs), but I think that Ni doms in particular will tend to be very unfocused to the real world (because, again, Ne is extraverted and draws inspiration from the physical world). And 'thinking about possibilities and the future' is almost stereotypically Ni. :p (To be fair, I don't know if there *is* a link between introverted intuition and 'thinking about the future', but my interactions with Ni users seem to confirm that NJs tend to be more future-focused).

'I wouldn't say I get bored but things lose my attention very easily. But then I just go in my own head, and I find that very fun.'--Same thing here. Real-world vs. inner-world focus.

There are many more things that point to Ni, but I feel like I'd be repeating the same idea over and over, so I'll stop here!

But I'd really advise you to read these descriptions of INFJs and ENTPs, they seem like the two most likely types for you to me (both are intuition doms and Ti-Fe users, which you seem to be).

enneagram - type 9

careers (top3): philosopher, scientist, philosophy professorYay! :) &gt; I find it interesting and fitting that the Virgin Mary is typed as INFP

??

I don't really think that there's enough information about her in the Bible to say anything beyond 'she's probably introverted'.[Similarminds](http://similarminds.com/personality_tests_index.html#.WFPU0_l96yI) has some interesting ones.

I like the ones on [CelebrityTypes](http://www.celebritytypes.com/personality-tests.php), as well.Oh crap haha. Sometimes Heidi is hilariously wrong in what she writes, but sometimes she hits the nail right on the head. I think that this is one of these times. Isn't she an ENFP?

And [this whole article](http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/12/10-things-people-dont-realize-youre-doing-because-youre-repressing-the-hell-out-of-your-feelings/) is 100% me when I am going through bad times in my life. Maybe I undervalued Heidi Priebe! I missed you, chadthecat. &lt;3Haha. Also, all of the Judgers are in the 'grown up' squad, except for ENFJs who are in the 'teenager at heart' category.Are you more similar to ENTPs or ISFPs? Describe the similarities and differences between yourself and how you perceive these two types to be like.The Fi one is very nice!FWIW, The Verve is one of my favorite bands, at least when it comes to the lyrics of their songs (on further consideration, this information is probably not worth very much, as I was introduced to the band by my ENTP friend...)

I haven't actually watched any interviews with Richard Ashcroft, but I have seen him typed as an ISTP. 

Many of his songs actually seem to talk about or address other people without a lot of focus on the narrator's own feelings, but one of his songs, *Velvet Morning*, highly resonates with me as a Fi dom and, in my opinion, could indicate a high use of Fi. [The lyrics](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tnkcg26ynpkq3t6vhly5si6yose?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics)

For me, Ne--&gt;Si is about possibilities that are each about as likely as the other, and are often indistinguishable (in my mind) from the actual, physical reality.

Say, I am having a conversation with someone, and while the other person is talking, I might think 'it would be interesting/funny if they said this or acted that way', and start to develop that train of thought, including how I would react to what they said/did, how they would react to *my* response, etc. If, after a certain time had passed, I was asked whether the imagined exchange actually took place in reality, I would find it difficult to answer this question unless I backtracked the conversation to the beginning and tried to evaluate whether the imagined remark/action fits in the context of the conversation and whether it's something I could reasonably expect the other person to say or do. It's also why I perceive time non-linearly: if I remember something happening, that memory is almost as concrete as (or rather, just as inconcrete as) my perception of the actual reality. That's why I am wary about making statements like 'that happened x days/months/years ago'...if it is something that I have revisited in my memory since that, then, unless I backtrack to that event and try to recall all the major events that have happened in my life between that moment and the present, then there is very little difference in my mind between something that happened four days and four years ago.

Another example: my route to the university has remained unchanged for the last 2,5 years. It's about an hour long trip of walking-riding a bus-walking some more. And yet I could only name one street on my way to the university, and about three major buildings. Even when I am actually observing the physical environment, I'm not *really* seeing what's happening around me, I'm seeing the 'potential' of these things, they're nothing more than a source of inspiration for me. Sometimes it's cool, but sometimes it bums me out. I've gone kayaking with my family a few times, and my mom (a Se dom) always reminds me to 'take in' and appreciate the nature/the sights. I just cannot do that kind of uninterrupted focus on the environment for more than a few minutes, I will start creating my own reality, if that makes sense.

(Disclaimer: while I am relatively sure that I use NeSi instead of NiSe, I am not as certain about the position of each function in my stack. It's possible (though unlikely) that my Si is higher than my Ne. It's also possible that everyone perceives the reality in the same way, in which case feel free to disregard this comment.)One of my closest friends is an ENTJ! She's also one of the most intelligent people I know. We mostly connect over the Fi (she has stated that I'm the only person she feels fully comfortable opening up to), but she also respects me enough to have conversations that are not solely about feelings with me. :D Dominant Te-inferior Fi is a very *intense* combination, though.'INTPs are the warmest robots and INTJs are the coldest humans.'

What you're saying checks out.

What if they *are* an INFP and they just *value*  crude humor and things with practical application? Did you consider *that*?Hahahah. Pretty accurate.

Nowadays, it's more like '*another* thread about how insufferable Fi is? Oh, okay', though. 

It's gotten better, I think. I've been seeing fewer of these types of threads recently. &gt; It's directly opposed to how an INTP is like; 99.99% correct about everything and the nature of things

Lol, come on.What.&gt;Also, am I really being obscurist again? My conclusions are that dense that when blurted they make no sense?

No! It's just that, with a statement like 'Ne is not Ne', I expected a more generalized pearl of wisdom about the true nature of extraverted intuition. :p

&gt;Well, at least I know to blame myself instead of going for the natural "ppl r dum" response.

Are you really taking shots at people on the subreddit? :o :o

&gt;Also Merry Xmas ye coy lass (;

How secular! Merry Xmas to you, too! I missed seeing you around, especially with many of the old regulars slowly disappearing from the subreddit. :(


 &gt; It's the holidays.

Right! Don't you have some holidays to *steal*? :p

&gt;I don't need more than a minute to see the titles and call out people

Do you mean to say that all of your comments are *not* a well-thought-out critique of Jung's typology? Sometimes they're just quips about the sub? *Should I stop looking up to you as an intellectual authority? :o*

I think I'll go into a lurking mode soon, as well!xxTJs, I'd guess.

A new year brings a new piece of wisdom. 👍

I think that *everyone* should strive to be "more Fi" in 2017. :DHey, I *always* finish my assignments!

...How do I join the ISFJs?&gt; Or in simpler words: "fuck Fi" still very much applies :3

What's with all the self-hatred? :D I wish you more confidence in the new year! &lt;3

&gt;But TJs can and should attempt to take your words to heart (;

*Should*? What a *values-driven* statement. (;
oh wow

Sinterklaas is a cute name! 

But not *nearly* as badass as [Дед Мороз](http://imgur.com/a/aluHn)!&gt;Now I just need to know how to pronounce that. :')

The Russian pronunciation [here](http://www.pronouncekiwi.com/Ded%20Moroz) seems pretty accurate, at least to my non-native ear.
'twas only in jest...but do you think that Trump is an ESFP?I wholeheartedly agree! I think that everyone should strive to be "less Fi" in 2017. :DNot sure if/to what extent this fits your view of the conflict types, but I can describe my (INFP) relationship with the ESTPs I know.

Despite my conflicts with ESTPs around middle school, right now we have this kind of a mutual respect/affection thing going on. In that they will (often jokingly) quarrel with everyone else, but then treat me in a very gentle manner, like a little sister or someone they admire (and I don't think that it's because they see me as someone who is too weak to take a joke; my *ENTP* friend, for example, has no problem being jokingly mean to me because he knows that I don't get offended easily).

And they're very physically affectionate with me, more so than with other people (even though Se-doms tend to be very physically affectionate in general). There's a lot of hugging and touching, and sitting very close to each other, which would be something that would bother me more (I'm usually only comfortable with this much physical affection with people I'm very close to), but they're like over-excited puppies in this regard, so it's honestly just kind of adorable. And they like to *take care of me* physically, like reminding me to eat regularly, or lending me a jacket or a shawl if they think I might be cold, or even buying me hot drinks or sweets as a treat (despite my repeated assurance that I can take care of myself :p). And again, I see it as a very sweet thing, because I *can* forget to have lunch, or to dress for the weather, so I really appreciate them showing that they care about me in this way.

And likewise, I like to invite them out for lunch, or surprise them with small gifts from time to time. It's a type of relationship that is, for me, quite unique, because I tend to be more detached in my relationships with the other types in this specific (physical) aspect. And I really admire the ESTPs I know for the mixture of raw intelligence *and* the very fascinating (to me) relationship with the physical world and their almost overwhelming physical "presence".Interesting, what *does* it sound like?

People on the sub have overwhelmingly typed me as an INFP, and that's the type I feel the most comfortable with, although I *have* considered pretty much every other type, as well (save for the Se and Je doms). Right now I have more or less determined that, if I am not an INFP, then the only other options that make sense to me are ISFJ and maybe even ISTJ (and I have been talking with a person who thinks that I might be an INFJ, but I *really* don't think that I use Ni-Se).

(I also want to emphasize, in case you thought that I focused too much on the 'S' aspects of the relationship, that the kind of friendship I have with ESTPs is really unique to that type for me. I really tend to be quite detached when it comes to the physical aspect of all my other friendships).Ahh, ISFJ has always been a very close next option for me, in case I am really not an INFP.

But it's interesting, because the quadra tests I have taken are always very definite on my Ne-Si use (i.e., they always say that I am either an Alpha or a Delta type, but also suggest that these both are about equally likely quadras for me). And I *have* looked into Socionics relationships, and found the descriptions to be very hit-or-miss, but when I took the opposite approach and tried to match my relationships with the actual people I know to the Socionics descriptions, I found that INFP *is* the type that makes the most sense for me, given the relationships that I have (admittedly, iirc, I determined that ISFJ was the *second* most likely option).

Since we're talking about Socionics, I think that I would actually be more likely to accept that I am a Si-dom *according to Jung's classification*, than that I am a Si-dom *according to Socionics*. Because I relate to the description of a "subjective interpretation of the physical world", but *not* to the high "awareness of internal tangible physical states" ("internal physical states" being something that I am, frankly, quite shit at recognizing).Yeah, Дед Мороз is *kind of* like Santa Claus (although the literal translation of his name would be Grandfather Frost). He's accompanied by [Снегурочка](http://imgur.com/a/Jtuho), who is *basically* Snow White.For sure it is a rather unusual way to look at introverted sensing, but it *is* how Socionics defines Si, you know? Like, I could see myself as being an ISFJ if I took bits and pieces from various descriptions of the type and only looked at the information that confirms this typing and ignored all of the things that point to me *not* being an ISFJ, but that's the same approach that I have used up to now (i.e., reading various different, often conflicting sources on the types/functions, instead of strictly following one interpretation of the function stack), and INFP *is* the type that I feel the most comfortable identifying with (it's the type I always return to, no matter how frequently I might question my typing).

And, I think, that if you want to say that I am an ISFJ *based on Socionics description of the ISFJ-ESTP relationship*, then you *do* have to take into account how Socionics defines Si. Because these descriptions were probably written from the point of view of how someone who is a dom-Si user, *as defined by Socionics*, would interact with a dom-Se user, *as defined by Socionics*. It would not make sense if these descriptions were written from the point of view of how Si-doms (as described by Jung) interact with Se-doms (as described by Socionics).&gt; I don't see how socionic's definition of Si plays into the type relations, which really does have some underlying truth to it. It sort of feels like they didn't build off the definitions of their functions, and rather just observed the nature of the interactions.

I don't think that I fully understand what you mean here: it is likely, of course, that they based the descriptions on observations of real-life interactions of the types, but, in order to classify these interactions as, say, 'a relationship between an INFj and an ESTp' (later, presumably after observation of a large number of relationships between INFjs and ESTps, called a conflicting relationship), they must have typed these people beforehand: and, in typing the people, they *probably* used the Socionics (and not Jung's) descriptions of the functions. And the interactions between a Jungian ISFJ and ESTP and a Socionics ISFp and ESTp are probably different, because of the different definitions of what ISFJ and ESTP really *are*.

&gt;However I do observe that Si users are a bit more body-conscious than Se types.

Well yeah, no other type probably has a higher body confidence than Se doms. But I'm willing to bet that high Si users would take the second place: body confidence seems like a 'high S' thing, and not a 'Se somewhere in the function stack' thing.
Oh no, I love ENFPs. D: Fi is cool!

How about this: I think that everyone should strive to be exactly as "Fi" as they want to be in 2017. :D

Haha, but wasn't the initial "imposing my values on you" comment the most Fi answer you had ever heard?&gt; i dunno i sound like i just said a load of garbage

No, it makes sense, at least the Ni part (not sure if that's how I would describe Si). But I'm not a Ni person, so it only makes sense as a *possible* definition of Ni, and I can't tell if that's really how the Ni experience is like for people who have it in their stack.

Lol but ahhhhh now you'll make me question my type *again*, and I have gone through this process so many times already, and you could have at least suggested some cool, lesser known type that I could read more about, and not ISFJ, my problem type that I always return to. D:
Aww! Well, I like Fi a lot better in the ENFPs that I know than I like it in myself, so there's that. :Dlol Aurarus

But thanks! I'll consider that!This actually seems like a more accurate view of both INTPs and ISFJs (and I actually feel quite awful about writing that last reply to you; sorry! so I decided to respond)

Yeah, as I said, ISFJ is a type that has always been very close to INFP for me. I guess I gave INFP a slight edge because I live and grew up in a very conservative country and built up my own moral framework almost from scratch, so Jung's description of Fe users adopting the values of the people around them never resonated with me. I have also always felt like the Ne and Si functions are very balanced for me (almost 50/50), so it made sense that they would be in the middle of the sack for me. And it's not that I think that I am an *intuitive* type, necessarily, but rather that I am almost sure that I am not a sensing type: I have a very weird relationship with the physical world.

I guess some of what you wrote wrt ISFJ is accurate for me, but, I think, I would relate to about a similar proportion of what you wrote if you had described INFP. I don't know. I have been searching for some definite distinctions between INFPs and ISFJs for ages, but I haven't found anything yet.&gt; Si doms really do think "boring" thoughts.

But...how do you know what they think, Aurarus? :o*No way!*

/u/CritSrc, can you confirm or deny these awful rumors? :D

I do not buy that you're an INTP...you have always seemed like a Feeling dom to me. (;Dude, I *know* that you're an INTP!

Or rather, I know that you *think* that you're an INTP. But all IxxPs are just mistyped ISFJs, right?  *¬_¬*I'd say that you're a pretty definite Ji dom (IxxP).

And it *seems* like you use Fi (the need for things to make sense *to you*, the desire to express yourself authentically, the idgaf attitude when it comes to the views of other people that *you* don't see as being important, etc. You also use quite a lot of strong declarative statements--it looks like Fi that is not tempered by Ne.) At the same time, there are some things that could apply to both Ti and Fi doms (excessive self-awareness, for example, is something that is common to both Ji doms, as is living in a state of what you described as "constant, low-key rebellion"). Still, I am going to say IxFP for you.

I'm not certain about your Ne vs. Se use; I'm about 50/50 on that. But I'd look into both IxFP types, and if you feel like they don't fit you, then maybe the IxTP types, as well.

&gt;Hilton: "When I was little I looked up to Princess Diana."

Wow, that's a *really* cogent argument for her being an ISFP.I have no preference for either axis. I enjoy my interactions with both Fe-Ti and Fi-Te users.

&gt;Fe-Ti axis users have a warmth that just isn't there for the Fi-Te axis users.

I really liked [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/58vjlc/what_are_some_questions_to_ask_or_signs_to_look/) by /u/speudebradeos, and have found it to be accurate, at least as far as the people that I know are concerned:

"For Fi-Te, warmth, meaning, light, and value are inside of you. But the world seems cold and harsh. You therefore must master the systems of the world in order to bring this warmth and light into the cold world. You have your own source of meaning that you want to bring to others.

For Ti-Fe, warmth, light, meaning, and value are outside of you. Inside is rather cold and harsh, and your goal is to learn the language that people are speaking around you so that you can bring some of that warmth and light inside yourself. Others have the meaning and you want to fit in so you can get some."&gt;Ji doms are still behavioral Ps.

In the MBTI system, judgers prefer a 'structured and decided lifestyle', while perceivers prefer a 'more flexible and adaptable lifestyle'.

Ji is rigid in many ways, but it is an introverted, subjective function. A judgement made by Fi or Ti won't be as dependent on the objective reality (facts or collective opinion) as a judgement made by Fe or Te. So Ji can *come across* as flexible and adaptable because it will be more likely to reject pre-made systems and rules and create its own (Ji is adaptable because it is "on its own", there is no need to switch between systems made by other people), but internally it's still structured and rigid. 

Thanks, odysseus-, you're the best! I really missed having abridged type descriptions to refer to in times of need. :D

In spite of what /u/lawdoodette said, the description of the Fe type has always seemed like the most negative one by far to me. This does not reflect my opinion of Fe-*using* types at all (although I have only typed one person I know in real life as a Fe *dom*, and I don't really know her that well). I've also been talking with someone who was very resistant to type themselves as a Fe-using type, in no small part because of Jung's description of Fe. What do you think? Do you see the Fe-type description as an overly negative one (at least when compared to the other descriptions)? Or do you think that people will naturally gravitate towards the descriptions of their dominant (and potentially auxiliary) function? I.e., if I think that somebody has a highly developed use of some function, but they reject the description of that function, is it unlikely that it's their dominant/auxiliary function?&gt; apparently even in his day people thought that kind of person was fake and manipulative, when a better term might easily be "lost"

Aren't we all a little lost hah hah.

No, but really. Couldn't all of the pure types be referred to as lost, where the way to "finding yourself" comes through developing the auxiliary? Or is it that the other pure types are just doomed in different ways than being "lost"?

Oh, and I also saw your comment about IxTPs and warmth in the other thread. The topic of INTPs' Fe has always confused me. Because the inferior function *should* be repressed as hell, right? Real INTPs *shouldn't* be like the meme-y INTP descriptions on the subreddit, where they are portrayed as infallibly rational and logical people, who are *also* squishy and warm on the inside. It'd make sense that inferior Fe *would* in some way screw things up for INTPs, just like I recognize that Si and inferior Te cause me problems, in ways that I am both aware and unaware of. 

So why *do* all the INTPs that I have typed as such come across as  socially adjusted and even somewhat warm people? I met my INTP friend recently, and yes, she's detached and kind of closed off emotionally, but not any more than I am, and she's actually, you know, smart enough to realize that maintaining friendships requires reaching out to people from time to time (as opposed to me, who's actually comfortable spending months in a hermit mode), and she just seems like a more socially adjusted person than I am in many subtle ways I can't exactly articulate. My ISTP friend actually fits the "socially unaware person" description much better, even if he's more outgoing and has a wider circle of friends. So what *is* up with IxTPs' Fe? Say, how does it mess with your life?
 
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N_RZJUAQY4&amp;feature=youtu.be) is an ESTP, probably.

Awwww you're so cute!Embrace your Lithuanian roots! Accept Socionics!But it's fun! *Socionics says* that, as an Alpha quadra type, you should enjoy *fun* discussions about theoretical concepts. :D

Besides, it's cool to be an Alpha type--the benefits of that *almost* outweigh the inferior Fe.I don't even *believe in* Socionics.

Luckily, I am not a Ti dom, or my concern for the logical consistency of the ideas that I entertain would stand in the way of enjoying some *fun* Socionics tests.Why is it that the people who talk the most about other people being mistyped almost always flair as INXXs? Is it some attempt to artificially maintain the perceived rarity of the INxx group?

I treat Socionics as any other idea: even if it's faulty, it can still provide some benefit, or at least entertainment. If there are Socionics people who say that I am an ISFp, even if I think that I use Fi+N, then that's something that's worth looking into, even if just to find out how Socionics people perceive me. I think that I am an introverted feeler, and Feeling is the function that I am probably the most sure about having in the dominant or auxiliary position, so I don't think that it's *unlikely* that I could be an ISFp in *that* system.

But then, sometimes, Socionics goes *way* too far. People have typed /u/odysseus-, who's a clear Ti+N user in my eyes, as an ISFp. So what they're saying is that odysseus- represses the functions that he considers to be his most developed ones and is the most capable at using the functions that he considers to be his least developed ones. I could see how an INTP could be confused for an ISTP, or even an INTJ, but if people are saying that odysseus- is an ISFp (and justifying it by referring to the quadras, probably the most ridiculous concept in Socionics), then that's an ISFp that's so far removed from any of the original (Jung's or even Myers-Briggs') concepts of an ISFJ, that it becomes practically meaningless. ISFps are not just "sane INTPs" or "people who want to be INTPs", and not every agreeable person is necessarily a feeler. ISFps are, in fact, distinctly different from INTPs. Claiming that a Jungian/MBTI INTP is an ISFp in Socionics would *maybe* make sense if people treated these systems as completely distinct ones, and ISFps were actually described as INTP-like people, but the descriptions of ISFps in Socionics are much more similar to the descriptions of ISFJs than the descriptions of INTPs in MBTI. And *even* if Socionics described ISFps as people who are focused on ideas and theories instead of people and the physical environment, then saying that an INTP in an MBTI sub is an ISFp in Socionics, *as if* that information was in any way connected to their MBTI type, is pretty much pointless (unless they have show interest in Socionics and would like to find out what their type is in *that* system).

\~End of this semi-rant.~Ahhh, sorry if what I wrote wasn't coherent. I've been feeling really tired lately and I just wrote down all the thoughts that I had related to the topic without any structure.

But the TL;DR of what I wrote is: I've noticed some very common trends in how people on this sub are typed by people who are interested in Socionics. One of the most common trends is INTPs being told that they're ISFJs (ISFps). But if Socionics declares that ISFps can be be ideational, Thinker-y people who are interested in abstract theories ("wannabe/sane INTPs"), then doesn't the concept of an ISFJ become meaningless because these neo-ISFJs are almost indistinguishable from INTPs? I think that you might be hanging around some very INTx-ish people (in real life or online), so your frame of reference might be shaped by that. Real-life ISFJs are not just more Feeler-y INTPs, they are very distinct from INTPs, in my opinion.

(I'm asking you because you seem to be interested in Socionics, but I also just realized that the conversation that we had and that I made a reference to--about ISFJs being "sane INTPs"--took place two weeks ago. I hadn't realized that so much time has passed since then, so I'm sorry if this conversation was confusing.)I mostly just visit this sub, but these are the main ones that show up on my front page (I'm listing only the general ones which could be interesting to people who don't share my interests, too):

I also have a [multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/CrowdedHighways/m/mbti/) of all the mbti subreddits. You're doing fine, man.

Unless they've really done some truly vile things, the greatest shortcoming of the people who think of themselves as despicable is usually their low self-confidence. (Sometimes, the low self-confidence is coupled with a high assurance in one's own abilities verging on arrogance, which somehow seems to be even worse for the person than just having a low self-esteem, but that's irrelevant to the main point of the discussion). And if a person has a low self-esteem, then all of their perceived shortcomings--the faults that other people probably do not notice, or might even find interesting or unique--get multiplied, and overblown to the point that they become crippling (anxiety-inducing, standing in the way of success). Whatever you might tell yourself, people really tend to value authenticity more than a fake character, as long as the authenticity also comes with self-awareness (and you've proven that you have it by making this post). People aren't really as dumb as they're portrayed to be; unless you're masterful at creating a persona, everyone will be able to tell that you're faking it. You don't want to enter the uncanny valley of faking emotions, so you either have to be genuine, or become so good at faking your personality that you become indistinguishable from the character that you have created.

I find that it helps to look at yourself "from above", as if you were a completely different person: would you still say that *this* "you" is despicable if you weren't able to see all of the self-doubt and anxiety inside of you? As quiteafewfireflies pointed out, intrusive thoughts also don't make anyone a bad person; everyone gets them. At the same time, while this comment *is* in a way an attempt to console you (nobody probably thinks as badly of you as you think of yourself), it's also an attempt to give you some perspective: the dark thoughts that you think make you despicable...everyone has them. People tend to become more aware of them when they're a teenager, hence the trope of the edgy atheistic teen. You don't come across as an edgy teenager because you are intelligent, so your "dark thoughts" actually have a possibility of having some merit to the world, but the general principle is the same. The thoughts mellow out with age, but even the most self-aware adults probably still believe that they are unique in the darkness of their thoughts, or the depth of their mind, or the intensity of their emotions...that everybody else, maybe with the exception of a few closest friends, are two-dimensional characters, and that only they have the access to the whole of human experience. I know that I'm talking in generalizations/out of my ass, but I do suspect that, even if most people are consciously aware that this is a ridiculous thought, most of them still believe that they're "special" in some way, truly different from everyone else on the planet.

Journaling was suggested in this thread, and I agree with that suggestion. I also think that it would be better for you to write by hand than to type, especially if you usually spend more time on your computer than you do writing things down on paper, which is probably the case. Writing by hand is a more deliberate process because it's slower and because you're setting aside some time to do that, instead of having the word processor *and* your Internet browser open at the same time...even if you wouldn't be taking breaks to watch videos, or read comments, or *whatever*, it would still be distracting. 
Yeah, I've seen people talk about that, and it really seems like it's better to just have an all-around low self-esteem, because then at least you genuinely don't have any expectations that you could achieve greatness...you're consistently negative, so to say.

Not sure if there's any advice I could give to you, but it does seem like the difference between the low self-esteem and the high expectations for yourself tends to become smaller with age, when you get a better sense of your actual abilities (when faced with the real world), and either develop a normal self-esteem, or reassess your skills/talents/abilities and realize how much they're actually worth.

Off-topic, but (if you don't mind) I've been wondering why you consider yourself to be an INTP for some time now. You acknowledge how scattered your thoughts can be, and the way you approach writing comments seems like dom Pe, aux. Ji, rather than the other way around...maybe ENTP? (Not saying that you are an ENTP, necessarily, but at least it seems more likely than INTP).&gt; I found real life examples of ENTPs and INTPs

I have only typed two people as INTPs and two people as ENTPs irl, so I can't really make any generalizations, but you do stand out among the INTPs I know irl and the people I think are INTPs on this sub. Do you have any video examples of what an INTP vs. ENTP looks like, or are there any users on this subreddit that you think are real INTPs?&gt; I love comments like this

Hah, do they appeal to you because of your enneagram type?

All three xNTPs that I know (/have typed as such) in real life are also really memetic xNTP. 

About the difference between INTPs and ENTPs: Socionics might be faulty, but the PoLR function is a part of that theory that I *do* find valuable/accurate, and you can really notice the difference between PoLR Se in INxPs and PoLR Fi in ExTPs.

Would you mind if I summoned someone who I think is an actual INTP to this thread to give his opinion about your type? (It's okay to say no!)/u/CritSrc, sorry to bother you, but do you think that this young lad is an INTP?

Don't feel obliged to read the whole thread, of course, but maybe look at [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5ox8nr/am_i_retarded_or_is_it_just_impossible_to_express/dcmu2wu/) or [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5haoil/one_strange_constant_with_theorizing/)? Thanks a lot!!

(Aurarus, I'll elaborate on my own opinion when I'll have more free time!)Can confirm; currently ciring.Not sure how I feel about the black flair on its own, but I love it when an INFP posts a comment relating to their type, and then you see a row of comments with black flairs posted in response.There are quite a few inconsistencies in the graphic, especially if it was made with functions in mind.

Why is ENFP higher than ESFJ for physical? Why are INFJs (auxiliary Fe) more emotional than ENFJs (dom Fe)? Why are INTJs as emotional as four of the Feeling types? Why are three NFs as "mental" as ISTP and ISTJ? In fact, what does "mental" even mean in this graphic? Stereotypically, I would expect that to be either intuition or thinking, but ENFP (a Feeler) is more "mental" in the image than an ESTP (a Thinker), and ISTP and ISTJ (both Sensors) are higher than INFP (an iNtuitive type) in the graphic. And so on.

&gt; INTP

In truth, I am just nitpicking.Aww, the ESTJs don't deserve this. :(Yes! Scrunched up eyes and a huge smile...radiating happiness and warmth as if they were the Sun itself. :DWords and touch tied, with time very close behind.I think that Feelers are probably more likely to engage in this kind of behavior, but that they also tend to be aware of the fact that they're doing it (it's just that they perhaps feel unable to do anything to stop it). From my observations, Thinkers tend to act under the influence of emotions and then later deny that the emotions played any part in their decision-making process.This particular example:

&gt;[..] even though a spouse has shown only devotion, a person using emotional reasoning might conclude, "I know my spouse is being unfaithful because I feel jealous."

sounds a lot like a [lack of object constancy in people](https://books.google.lv/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=lv&amp;id=UFrAvF2Bj-cC&amp;q=Lack+of+object+constancy#v=snippet&amp;q=Lack%20of%20object%20constancy&amp;f=false) (or a lack of emotional constancy), which is commonly associated with Bipolar Personality Disorder, if I am not mistaken.

(Note: while object permanence is a well-researched concept in developmental psychology, I have only read about emotional constancy and its relation to BPD online, so take it as you will).That's the most accurate description of ENFPs I've ever seen.SPs in the short run, SJs in the long run.

I wanted to say that NFs might actually have a better chance of surviving than NTs, but then I remembered that NTs have the ENTJs.I think that I would enjoy living in a world that consisted entirely of NF types, at least for the week or two that such a world could exist before its inevitable downfall.The ability to create dank memes might raise the NTPs' spirits for some while, but I'm not sure if it would substantially increase your survivability.&gt;I would therefore assume that most Kek fans (kekists? kekistanis?) are likewise INTPs, ENTPs, INTJs, ENTJs

*Not* ENTJs lol.&gt; outward emotional harmony

Maybe group harmony?Is this an actual riddle, or are you just trying to figure out your type? If it's a riddle, I'm stuck (assuming that you're going by the functions).

Here was my thought process:

"When I feel I feel like an INFJ"--&gt;Fe. If you have Fe, you must also have Ti (INTP, ENTP).

Two of the three remaining types (ENTP, INTP and INTJ) must determine your perceiving functions. ENTP and INTP share the perceiving functions (Ne-Si), so you're some Ne-Si using type; I assume that Ne refers to talking and Si refers to doing in this case.

However, the type that remains (INTJ) uses Te, and not Ti, making this riddle unsolvable.

If this is not a riddle and you're just trying to determine your type, I would say ISFJ! "When I feel I feel like an INFJ"--&gt;auxiliary Fe, "I usually strive to do like an INTJ"--&gt;IxxJ, "When I talk, I talk like an ENTP" and "when I act I act like an INTP"--&gt;Ne and Si.

If not, then maybe INTP! Ne is your first extraverted function, so it makes sense that you "talk like an ENTP", the strength of your feelings is not really determined by any functions, it would make sense that you "act like an INTP", and, if INTJs are said to be more "put-together INTPs", then it's clear why you'd strive to be like them.

Did I take this too seriously?&gt;i've scored all the following: INTJ, INTP, INFJ, and ENTP

If you're trying to determine if you're an INTP or an ENTP, it could be useful to think about whether you're more like an ENFP (then you're more likely to be an ENTP), or more like an ISTP (in which case you're more likely to be an INTP).

If it's between INTP and INFJ, looking at your use of Fe would probably help you to make that decision.

If you're trying to decide between INTP and INTJ, you should look into the functions. Also, I know that people don't tend to trust the letter tests, but I think that they're useful when you're trying to decide between two xxxP and xxxJ types...not by looking at the results for the P/J dichotomy, but by looking at the percentages of the N/S and the T/F dimensions. So, if you're trying to decide between INTP and INTJ, you could copy the results of, say, the 16personalities test here (with all the percentages!), and I could tell you which type you're more likely to be!/r/MBTI, I Love You But You're Bringing Me DownHey man, welcome back! :) I am glad to read that you're getting some treatment!This is kind of inspiring.*Nice graphs.* \*grumbles*Ahh, fun!

I'm quite a stereotypical IxFx. I have wavered between all of the IF types, except for ISFP. Right now I'm about 85% sure that I am an INFP. (I am always open to new opinions, though!)

Stereotypes taken from [here](https://type-coach.com/infp).

&gt;Sensitive

To a fault.

&gt;Caring

Yes, I care a lot. I'm just often unable to show *how much* I care without playing it off as a joke.

&gt;Empathetic

...Undecided.

&gt;Flexible

Yeah.

&gt;Casual

I'm extremely neurotic, but for some reason I approach *most* changes in the external world in a very calm and relaxed manner. I actually thought that I come across as a collected person to most onlookers who don't know me that well, but an acquaintance at the university noted that there's always a certain... tension and apprehension to my body language. So much for trying to come across as a calm and collected ISTP. :D

&gt;Spontaneous

Not so much "spontaneous" as "constantly underprepared".

&gt;Reserved

&gt; Modest

Yes to both.

&gt; Calm

See "casual".

&gt; Unique

Probably not.&gt; Your friend is 100?

:D&gt;INFP: Teaching people to find ultimate happiness in life. But you have to force them into it.

Sounds great! &gt;:DI have to learn to word titles better, but I hope you got the idea.

I would suspect that in the Fi user's case, the process of 'putting other's needs/valuing other's opinions before their own' would be more of a deliberate/conscious *decision*, while in the Fe user's case, the process would be more unconscious and natural, but how could you tell the difference just by observing these two people? 

Note that I am talking about *observing* people, so I am using slightly rudimentary definitions of Fe and Fi, and discussing mostly behavior-based tendencies.

One hypothetical proposition would be putting both of them in a life-endangering situation (or even just security/status quo challenging situation) and seeing who takes care of themselves first, and who takes care of others. But that's unethical, and I think that the reaction would be instinctual, and not based on personality (I know that I will always protect at least the ones closest to me first).

I would also guess that for the Fi user, the process would be...more 'dramatic', I guess. For the Fe user, the 'putting others before oneself' thing would be natural/no-big-deal, while, if the Fi user sets it as their core value, they would be likely to see it as their 'purpose in life', so they could decide not only to 'be kind to other people', but also 'devote their life to doing good', e.g., by becoming an activist, or a missionary, or a teacher, or a doctor, or whatever they define as being 'good'.

Or do you think it's just circular reasoning? If someone values the value of valuing other's values (:D) before their own, do you think that they are really only acting for self-satisfaction?If presented with some statistics (the validity of which the Ti user would have no reason to doubt), is there any reason why a Ti user would reject the data?

What I mean is: a high Fi user might reject objective reality if it does not fit with their personal beliefs. A high Fe user might reject objective reality if it does not correspond to some socially-accepted moral norms. Is there any reason why a high Ti user might reject objective reality in favor of following their subjective interpretation/analysis of the reality?

Ti and Fe operate together, they do not exist on their own. So would it be reasonable to expect that a high Ti user might also reject statistics in favor of the socially accepted moral norms? But the descriptions of the thinking functions often contrast them with the feeling functions by claiming that 'thinkers' supposedly make dispassionate judgements: i.e., judgments that are not influenced by emotions, social norms, conventions, etc. If that is true, how can Ti be simultaneously dispassionate *and* subjective?

Here is a statement from the cognitive functions test that corresponds with Ti: "I modify models and frameworks to accommodate new data, thereby preserving inner logical consistency." If I understand this correctly, Ti cherrypicks only the 'relevant' factual information that fits within their pre-made *subjective* logical system...but in order to choose or reject information, or to create the logical systems in the first place, don't Ti users have to make subjective value judgments at first? If that is true, why is Ti usually regarded as being more objective than Fi?

I guess my question is: does/can Ti by itself have an agenda? Can a high Ti user theoretically consider a question without *any* personal investment in it?(Because lately I have been trying to classify everything into 'human things' ("everyone does this") and 'type specific things'...)

To what function(s) would you ascribe the following behavior:

Some person has spent a lot of time over the past few days mulling over some specific issue that is personally important to them (say, something that would impact their future, such as a career choice). And then something happens (a conversation with a friend, for example) that CHANGES EVERYTHING!! For instance, the friend says a simple sentence that nevertheless EXPLAINS EVERYTHING THAT THE PERSON HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT. You know, the person assigns GREAT IMPORTANCE to that one sentence, and NOTHING WILL EVER BE THE SAME, and the person comes up with a very grand, thorough FUTURE PLAN that is entirely based on that one sentence, but ties into it everything they have been thinking about for the last few days, and the plan actually seems logical and LIFE-CHANGING, and they're full of determination to actually carry it out, come tomorrow...

But then they sleep it through, and when they wake up the next morning, they realize that the plan is actually quite flawed, that it is quite improbable to carry out for reason 1, reason 2 and reason 3 (although the BIG PLAN had seemed very logical the previous day), and that perhaps it is better to stick to the bigger long-term plans the person has instead of trying to change their whole life in one day.

So, is this related to functions at all? Just human behavior? And what is your experience with daydreaming?I am questioning my type again, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could guide me in the right direction or at least make me more comfortable with my own typing.

I will probably never be able to settle on one type completely, but the type I am the most comfortable with right now is INFP. However, I'd like some confirmation that the way I have typed myself is ''correct'', or advice about which other types I should look at.

For starters, here are some test results:

**Letter tests** (such as 16personalities or John's Personality Quiz and about 15 others): INFP, almost unfailingly (although when I was a very young teenager with almost no knowledge of MBTI but a huge interest in personality tests, I always typed as INFJ). *Always* some introverted type.

**Cognitive functions tests**: on average, it goes something like this Fi&gt;Ne&gt;&gt;Ni&gt;Ti~Fe&gt;&gt;Si&gt;&gt;Te&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Se
 
**Socionics tests**: socionics types me as INFP (INFj), with ENFP as the second most likely option. When I actually read the Socionics' description of the functions and each function's place in the eight function model, INFJ or ENTP (!?!?) seemed liked the most likely options. As for the quadras, I could see myself being either an Alpha or a Delta, so all it tells me is that I probably use the Ne-Si axis. As for the Reinin dichotomies, my preferences mostly correlate with the ISFJ type.

**Enneagram**: I think of myself as 4w5 (so/sx or so/sp?), but I think I could be any combination of types 4, 5 and 6. I also see some characteristics of types 1 and 9 in myself.

**Big five**: I usually get a result that corresponds to the ISFP type.

(As you see, I have tried it all)

Moving on to the actual typing: I decided that I would start with the assumption that I could be any of the types and continue with a method of exclusion until I have narrowed it all down to one type (I'll try to keep it short).

The possible types: ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTP, ISFP, ESTP, ESFP, INTJ, INFJ, ENTJ, ENFJ, INTP, INFP, ENTP, ENFP.

First of all, I am absolutely sure that I am not a Se dominant type. I could explain my reasons for why I think that is the case, but it would become immediately obvious if you met me and interacted with me. I am just 100% sure of this. This excludes the ESxPs.

The remaining types: ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTP, ISFP, INTJ, INFJ, ENTJ, ENFJ, INTP, INFP, ENTP, ENFP.

Next, my understanding of the Je-dominant types (ExxJs) is that they want/feel a need to shape the external world through their actions. Now, there are moments when I feel a need to get my life together and start organizing, making plans and actually changing something. But that is definitely not my default mode, I feel exhausted afterwards, and frankly I am quite comfortable with whatever life throws my way as long as everything's alright in my headspace (that is to say, I prefer the inner to the outer world). So I think I can safely exclude the ExxJs.


The remaining types: ISTJ, ISFJ, ISTP, ISFP, INTJ, INFJ, INTP, INFP, ENTP, ENFP.

Next, I would like to exclude the ISTP type. Ti+Se combined has a very 'cool' and 'idgaf' vibe that I could never hope to emulate. On the unlikely chance that I am a IxTP type, then I think that my Ti is 'softened' by Ne. And if I am a ISxP type, then I think that my Se (ha-ha) is 'softened' by Fi. I would also like to exclude ENTP for similar reasons. There is this 'unstoppable mental energy' vibe I associate with Ne-doms, and I guess I can sometimes appear to be like an ENxP in real life if I feel alright, but I get tired if I have to 'act like a Ne-dom' for prolonged periods of time, so on the off chance that I am an ENxP, I could only see myself as an ENFP because I think that Fi requires a period of recharge/downtime even in secondary position ('ENFPs are the most introverted of all extroverted types'). So I am excluding both ISTP and ENTP.

The remaining types: ISTJ, ISFJ, ISFP, INTJ, INFJ, INTP, INFP, ENFP

I also think I am not an INTJ, because 1)Almost every person who identifies as a Ni-dom claims that 'if you used Ni, you would know', 2)I am pretty sure I don't have Te as my auxiliary function, 3)I don't relate to the description of inferior Se (over-indulgence in physical sensations when under stress), 4) I have never read a description of INTJs that I could see myself in (not that there are a lot of descriptions of INTJ that describe them as anything else than geniuses and infallible masterminds)

The remaining types: ISTJ, ISFJ, ISFP, INFJ, INTP, INFP, ENFP

This is where it gets difficult, because I have more or less seriously considered being all and any of these types. Now it just comes down to being more or less *likely* to be one of the types, so I will do a comparison of each type to INFP, and why I think I am this type after all.

ENFP: There are some things I relate to in the descriptions of the ENFPs. I can act like one when I am feeling alright, so I sometimes wonder if I am simply a depressed ENFP who requires a lot of downtime (especially since it's often said that you can't identify your dominant function, but I can identify Fi pretty easily). I also relate to the description of inferior Si much more than the description of inferior Te when I am stressed out.And it's about equally likely that I am an ENFP and an INFP when it comes to the Socionics' descriptions of the functions. However, if we were to simply go by letters, I would definitely be an INFP. I also think that I certainly lead with some kind of internal processing that feeds on external perception, and not vice versa.

INTP: I think there are a lot of similarities, at least externally, between INTPs and INFPs, but i think that it is more likely that I use Fi-Te, rather than Ti-Fe. Like Ni users, Ti-doms often like to repeat that 'if you had Ti, you would know', and well, I am here, still questioning my type after months of research, so I clearly do not 'know'. I am aware of the fact that I make a lot of subjective, value-based judgments, and it is hard for me to defend a position I disagree with (i.e., 'playing devil's advocate'). And if I have to choose between 'rationals' and 'idealists', I am definitely an idealist.

INFJ: I have spent too much time researching the differences between these two types, but I think it all comes down to this: My Fi is stronger than my Fe.

ISFP: I would have more doubts if I didn't know about the functions and only had to type myself by letters. But as it is now, two things make me think I am more likely to be an INFP: 1)I am almost sure that I use the Ne-Si, and not the Ni-Se axis; 2)My Se is simply not that strong.

ISFJ&amp;ISTJ: My Fi is stronger than both my Te and my Fe. I also think it's stronger than my Si. I know that statistically it's most likely that I am one of the ISxJ types, so I am willing to be convinced.

Thank you in advance! :)Aspects to consider:

1) How similar or different is the way you perceive and judge the world?

2) How similar or different is your viewpoint of the world?

3) What communication styles do you have, and how does each person get their idea across?

4) If your outlook of the world is different, does it make communication more difficult? If it is similar, do you eventually run out of ideas to discuss?

etc.
 Please take this test: http://personality-testing.info/tests/NPI/

And then report your results here: https://goo.gl/forms/p71Tpw8qf5aYLcA82I want to see how different types will approach this moral dilemma.

(There are many variants of this kind of scenario, but here's one by Dostoevsky):

**Tell me yourself, I challenge your answer. Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature — that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance — and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears; would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?**

The whole chapter is [here](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/dostoyevsky/d72b/chapter35.html). I greatly recommend you to read it. The relevant part that provides the larger context for the scenario starts with "But I’ve still better things about children" and is too long to copy it all in this post.

Thoughts?Sure! I'll be looking for some trends in the responses, like that people like the extroverted/introverted version of their own type (i.e., XXXX types like YXXX types the best) or that people like types that share certain functions with them, etc. I just need more responses :(I'll post it in all the type subreddits later, so hopefully I'll get more responses from the more uncommon types, as well.

Intuitive bias is a thing that I'm very well aware of, and I do intend to call it what it is when I make the summary of the results.Of course you find your own meme accurate...https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/h0ks1a/responses_to_the_survey_about_peoples_favorite/https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/h0ks1a/responses_to_the_survey_about_peoples_favorite/https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/h0ks1a/responses_to_the_survey_about_peoples_favorite/https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/h0ks1a/responses_to_the_survey_about_peoples_favorite/Isn't this the exact opposite of abstract thinking?Here in Latvia, we make a cold soup (literally called "cold soup" or aukstā zupa) without any cooking! You just take beetroot, cucumber, some eggs, and add kefir (similar to greek yoghurt, only thinner).Definitely not "as much hate".Does a 4-panel comic really have to be titled "wait for it"? Is it that unusual for comics to have punchlines?Or maybe it's just a bad idea.This test is legit. 😎These results point to you being an NFJ type. I would change the flair!!My results: https://bigfive-test.com/result/600b11a0f91d8d00095e5fca

What type do you think I am?Yup! Well, I'm sure about the I and the F, not so much about the rest of the letters.I'm probably a NeSi type, and I think I'm a Fi dom, while my friend leans towards me being a Fe-using type.N stands for Neurotic (Ne, however, stands for Nerdy, as I'm sure we all know).
My friend, you have to try out discord. It is frankly much cleaner, much more attractive, competent, has plenty of unique features and bonuses over a typical skype chat. It's called "chat for gamers" but I'm part of an online reddit government simulation game for political enthusiasts that operate entirely off of discord.Discord is absolutely free and can be downloaded on the desktop, mac, iphone, and android. The calls are free as well. It is becoming very popular recently and the community that I am in with hundreds of people migrated from skype to discord due to it being so much better.I can set up the server for you and everything, I highly recommend it. It has so many neat features and abilities.I'm in the PST. I can actually put it together right now and we can meet up on it later, I've assembled about 6 chats on discord in my time there.On it.tru ❤️Have my upvoteAlso INFP. I'm pretty impressed with your view here; most other INFPs (including many on the INFP sub) were completely distraught about Donald Trump being President Elect and many of them admitted that they did or are crying. It's very relieving to know that there are others of our type promoting acceptance and resiliency.Simply a matter of perspective. Reddit itself along with the Millennial generation that makes the majority of this website would typically be further to the Left. And as INFPs are known for being emotional and moody, many of them would be so upset to cry over Donald Trump's win last night.
Now I'm questioning my whole existence... fairly sure I'm not an S whatsoever though. Potentially an INFJ. STAY AWAY FROM ME. 

I love ENTPs but it always ends in disaster. Never ever had an S result in a test in my life, and I'm very strongly N apparently. I hate paying attention to little details, I much prefer abstract, artsy things and I'm a HUGE daydreamer - nearly always distracted and wrapped up in thoughts. Think I'm a bit too emotional for ENTPs, they seem to get frustrated with it. But then maybe that's just a problem with all F/T type relationships. Yeah, that's been the problem in a lot of my relationships with ENTPs, I take my emotions really seriously. Can't stand being criticised even on the teeniest level. They're irresistible imo. More than likely, yep. Even if it's just to reel in more ENTPs. I'm often mistaken for being very extroverted. I've had 3 serious relationships in my life so far and every single one of them has been with an ENTP. I also just started dating a guy recently and he's also an ENTP. 

Is there some sort of inexplicable pull between the two or is there a reason why I'm so attracted to them? I thought it could be that we have some similarities (N,P) and some differences (E,T), but I once briefly dated an ENFJ and that was AWFUL. 
As an avid green tea drinker, I completely agree with the INFP one. :&gt;You're taking this way too seriously man. Calm down, this post is just for fun. 
This is very fun to read. I wanna see if anyone else chimes in before I state what I believe!

Thanks for reading!I'll PM!It was certainly an ENTP for the Mr. and ISFJ for the Mrs., so you were pretty much spot on! It's hard to tell because, as you said, they are fictional characters in one instance.

Thank you for reading and I was glad you enjoyed it!Yes—perimeter, thank you.

I'm really glad you enjoyed the story!

About the character's MBTI things—you have some good guesses and I see those as possibilities too. Here was my overall attitude with each character that I sent in a PM to someone else:

**Father** - very inventive and contemplating possibilities driven by the purpose of exploring and improving the world around him (that's like... Ne fueled by his Fe... but he uses Ti to make him such a clever scientist). Super ENTP.

**Mother** - She is usually assessing things from her grounded perspective on the world around her/her history with her family. She refers to her impression of people's characteristics (Si) to illustrate what is desired in the moment for people to get along (Fe). e.g. when she scolds Kristina: "It’d be nice for once if you didn’t criticize everything about us when we’re together. You won’t have much luck finding people to spend time with if all you do is point out what’s wrong with everyone" Trying for an ISFJ.

**Kristina** - Someone else pointed out she is a heavy Se user, and I find that interesting because that information is only available by subtraction. She's a bit of an introvert—that or she just doesn't connect with her parents one bit. I was thinking of an ISFP... although arguably she's an ESFP who is not able to engage in the concrete world she's interested in with her parents having Ne and Si manners of perceiving. ISFPs have literally no cognitive functions in common with ENTPs &amp; ISFJs, and this could be the cause of her parental disconnect because they see the world and make decisions in the world using a completely different toolset. That being said, I think you were accurate in calling the worry as a "Te-Ne" loop, so that could have been my natural self seeping through the writing a bit (I can worry like that too.)

**Mr. Anderson/neighbor** - Likely an ENFP. He had good rapport with the father/ENTP (both using mostly Ne) and he idealized the father a little bit. He stood up for Katrina's father when Katrina was critical of him, seeing the best parts of him. He was also an English professor, which can be a very NF kind of job. He is curious to ask Mr. Perozo how it *feels* to realize a vision (once Mr. Perozo's hands reach the moon), and he is also a bit of a crusader in helping Mr. Perozo's scientific pursuits because they perfectly express his unique approach to science.

**Bandit the Cat** - Going for an ISTJ... he was very dutiful of keeping tabs on the family, and being the functional opposite of an ENFP... he'd be naturally good and stable at something an ENFP would have impatience with... like watching a family for a very long time as kind of a sentry and able to recount details in an accurate and reliable way. A good partner in crime for an ENFP.Glad you had fun reading and analyzing!No need to apologize! Thanks again!https://threebowlsofsurreal.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/amillionsmilesaway1.pdf

There are five distinct characters, each with a different type. MBTI isn't why I wrote the story, but I did have types in mind when I sorted out some details.

It might be entertaining to find out if you're good at typing or if I'm just a dull writer! 
If I'm writing a character the most obvious divisions in narrative style would be between SJ, SP, and N.  

Within N, the difference between NP (complex web of meaning) and NJ (branching, seeking, connecting, like a lightning bolt) has more impact on the flavor of characterization than NT (define "purpose" as "consequence") vs NF (define "purpose" as "telos").  Intuitives are stuck in their heads, and it can take some pretty crazy situations to pull them out.

NT's are plenty philosophical and NFs are plenty rational.  What we have is subtle differences in ideals and values and preferred axioms that become more obvious when we interact with each other.  

---

As best as I can tell, I basically think like an INTP, the difference is I'm lazier and more egotistical in my pursuit of truth.

&gt; For example, do you have an internal monologue of some sort? Is it audible a little bit to you?

Yes.  But this is a verbal-thinker thing.  A visual NP wouldn't do it as much.

&gt; Do you think with mental maps? Are you highly visual?

Yes.  No.  I can push it, but usually don't think in pictures and color.

&gt; Do you think you have really good working memory?

Somewhat.  I'm very comfortable with putting ideas down and trusting that I'll pick up the good ones later when I need to.  But I don't think my working memory is any better than would be normal for my IQ, and might actually test a little worse.  (Very easily distracted.)  

I think better with scratch paper, especially when working through math/science problems.

&gt; Do you feel as if you can "think" on two somewhat independent tracks?

Absolutely, although I think this ability is commonly presented as more powerful than it actually is.  I can't follow multiple tracks with the same focus as I can devote to one.  And it's hard to describe this mode, because the only way I've seen it illustrated *outside* my head is visually.  So, [I think like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZLjTj0kAA), but not visually.  Analogy and predication and all that verbal stuff, not color and form.

If you watch me write you can probably tell which I'm doing.  Putting words to page, I have to be thinking linearly, because that's how written and spoken language work.  Stop to daydream, that's when I'm thinking broadly.It makes for believable character interactions in fiction.  That's mostly what I value it for.
Values: Fe-Ti.  Belonging to a clan and contributing to it feels natural to you.  When an officer says "these are my men" he really means "I belong to them."  (Confidence: fairly high)

Perception: Si-Ne.  Your mind is observant but doesn't necessarily speak up until it notices connections.  When faced with a new problem, you'll need to work through multiple hypotheses to find something that works.  It's more efficient to start with a recipe or procedure and improvise as needed, and if you don't experience it's natural to reach out to books, experts, or friends as a starting point.  (Confidence: moderate)

Attempted typings: xSFJ, ENTP

**ISFJ** is often described as bookish and quiet and creature-of-habit, but this stereotype can be easily taken too far.  They're not likely to *incite* chaos, but they handle it well enough as long as they have trustworthy friends to give them confidence.  Those with good distress tolerance (and that does sound like you) are particularly good troubleshooters and emergency leaders.  Under less stress, they prefer to cultivate themselves and others from the sidelines.  May wilt under personal attack, will fight to death for their tribe.  (knowledge)

**ESFJ** is like a warm hearth in a cabin on a snowy hill - they generate zeal and fellowship and take pride and sustenance from gathering and inspiring a tribe.  Internally, however, they are not too different from the ISFJ, maybe a bit more creative and a bit less disciplined.  The big difference is how *addicted* they become to cool people - they get addicted a lot.  Remarkably tolerant, but becomes rigidly judgemental when threatened by evil.  (connection)

**ENTP** is an unusual bridge between the dispassionate rational types and the highly social tribal types.  Where an ESFJ gathers and empowers people, an ENTP collects and enshrines ideas and experiences.  They are natural students (but not so much in school) and teachers and historians and storytellers.  Vulnerable to boredom and likely to develop wanderlust if things become too static.  (curiosity)I'd agree that they're the most cuddly.  They love the stimulation of new ideas and perspectives and end up affectionate towards people once their Fe warms up.&gt; If you could give me real life examples

Sure, I can willfully misinterpret that and give a fictional one. (:

["Yeah, okay.  Nice meetin' you."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjfzdLQ6gbs)

When an ISTP is being mean, they'll generally do it through indifference, isolation, or well-aimed criticism.  The first two might not be intentional, at least not entirely.

But that's part of the thing: kindness as a virtue requires effort.  This means that everyone is doomed to some level of being an asshole, simply because there isn't enough energy to go around.It goes for everyone too, I don't want to put myself on a pedestal there.&gt; How do I add text to this thing? 

Comment to a link post (like you did), or post a self-post (also called text post) and link to what you want to talk about inside.

There used to be subtle reddiquette differences between them, but there was a recent change to the karma algorithms that makes the two pretty much equivalent now.

Welcome aboard.Enlightened self-interest makes good arguments for kindness.  

Metaphysics of quality, aristotelian virtue ethics, kantian categorical imperative, etc. etc.  A lot of ink has been spilled arguing that caring for others to make yourself feel like a good person does in fact make you a good person. 

Or at least a reasonably accurate facsimile.

Something like that.  At least the effect is the same.  Right? 

(*scruples intensify*)INFP.  Verbal, but let's see what the quiz says.

... What, no dramaturgy?  I love dramaturgy.

&gt; You got: Verbal-Linguistic Intelligence
**Hermione** is an ISTJ.  The Te-Fi alliance gives her the particular brand of romanticism that is found in IxTJ.  She's too much of a conformist for an INTJ typing, though.  Intellectual enough for either.

**Harry:** ENFJ.  We are oh so fortunate that he didn't choose Slytherin, and his story is a fantastic case-study in overcoming an abusive past.  

What is the most important theme of his internal conflicts?  *Belonging.*  He grows up in a family that doesn't want him, and is then thrust into a world that loves him - before he's had any chance to earn that love.  So what does he do?  He drinks it up and blossoms - but he drinks it up first.  That's not Fi.  Fi would be too wounded by the insincerity of "the boy who lived."  Instead it goes to his head, but it doesn't corrupt him.  Instead it inspires profound, heroic loyalty to the wizarding "family."

He's Fe-dominant and amazingly so.  Taking that into consideration, is he S or N?  It's easy to say "well, he's not that bright, so not N" - but that's not the question.  Si-Ne or Ni-Se?  

[Check out this type angst, too](http://www.alittlebitofpersonality.com/2013/08/enfj-faramir-dilemma-definition.html)

(And, no, I don't think he's curious enough for curiosity's sake to be a typical SP anything.  He's just not driven in that way.)

**Dumbledore:** INFJ.  This is much less contentious a typing than the previous one.

**Remus Lupin:** INFP.  He's larger than life, but the quietly tragic moral steadfastness of his is Fi of oceanic proportions.  His quiet perceptiveness is INP or maybe ISJ.&gt;  He doesn't take care of people, like Molly does

This is a very valid observation.

But why would he have those caretaking skills?  He never saw them modelled in childhood.  I think he would if he could, but he simply can't.  And he can feel that part of himself missing, even though on some level he knows it should be there.Te isn't an information-processing function.  Don't think of T types as *better* thinkers, they're generally *more confident* thinkers.

The know-it-all thing, though?  It's better described as *awkward* and insecure Te.  If it were stronger, or the INFP in question more mature, comparisons wouldn't matter so much.

It can also be a good sign that an INFP is hurting or even going over to the dark side.Absolute best?  Anyone who has made victory a personal goal.  

Casual game?  ISxJ or maybe INxx.

Being wrong only strengthens my know-it-all side.  It's pretty ugly.Any.  Deja vu is a neurological glitch, to the point that if you experience it frequently you should talk to a doctor.  (Harmless by itself but sometimes a symptom of epilepsy and brain trauma and so on.)Haha, no that's Ne, don't traumatize them!This.  This is the right stuff.

How about chess, with standard openings and endgames?  Maybe Scrabble.  I'm thinking that applied-knowledge tasks like that would be right up Ni's alley too.Unabashed Nazism is funny now?  Why didn't I get the memo?

(*GMail: 1283 unread*)

...oooh.

&gt; Fascism makes hollow promises in order to gain absolute control and mobilise the poluation in military conquest.

Nah, that's too narrow of a definition.  Franco never tried to mobilize for foreign conquest.  (Hey, can we have Gibraltar back?  No? okay...)  Non-fascist dictators, too, have been wise enough to not follow in the footsteps of Napoleon and Hitler.Have you seen the Meet the Pyro video for TF2?

I do believe in magic.Be flexible. 

You're usually more intelligent too.Mmhmm.
Im a know it all when it comes to what I want, what my intentions are and my feelings towards individuals. Concerning these subjects, I can appear quite the arrogant person (been told so). But I am constantly plagued by self doubt.Hi, female infp (23) here :)  Have you experienced fi-si loop before? How is that like for you? Also, what is the most compelling aspect of you or an example of why you are an infp? 


Thanks!I got visual spacial. Good with directions? Ha u funnay.I got Tina Fey as well but Im an infp 🤓Fi dom Ne aux. I like it because its cathartic, relieves tension and makes me feel stronger. I like to be prepared in a scenario where I can only rely on myself and my strength ie: run away from harm or lifting a mini fridge lol. Quite often I end up having to do these things myself anyway. Going to the gym or working out is painful but ultimately I remind myself fitness is self love.- Type: INFP 4w5 
- Hogwarts House: Ravenclaw (recent), Slytherin (accepted) and formerly Gryffindor.
- Ilvermorny House: Thunderbird 
- Wand: Sycamore wood with phoenix core and slightly springy
- Patronus: Great Grey Owl

Before pottermore, I took online quizzes and consistently got Slytherin house. When I joined pottermore, they sorted me Gryffindor (which I understand seeing as though somehow slytherin can be mistaken for gryffindor based on stereotypes). Slytherin is my accepted house but ravenclaw seems the most appealing (their common room has the best view! but also I like their colors). Taken into account of what I actually value, I can see why I got sorted into Ravenclaw even though I don't live according to them (quest for knowledge, intellectual curiosity, detachment). I would say I probably act more accordingly to Slytherin but really admire Ravenclaw's style :) As for the Ilvermorny house, Im just glad I did not get pukwudgie LOLLL. I don't really know the types of people who tick me off, but based on stereotypes I suppose they could be Se dominant or Te dominant. I get along great with an ESFP though, but he is quite ambivert and is not at all an imposing person. My close friends are mostly introverts: ISTJ and INFJ.  I agree with Ni feeling like a black hole, often times I would say 10x the amount of words and ideas and get 2x in return and it makes me question myself LOL. But I understand that while their behavior might be draining on me, similarly my behavior probably drains them too! In whole, I can't say that I loath Se/Ni but rather its all about what behavior ends up not being compatible/readily understood by me. I just have to put in more energy to understand those behaviors exhibited by other types. I actually find that other types in the same quadra as mine (INFP) are probably more aggravating than types in other groups just because I believe that if I don't like something about someone, it's probably has to do with the fact that I can't accept that in myself. Ie: ISTJ tendency to constantly pick on 'seemingly' insignificant details and constantly regulate people's actions yet cannot handle when its being put on them. I can see myself behaving this way. A fairy that likes hugging &amp; cares about everyone. 


lol no Tune out.I start fantasizing about something or some place pleasant c:the road eternalFo reals doe.LMAO what childhood did he have. Too real.Ooh.. hmm. I originally thought some traits of him came across as expressed Ti. Like his attention to detail and dedication to understanding all things logic based. He is the type to value accuracy over efficiency though. He does not focus terribly much on personal relations, but Im starting to lean towards Te. I don't know a lot about Fi being inferior or how it looks like. Thank you for your thoughts! Its hard for me to see Ne expressed, so maybe it is inferior. But I have a closer friend who is ISTJ and even I can see her Ne expressed. Infp, admirer of enfj and entj :^)It's the thing responsible for all those moments where I'm analyzing people; their intentions, their behavior, the things they say and how they relate to people. I'd like to think it's why in the past, I was so motivated to calculate, weigh and differentiate all personal relationships I had with people and the relationships owned by those I cared about. Also, always trying to avoid seeming over the top or over-expressing. Not sure how responsible Fi is for this, but as a kid I was never comfortable expressing how happy I felt because it would make me feel embarrassed or attention-seeking. It's easy to write off something or make a decision based on how 'important' I think something is, I think this is why people who argue over minute details drive me insane. Honestly, WHO CARES? Also also, I'd like to think its responsible for evaluating the consistency of people's behavior and personality. This in turn made me only really respect the adults around me that lived and acted according to what they said. In school, I was strangely eager to please adults to earn their respect yet simultaneously reluctant to trust them because I myself had certain standards for what constituted a good adult/teacher. Lol, I had too much time on my hands... I thought their stereotypes were like being handy and cooler than you daredevils lol. I might have an Istp friend and I don't think he's boring at all.criticism and obsession over details that don't seem important to anyone concerned, except for that one person who insists on arguing about it/pointing it out. people who don't mind their own business when they should, ie: rubberneckers. 

from an infp Seriously.. the harder someone tries to force something on me, the more repulsed I am by it. I feel bad because this isn't fair to the friends who try to share things with me...Because its not really observable and personal in nature, I would say it tends to be useful in relationships (with others and with the self). It makes introspection come more easily and with introspection, I can make more meaningful decisions in my life. I think it helps me strive towards consistency.Enjoyed it, but probably did not love it. The ending was satisfying. I don't think Fi vs Fe influences which values people hold onto. That probably has more to do with how one is raised, who influenced them, their culture, etc. Mm yess.. black. Black like ma heart I also got fairly high Ni in that test and its weird. At the time, I started googling to see if other people were discussing this (other infps also testing high Ni) and I stumbled upon this dude's post on how Infps use Ni. He also talked about how INFJ having strong Fi but it being undervalued as well. Quite interesting! 

http://leontsao.com/2016/02/24/infps-intps-ni-in-the-id/  Infp here. My specialty is casual art, procrastination and dark humor.Accurate. ISTJ friend stresses out about things not happening, but would rather bother other people to do something about it instead of doing something about it themselves lol. It seems like they appreciate things being clear and planned out but don't necessarily initiate or lead the process until they really really have to.Can I know what you pisses you off? And how you tend to prioritize information within conflict? I find its easier to try to narrow down axis pairs. For example, Fe is pretty different from Fi. I use this to distinguish between INFP and INFJ (which to me, might appear very similar because we tend to have similar goals but the way we go about achieving them tends to be different)Probably entj or estj With regards to planning things to do, I tend to be laid back about the situation. But I won't stress about things not getting done nor would I push others, because if its that important to me- I would do it myself, with or without the people that I am planning with. LOL. I am always prepared to go my own way. My style of leadership is to survey and assist, not direct. I find my INFJ friend is better at directing and planning than I, but together we work quite well. Basically, I don't stress as much about planning things out clearly or following those plans. I like improvising and I am ok with ambiguity with most things. I notice the way I communicate is also this way, open for multiple interpretations and with space for change. This no doubt frustrates my Te dominant friends :3 But if its something very important, I get straight to the point with urgency. &gt;&gt;I like categorizing things not physically, but mentally. I have a very dense system of categorizations I have created about people. I like pointing out double standards, stuff like that. I'm always thinking about how to make things work, making sure my argument applies to every possible situation. 

This is me tho. People who don't know me as well, or who have known me during high school seem to guess that I'm INTJ. This is probably due to me not immediately appearing like infp stereotypes on the internet. Infps are analytical, our area of focus just tends to be human and morals topics it seems.It'd be nice to make something I love personally and that a lot of people also like and think its great. But from an artistic perspective, a lot of the motivation comes from wanting to accurately express what it is thats inside. No matter the prestige, it'll still feel a little bit hollow inside if it doesn't meet my own personal standards. But at this point in my life, I certainly won't turn down the comfort and satisfaction that prestige would bring :)I still see empathy vs sympathy in Infj vs infp posts. It strikes me odd that INFJ would more often get empathetic/empathy description when I imagine that INFP would actually practice that more. I think INFJ is much better with sympathy, being sympathetic to others and showing sympathy regardless of whether or not they can personally, truly understand or relate.
Infp who would like to be what people first think I am,  an Intj ._.What would you say is one of the most distinguishable characteristic of yourself and do you find other ISTPs have that in common with you?  I can imagine that someone would be hurt to read criticisms from someone you consider a long time close friend and it is unfortunate she found out you wrote those things. I suppose it doesn't matter how she found out, but you didn't do anything wrong by seeking counsel via venting. She might be feeling betrayed you didn't bring these issues up with her personally, but would she be able to handle it then? The fact that you have opinions of her is allowed, but perhaps its the way it came out that ended up hurting her. I hope she can recover and be the bigger person to have a good talk with you about this. Wishing you both the best.Pretty close c: Im an infp that confirms: 
1. Preference for indirect communication, open to interpretation.
2. Prefers options, not strictly adhering to schedules.
3. Second-thinking, overthinking. 
4. Tendency to focus on depth of things, depth of relationships, analyzing people's emotions/intentions.
5. Negligence of details and rules. 
6. Sensitive, but does not show it. 
7. Providing validation for those I care about.

I am not infp in the following ways: 
1. Romantic, optimist, seeing through rose colored glass
2. Warm 
3. Easy to take advantage due to unassuming appearance and behavior. I think I'm quite harsh. 

I've tested enneagram type 4, I find the description for that type (especially the struggles) to be much more accurate than a lot of stereotypes associated with INFP.That people can see through my bullshit, that I'm predictable and vulnerable. Physically, I'm self conscious about my nose and my shoulders. What kind of things are they asking from you? I'm an infp and I only bother people that I need something from (friendship, time, etc) and people that I want to be around. So to me, this doesn't sound like a crime...If they accept this from me, then its my understanding that we have some sort of friendship going on. If they're consistently taking in this interaction/relationship, then perhaps it's time to balance it a bit by drawing boundaries. I relate to the bit about questioning what you believe. I periodically do an overhaul of my beliefs. Its stressful..because so easily it can just end up making me think "Am I a hypocrite for going back on things and believing in two contradictory things?" I like being around people who hold contrasting beliefs as me as well, it's like having access to a different perspective that I recognize within myself. A tiny part of myself.

#17) I love Indie Rock. 

lmao wat Not exactly popular, was standoffish. Had one person I was really close to and only associated myself with non-delinquents even though I myself could have been considered a delinquent. I did just enough work to get classed with smarter students to avoid the pleb classes lolLol, omg. Can relate to the harsh character attacks from not doing something mundane like washing the dishes... Although, not exactly sure if my mom is an ESFJ. That I'm intimidating, lol.I got entp, even though I had equal amount of responses for: entp, istp, estp and intp. Suffice to say... my current mood must be: apathetic. LOL I've researched mostly my own type infp and infj. Next would be istj and entj. I read a lot about cognitive functions but I'm not entirely sure how it all fits together and gets used by types lolI have an istp friend that plays a lot of support. i do wonder what his enneagram type is though, maybe thats more of an indicator.Who tends to take the lead in planning things or initiating? I have 2 infj friends that I enjoy talking to very much. It took some getting used to, because I'm someone that starts talking about a bunch of random things and I can spring an entire rant full of ideas and thoughts on them. I think it can be overwhelming for them, because when they communicate, they are more thoughtful and deliberate with what they decide to share. So it can make me wonder, have I said too much? Do they not agree? Are they disinterested in this conversation? 

It just takes them longer to craft the response they want and I understand that now. I appreciate their thoughtfulness, and I don't think it's boring to talk with them. They are great listeners and I feel free to talk with them about various things, but I find it tends to be most engaging when the topic concerns people, our lives and how it impacts our futures. Infp slytherin I'm an infp and I wouldn't say that I'm happy but I know I'd be less happy trying to pretend to be another type and failing at it LOL.For whatever reason, I am surrounded by Infjs. They make good company, for festivities or for sharing silence.To find out what you're really after and self care.Not being able to handle what they dish out :) ie: my opinion is the only valid one and you just suck and have poor judgment and taste, will be butthurt if you attack me on this.INFP 4w5 here. Speaking entirely thereotically because I have never been in a romantic relationship before, sorry :( 


1. I believe non monogamous relationships provide freedom, reduced pressure and cultivates more nondiscriminating love and acceptance but requires a lot of effort (frequently checking in with yourself and multiple partners), A LOT of maturity and has less security. 

2. I am more open to this but I don't think Im ready for it haha. Basically I need to work on communicating with others before I attempt it. Also, to be more comfortable and at ease with being by myself. 

3. To be successful at it, I think you'd have to be pretty damn good at unconditional love and to be supremely self aware. One would need to master communication and have a lot of patience. 

I once read a book on polyamorous love and relationships lol. It basically introduced me to this concept and I'd like to think it expanded and altered my own personal relationships in my life for the better. The book is called The Ethical Slut for anyone interested :)I like that they are nonjudgmental at the core. Communicating with them is easy for me as an Infp because we share similar goals but they achieve it in a way that is inclusive, with more social finesse and is objective. They are able to handle one on one interactions as well as transform to be a supporter and initiator in a group setting, which makes for an excellent wingman/woman for new experiences and meeting new people. Infj is the type I can count on to be receptive of my whackiness, blunt and stark sense of humor but still provide groundedness.

 They certainly don't give themselves enough credit for how wise and thoughtful they can be. I only wished they could be as perceptive about their own agendas and internal life as they are about others lol, although I suppose this can be said about other types including my own as well haha. I have two friends of this type and it took me some trial and error to come to understand Fe vs Fi, i think as an Fi user I misunderstood and distrusted Fe a lot.Not the ISTJ I know, but I only know one lol. They're always the one to remind me of the "rules" and the "right way to do things", to my annoyance. They are the person to signal even if they're parking into their own damn garage. They don't seem to care for fashion, only what is comfortable and practical to wear. They have an active imagination and dream life that they only share with people they are comfortable with and trust. Not really morals, more so relating to laws and existing conduct. Ie: you do it this way because this is what other people do and its the way its been done. Most of the time, it pertains to the law and accomplishing something with efficiency. For example, I can count on Istj to help me in cooking a new dish because they have experience in preparing things and they tell me how its "usually" done. But sometimes, this leads them also think theres only "one right opinion" and that it's theirs lol, which is silly esp. when it has to do with something completely subjective like "I don't think that person is attractive" and then they're offended because somehow.. there can only be one right opinion. 

Probably not an Istj thing, since I only know one istj I can't say if its a common shared thing, that they seem to not be able to handle what they put out. I think because they use Te to communicate, it can come across as harsh or blunt yet, their tert Fi can't seem to handle being treated in similar ways. This might make my Istj seem uptight and moralistic, but I would say for the most part they are quite laid back. When their thoughts of "this is the right way!! You're doing it wrong." dont get communicated, they just get super anxious.God, no lmao :| I'm inclined to think that from this, Fe users are able to compromise better than Fi users in terms of what they understand and recognize as "love". For fashion.. I cant help it, I know its insensitive but haters gonna hate.Infp: I wish I could be more consistent in how I express myself and treat others. I think it depends on resilience, no matter the type. It would seem feelers have more experience dealing with sensitivities and the things that affect them since they naturally pay more attention to these matters and spend considerable time in working with how they feel and how other people feel. So that experience can give a certain level of comfort and ease in processing it all. Personally, as a infp I'm often stuck in my own head, making certain things a "problem" when other thinkers wouldn't- but I'd also like to think that, when really painful or upsetting things happen I am more well equipped to deal with the emotional side-effects. Suppression and denial as coping strategies tend to not work well, for me in the long run. It might work for others if they can function decently in the mean time. I like it for the most part, its how I get to be playful and be spontaneous. The worst thing is when it causes me to entertain never ending negative possibilities.  * Si: underrated, hidden gem
* Se: over the top, entertaining
* Ni: golden nugget, enlightening, biased 
* Ne: funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn, but also shut up?? 
* Ti: Wish I could have this, like Fi minus the extra baggage and drama
* Te: anal retentive, love/hate, like a boss
* Fi: just stop
* Fe: imposing yet accommodating, all about equality and reciprocity, respectful I don't know why but I didn't enjoy that game :( * Fe is active and goal oriented, its used to achieve a certain harmony of values and feelings shared by tuning into what values/feelings are expressed by OTHER people. Types who use Fe are usually really good at picking up how other people feel and communicating it/mirroring it. They're also good at bringing people together and creating a common goal/activity for everyone to enjoy, very inclusive. 
* Fi is internal and individualistic, its used in a more private, one-on-one basis type of way. It considers the SELF first in considering how to best respect/treat other people's values/feelings. Types who use Fi are usually more private in what they express, because they don't want to be insensitive to what other people are feeling/want. They don't impose and they don't direct. They are always hyper aware of how things affect them, for good or worse.
* An easy way to tell whether or not someone has Fe or Fi in their stack is to see what they tend to value more. Fe will have a more utilitarian style, create the best scenario for the whole group while sacrificing some personal views of either the self or the few. Fi would be more willing to polarize others in order preserve individuality, it doesn't compromise nearly as easily as Fe.  Weird.I can charmed and won over by: 
* Demonstrating that what you say and what you do align for the most part 
* Mastery in something you care about and sharing that passion
* Confidence 
* This is fucked up to say but, basically someone who can play mind games just as well as me LOL :( I only know one ISTP and they are a type 6 enneagram. Unsure how accurate his typing is, since he only took the tests once. But going on this, I find him surprisingly sensitive as well as a creature of comfort. He is not opposed to doing new things but when left on his own devices, he tends to stick to simple routines and habits ie: eating the same food. He seems to find negative attitudes highly offensive and enjoys a lot of alone time, more so than any introvert I know lol.I agree we appear similar on the surface, it has even on occasions made me think just how similar we are. So when it just so happens that we arrive at a point where we are divided or even speaking a different language, it is a little jarring. We share similar values, but our styles of achieving or realizing our values is quite different.  I agree that Fe is definitely more expressive than Fi, given that it is extroverted and does mirroring action. But, I would consider myself fairly animated and I wish I had a better poker face during moments. I've been told I tend to make a lot of random facial expressions, exaggerated even but this is probably Ne at work lol.Im inclined to agree with this. It would seem Fe would find more issue with how sentiments are being delivered/communicated whereas I personally find the actual intent more offensive. I have acts of service as my top followed by quality time. I think it may depend on other things as well, such as age and what you have observed as being a common expression of love and affection. My family background is one where words are cheap and actions definitely speak louder. I would wager, more younger people tend to value words of affirmation/quality higher and as you get older, your needs change. I can see acts of service having more value and meaning when you find yourself short of time and busier, etc. I show up to interviews as an Intj in order to land the job. I used to feel the same way, despite my Infj friends who tell me that as an Infp, I offer them invaluable advice that they can always rely on. Its hard to see the value of a function that can cause me so much trouble and annoyance, especially in a society that seems to encourage that we suppress how we truly feel, what we truly think, etc. But whenever I hear about the things another INFP is doing and the advice they give to others, I think how admirable it is that they are so true to themselves and they are so committed to their growth. It's refreshing and inspires me to do the same, because those are my goals too as an INFP. It would be nice to be well-rounded and find values in other ways of "being", but there is no use in trying to become say, an INTP when I will be at best, a clumsy one. I got explorer. But I'm actually quite lazy LOL.. and also have a decent level of social anxiety so often times I opt to stay home.. instead of doing that thing I've been wanting to do ;-; INFP as Wanderer (A spontaneous drifter) You're fast to adapt to wherever life takes you.\

* openness: 31% 
* conscientiousness: 2% (Yikes.)
* extraversion: 54% (LOL)
* agreeableness: 54% (again LOL)
* neuroticism: 62% 

* outlook: emotional 
* character: thoughtful 
* self control: reserved 
* composure: direct
* taste: blockbuster

I find that the latter portion tends to make sense for the INFP type. Didn't include the rest cus lazy :p This was a neat test, but I find the second half .. boring? or rather, I questioned why they needed to know what brands or products I used. I'm a sucker for fads, so I like a bit of everything. Lately I've been into the whole business casual look of a blazer and relaxed button ups with shorts or jeans. Fashion is merely one of the forms of self expression so I'm not really content to just wear the same things for eternity.. The idea of a capsule wardrobe is so, so appealing though. I know it's just not practical or realistic for me at this time :(For me, Si tends to come as a relief function. It tends to check my first two functions, both of which I use and rely on heavily to process information. As an INFP, I tend to hold onto events that have really affected me and I attach value to it. This event then gets sort of cataloged and used in a way to reference how I handle future events. These things that I have been affected by also become a solid component of how I view myself; I either use it as an example to grow out of it, or to further emphasize. It surprised me to know that not everyone operates this way lol. I am sure as an INFP, my comfort level and skill with this function doesn't match the efficiency and mastery that of ISFJ or ISTJs. I find myself not trusting my own Si and also it tends to blow past events out of proportions, especially with regards to mistakes I have made. It just keeps haunting me ;-; But when it works, it is life saving.I find it easy to appreciate their company when I lower my expectations and engage completely in the present moment with them. I tend to want to be active and physical together with them, it has an energizing effect on me :)  Narcissism 9

MMMM. Equating everything to their emotions and allowing that alone to define them. Too sad to function, too mad to move on, feelings = only reality. 


If we're talking about (Se)nsors as friends, I personally don't have any close friends that use this function as a main function. This is because I don't bother wasting my energy trying to force a connection with people that also have no interest in establishing any with me. Of course, human connection is not entirely dictated by typology... 

I think regardless of type, if I have nothing in common with someone it becomes very taxing for both parties to sustain a conversation. Each person has particular interests and their own communication style that might or might not be compatible with yours. I used to feel frustrated not being able to connect with everyone, because I too wanted to be well-rounded. 

I am assuming self development and growth is important to you, so my advice is just this: While this is still a work in progress for me, I would just say that in order to appreciate what each person offers, you have to also be willing to accept what they don't. If I'm looking to try something new, do something exciting and get physical (mainly outdoor activities), I can always count on (Se)nsors to be up for something. Similarly, if I am looking to talk about history/current events/random shit, I know I can always count on my ISTJ to reply to a 2am rant about any of those topics. At the end of the day, all types have something unique to offer and it's completely ok if you don't click with them and vice versa. Im assuming it has to do with stereotypes. ISTJs are supposedly more inclined to reject new information immediately, in favor of double checking their own database of information. Typology is frequently challenged, whether or not its accurate, at all applicable to people and whether or not it actually describes personality, etc. The ISTJ in my life is a collector of random facts and information, but is also critically skeptical of new things/ideas. Whenever I ramble on about MBTI to her, her response is along the lines of "Interesting, but I still don't get it. I would like to learn more, but it's just so confusing." This isn't an outright rejection or dismissal, so I just go on ahead and keep pestering her about the topic :) 

I think a more common thing is to hear about ESTJs rejecting MBTI. I choose the option where theres no child. Not at all pitiful. People are hard to understand in general, but its great that understanding yourself can in turn help others understand you : ) Esfj, Enfj &amp; Istp. Dominant Fe users both in my work and personal life just in general radiate warmth and humor. Super patient and humorous as well. They make my day easier and I find myself aspiring to improve my own outlook and attitude just by being around their kindness. 

On the other end, I find Istp's are so incredibly innocent and sensitive. I trust that they almost never have ulterior motives. Maybe because they are incapable or simply just don't care to. It's calming and refreshing. 
Yass gorl Elie Saab. His work is so beautiful! Wrong. I want to be every type, depending on what I'm feeling like for the day.Thats interesting. The infjs I know are always in a mode of "striving", which sounds stressful but they make it seem natural and absolutely calm from the exterior. I also find that they are always so illuminating on the issues of others, but so glaringly blind to their own problems and emotions (which any type can commit). They just have so much determination in achieving the vision they have, that anything that undermines that vision will be ignored until the bitter end, until they can idealize and strive no more. I find this quality admirable, no matter how difficult it may seem. I guess maybe as an infp, I can relate to the constant "seeking" and "striving" for our personal ideal. The constant striving is also what tends to make self-satisfaction out of reach. They are also very hard on themselves for trying to reach their own definition of perfection. I would say it is somewhat true, as I can agree with a few things. It is a rather positive description of infp though. In response to the question, where are healthy infps found, honestly.. If you had met me, you'd be deceived to think that I am an healthy infp. I am healthy enough to know what unhealthy looks like, but this is not to say I am comfortable having someone know me on an intimate level. I don't think there is a "place" to find any healthy type lol. Even if you were to follow the idea of "like attracts like", by exhibiting vibes of stability, maturity and positivity- there is still the likelihood of attracting someone who is lacking in all of these things. Still, it seems like the best and the most proactive thing you could do in order to increase your chances of meeting the most developed type of your dual :) I got enfp, close enough lol Sounds about right.So I've been trying to type a friend for a while now, but still can't really decide on a pair of functions or type that most fits him. He has taken the 16personalities quiz as well as a functions test. He got ESFJ on 16 and disagreed with most of the descriptions but particularly the bit about being a "cheerleader" and or popular like the jock. Actually just paraphrasing this makes me cringe LOL. I can agree enough that he doesn't seem like he is a Fe dom at all. But I can see him having Ti. I just have difficulty telling apart whether he has stronger Ti or Te. In the functions test, he scored only a bit higher for Te than Ti. Here's some notes about my friend:

- He seems to struggle a lot in understanding people's behavior and their motivation; easily frustrated/angered by people who cut him off in the road or commit general human errors/shitty things.
- He seems to communicate in a very articulate way, never just saying things randomly. He also struggles understanding people if they don't communicate in a very thorough language ie: This is A. I mean A. Maybe my style of communication just isn't as compatible with his, but this makes me suspect he probably has Ni over Ne. 
- Extremely detail oriented. He can focus on one task and dedicate his time to perfect it! 
- He is not outgoing but fine socializing. I have told him on many occasions that he is someone quite balanced in masculinity and femininity. He is able to connect well with females in this regard. Yet he is equally capable of spending time by himself. I suspect he gets the extroversion aspect from focusing his energy outside of himself. 
- He is somewhat conservative in his values but more open with ideas not connected to people and feelings. 
- He has a variety of interests and as such, I'm always finding myself consulting and asking him for help on a variety of subjects. He is quite a hands-on person and is always generous with his time to help others. But he does assign value to knowledge ie: some things don't matter in the end because can't be used.
- He is quite good at gift-giving, he puts in the thought. Though, he has said he would still prefer people just tell him what they want and give a "guideline" or "wishlist". 
- Has moments where he IS being a cheerleader, clapping and cheering people on. But mostly, he is a encouraging person. But to me, it sometimes comes across as an intense expression if that makes sense LOL. Like a concentrated dose, since on a normal basis he is not bouncing off the walls and egging people on to do things. It's very laid back. 
- Goes with the flow type of person. He is rarely directive, unless prompted to share his take on how to get something done or what to do. 
- Not as well versed in comforting people, but I can see that his style of empathizing would be to offer solidarity and basically trying to share whatever you are feeling ie: someone did something shitty to you? wow fuck that person! Im angry now too.


Cant think of what else to add at the moment, but if anyone has any ideas or if these descriptions even remind you of a type feel free to share! Based on stereotypes, I almost wanted to type him as ISTP but I want to try to understand the differences between the functions first. Any comments and thoughts are appreciated :) 
&gt; ENTP but likable

savage Because to make a multiple choice test to figure one out the types need to be simplified. I know I didn't trust the test cause there were very few questions where my genuine answer was one of the options, so it didn't feel like it could possibly be entirely accurate.Fuck I guess I'm 3/4 ENTPMr Incredible and Elastigirl seem spot on to me, but I don't feel like I see much Fi at all in Violet. I mean, they're not wrong."If your inferior function is x, you probably dread doing y."Because it's not "this is how x function works"?I think everyone I have ever dated has been an INFP.&gt; you probably have a personality disorder

SavageStop, I can only get so erectStop, I can only get so erectThis is the same conclusion I came to.ENTJ, mostly raised by definitely authoritarian mom, some input from permissive, maybe neglectful dad (I sort of lean towards neglectful except I wouldn't call him cold.)ENTJ Slytherin I swear I had that exact exchange with my momI don't mind type me posts. I don't like the idea of just redirecting people to mbtitypeme because it's not a very active sub so I don't consider it a real alternative. 

What I think we need is a specific set of questions/guidelines for type me posts. When they're actually thought-out and full of relevant information, they're a valuable generator for discussion.TIL I'm an INFJ
Very picky eater here. VERY, VERY picky.As an INFP hufflepuff I approveAnother INFP! Sounds exactly like me but except everyone actually did just piss me off and I wasn't afraid to show my passive aggressiveness.Relaxing and gives us time to think or to just not think at all. That's good that you let her have her alone time. I'm sure she appreciates it :)If it helps, it suggested that I am an INFP. Which I am.Interesting. I've heard Dahmer was an INFP and that Bundy was an ENTJ quite a few times.well thenI am not on about psychopathy specifically, I agree there is no solid MBTI for any mental disorder, but I am on about them as individuals.True. I do think that you can see differences though between each person with the same disorder though and that is unfortunately all we can do hereMainly just pizza, chips, and fish for mre lolVegetarian here. Can confirmINFP. Passive aggressive, yet really sensitive. I sometimes act as if I don't care about things but deep down I really fucking do.It isn't something people really want to do, but... definitely give us quiet time to ourselves. Let us vent it all out to you. I know that is the last thing I guess anyone would want to handle with someone passive aggressive and awkward, I will admit, being an INFP is complex.Only liked school as it was another place where I could see my boyfriend.Anxious, jealous wreck and self-loathing.With friends, I am VERY sensitive on the inside. Damn I care about them too much. Distant on the outside. Average internal sensitivity with people I don't really know. I do agree we are caring people but not as much as people make out.Yeah. Dr thinks I have not only GAD, but also OCD so it seems accurate. I still wouldn't belittle what you have though. It is still to you, a massive problem.Boyfriend - ISFJ.

Thank you!Mental health stuffsVisual-SpatialRationality, Shyness, OrderlinessESTPs because of how out there they are. They don't know when to shut up.ISTPs.

Less evil, more troubled.Everyone thinks we are overly emotionalMusic. Calm music for studying thoughINFP, got fifteen... damn psychopathic for an INFPUm. Let me rephrase that, then... by the concept that has been created, what is the worst thing you have done morally?The point of the question really flew over your head, didn't it?The POINT of the question did. I didn't mean all this nonsense about it not existing. I get what you are saying but it was not what I meant.I'm currently not cryingI try and make an excuse to get the fuck out of thereAll Thinkers are automatically crossed out.

The only ISFP I get along with is my father... The rest are just full of shit. Crossed out.

INFPs... Well I am one and I am ugly as fuuuuck so... Crossed out.

Any judging type is too serious to be cute imo.

Extraverts are too loud... Not cute.

That leaves us with... Nobody. HUA HUA HUA

NOBODYISCUTEI cannot really comment on this bit as I do not know any ESFPs irl but ive seen you on this subreddit a lot and you seem niceSince a lot of your posts are downvoted as hell I think that says a lotI'm an INFP and I am shit academicallyDichotomies then.Yep me tooPluto all the wayPlutoI constantly just fall asleep in my own thoughtsBritish, so might be a bit different. My grades are literally just C's with a couple of B's and one D and E.It's the grade below a D. In other words very shit. Keep in mind I am in Year 12 (don't know what that is outside of Britain) so mine are probably not on the same level as yours. Yeah I'm young hahaBeing an INFP academically is either good or bad, no inbetweenIt really is. It's the only way I'm keeping up on my psychology class hahaI was on about most people but okIt is meant to be more of a "But if you HAD to pick one.."Any thinker really. Oh and extroverts mostly to me.People watching - Fail, Right brain - 60%Gunna be honest, I only really give a shit about those close to me. I can easily offend someone without it bothering me. However if you are close to me... I care a LOT.Something they're familiar with? "Why are you taking so long?"

Something they aren't familiar with? "Um... do you need help?"

However if I don't know the person I am too awkward to even say anything.I can go longer than average without talking to someone. When I do socialise, it's mostly with one or two people at a time. Anything more is exhausting.Procrastinate.6/40FacebookA stereotype is to be all empathetic and care about everyones feelings soYepWould you say ISTJs are  prone to guilt/remorse?

INFxs are probably two of the most mistyped.Good point but most of the flair is just INFPs chatting bollocks about how their self-diagnosed depression came on because of how they found out that their ex was an ESTP.It's just all so pretentiousI am an INFP. I just do not express my emotions with anyone but those closest to me. I guess I must have a higher Fi then.I think it's good to address an issue in order to show people how they can change thoughThey'll probably then blame me for their self diagnosed anxiety disorder.

And yes, I am British.Dad - ISFP, Mum - ESxJAnother thing... foot painI'm 5'4ft-5'5ft and feel too tall for a girl. A lot of people say being tall is nice and model like but the thing is model height is like 5'10ft! So I'm not even that. I'm like the awkward kind of tall. Or is every other girl around me just short?I'm British so I guess I am pretty average but I suppose the girls in this part are just short. Parents aren't from this part of Britain so might be why my height genes don't match with theirs lol.I have only had one boyfriend who I have ever been with, but to previous crushes not liking me back? Weeks of feeling really sad, a lot of the time in tears over it.Hes practically sensitive, is the problem. If it bothers someone he might do it anyway if logic says its right but he gets massive amounts of guilt over it.My ISxJ boyfriend and INFJ friend are the only people i share it with.I get so into stuff that I like telling my friends but with MBTI I only really talk about it with my BF  and BFFI find it hard to get on with ISFPs Bloody hellISTJ: The one secretly analyzing you and judging you

Edit: Yay my type is very close, if not, the same as Salad Fingers. I have learned something new today.I think he is ISTJ. Thank you!He has both a split Fe/Fi Te/TiINTJs and INFJs are similar enough to understand eachother pretty easily, I mean, look at that Ni dom! Flood eachother with interesting theories and ideas.Fi is a piece of shit, but a lovely piece of shit.Yeah I get along with very little INTJs...The next type I've gotten is INTP/INFJ.Um. No, the point flew over your head. By ambivert I mean your introversion and extroversion are very close together. When we mean introvert we mean someone who is DEFINITELY one or the other, same with extrovert.Kinkiest?Kinkiest?OhBritish INFP here..  all I can say is... America's fucked.A mystical, fantasy world? I have no idea what you are on about.ESTJ? Damn!BFF squad - INFJ, INTP, ESTP (all female)

Boyfriend - ISxJISTJ.Serious and unapproachableThe 3 friends I listed are all in a little group of 4 with me, and we all get together pretty well. The ESTP and INFJ do clash a lot though. And I am the one they both come to whilst the INTP is just there like "Oh".More information regarding my ESTP friend - The introversion and extroversion certainly did clash at first as she took it for being rude. After a while though she did accept the fact that I am just quiet by nature.Oh I day dream a lot as an intuitive, so I am never fully aware of my surroundings, but I wouldn't describe the world as all mystical.Never been drunk.Getting a new PC this year and staying at my aunts!WE NEED TO BUILD A WALLI get you. Now that I think about it, a lot of people are starting to prefer Winter. A lot of the people saying that are people who seem to come off as uh.. 'edgy'...INFP here. People who think everyone likes themLike an INFP but probably not daydreaminghttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JokeI worry too much.What do you think the MBTI of the following people were?

Ted Bundy,
Jeffrey Dahmer,
John Wayne Gacy,

Ed Gein,

ENTP -I am aware that mental disorders and mbti are usually unconnected, but I just find this interesting. If you feel comfortable enough, comment your MBTI type and any mental disorders. 

I am an INFP and my Dr suspects I have both OCD and GAD.My mind was thinking about random stuff... then it came to a conclusion. Ayyy, ticklefights. 

How do you think each MBTI type would react to a ticklefight? Ticklish or nah? Hate it or love it? Win or lose?

Gosh, this is probably the weirdest shit I have ever posted.

EDIT: Forgot to include mine. Extremely ticklish and only like being tickled by my boyfriend. It's fun with him! Even if I do lose...
Loathe it when others try tickling me though.Morally.If you are a feeler who doesn't suit a stereotype or know a feeler who doesn't feel free to share below. Personally, I do not feel as much guilt in comparison to how we are represented. I am in no way psychopathic by the way, I would say I feel as much guilt as the average person would, not a "Oh no I replied to them 5 seconds late I am a horrible person and don't deserve to exist!" like how a lot of people talk about us.I get existential a lot, so... type me please. I mean I am sure that I am an INFP but... just making sure.

 1. Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind. 

ANS: My Dr thinks that I may have 2 anxiety disorders - OCD and GAD.

2. You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favourite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?  

ANS: I start panicking over how much time will be lost due to this break down and due to being in the middle of nowhere I worry due to the unfamiliarity of the area. I completely forget about what we were doing or where we were going, I am too busy panicking. On the outside I may just go fully silent, looking around.

3. You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the afterparty that was announced (and assure you they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do? 

ANS: I get annoyed and try to convince them not to go to the after party. I absolutely hate parties - they feel like a sensory overload to me. I think I would also not trust the driver to not get drunk so I would start worrying about that too and think about how in the car later on we would crash and never see our homes ever again.

 4. On the drive back, your friends are talking. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward reaction? What do you outwardly say?  

ANS: I get very fustrated and feel as if I am being personally attacked unintentionally. However, I remain silent and say nothing. If everyone joins in with the discussio  though, I may snap.

5. What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, values?

ANS: I would feel attacked and would try and make an excuse (if necessary) to get out of the situation.

6. What are some of your most important values? How did you come about determining them? How can they change?  

ANS: To me friends and family are the most important thing. With friends only the closest though. Family because you cannot change who isnt or is family and close friends because they are there for you and most friends arent truly as loyal as close friends would be.

7. a) What about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else? b) If you could change one thing about you personality, what would it be? Why? 

ANS:

a.) I think I daydream more than others and think on a deeper level. I also find myself to be very unorganised and procrastinate a lot.

b.) I wish I was more organised and respected more as a person.

 8. How do you treat hunches or gut feelings? In what situations are they most often triggered?  

ANS: I sometimes go by my gut instincts but if I am in denial of what it is trying to say (e.g someone does not like me) I try my best to ignore them.

9. a) What activities energize you most? b) What activities drain you most? Why?  

ANS: a.) Being by myself, eating, resting.

b.) Long conversations, social activities, anything physically active.

10. What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? Why?

ANS: I try to hide as much emotion as I can. I do this so that people do not judge me.So I'm unsure about what my boyfriend is. He seems like his feeling and thinking are evened out, but they may not be. Any help would be appreciated. Information about him below.

So, around me he is fairly in touch with his emotions around me. Not as much as me of course, I am an INFP, but he is in touch with them to a decent degree I would say.  He does not show this to other people, however. I think that may be because he wants people to still see him as masculine I guess. I am pretty sure he told me that once, actually. His masculinity is a big thing to him.

He is VERY worried about how people see him. He wants everyone to like him and to see him as a brilliant person.

He takes feelings into consideration when making choices, but he also puts logic into it too. This is where I'm stuck.

He doesn't really care about people he doesn't know. Not in an apathetic or hurtful way - he has stated he doesn't want any physical harm to come to anyone, even people he dislikes. By not caring he means he wouldn't want to help anyone like a stranger with a problem unless it was major.

I think I may be overthinking it? Please clear things up for me. I feel like I have missed something out here so please let me know in the comments if you have any questions.Comment belowI've heard a lot about people clashing with their type. Personally, I rarely do. I do, however, clash a lot with ISFPs.Seriously, the INFP subreddit is just full of mostly mistyped INFPs putting on the role of the stereotype because of how they read the description from I don't know, 16personalities, and thought, "YESSS DIS IS ME SO EDGYYYY". 

Let me tell you something. Maybe I can't speak for all INFPs, only myself, but I am actually surprised by how much bullshit is in the INFP subreddit. It's all edgy, dark, depressing and just plain ridiculous. Stop. You are making INFPs come off as needier and emotional than we are! We ain't hippies, so stop constantly coming off as one.

Disclaimer: I am not on about all INFPs. Just the ones who got INFP on a quiz, read the description, thought it was edgy, and whacked the stereotype onto their ass.

Thank you.Personally, I am absolutely terrible when it comes to nostalgia because I just cannot move on. Nostalgia for me is not a positive experience, it is more of a negative one as my emotions run wild in some kind of "griefing" mindset. I just miss the atmosphere and back before my anxiety disorder relapsed. Things were really happy back then. I miss Sept 2014-Jul 2015. Everything just felt so right.So FD, MN, same thing, different language....

What do you all think their types are?

Personally, I think...

Yukki - ISFP
Yuno - ENFJ
Akise - INTP
Kosaka - ESTP
Mao - ISFJ
Hinata - ESFP

Can't think of any others. What do you think? Feel free to share what types you think they are.I know that any type can wear them lol. But stereotypically?

I always thought an ExTJ. Stereotypically strong willed, confident, you know... and stilettos represent that.

I on the other hand... am an INFP female who just hates high heels. How do people walk in them?

Also I know a lot of guys have a thing for girls in heels. Comment if you do, I wanna see which type does.

For fun!So my boyfriend is definitely an ISxJ. The thing is, it's as if he's right inbetween...
Does anyone know any tell tale signs?Does anyone else ever feel a bit silly for being into this kind of thing?
Such an INFJDo INFP! DO IT NOW!this is exactly meHaha. That's a joke.ENFJ's, definitely. I like how they try to make me as comfortable as possible, and they try to understand who and what I am. Being a stubborn cunt about personal values.Eddie Vedder. Such an amazing singer and lyricistJudging by your name, you're an INFP. Cobain was definitely ISFP.How so?I seriously don't get it.That's a pretty interesting thought. I do find myself to dislike people that are very similar to myself, but only in my social circle. I seem to like famous people of my type a lot. Perhaps its because of my often misunderstood type, and to see famous people of the same type gives some kind of reassuring feeling, or perhaps a feeling of acknowledgement due to their status in society.And the ISTJ is just sitting there, not really doing much.To represent the type, sorry, edited the post.I feel like INTP's would know if they were INTP's, and INFP's would be more in doubt. When I think of an ENTP, Filthy Frank comes to mind.INFP here. ADD, major depression, anxietyThat I'm very quiet. INFP here. Can confirm. I never freeze during the winter.Ah yes, a typical ESTP. Not knowing what the fuck is going on around them.Heavy Fi users[Here's me, an INFP. My hair is in a ponytail and normally goes down to my nips.](https://i.gyazo.com/17cce0193aefbb3b5de78bc482e60497.png)definitely not my dude lolThere's nothing more important than authenticityTool is probably one of the greatest bands in history. Lyrically and musically.It's not like introverts can't be talkative at times.

I love talking to someone who has the same viewpoints and interests as me. 

If I'm talking to someone who I'm unsure of, and they just keep talking and I really have no interest in knowing anything about that person, I will enter this mode where I'm constantly thinking about how to get out of the situation. And when I'm talking, I enter this automatic response mode, where I just agree with whatever the person is saying while sometimes not really hearing what they're saying. A lot of people are mistyped for being INFPs. People generally think INFPs essentially are stereotypical emos. This couldn't be more wrong. 

A lot of people think that smart = INTJ

Social awkwardness = INTP 

HEY LOOK AT ME IM SO HAPPY = ENFP/ESFPI honestly don't care at all about finding a partner.The easiest for most INFP's I figure would be ENFJ's.Yay druidI am an INFP, and I admire ENFJs

As an extremely unhealthy INFP I love how ENFJs typically try to understand other people, and as a complete loner and outcast, it would be lovely to have that kind of person in my life
I dont think you understand the meaning of the flair. 

It's not the type you admire, its the type you are.

Yours should say ISTJBoth of my parents were typed as ISFJs although I believe my father is an ISTP or ISTJPure curiosity, what's your dad like?I don't see INFP as anything but druid like classes/races. I constantly think the Bosmer in The Elder Scrolls is such an INFP race.I don't have a lot of friends, and I'm definitely not the social kind of dude. If I'm spending time with you one-on-one, there's a good chance that means I'm expressing my affection to you. 

You won't ever hear me flat out saying "I love you" to someone, because it's very hard for me to say. I will only say it if I REALLY mean it. Like really, really, really mean it. Either I'm just staring into thin air, due to my intoxication preventing my abstract mind of actually having an intellectual thought... Or... Since I am missing the capability of actually thinking, I become an ENFP.Psychologist appointment-like conversations. I find myself bonding with people very quickly if I'm having a one-on-one conversation with them.Both ISFJwhats wow about that? just curiousif someone gets a kiddie tantrum it does not equal being extrovertedElliot is such an INFP.I meant kiddie tantrums as a way of expressing anger, which hulk  does. If you show that you're mad in any way, it doesn't mean you're not an introvert. Being introverted only means that you prefer being alone and you basically need to "recharge" for social situations.So you're saying all INTJs have superpowers already?I'm interested why you typed John Lennon as an INTJ instead of lets say an INFP which seems to be the popular choice.One of my favorites

Id say INTPI enjoy my INFP shell, but being an ENTP would make my life so much better.[uhh hi](https://i.gyazo.com/c837f5728fff4ab5a86caaa79ad513d0.png)Dude samewe just want to get along man

lets just love each otherMy favorite poet is Jerry Cantrell and Layne Staley of Alice in Chains.

Why? Because I'm a miserable INFP who likes to identify with something I haven't made up myself.I'm an INFP, my best friend is an INTP. We're both fucked up in the head and we don't have any boundaries when it comes to conversations. We talk about fucked up things, share the same view on humanity and life in general, and we couldn't live without each other.I do enjoy the lyrics and depths of some indie songs, but I usually tend to listen to hard rock based music with very personal lyrics e.g Pearl Jam, Pantera and Tool. What's so interesting about it? It's just coins and paper. I don't really see what's so great about cash.I partied a little bit just to try it out. I found out that I did not really like big and loud parties, but rather preferred smaller parties just with people I know. As a typical INFP, I value intimacy quite highly.I don't really agree on traditions being an Si thing.People who care about me. So ENFJs I guess?I often wonder if there's more to mbti, other than just purely personality. If one's end goal is, like yours, being well-known and highly respected, does it even have anything to do with just the personality type? Does the personality type influence ones goals or does ones goals influence the personality type?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but having these goals is quite typical for narcissistic, machiavellian and/or psychopathic people, right? Are INTJ's usually considered narcissistic, machiavellian and/or psychopathic? 

I know this speculation is a big sidetrack from the original intentions of this thread. But I'm just curious, as I'm starting to doubt the legitimacy of mbti types.

Don't bust my nuts if I'm way off on all of this. I'm not very familiar with the true meaning of mbti yet.I'm a musician, and I really don't care much for people's love/hate towards it. I love making music and listening to it, and it's a way for me to get my feelings out there, thus out of my head so I can concentrate on other things. 

I'm not saying it's not nice to get constructive criticism or compliments for my music, but it's not my goal at all. I create the music for my own sake, and if people enjoy it and/or identifies with it, good for them.Retentive hysteric

Polite, gentle, and unusually placid, you have comparatively little interest in interpersonal relationships with others and can be alone for long periods of time without feeling lonely. Having from an early age found that your own perceptions were at odds with those of others, you have retreated into an internal world of imagination and private perceptions. When others come into contact with you, they tend to perceive you as having an asexual presentation, often with stiff and affectively constricted, child-like manners (which may themselves come across as attractive, encouraging fantasies of domination in others). Metaphorically, your personality style may be likened to a teenage girl whose uterus is so afraid of impregnation that it shuts off every mating signal that the individual is able to produce, including charm and emotional presence. In the same way, the actual you may have marked difficulties with gender roles, giving others the psychological (though not necessarily physical) impression of an oddly a-gendered individual or prepubescent child. Like the teenage girl whose uterus contracted to shut off its activities entirely, others tend to experience you as having little positive or negative emotionality, but only a certain 'flatness,' attesting again to the fact that you come across as having 'retired' a bit into yourself. Apparently detached and somewhat indifferent to socializing and interpersonal affairs, little do others know, however, that because you do not hinge your thoughts and feelings on accepted social mores, you are actually capable of great creativity and originality when left to your own devices.



Fuck depression yoSomething that INTPs can do and an INTJ can't? Hmm. This one will blow your mind-

MBTI has nothing to do with what each type can and can't.wtf?because a vibrant bright red is a symbol of aggressiveness. mahogany and blood red are more mellow, so i dont see a reason for your suggestion. so wtf?i believe most people get a clearer feeling of aggression with a bright red as opposed to darker red colors. in order to make the message clear, a bright red would be the better choice. but yeah thats just my opinion.Pearl Jam is the shitINFP here.

I am not religious. Although I do appreciate a true religious person, as they're really the best people in the world.

I am a left libertarian on the political compass, somewhere in the middle of that section. Social liberalist. All religions have one thing in common, and that is that they want the best thing for everyone in some degree. 

While there are people who may be kind of dickwads and call themselves true "muslims" or "christians" or whatever, that's just not right. Which is why I said "a true religious person".They may vary, but no religion is made to spread havoc. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2_OOaP763kTo avenge isn't necessarily human. Try primal or something like that. To forgive isn't divine, it's just an act of sincerity, which is human. You just described an autist lmaoYou got lucky on your username thenI don't think you fully understand what Fi is. What you seem to think Fi is, if I understand correctly, is that it is selfish? Yeah, that's not what Fi is. And Fe doesn't just mean you're benevolent. It's much more complicated.Stardew valley can suck my nutsNo. Only INFPs and ISFPs can be artists. /sENTP. For some reason they often speak my mind for me.why a special snowflake of courseDon't kinkshameI'll fuck your mother's asshole with a thorny branch until it bleeds&gt;F types always think more about people, T types more about problems

Bullshit

&gt;T types are also a lot more "fond" of problems or "bad" stuff, while F types obviously do like "good feelings"

Bullshit

You seem to be reading way too much into it. I'm an INFP and I can't deal with people being frustrated and shit. It just makes me frustrated too. Also I can't be fucked dealing with broken stuff. 

To a certain extent, I do agree that T types thrive in practical problems, but you're making it come across so simple, when it's just not.Yeah, those are good movies too. MBTI has absolutely jack shit to do with IQAlright but an INTJ can be smart, but can also be stupid as fuck, while still retaining their cognitive functions. I don't see how it correlates You can make a statistic of it, but it wouldn't have any value.I can never keep up relations with anyone unless they're online friends. I don't know why. So yeah, I guess I am a loner.This is already like one of the top rated posts you fucking plagiaristic fuckerGo fuck that bitch up. It's your house, your food, your rules.I can't explain it with terms that you might be looking for, but..

I suck at socializing because I find it hard to talk to people about mundane everyday life shit - which is why I find myself seeking down to earth and artsy friends who are somewhat like me when it comes to interests and world views. I become awkward quite easily if I don't feel comfortable with people, and then I just go quiet.

I don't know. I have several mental health issues as well, so take my answer with a grain of salt. My opposite is ESTJ. I really don't know anything about them, other than their stereotype. What I understand is that they're quite rule oriented, which I don't like.I isolate myself and refuse taking advice from people.I feel like my heavily dominant Fi somehow made me feel depressedNew information? In what sense? I've more or less isolated myself, but I'm getting "new information" online&gt;then the solution is easy; stop procrastinating.

easier said than doneHe can't even make up his mind whether The Hound is an ENTP or ENFPVery typical of an ENTPGenerally, people think INFPs are sensitive, warmhearted crybabies. w0t? 

If there is something I'm not, that's definitely it. I'm probably the coldest fuck I know, and yet I still score INFP in every test I take. 

Please stop saying we are cuddly, because it's rustling my jimmies. Thank you.

Edit: This is more of a humerous rant, guys. Don't take it too seriously.To represent the typeI hear so many people saying that Frank Zappa is either an ISTP or an ENTP, what do you guys think?I'm thinking either ESTP or ENTP would be perfect for roasting people and defending themselves, typically being smooth talkers.I've been trying to type him, but I can't really understand him. Here are some clips, see if you can figure him out:

https://youtu.be/B7Gk-MKK49w

https://youtu.be/P5QTFDxX2yE

I see a lot of me in him.It's a movie where people are locked in a facility and are prompted to kill off each other. It's interesting to try and analyze their personalities. It's a cool movie, and the mbti aspect makes it even more interesting.
If a subject requires memorization, I always watch a tv show I've seen a ton of times (episodes of IASIP or The Office usually) and mentally connect the background show with topics I need to memorize. It seems really inefficient to everyone I've told about it, but it's worked for me (3.99 GPA, last semester of school) so I keep doing it. 

My study method is similar to yours for things like math or my accounting courses, but I focus on studying the actual concepts from when I learn them until I feel I fully grasp them (the "aha" moment), *then* I'll practice doing problems.The best way I can explain it is that my memory for images, events, things I can see/hear/etc. is waaaay better than it is for dates/facts/data. So to take advantage of that I rewatch stuff I remember scenes and jokes from as I study and make mental connections between the two. So like for my biz classes, I would watch It's Always Sunny and since I know most of the jokes (I've watched through it more than I'd like to admit), having scenes playing in the background while I studied helped me remember names and ideas by using those jokes as a memory device. Honestly I think it's similar, though waaaaay less efficient, than the "memory maps" people talk about using to remember facts. But I've never been able to get those to work so I stick with this method.The second one. It's sort of like a starting point for my memory, so as I'm taking a test and trying to recall something I can start with the scenes/jokes from when I studied and from there remember like what scene I was watching while I was studying that specific subject or chapter. I've thought about trying it with music since it's easier to implement repetition with songs since they're short and less annoying to replay.One of the Si Doms. ISFJs because I don't think the way people perceive me would change much, but the way I would take in info and process it would be completely different. ISTJs because a lot of people I've respected in my family, school or jobs have been ISTJs and I just like the efficiency of the way their mind works (as opposed to mine).INFP: [Bottled Affection](https://youtu.be/cKsNHTNXJfo) by Cold War Kids. 

I'm not a huge fan of their new stuff, but that song has been on every playlist I've made the past couple years. I just relate too much to the lyrics.

Also all of Jeff Rosenstock's solo stuff. Literally all of it. I'm secretly obsessed with his music. It's not healthy.INFP. Boring accountant by day, terrible writer most nights/weekends.
[Here's](http://imgur.com/XCMazxY) my lame excuse for a mirror selfie (phone included).I’d pick an estj because I like changing letters around in jest.
xxTP. Please nerd out on me about car parts or chess or the science of manipulating people or whatever it is that you're really into. It's so cute.

Fs of all kinds and I get along well friend-wise, but not really in relationships. I've got enough feelings for two, we don't need more.

xNTJs are fun to talk to, but they're too confrontational and controlling for dating. xSTJs and I just never have anything in common.So, I've personally found the "Ne is outwards, Ni is inwards" description is basically right, but a little too abstract to actually identify the functions. Here's how I understand it a little more concretely:

Ne is a bit easier to pick out for me, but I might be biased. You can generally look for two things: coming up with off-the-wall ideas, and constantly making connections between things. Ne likes to use metaphors and analogies to explain things. It will often try to solve problems by taking something that worked in a totally different context, and adapting it to the problem at hand. Ne sometimes has a bad habit of sitting around debating ideas and possibilities without ever committing to a plan of action. Si comes into play when Ne goes looking for new experiences: we like to run around using Si to just vacuum up information about the world, that we can later use as fuel for new ideas.

Ni tends to focus on ideas in isolation, without worrying about how they fit into the greater web of ideas. Give NJs a problem, regardless of what it is, and they will just come up with a very situation-specific solution like some kind of crystal ball. Ni is generally good at predicting how a particular situation will develop, or pinpointing the exact issue when confronted with a problem. A noticeable characteristic of Ni is that it doesn't tend to think out loud too much, and instead deliberately considers ideas or asks careful questions before giving a relatively "finished" answer. Se helps out in that a Ni user can remain right in the moment when focused on an idea, and take a good "here and now" look at the moment before processing it with Ni. So, Ni tends to be a bit more present than Ne when thinking about something, while Ne seems like it's off in the clouds somewhere a lot of the time.Huh, I've always been pretty good with math, and I write down everything. Even for non-math problems that involve multi-step thinking. I think it helps with the flurry of ideas going on in my head - I write down anything I've already figured out, so I can free up head space for the things I haven't.Totally sounds ISTJ to me too.

I think ISTJs, with all their sense of duty and responsibility, can come across as F because they're pretty caring. The ISTJs I know will give the shirt off their back to a stranger because it's just the right thing to do, but then later they will whine about it, because what kind of person could be so selfish and unprepared to need a shirt from a stranger?I find ISFPs really charming and interesting, but yeah, the conversation just falls flat sometimes. How can I talk to you guys better?&gt; however there is always this air of them being *just on the verge of being pissed off* about something.

Haha, this is so spot-on. The whole thing, really, but that made me laugh.The Ti-Fe vs Fi-Te here is perfect :) Fi-Te wants there to be one morally correct way to approach the situation, Ti-Fe just goes, "well, logical conclusion is just that she in particular didn't want to talk to you, doesn't mean anything deeper".

OP, you're probably fine, although you might need to get better at picking up the cues when people don't want to be talked to. If you want actual advice on the particular situation, I think we'd need more information on the context and what you said. Sounds like the girl is probably pretty socially anxious, if she just completely shut down and had someone else go to talk to you. Honestly, though, I wouldn't really want to be approached by a stranger in a library for small talk either.You could try to keep a diary, or maybe just write down a bunch of stories from your life that stand out, and see which patterns you find. No one fits their type 100% of the time!I'm going to lean INTP, from how your post is written. It's wordy and a little rambling and excited, which is way more of an INTP than an ISTP thing. ISTPs tend to come across as cold and detached, and I don't get that vibe from you at all.Can you elaborate a little on the problems?

I've dated a few ENTPs - the dynamic was probably a bit different with an INFP, but I can definitely get that they can be difficult!I find it helpful to make a list of the things that need to be done, and then just arbitrarily skip around depending on what I feel like doing. I would go crazy if I tried to do things in the exact same order every time.xxTJ would be my first guess. Te-Fi tends the most towards those sort of "people should be this way, and that is a fact" sort of judgments. Maybe an immature xxFP, with Fi-Te.What makes you sure you are an ENTP, if I might ask?I don't think you'll "grow out of it" automatically, but I definitely think you can learn! I would guess that an INTPs main problem would be being too shy to put yourself out there socially and make the first move, and I don't think you can get over that unless you just get out of your comfort zone and practice.INFP - insecurity, anxiety. We waste way too much time feeling unsure and self-critical, and not taking enough action as a result :(I've been wondering about this recently.

So, I was really interested in MBTI as a teenager, and I started reading up on it again after I met someone who I was having trouble understanding, but happened to remind me exactly of the profile of a particular MBTI type. I did some research on his type, and it was definitely helpful to be able to read about people who reported having a similar personality to him, and get an idea of their inner thoughts and motivations.

The idea that personality types exist is obvious to me; people have patterns in their behavior, and there's only so many ways these patterns can differ from each other, so it makes sense that you can group people together and say that they have a certain personality type. I like MBTI a lot because I feel like it identifies some interesting personality patterns that people don't really talk about otherwise.

But I'm not sure how I really feel about this idea that there are these 8 functions, and everyone has this particular list of functions in a particular order, and that makes up the 16 types that everyone falls under. It feels like a really weirdly specific claim to make without solid evidence. I sometimes meet people who I feel like are the spitting image of a particular MBTI type, but I meet other people who don't really fit under one type neatly and fit some patterns of a few different types.

Personally, I basically feel like INFP sounds the most like me: I'm idealistic, optimistic, usually shy but willing to take a stand when I see an injustice, really interested in theoretical ideas, way too sensitive and insecure for my own good. But some things just totally don't fit: I do a lot of impulsive and thrill-seeking sort of things (Se?), I'm doing theoretical math research and I love it (Ti?), plus I don't even really like poetry or art.

So, I like that MBTI gives us some neat vocabulary to describe personality. It's good being able to point out that a particular behavior is "Fi-Te", and that you can usually expect that person to do more "Fi-Te" behaviors in the future, and not so many "Ti-Fe" behaviors - I don't know any other words in English that describe these concepts. But saying that everyone fits neatly into one of the 16 types, and that everyone with that type has an exact function stack, and that you can trace a particular behavior to, say, tertiary Ne or something, feels totally bizarre and pseudoscientific to me. I mean, I do get that it's a model, and no scientific model can't describe reality perfectly, but it just feels really over-specific without enough support.

Would love to hear other people's thoughts on this!

Edit: Thanks for some good responses! Realized I wasn't totally clear on my point: I definitely think you can somehow categorize people into personality archetypes, and no one is really such a special snowflake. Some of the MBTI types seem to hit people's personalities exactly, but some don't. I think this is probably a result of this rigid system of saying that there are exactly eight functions which people have particular configurations of, and this system feels really pseudoscientific to me. I wonder if there is a better way to categorize personality, while keeping some of the good insights of MBTI.
May I suggest counseling for him?Excellent job, thanks for the video and thanks for this post!

(PS are you Michael Pierce?)Yes, you did an excellent job! Especially capturing the chart! Thanks a ton."Inside every cynic is a disappointed idealist"(DISCLAIMER: ANY TYPE CAN GET ALONG WITH ANY TYPE BLAH BLAH BLAH)

I can see this.

INFJs like talking in complete thoughts (uninterrupted), don't like being misunderstood (or having their words twisted), and are very serious about their views.

ENTP loves to debate and interrupt, mis-contextualize to make other views look silly, and does it in a way that is playful and entertaining to them.

I could see an INFJ getting very very frustrated and the ENTP continuing to egg them on.

ENTP is one of my favorite types. If this seems very negative towards them, it is not intended.You put into words something I never have been able to, great job! Add ESTJ to that list as well obviously.

These types of peoples' lack of reading into the cause and effect of actions makes their shortsighted point seem brilliant to them somehow. They don't think about what would happen down the line, just that this solution is immediately satisfying or efficient; and that is as far as they think. They don't think about that solution being used in other contexts or what it would mean if they were the ones being left behind in the solution to a problem.

**RANT TIME!**

My other related pet peeve is people who believe being "neutral" or "moderate" is some noble and universally correct stance. Do they not realize that "the middle" is completely based on the context around it? If the perimeters for discussion in Nazi Germany is "Should all Jews be killed no questions asked, or should we just violently force them out of the country?"; then your little brain dead cop-out of neutrality is still an evil answer.

People need to realize how arguments and discussions presented to them are being framed. People can be very easily manipulated by the framing and contextualization of a discussion.

Like years ago when the news media discussion was "How bad is it that Obama is a *SOCIALIST*!?". Let's break that down. It implies multiple things at once, and manipulates peoples' views on the discussion.

The "facts" it assumes are:

* Obama is in-fact a "socialist" (False)

* Socialism is an inherently bad thing (False)

* That someone's political ideology is an opinion of the masses, rather than a factual reality of the person who holds those views (False).

A simple 10-20 word question can have paragraphs worth of implications behind it manipulating people.

**TL;DR** neutrality and moderation is still a stance, and is not resistant to consequences.The authority and confidence in which [one] talks about something they are ignorant about, makes for a huge problem.

If you come at a discussion with the appropriate amount of humble hesitation to go along with your level of knowledge on a topic, you are more apt to having a good conversation and learn from the other person. If you enter a conversation about a topic you've read up on for 30 minutes (or less), but talk about it with the confidence of a lion; then you will not allow yourself to actually participate in a proper exchange of ideas.

I can't tell you how many people I've met who have heard one news headline, and then talk down to experts on a subject with the most embarrassing amount of confidence you've ever seen. Phrases like "I'm just telling it like it is" or "its just the harsh truth" are common among these people. The think that claiming the reality they are presenting is unpleasant, that they are humbly explaining that they are correct. Another common phrase is "I wish I was lying". No one is claiming you're lying, you're just ignorant and under-read on the topic you are posturing as an expert on.

The way you talk about things is VERY important.Are you INFJ or ENFJ?Obviously, but that is not what this discussion is about. We are talking about the common, not the ideal.Yeah, ESxx types and me do not mix. I (personally) don't know any N-type (with exception of ENFJs and ENTJs) who gets along with ESxx types, but every N-type I know DOES get along with ISxx types.

I wonder why that is.Its weird you say that because it sort of seems like you are describing the stereotype of INFPs.

I get along with INTPs better than any other type. Though all my INTP friends say I am very logical. And I don't get offended by anything (if that is what you mean by softy).Yes, I know an INTJ who feels the same way. My rule is "be a good person, or be smart", ISFJs tend to fall into the former, so I have no problem with them. My INTJ friend is more "be intelligent, or be open minded/recognize my intelligence". ISFJs don't meet the first category for him often times, and they are often set in their ways so won't abide to the second category.Because you enjoy sex with the latter two, right? ;)Someone is just bombing this whole thread with downvotes. Don't know why you're trying to get in the way of interesting harmless discussion.I have a single ISTJ friend, and NO ONE else I know (all N-types, and an ISFJ) like him at all.

I *hate* reprimanding people, but I had to yell at him for how he was treating my friends.

We have excellent discussions on sports! But when it comes to music, politics, video game strategies, he is just a dumbass and is very closed minded. He talks with a ridiculous amount of confidence about things and refuses to see any topic from anyone else's point of view. How he values music and style is based on "if cool people are into it". It is just water and oil in many regards, but man does he know his sports!Thanks for being honest :)

If you have time, I would love for you to ramble about them as people! What about them as people do you enjoy? As someone who would have them in my bottom 5 types, I would like to hear what you see in them.&gt;with his constant devil's advocating. ;) 

That is what I was imagining. You in your alone time formulate a well researched opinion, only for this ENTP to just pick it apart instantly with no prior thought given. Must be frustrating.

That ideal partner stuff is such bullshit. It claims ENFJ (maybe) or ESFJ (hell no!) would be my ideal partner. It is so dumb how it sees a partnership as forming a Voltron of a single person. "You must cover each others weaknesses!" rather than "You must love each other".

My ideal partner would be..... *drumroll*..... an INFP! Sorry, but its true! I like people who come from the same place as me and understand where I'm coming from. ENFJ or INFJ could be great, but every girl I melt inside for has been INFP. Would our household be a disaster because we have the same weaknesses? Yes. Would we love eachother more than anything regardless? YES!Thank you!

Might as well continue the discussion... Which personality types do you not get along with and why?Yep, I agree! Best thread on /r/MBTI in a while. Even though the topic might seem mean-spirited, everyone is handling it well and treating each other with respect.

There is no reason to downvote. It is a reality that people don't like conflicting types. Don't cry about it, talk through why that might be! Clear up some misunderstandings rather than just putting up a wall and refusing to discuss these dilemmas.Oh boy, just found your Piece de resistance of the thread Flux. Going to start reading it now, and will tell you what I think!&gt;I have zero patience for people that are presumptuous of my intent. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say-- yet these people don't seem to listen.

And that is the nature of Fi/Ne. I recently heard Fi and Ti described like this a while back and it is TOO perfect.

* Ti/Ne is being a bullshit detector for facts and logic
* Fi/Ne is being a bullshit detector for authenticity and motives

That is absolutely true. I am constantly naturally detecting peoples' motives. **(I am normally a humble person, but for the sake of this discussion I will give some context. Skip this paragraph if you become nauseated by what appears to be arrogance)** I am very good at detecting peoples' motives. I am very good at meeting someone and within an hour knowing so much about a person. For example, I predicted my friends' friend was sexually abused by a family-member/family-friend within an hour of meeting her. A few months later my friend came to me and told me that he just found out she was sexual abused when she was younger. People can come up to me and say something and I just immediately know what their motive is behind what they just said. Usually I keep it to myself as to not sound like an asshole or create an awkward situation, but if I call them on it they can't believe that I could read them that easily.

I have a lot of downfalls and shortcomings, but reading people is a skill I am always complimented on by my peers. Often times when it comes to peoples' stances or actions, my morality detector goes through its usual process. Is it good or bad? Are they honest about their intentions or not? If they are doing a good thing, but are doing it for the wrong reasons, do I have a problem with it? If they are doing a good thing, but are dishonest when declaring their intentions, do I have a problem with it? Etc...

When I get hung up on "What they are doing is bad", the next question is "Do they know what they are doing is bad, or are they just misinformed/ignorant about the situation?". It is basically a game of "Dumb or Evil?".

**[WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS NEXT PART THE WRONG WAY!]**

I think with ESTPs I am very often finding myself playing Dumb or Evil. A lot of ESTP decisions are made firing from the hip. On the spot quick witted decisions. Or they have a mostly baked idea and just want to go through with it and roll with the punches as they come. **I respect this about ESTPs and wish I had this ability, trust me!** This is fine for a lot of things in our world that rely on quick decision making. It is why Se types are such brilliant athletes, repairmen, coaches, businessmen men, entrepreneurs, etc. They can look at a situation and instantly go "Oh hey, that's fucked up. I'm going to do something about it and fix it". Or, "standing here thinking about it doesn't accomplish anything, I'm going to just start doing it and deal with the consequences". Meanwhile, INFPs might take an hour looking at the same thing.... cautiously questioning their own every move just to come up with the exact same gameplan the ESTP came up with in 30 seconds.

But on the flip side I often find ESTPs using that type of quick wit on topics that require a much deeper, patient collection of knowledge like politics and topics involving things as complex as people. This often leaves them with short sighted political solutions that put me into the cycle of "Dumb or Evil?". Did he not think about [x] [y] and [z] aspect, or does he have a motive that is purposely ignoring those aspects to push an agenda that depends on those variables? I could go into a very specific example of this, but I've already gone on too long so I will stop myself.

So again, when I am questioning an ESTP's motives, keep in mind that it is me giving you the benefit of the doubt and saying "he is too intelligent to hold this belief without a motive behind it". The flipside would be "You have no idea what you are talking about, but arrogantly think you do".

&gt;They seemed to be worried about unimportant specifics while missing the big picture. 

That is what Ne is all about. Ne types can see what problems seemingly unimportant specifics can cause down the line. ESTPs like to just get things done and get passed the annoying barriers. Ne types like that too, but we also realize that some jackass will put their dick in every loophole we leave behind us around the way... so we are infinitely stuck in the process of thinking about the loophole possibilities and never actually taking action. That is the nature of Ne: thinking about possibilities, often to point of paralysis.

&gt;I think and these XNFP people seemed to not listen but instead be assuming my intent on everything.

When I am talking with INTPs for whatever reason, I do not have this attitude at all. It is completely a collaborative discussion. I think it is the amount of confidence and swagger that ESTPs talk about their ideas that make INFPs not even enter "collaborative discussion" mode in person. INTPs share that Ne uncertain, second guessing, "I would rather be corrected than be right". When both sides of the discussion seemingly have no ego, INFPs open up. When INFP feels an ego or confidence coming from the other side, they either shut down their openness, or just completely withdraw from the conversation. We love people who are humble, open minded, and people who are "listen-first". We don't like talking over people, but we hate not being heard just as much.

&gt;Someone being insensitive is not some trying to be mean.

I think what he meant to say is... "someone purposely shutting down their sympathy/empathy to produce an easy solution where they don't personally have to compromise". I've often heard people just make these curt and simplified solutions to problems where they just throw up their arms and go "Eh, just euthanize anyone with special needs who doesn't have a family to support them" or "Eh, fuck social security and welfare. They didn't earn the money so we shouldn't give it to them". Regardless of what your stances are on those topics, throwing your arms up and neglecting humanity is not how you come up with solutions regarding humanity.

&gt;The INFPs I've known seem to think they're smarter than they think they are. They seemed to assume my intelligence, or my intentions.

I'm glad you realize the process INFPs go through. Again, INFPs will do this for topics they put a LOT of thought and research into. When you enter a topic that an INFP is dedicated to, you better believe they have put as much time into thinking about that topic as you have anything in your life. Look at how many paragraphs of thought I'm spraying into such a simple topic right now?

&gt;The INFPs I know, they are hypocrites. They seem incapable of recognizing they are though

This is a common misunderstanding I've heard from people on MBTI forums talking about INFPs. INFPs often aren't able to explain themselves in full in-person. We need a writing format to get our complete thoughts out. We sound like bumbling idiots when talking in person. It is very hard for us to communicate face to face.

&gt;It seemed like the INFPs I know couldn't handle questions either. I could ask them why they think something and they couldn't explain it-- but they expect me to respect it and value it. I would ask a question on why they see something a certain way and it's perceived as an attack on their values. I don't like having to say, "I'm just wondering but.." or having to give a disclaimer that I'm genuinely curious every fucking time. 

Exactly! We are terrible at explaining our self face to face. It is just as frustrating for you as it is for us. We actually DO go into a panicky mode when we are questioned like that. When writing you can put your thoughts out, revise, come up with the perfect wording and thoughts without the stopwatch known as "social interaction" counting down every second.

&gt;I don't like having to say, "I'm just wondering but.." or having to give a disclaimer that I'm genuinely curious every fucking time.

Funny enough, I have this exact same problem! I am such a fucking curious person, and every time I ask a question it is perceived as an attack. Even when I explain "no no no, I'm just curious!" they still think I'm attacking or scrutinizing. I think it is very much to do with current events and how people treat eachothers' views right now.

&gt;I think there is something to the natural conflict relationship between ESTP and INFP. I don't think I'll never be friends with an INFP, I just think that I realize there's some give and take where the INFPs seem to think they are always right because they say they are. 

I think the power of the internet is the way for INFPs and ESTPs to connect. We can challenge eachother, and as long as we don't get catty or emotional we can have great discussions. It is just impossible for us to have it in person due to the INFP's shortcomings.

**You seem like a very levelheaded and mature ESTP. People like KBNation and his "brother" on here can't have the same types of discussions. You go out of your way to be kind, courteous, and non-confrontational and I appreciate it. Thanks for all the food for thought, sorry about the max character limit response.**Hahaha :)

I applaud honesty over all else.&gt;taking no offense just means you're flexible

Which is true! But I also meant it in terms of humor. You can not tell a joke I get offended by unless you're specifically trying to hurt me. I can only think of one time I've been offended by a joke which is when my grandma died, and within 24 hours my friend used my grandma's death as a punchline to me. Literally the only time I can remember that I've been offended by a joke. Even then, I forgave him and we moved on, and I don't hold it against him. It was a slip of the tongue, we've all been there.

&gt;It's frustrating to see people who can clearly achieve something better let themselves get jostled about by others' opinions of what they should do.

Yeah, it is frustrating for us too. Part of what that is consists of is we don't like telling others what to do or what to think, we would rather just meet people who have come to similar conclusions and work with them. When we consistently meet people who are just so against what we stand for, it is so discerning. We have a love for people, but when everyone turns their back on you, it is very isolating. When you dedicate your life and all your thought towards helping others.... and then the people who are included in your umbrella plan of help start start working against their own interests it makes you just go FUCK IT. Why should I help these people if they're so ass backwards that they are fighting against their own interest? It is very demotivating.

I can't speak for others, but I suffer from anxiety and depression; and that is mostly what causes me to get so downtrodden so quickly. They feed each other back and forth until I'm just completely demotivated to do anything at all. Now that I've realized I have anxiety and depression I have become better at identifying it and overcoming it, but it can be hard.&gt;To you.

Would you enjoy a conversation where I interrupted you every time you tried to talk? Where I laughed at you every time I thought you were wrong? Where I talked in a condescending voice the whole time? Come on man, don't act like you're a robot impervious to basic attributes of social interaction.

&gt;What part of conveying your opinion with confidence makes you definitively unopen to a "proper exchange of ideas"? Because you, and many others, find it off putting?

Because it is often followed by an unwillingness to listen. I think you are confusing the INFJ and ENFJ version of confidence with the ESTJ, ESFJ version of confidence I am referring to. The SJ version of confidence is "I know I'm right, and no information or perspective you present to me will change my mind".

Having confidence in yourself and ideas is not a flaw. However it is a flaw if you are actually relatively ignorant about the topic you are demonstrating confidence on.

If I walked up to you and started stating an incorrect fact about a topic you were highly knowledgeable about how would you react?

What if after that reaction I go "Yeah, but I heard this [incorrect fact] so you're wrong".

And then if you try once more to correct them. "Yeah, I trust the source I heard [incorrect fact] more than you, so I'm going to just keep believing what I believe".

It doesn't hurt your feelings, its just frustrating and absolutely infuriating to deal with that sort of confidence.I don't think they are equal, the message itself is of course the most significant part... BUT there is definitely a decent weight given to the delivery. And no one can deny that.

If I was punching you, yelling and calling you names while saying my opinion; you would have an entirely different opinion of me than if I said it to you in a calm voice while we are sitting at a library table. Context means a lot.

Mutual respect must be shown in an exchange of conflicting ideas.&gt; I care about both....the "humane delivery" was only secondary to the truth.

He's saying the message outweighs the delivery. You two agree on that. But he is saying that the delivery does have some weight to it. Which everyone can agree on.&gt;some people who aren't that bright and know that they're not that bright still make the effort to learn

Yep, willingness to learn and open mindedness is one of my favorite attributes. I think ENFPs are the best at this. They rarely go deep into learning about a variety of topics on their own, but they are curious and always asking questions and will ask for you to elaborate while they listen.

They are never afraid to ask questions, but its in a very genuinely curious and kind way unlike some other types.&gt;I'll be honest, it's super taxing for me to actually do this.

You're telling me. I spent an hour of my life typing up that mini-essay LOL

Yeah, sorry about my longwinded responses. I think that is another reason why INFP and ESTP's don't get along. INFPs are very wordy and particular with trying to get their message across **but aren't succinct while doing so**. People who aren't patient enough to deal with that will often come away from an INFP with an incomplete view, or will just decide to start talking over them.

Thanks again for the discussion. You're my favorite ESTP so far :PI'm not saying I want people to lie to me and make me think they agree with me... just to show respect. Level-headed, honest, respectful conversations can cause a conversational game of tennis. Disrespect, insults, misconstruing the other persons' words, and talking over each other turns the conversation into a no rules MMA fight.

Either way the truth is present, but one way allows more possibility for someone to come away with something learned rather than respect lost.&gt; It doesn't affect the soundness of the argument though, nor does it make the choice of presentation necessarily wrong.

I never once mentioned it would.

A discussion is not two people presenting their view of the world and then walking away... it is a back and forth. You wont venture down the same conversational rabbit holes when people are acting in different ways.

I'm not sure why you are having such a hard time understanding this.

&gt;they're free to try to enforce those boundaries onto the conversation or walk the fuck away

Exactly. The conversation is less effective if someone walks away.

How are you not understanding this?

&gt;I'm also not cool with you removing the conversation from its original context and putting your own spin on it.

Oh I'm sorry, is the conversation taking a turn due to how I'm delivering information? How devilish of me to use the exact system I am discussing to prove a point. I am an absolute fucking genius...

Now I will confidently proclaim myself right and walk away from this conversation rather than reading further into your comment. I am so *euphoric* right now, I'm going to go for a jog.*the crowd cheers Bombast's name*

***BOM BOM BOM BAST! BOM BOM BOM BAST!***

"His confidence is sky high right now folks! Look at him trounce around with his head held high! This is truly a victory lap for Bombast!"

"That's right Steve, his opponent seems to think the discussion is still going on; but you wouldn't know it by the way Bombast walked away from the conversation!"

"This is truly a remarkable victory in the annals of discussion history Todd"

"The sport will never be the same Steve!"

---

Now that your puny mind dares to continue this conversation, I will carry on, seeing as though you won't allow your emotions affect your logic during this conversation... I will give you the honor of hearing more of my brilliant thoughts while we keep in mind the content of my conversation is the only thing that matters and not the methodology of which I go about the discussion.

&gt;Yes, naturally it is. Nobody ever claimed that delivery has no impact or importance, you're arguing against a straw man because you're interpreting my arguments out of their original context. Not to mention you consistently do silly shit like reinterpreting a disagreement with "VERY important" to meaning no impact what so ever.

Oh so now straw man arguments and argumentative fallacies are disallowed in a conversation? Ha! I never agreed to those terms! My methodology of breaking conversational norms counters your desire for a civil conversation! ^(*Also you have tiny hands.*)

&gt;It's perfectly fine of you to choose not to entertain whatever conversation you don't feel like entertaining, but to apply a general judgement based entirely on your preferences rather than some form of objective criteria is egoistic and petty.

I grow bored of this civil discourse. I will now only discuss the topic of Australian Equestrianism. To decline this based on your subjective displeasure for horses would be quite petty and egotistical.

Do you wish to continue this conversation under those confines?

[Y] or [N]?

----

[/unjerk] If you want to have an actual civil conversation, I will. I feel like I've proven my point on that front enough. Also, I haven't downvoted you a single time, that is someone else. I find downvoting in a back-and-forth conversation petty.[This is me in a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKMK3XGO27k)I'm not sure if you're asking "What is your stance on INTPs?" or "What are INTPs' stance on ISFJs?". I will answer both.

I personally love INTPs. They are my favorite type to converse with and make up the majority of my friends. They're super open-minded, informed, thoughtful and don't talk with a ridiculous amount of confidence, even though they've often earned the right to. They have that same second-guessing themselves that causes them to be informed and thoroughly thoughtful! I find them as very often (not always) moral and considerate of others, which is something people don't give INTPs enough credit for.

I've never asked any INTPs what they think about ISFJs. Thinking about one of my friends specifically, I think they would feel the same as me. As long as the ISFJ doesn't hold any **harmful** illogical beliefs, they are okay in their book.

What type are you?&gt;Like SJs are the only ones who can hold "harmful" beliefs.

Reread my comment and realize how hard you just projected that onto my comment. I never even came *close* to suggesting that.

&gt;FFS stop being typist.

I can't tell if you're trolling or not.

&gt;yr-typing-is-wrong

Stop being typist.&gt;The SJ version of confidence is "I know I'm right, and no information or perspective you present to me will change my mind".

I stand by that. What does that have to do with harmful beliefs? I'll answer that for you, nothing.

Seems like you have a bit of an obsession with me. I'm flattered.A) I wasn't even stating my own beliefs, I was stating my INTP friends' beliefs.

B) My friend has a problem with people with anyone with harmful and anti-science beliefs.

I'm not understanding how this is a SJ thing? Enlighten me why you think only SJs have harmful beliefs? I think its something any type can have.INFP as well...

Its the worst when you accidentally stare at someone's boobs but don't actually "see" what your eyes are aimed at. You get the social downsides of staring at someones boobs, without the gratifying visual of staring at boobs. Its a lose/lose.So what SJ type am I triggering right now? Clearly you are ashamed of your type or you would have your MBTI flair on display.*Note to self: ISFPs can be overly offended SJWs.*Sorry I'm not engaging. I've done too much typing and thinking today and don't feel like delving into a new conversation before bed. If you want to read some of my thoughts from today then you can read this essay.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4slmte/which_personality_types_hate_each_other/d5aln5m

Have a nice day!I actually was thinking the exact same thing. It would make sense why this person is stalking me. Its the only SJ I've had a negative interaction with on Reddit. Weird that a comment chain that only us "3" are in... your comment has 2 downvotes. Hmm...

Not very subtle meowsockThanks for letting me waste your time with my thoughts! ;) And thanks for the response.

I think evil can be a very grey term. That is why I used the question "Good or Bad" in relation to the specific action being examined. Like I said, the actual game my mind automatically plays once I figure out I disapprove is, "Dumb or Evil". Sounds harsh, but its short-term for the following internal thoughts...

* "Dumb" - misguided in terms of information, logic, or seeing cause and effect. Might have good intentions, or neutral intentions. Sometimes they have slightly bad intentions that they don't realize has COLOSSAL bad consequences because they are preoccupied in their own interests.

* "Evil" - having a motivations of greed; neglecting others' needs or autonomy; deceiving or lying to push a hidden agenda; accumulation of unjust power; using peoples' weaknesses/flaws against them; or any other human flaw that could result in harming others.

But again "Good or Evil" is such a weird grey area question. That is why Scandanavian countries have such great criminal reform systems. Rather than treating these people like sub-human "evil"-beings, they treat them like humans who have gone down the wrong path (because that is exactly what they are!). Who knew that treating humans like humans, would make them become more humane!?

&gt;In person, I rarely get flustered these days because whenever someone bothers me -- click -- oh, he's just misguided, let me play along to help him understand.

I try to avoid that sort of confidence in myself. I have been wrong before, I will be wrong again. I believe I should always be refining my world view and try to maximize my empathy for the situation to try and relate to the person. "We have very different views. I wonder why this person has that view? What events happened in their life that caused this view to form? Maybe if I figure out their history, I can show them they have created a myth for themselves".

I know my view works for me, but I shouldn't push it onto others and their situation unless I can help them reach that conclusion on their own. Rather than telling them they are wrong and trying to change their world view through raw debate, I use their current world view as an avenue to show them other thought processes. Rather than a confrontational debate, it is a collaborative understanding of their thought process. I will make suggestions of empathizing for others and say where they might be misguided along that thought process. **I don't do this in a manipulative way, and I never do it to further my own agenda**; I do it to try to create more empathy and understanding in that persons' world view. Telling someone how to feel about an isolated topic is nowhere near as powerful as giving them the tools to properly approach every topic they ponder. Its like the thought-process equivalent of "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime". I guess my on the spot adapted phrase would be **"give a man a thought and he will be right about a current event; give a man a though-*process* and he will be right about all future events"**.
&gt;In person, I rarely get flustered these days

I do get flustered in person. I don't prepare arguments or anything. Everything I say is free-flowing thought. I formulate words for my ideas as I say them... rather than crafting them ahead of time. Often times I will use one wrong word or get hung up "um"ing trying to think of the perfect word, and people hold that against you! That is probably why INFPs are so much better writers than talkers, we can revise without the ticking time bomb of "social expectations". We want every word that comes out of our mouth to me original, genuine, honest and adapted for the specific situation. Having canned, pre-prepared arguments or stealing others' thoughts often feels like cheating to me (as weird as that might sound to you). This is probably why we are very good counselors, because our conversations are a very personalized experience. Too bad that skill doesn't transfer over to debating. We have the improvisational skills of an ENTP, but we are only good at the quick thinking with feelings/emotions rather than with logic and fact-connecting (like the ENTP). Counselors and arbitrators are more the INFP style.

Okay I have gotten into another rant tangent. I will just stop now.Ah I see. Yeah, to reiterate I feel the INTP perspective would not be restricted to an ultimatum. Its more a rambling set of loose guidelines.

"Smart, intelligent, open minded, thoughtful are important... but if you're a good person and are not harmful/evil/threatening to basic human decency and thought, then you are okay in my book."

Sounds a bit more accurate.Sounds like you could be either ISFP or INFP. Hard to tell without more information.I feel like INFJs and INTJs can clash with their own type very often.

They are sort of the "blueprint" types if that makes sense? You can't carry out a construction project with two conflicting blueprints. Both have a full on Ni nexus dictating their world views. Two conflicting Ni's colliding is like unstoppable object vs. immovable object.

Hell, I'm sure there can be some absolutely terrible INFP+INFP relationships very easily (conflicting Fi views, yikes!)... but if the puzzle pieces align correctly, they could also be a beautiful disaster together as well :)Penis size, social security number, willingness to receive anal, and number of times you've fantasized about fucking a member of the Full House cast.

Just the basics...That is one out of the way. Now what about Full House cast? Are you a Joey or a Danny type of person?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLnqewOIulEIf someone ends a relationship due to MBTI type, there were already other reasons, they just used MBTI as the excuse/justification. They already had negative feelings but felt wrong for having them and finally their feelings were given validation so they acted on them. Sometimes people need a push to make a positive change in their life.I agree.

In general interaction, it can be hard to tell them apart. I think the easiest dead give away is listening to them talk about academic/political topics. For whatever reason I can nail the difference instantly as soon as those type of discussions start.

INTPs have ideas on how to make the political process more logical, factual, and for the betterment of humanity as a whole; INFPs have ideas on how politics can be more fair, consistent, and provide justice for each individual. Its very much the difference between Ti and Te (and the Fi weighing heavily of course on every single thought the INFP has).

INTPs have my favorite perspective on politics. I think the duo of Fi and Ti is a great combo for politics. If it is logical and everyone individual is represented morally, then what can go wrong? Fe can often overlook the individuals and minorities of society. Te can put efficiency over humanity. Ti and Fi are like peanut butter and chocolate.Ah. Jesse type of person. Got it.

Moving on... do you prefer receiving or giving anal? Much like Christmas, I hear its better to give than to receive when it comes to Anal.It was a trick question: "anal is terrible" was the correct answer. I will give you partial credit.Yes, this is the one I use for introducing people. Between the visuals, the formatting, and the length it goes into topics without just having a bullet point of attributes. Its pretty great. Not perfect, but the best entry path IMO.ITT: Sensors thinking the best response is to start bashing N-types.Hard drugs, extreme sports and constant casual sex! ^/sWell its not very open minded to turn this thread's discussion into and Us vs. Them mentality, is it?Thanks, I appreciate it! Sometimes I want to just write a book of my thoughts, but I hate the permanence of that. I like having an open format where I can revise and reformulate based on new information. I like having people to bounce ideas off of, as to help me pin point what I am trying to say, and explain the perceived flaws of the ideas.

I cringe at the idea of someone reading my thoughts, and disagreeing without me being able to explain myself... not because they have a differing view, but because they don't understand my complete thought and I left out a very key bit of information. That would drive me nuts. I like the (relatively) personal nature of a back and forth conversation on the internet, rather than the impersonal and one-sided nature of someone reading without being able to directly ask me questions.

Thanks again for the compliment, made my day. Do you have any thoughts on the subject, or how do/don't relate to what I wrote, as an ENFP? I like your username :)Check the whole thread right now. Everybody is being a bit reactive rather than dismissive of the OP.Not everyone is an ENTP though (I mean that as a compliment). The fun visuals, type names, caricatures and color coded organization make it very palpable for NF types for example. It is a lot easier to remember and compare information when there is some visual/emotional stimulation to help remember like a caricature.(I love skateboarding! I'm just joking around)

All the types tend to have different ideas of fun though. Those just seem to be ones that Se's are often attracted to. Stuff that is "fun" is not fun for me. On the flipside, I'm sure a lot of Se's don't find fun in the boring conversations I have with my INTJ and INTP friend. We will go on for 2-3 hours straight talking very in-depth about global cause and effect, hypothetical political systems and propaganda analysis.Exactly, all types can do anything. Just like in general I gravitate AWAY from risky things, as does my ISFJ friend. Meanwhile my INTJ (Se) friend will kinda take risk head on and loves that feeling of lost control.

But boy do I love skateboarding and jumping off of stuff I shouldn't be jumping off of.&gt; but what if those caricatures don't match reality?

Exactly! Which is why I see it more of a gateway for people who have no interest at all. Though I will say they do give fairly accurate caricatures. The titles can be a bit off. It wrongly gives the impression "oh all Entrepreneurs must be ESTPs? All planners and architects must be INTJs?".

But I don't see a problem with the general graphic they associate with each type. They are close enough to hammering home the general essence of the type in a simple single image. https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types

Also, how can you criticize anything MBTI yet if you don't even know your own type? Seems like you are still learning about it on a very base level if you can't even identify the person you know best!Agreed. There are many TYPES of intelligence. You can argue IQ only measures a few types.https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4t4rt9/yeaaah_no_this_kind_of_thing_needs_to_stop/d5f0dwp

I meant it more directed at this post. "Whole thread" was a terrible misuse of words by me. Casual hyperbole in conversation becomes hard hyperbole in text. I need to English better.&gt;To me, it seems like a cop out for anyone who isn't interested enough to dive deeper.

When you are showing other people in your life for the very first time, you need an easy in. No one is going to sit down for 2 hours and take a class on some (for all they know a psuedoscience) complex typing system. You need something that can introduce the concept to them in a manageable 15 minute chunk. If they are interested, then you dive deeper.


&gt;The graphics themselves aren't that bad, (even if they are a little saccharine) but the blurbs are inaccurate and misleading. It misses the mark completely on what the MBTI attempts to describe. 

I agree. But you need something to go off of on a quick glance. Their descriptions are good enough for (again) and introduction to the topic. If you use it as an MBTI bible further down the line, then that is where you fall into some problems.

&gt;This last part doesn't merit a response. It's an attack on me, and it's plain stupid.

It wasn't an attack, its a very astute (and important) observation. To not know if you are Ni/Fe vs. Ne/Ti is absurd and suggests to me an ignorance towards how MBTI works. I think it is a perfectly fair comment that you are taking way too personally.

&gt;If you don't know why, I'm not explaining it to you.

I'd love to hear your rationalization. To not provide one would be (in your words)

&gt;a cop outI just generally never have very great of conversations with extroverts. I have so many thoughts swarming around my head, and they never let me interject. So I'm just sitting there listening... and listening. When I finally get to talk, I either forgot the entirety of what I was going to say or get cut off before I can finish my complete thought.

INTPs are my favorite to talk with. ENFPs are my favorite extroverts to talk with. They are good listeners much like INFPs. They've got the Ne open mindedness, but without the ENTP confrontational tendency. Though ENTPs are my favorite to listen to talk (just as long as its not a back and forth conversation).

http://greynotgrey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ped2.jpgWell you didn't say anything at all. Doesn't seem like you put it any way yourself.&gt;When taking the MBTI, I caught myself stuck on some questions, unsure if my behaviors and thought processes were truly in line with some of the statements or if I just thought they were, or wanted them to be, in line with statements. I found myself thinking of hypothetical scenarios and past experiences and it actually became quite confusing and contradictory at times.

That is due to the testing itself being flawed, which is a different topic than what we are talking about.

Being ignorant of MBTI and not being able to type yourself is one thing... LaserSharksInc is posturing them-self as a very knowledgeable wealth of knowledge on MBTI that they can criticize websites built by people who actually are. Yet, doesn't have the ability to identify them-self without a test doing it for them.

Its one thing to be trapped between identifying INTP and ENTP, but ENTP and INFJ is just an inexcusable amount difference that demonstrates it is not a lack of self-understanding, but a lack of understanding MBTI.

No one with a good grasp of MBTI will ever confuse Noam Chomsky/Billy Corgan as an ENTP or Bill Maher/Bill Hicks as an INFJ.

&gt;To put it in perspective, it is actually quite common for therapists to see therapists themselves. Some counseling facilities actually require this if you work there. Sometimes even therapists need an objective look on situations in their lives, their behaviors, their problems which they cannot provide for themselves because, as humans, we are biased by our feelings and assumptions, whereas someone else may be able to look at the situation and see things in a clearer light because they aren't.

That is COMPLETELY different. Identifying problems in someones life by having someone as a mirror disconnected from the emotional day-to-day interactions with people is way different from just realizing basic truths about yourself.

&gt;there's a difference between 'not knowing the difference between Ni/Fe vs. Ne/Ti' and 'not knowing if YOU personally identify more with Ni/Fe vs. Ne/Ti'.

I think the problem is there is a difference between knowing the contrast on paper, vs. knowing how they actually manifest themselves in people. Once you know all the ways they can manifest themself in how someone carries themself, interacts with others, and makes decision on a daily basis; then you can begin to identify it in yourself. If you remain only looking at the information on paper, rather than how those types actually exist in a non-theoretical realm, then of course you wont be able to identify people.

Its honestly just embarrassing that we are even having this conversation. If it is HONESTLY a problem with you not being able to look at yourself on such a basic level, then you have bigger problems in your life than figuring out your MBTI type.Cop out.&gt;I just don't like being talked to like I don't know anything. 

But you don't.

&gt;I use others as a reference point for MBTI rather than myself (Intuition+Ti-Fe), and that's how I learn about MBTI.

So you're still learning about MBTI. My exact point.

Stop trying to act like you're an expert on something you are ignorant about. I'm going to assume you do that a lot in your daily life, and trust me, people are judging you for it.

Being a contrarian to maintain your perfect self-image of yourself and keep your ego in tact is a very embarrassing flaw to be proud of.Its annoying when people walk around thinking they are smarter than they are. Confident ignorance is the single biggest flaw in modern society.I just love the hypocrisy of someone using cop out as an insult and then proceeding to cop out multiple times directly afterwards.I see you're an INFJ all of the sudden now, huh?I don't know if glorify is the word... but...

/r/INFP seems to overly obsess over depression, overcoming depression and acting like childish young girls with things like "I'm hugging you right now" and text submissions that just say "I love all of you". Just super saccharine and in-genuine stuff that then everyone else reacts to as being super sincere?

Every single conversation is a Fi conversation... not a lot of critical thinking or analytical conversation. If you even try to talk about non-Fi topics everyone goes "OH WOW, I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE ONCE PLACE I COULD ESCAPE THAT".

It is quite literally a giant hugbox. I feel more at home in /r/INTP

Not hating on /r/INFP, but as someone who (of course) also suffers from depression, it is just a place that really brings you down and puts you in a bad mood. I like the type of stimulating and interesting analytical conversations of INTP way more than just dwelling on depression all day.


**EDIT: Any INFPs who share the same sentiment, please share your opinion here! https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/**100% sure. Its just /r/INFP dwells on the worst parts of INFP rather than embracing the great parts. Yeah, a lot of us have terrible depression. Does every single thread have to be about that?That is great to hear! Hope all is well with them!

Like many INFPs, I have a passion for art and music... but I also have an interest in politics, sociology, propaganda, media manipulation, studying "power" and generally analyzing people on a macro scale. However, you can't even come close to talking about any of those topics on /r/INFP. I get downvoted to oblivion if I talk about anything besides depression or hugs.

What type are you, if you don't mind me asking?Wear that ESTP flair loud and proud. Hiding it only propagates negative stereotypes because all the ESTPs who are good people aren't visible, and only the assholes wearing flairs are visible.

Come on, break down the walls daisies!&gt;but I hardly ever see anything really downvoted there

Try making a post about politics. The uglies come out real quick.

https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year Look for yourself. Find me a post that isn't about fuzzies, depression, mental health and occasional art/music threads. The only humor coming from people reposting internet comics that often are also sort of depressing or fuzzy. All other discussion has been filtered out over the years. Its become a depression/fuzzy/hugs circlejerk. 


Also (I'm not a Trump supporter, I despise him) but here are the downvotes you are looking for. https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4r59zn/who_else_is_a_trump_supporter/ Scroll to the bottom.

I've made posts about Bernie Sanders and they have been downvoted to hell. I made a thread about (without any political agenda what so ever) encouraging people to stop feeling apathetic and get out and vote (in which there were many detractors in the thread talking about how [x] philosopher says voting is meaningless).I'm not disagreeing with you, but compare the front page of both /r/INTP and /r/INFP right now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/4tjl0b/do_you_believe_in_morality/

A philosophical discussion on morality (not my cup of tea, but its people using their brains to think about a topic.

Meanwhile this is the **ONLY** thread on the front page of INFP that isn't about Depression right now https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tjvfw/what_isare_your_favorite_animals/

Wow, real stimulating talk, huh?

The raw PERCENTAGE of certain talk on the subs being about the dredges of each type are different on any given day. INTP its maybe 40-75%, INFP it varies between 85-100%. No hyperbole.You have a positive upvote tally next to your name on RES for me, so clearly not asinine enough.I have NO idea why this is getting downvoted. Both DrunkMushrooms and Aurarus are bringing up great points. I think there is a ton of truth in both posts.

/r/INFP is a perfect example of :
&gt;Most posts on every type forum seem to be about people seeking help, rather than people creating original content that showcases the best of their type.

and also a great example of:
&gt;It is the replies that show off the type's strengths.

Though I also agree with all the points Aurarus made. Maybe not every post follows those guidelines, but if you go on those subs at any given time you will definitely see tons of those types of posts.&gt;deliberately crush any mushy gushy feelz with cruel reality occasionally

Saying your opinion on something is a reality is a cop-out though. That is my least favorite logical fallacy.

Its like when people say "Yeah I agree with this political movement, but I'm not going to join it". "I'm just a realist".

Well if every cynical asshole got off their ass to fight for their own beliefs, then it WOULD happen. YOU being part of the problem by being an apathetic detractor doesn't put you in position to be a "realist" on the situation. Its a self fulfilled prophecy.

**I'm not talking about you specifically (I don't know if you do this), just a general mentality/logical fallacy I hate.**Yeah. I feel like we should consolidate depression/feels posts into a weekly discussion for people. What do you think would be a good solution?https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/

Please show your support and share your opinion on the topic here. We need visibility of the people who are dissatisfied with the current state of it.&gt;unlike MBTI which is very easy to get a different result on.

This is due to the TESTS being flawed, not the science behind the personality types themselves.

In general the concept of the types (16) being to the power of two is sound mathematically. Let's say that Cognitive Functions is actually very close to being a truth about binary genetic strands. The 16 types works into that system of genetics governing personality.

The Big Five is very simple for anyone to understand just by looking at it, MBTI is often misconstrued as pseudoscience due to ignorance/unwillingness to learn rather than someone fully understanding it and then disproving it. The Big Five is so simple that you can't disprove it, really.

I think Big Five has its uses, but not sure if it would be ultra effective in deciding MBTI types. They aim to find different things about people, in my honest opinion.I think I understand what you are saying, but I would like to see some examples.Rather than instantly feeling hurt by it, you should ask yourself: is this true for me? If it is, make a positive change in your life. If not, then don't be hurt.You're on, hotdog! Where and when!?Interesting, thanks for sharing! If it works, it works. I would like to hear more about your process though. What indications from Big Five for example would indicate INFP to you?

I'm interested to hear more about this "social group". Is it specifically an MBTI group? How did you find it (or it find you)?

Again, thanks for the in-depth response!Personality disorders tend to always throw personality tests out of whack. It seems like MBTI tests (already flawed) seem to always type T-types with depression as INFP or INFJ for example. Weird how that works...Thanks man, that means a lot. I actually picked up a very persistent stalker who is harassing me currently just from that post.

He is commenting in a very bullying fashion on every post I make, stalking through my whole account history, and editting all his posts I reply to, as to make my responses look completely non-sequiter, dumb and out of context.

That thread is actually in itself an interesting study of people. The thread has an 85% upvote rate, yet I would guess 90%+ of the top level comments are in opposition. Most of the comments in support are massively downvoted. The silent majority in full effect, right?

If you want to chat sometime send me a PM, I would love to talk  about Sociology and stuff with you! (just skimming through my 100+ message inbox right now trying to ignore the angry/crazy people)&gt;TL;DR: Mumble something about "wow that's interesting" and frantically google "MBTI Big Five correlation chart" which you can try at home, too.

Ha! I was having a bad day, but this really cheered me up, thanks.

&gt;Non-MBTI specific group of community members where I happen to be in a leadership role, kind of a long story.

Translation: Scientology. ;)

Have a great day!Thanks!

Yeah, when my INTJ friend had a falling out with his other INTJ friend, I tried explaining it to him like that. Hopefully that little nugget of wisdom helped ;)The INFPs would join them instantly and turn the nation into 15 groups.Can the INFPs join this INTP group too?You're out of the group.ya firedAs I was briefly saying while heading out the door...

You can say all you want about the types in theory, but in actuality there is too much conflict. Yes I know both types are Fi Te Si Ne. I understand the theory of somehow that means they will peacefully complete each other without conflict. I get all that. But when rather than someone being different than you (different functions), they are quite literally opposite of you? It can cause a lot of problems. People like to talk about "opposites attract" but that is not true. If opposites attracted, wouldn't every couple be bi-racial? Wouldn't Bernie Sanders supporters be marrying Trump supporters? Socionics likes to use the same sort of logic that by completing each other, you are at peace with each other.

I will use the dual I know best from personal experience with INFP and ESTJ.

http://www.truity.com/infographic/entj-highest-earning-personality-type

Right off the bat. INFPs are generally (myself included) non-materialistic people. We would rather work a virtuous job or express ourselves with art, or exhibit our outside the box thinking; regardless of the potential salary. To work a job that does not allow those needs to be fulfilled, is to live a tortured life not worth living. We pay no mind to social status, trends and are skeptical of authority. We are live and let live, and wouldn't wish to boss someone around, but rather grow someone in their own way. ESTJs are all about making money in an office job, climbing the corporate ladder, respecting of authority, are strict regulators and in general aren't in favor of anything outside the norm. INFPs look down on ESTJ's materialist and status-centric nature, while ESTJs look down on INFPs laziness and "pointless" way of looking at the world.

http://similarminds.com/jung/estj.html

http://similarminds.com/jung/infp.html

They are directly conflicting in terms of their subconscious nature. The Te desire for efficiency and Si focus on what is real; directly conflicts with Fi accounting for individuals' emotions and Ne focusing on hypothetical possibilities.

Let me tell you straight up... I enjoy nearly every conversation I have with INTPs, as we spew our views on hypothetical topics. Even if we have conflicting views, the patience in which we explain ourselves and listen to each other causes for very interesting discussions. I have never once had a conversation like that with all the ESTJs I know. I rarely enjoy the conversations I have with ESTJs, and they would not enjoy the type of conversations my INTP friends and I have. It feels like I am held hostage in conversation as we talk about bullshit small talk when I would rather talk about some hypothetical political theory. As I said in the original post:

&gt;If you are just going to join every thread on here and talk about how superior Socionics is, then why are you on /r/MBTI in the first place?

And then you proceed to do exactly what I explained Socionics people do. Congratulations on being absolutely predictable and proving the point I was trying to make. Clearly you didn't read the post before going on a rant.&gt;Tragedy of the commons, it's not any one person's effort to revive it by themselves, it takes everyone, but any one person has no incentive, so it doesn't happen. 

Which is precisely why I am making this thread. All the people silently downvoting could instead take action and repopulate their superior system's sub.

Not to mention there are plenty of other Socionics forums on the web that are populated: https://www.google.com/search?q=google+socionics+forum

http://personalitycafe.com/socionics-forum/

http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/socionics/I don't want you to change, I am just a bit tired of people derailing conversations to talk about Socionics... and this wasn't targeted at you Flux.

&gt;With those sweeping generalizations, and us/them mentality

Users in threads will join an MBTI discussion and start talking about Socionics being superior **in an /r/MBTI thread**. If that isn't creating a us/them mentality, then how would my post be any worse in doing so? My thread is merely a response to the users with that mentality.

And sorry I didn't spend an hour per paragraph digging through years of /r/MBTI posts to cite specific examples of everything I am talking about to avoid "sweeping generalizations." ;)

&gt;Does this include the cognitive functions?

Of course. Cognitive functions is the backbone of MBTI (not that the shitty online tests would give you any indication of that). Contrary to what Socionics enthusiasts try to suggest, MBTI is also based off of Jungian theory. The fallacy of Socionics is making the suggestion that "By being truer to Jung, you are more correct". We are allowed to build on theories. Jung and Freud would be offended if we took their word as gospel rather than as building blocks for discussion and analysis.

&gt;I also doubt that anyone comes to this subreddit with a knowledge of socionics. 

It is a bit self-centered *(is that is the right word when its not about self, but rather a website you browse?)* to think that Reddit possesses the only MBTI community in the world. I didn't learn about MBTI and Socionics from Reddit. I learned about it and then checked if Reddit had an MBTI community.

&gt;I just want to try and figure out what the people who are anti-socionics find is a reasonable compromise because I think throwing we have the potential to throw the baby out with the bath water. 

1. The type relationship theory is completely unfounded. Socionics enthusiasts treat it like gospel. http://www.socionics.com/rel/rel.htm

2. Being able to tell someone's type by their facial and body features is absolutely unfounded. *"INFjs faces are often perfect ovals but can be rectangular in shape as well."* What face types are left? I've never seen [someone with a triangle](http://img08.deviantart.net/4214/i/2010/181/e/7/triangle_head_by_dadouw.jpg) or [a football for a head.](http://i2.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/1_hey-arnold.jpg?crop=24px%2C346px%2C2695px%2C1500px&amp;resize=670%2C377&amp;ssl=1) Races and nationalities of people are predisposed to certain facial features, to imply that certain facial features dictate your personality type completely disregards basic laws of genetics. http://www.socionics.com/advan/vi/vi.htm

3. The pointless confusion of types. MBTI has types in a way that makes complete sense for practical use purposes. INFP and ENFP are similar types. Why make it confusing and change it to INFp and ENFP being dissimilar types? It is another layer of unnecessary confusion regardless of the logic behind the change. http://www.socionics.com/advan/whoiswho.html

4. Quadras are such a terrible set of terminology. Alpha, Beta... come on. We are getting into Ancient Greek and making it sound like Astrological sign bullshit. The amount Socionics discusses the importance of Quadras is blown way out of proportion. Yes, INTP and ENTP are similar. Yes ISFJs and ESFJs are similar. No INTPs and ENTPs are not like ISFJs and ESFJs. Your two lead functions have way more dictation on your personality than your other two do. An INTP and INFP have more in common than an INTP and ISFJ/ESFJ do. It is a pedantic use of terminology when you could easily just describe the functions being discussed. In no cases will I ever make a blanket statement that encompasses INTP and ESFJ where I need to list their quadra. Encouraging it by having the terminology being thrown around perpetuates myths of these types having some exaggerated amount of noteworthy similarities.

Hopefully you understand my opposition now.I knew that would *trigger* some people. ;)Yeah I notice a big difference in INTP and ENTPs demeanor. INTPs are very open minded and despite forming their opinions while alone, they will adapt them in intrapersonal conversation as sound logic comes. They are more likely to have a collaborative conversation where both people listen to full thoughts and both people come away having learned something.

ENTPs create their opinions, and then take sadistic pleasure in debate and nullifying the other person's point of view. It is not inherently a bad thing to be uncompromising, but BOY is there a huge difference the way INTP and ENTP go about things.

It is why ENTPs are the best stand-up comedians and have brilliant lightning fast quips in debates... but INTPs are able to have more thoughtful stances in the long run. It seems there are a lot more INTPs as comedic writers behind the scenes, while ENTPs can do both, but shine as the unwavering mouth piece for thought.

Have you noted similar differences?*May we* keep MBTI in /r/mbti and Socionics in /r/Socionics?And what thing is that?&gt; First off, socionics is a closer representation to Jung's original functional model in Psychological Types II.

Like I said in my other post.

&gt;Contrary to what Socionics enthusiasts try to suggest, MBTI is also based off of Jungian theory. The fallacy of Socionics is making the suggestion that "By being truer to Jung, you are more correct". We are allowed to build on theories. Jung and Freud would be offended if we took their word as gospel rather than as building blocks for discussion and analysis.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4x4uit/can_we_keep_mbti_in_rmbti_and_socionics_in/d6cstsy

&gt;The descriptions differ between a few types in both systems is largely due to cultural differences, which is why you might not be able to relate to your type description in socionics.

Yeah, like Eastern Europe doesn't have black people or Asian people or South American people. Being from a different culture does not make it more right. They have their own biases of course.

&gt;Socionics adds another layer to typology, and anyone who relies on one more than the other is silly.

Some of the layers of Socionics are absurd and pointless in my eyes. There might be some great ideas to borrow from in Socionics, but there is nothing saying that they can't just be apart of MBTI. A lot of the ridiculous Socionics stuff DOES contrast with MBTI however.Ah, but au contraire. Read the sidebar and you will see that your unfounded statement is not supported by the sub itself.

&gt; Other Personality Tests
&gt; 
&gt; Socionics was developed primarily by the Lithuanian researcher Aušra Augustinavičiūtė, an economist, sociologist, psychologist. Socionics is quite similar to MBTI but has some slightly difference nuances. It adds focus to intertype relations and analysis of functions. MBTI and Socionics are both derived from Carl Jung, but are slightly different in their presentation. The Socionics subreddit is here: /r/socionics.
&gt; 
&gt; Related Subreddits
&gt; 
&gt;     /r/enneagram
&gt;     /r/MBTIDating
&gt;     /r/socionics
&gt; 

These are the only mentions of Socionics in the side bar. It is specifically noted as different and links to other places to discuss it. Just as MBTI Dating is a different enough type of sub, as is Socionics.&gt;Regardless of whether Socionics or MBTI is more correct, it's clear to me that you do not understand the theoretical framework used in Socionics.

Based on what?

&gt;They take the cognitive functions (aka information elements) concept and observe that it should have implications for the information people pay attention to and tend to communicate about. That's where all the intertype relations and quadra stuff comes from.

I have already explained that in this thread. I am perfectly aware of cognitive functions and how quadras work. **If you actually read my post you would know that.** I have a perfect understanding of how quadras work. Your lead functions have way greater indication of your personality than your non-leads. It is pretty obvious that despite only sharing secondary Ne, *IN THE REAL WORLD* INTP and INFP have more in common than INTP and ESTJ, who share every single cognitive function.

&gt;It's clear that the MBTI instruments have poor validity, and really we should take MBTI and Socionics as just early drafts of what should be a much richer and more fleshed out theory that still needs to be developed and validated.

I agree. And the tests aren't even based on cognitive functions, which is hilarious.&gt;If r/mbti overflows with let's say big five related material, to the point where it is ridiculous you'd find that many people would complain, that's when things are changed

And I am not suggesting a rule, but I am doing exactly as you say. I am creating an open complaint for everyone to self-reflect on and to consider the way they use /r/MBTI. If they find they are unhappy with MBTI and would rather discuss Socionics, then I think it would benefit them to seek some forums that are exclusively Socionics to meet those needs.

To put it into sports terms... why go on a league-wide sub-reddit if you want to exclusively talk about your favorite team? There is always an active sub for you to discuss your favorite team, in a lot more depth and with people who are experts on that team.So then why didn't you add in how it is also a Socionics sub?I'm talking about the Visual Indicator bullshit. Race affects your appearance.

But also, yes South America, Asia and Africa have very different cultures from Eastern Europe.&gt;I've been trying to be more confident these days 

I feel that a *slight* lack of confidence is a good thing... it is like a self-skepticism or something. Obviously once it becomes debilitating, it is clearly a negative, but a healthy amount of second-guessing yourself is truly what the world is often lacking these days.

The reason INTPs lack self confidence, is because they have a very open and skeptical mind with their main focus being logical truth. They would rather the discussion lead to the correct logical answer than it leading to them "winning" the discussion. They realize they have been wrong before, and will be wrong again; and have the modesty to be able to "hey, maybe I'm wrong, lets look into this and find out".

Just remember, your lack of self-confidence is why you SHOULD be confident. I know that sounds like it contradicts itself, but remember that a lot of the people you interact with on a daily basis, don't have that healthy self-skepticism and don't put as much thought into their world views as you.Thanks!

I know a lot of great INTPs (my favorite type, but don't tell the other types that shhhhhhh) and know how extraordinarily smart they are. They need to be the ones speaking up and making a difference!

Pretty much all my favorite intellectual Youtubers are INTPs. I think it is a great format for INTPs to get their thoughts out in an engaging way. What topics are you knowledgeable about? Ever thought of starting a Youtube channel?Haha, absolutely.Song: [Sleep - Dopesmoker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIw7oeZKpZc)

What made it so addictive?: It was only halfway over.Yeah, 100% INTP.

Side note: My other favorite INTP comedian is Nathan Fielder of Nathan For You.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You

Secretly the best show on TV no one knows about. Don't tell anyone or the show is ruined!

This is a show you have to just watch full episodes of, but I feel like this clip should be enough to pique interest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbm1kJzdv1MHila is 100% INFP, not a question.

Not quite sure about Ethan, but I am pretty confident. It seems like all their content has heart to it. Ethan's commentary is mostly about motive rather than logic (very unlike all the INTP YouTubers and ENTP comedians), so I don't think he is Ti. Obviously the shit they dissect is so illogical that he points that out as well, but a majority of the targets are people they are questioning the integrity, motive and character of. That screams Fi to me... and of course Hila is Fi dom (having her influence behind the scenes), but that is not to say Ethan is or isn't.

I'm going to go with ENFP for Ethan.&gt;while Hila(?) is ISFP

&gt;I'm still betting ISFJ for Hila

Wut....

Hila is not some lazer focused Se type and is completely an aloof spacey Ne type.&gt;Oh and please argue the points, that makes all the difference.

ENTP - Obsession with arguing and debating :)

INFP - LOW ENERGY. Impractical interests and career endeavors. Unorganized.Hila is nothing like any ISFJs I know, and exactly like multiple INFPs I know.

What about her says Fe to you?&gt;concerns rationalizing objective facts

That is Ti.

&gt; She has like, no idea what's going on either so Te-vulnerable.

Wut... That doesn't make sense.

&gt;She has strong Fi, but it's filtered through to make an emotional impact on Ethan

Fi-dom would be xxFP, ISFJ is Fe.

&gt; Si-dominant is as clear as it gets with her, as well.

With what evidence?


You are massively confused about how MBTI works... I don't know what else to say. You contradicted yourself multiple times...

EDIT: forgot a word.&gt;a little bit of Socionics to get the full picture.

Oh come the fuck on. We are in /r/MBTI. Use MBTI types or go on /r/socionics . You can't say ISFJ in an MBTI forum and mean Socionics ISFj.

Just please stop being a conceited twat who talks down to people.

Also, see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4x4uit/can_we_keep_mbti_in_rmbti_and_socionics_in/

&gt;If you are just going to join every thread on here and talk about how superior Socionics is, then why are you on /r/MBTI in the first place?I'm done. I surrender. You win.

http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/610/253/184.jpgYes! Another converted. Probably my favorite show on TV at the moment.ITT: weaboos and people predictably saying the generic Redditor answers of "Rick and Morty, Bojack Horseman and Bobs Burgers".Yeah, I got the Superbowl one wrong because I was thinking about the year of the majority of the season rather than the year the Superbowl took place.

Change it to 2014-2015 season, or 2013-2014 season, etc.&gt;I think Fi deals with the standard sense of self worth

Is that why INFPs are the most suicidal type? More Fi means less self worth?I think self-worth is the wrong wording. Self-worth implies confident, self-centered, and putting own wants above others.

INFPs often are complete pushovers and put others wants before their owns and make a lot of compromises to maintain peace and avoid confrontation. It takes a real hot button issue to receive major INFP pushback.They are overly confident and self-centered. [They often cheat on their SO and engage in helping others cheat on their SO.](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/3byvb3/blue_must_be_istp/)

They are sarcastic, yet when other people make jokes they don't understand them. They claim they are free-spirited yet are super judgemental. They think they are the smartest or most insightful type when that is clearly INTPs. INTPs are just too polite to correct ISTPs. In general they are people who would rather have personal success than help the world have success. They also use the cop-out excuse of "I'm just a realist" or "I know it hurts, but its the truth" when saying things that are factually incorrect.

If you are offended by this post, just remember that I'm just being honest, the truth hurts and I'm just a realist.INFPs and INFJs understand things involving "people" more than any other type. If INFxs are talking about observations involving trends, observations and insight regarding "people", you better listen up. INFPs also value honesty/authenticity over above else, so we wont bullshit you.

When it comes to *"people"*, INFPs are realists. I've got the talent of reading people with the honesty to back it up. I have a friend who basically doesn't talk to me about personal things anymore because turns out ISFJs don't want the truth and empathy, they just want empty sympathy instead.

If you want me to say what I like about ISTPs I will gladly give that as well. I figured since /r/ISTP usually has enough circlejerking that I would give the counter balance to that.You're welcome. Sorry if any of it came off in an overly harsh/abrasive way.

Just remember to only use negative feedback as food for thought, rather than something to demotivate yourself. Though I shouldn't have to tell an ISTP that, since you guys parry attacks/criticisms and use them as fuel.

&gt;Though personally, cheating on your SO just doesn't make sense.

Glad to hear it. Cheating, walking out on relationships (especially with children) is the worst thing an ISTP can do. Make sure you think about the longevity of a relationship before committing to it "because it is practical and convenient". That is the first step in preventing the urge to leave the relationship in the first place.I'm not basing it on a single post. None of this is based on posts.

I just posted it because its the top post of all time on /r/ISTPNot on wives, but certainly all throughout high school and college people cheating on their girlfriend/boyfriends. Then rationalizing it with "its college, you're supposed to be unloyal, there's no expectation of an exclusive relationship at college".&gt;ISFJ people absolutely want truth and empathy, their function stack is Fi-Se-Ti-Ne

I think you're a bit confused how cognitive functions work. You might want to Google that one again champ.&gt;That's literally all you could respond to of what I said

The premise of your comment is on false pretenses. What is there to talk about? You making a statement about Fi, when the type is Fe? You want me to discuss ISFJ's Fi to coddle your feelings for making a mistake, or do you want me to correct you so we can have an actual discussion?&gt; Actually I expected you to think about what I actually said to you

There is nothing to talk about. You want me to talk about ISFJ's Fi-dom that they don't have. What a wonderful topic.

Why are you so angry right now over your own mistake? Can you really not just admit your mistake, apologize and move on without ruining your own whole day?I just don't understand why you are trying to hurl personal insults at me if you want to have an actual conversation.When you pose as knowledgeable on a topic and then say the following:

A) One of the four Si-dom types defined by the fact they are Si-dom, is actually Se type

B) That an Fi type has a certain characteristic because they are Fi, but then when you find out the type is Fe then "Oh, then in that case my statement is MORE correct and I'm more right". Absolutely hilarious.

C) That a type can have two introverted decision making functions (Fi and Ti)

D) That a type can have two extroverted perception functions (Se and Ne)

There are so many layers of why your comment made no sense that there was no foothold in actual typology left to actually have a conversation on. If you are willing to learn I can send you some interesting videos, but if you're just going to act like an expert and insult people who correct you; then I'm afraid this conversation is over.What? Have you met an ESTJ, ENTP or ESTP before?Because all S-types secretly agree that N-types are superior in every way, but will only admit it to themselves when it means whether they get a job or not.

^;)The more I browse /r/mbti, the more I realize only about 25% of people who comment have even a basic understanding of cognitive functions. Yet the other 75% will argue with you relentlessly about their own confidence in how MBTI works.

I hate blind ignorant confidence. The single worst trait that is holding the world back the most these days.&gt;ISFJ people absolutely want truth and empathy, their function stack is Fi-Se-Ti-Ne - seems like you've decided that all of them are exactly like the single one you've read. That ISFJ probably doesn't like you trampling on their emotions or their personal lives, they might find it a bit offensive that you act like you inherently understand their perspective

Wrong. Since I have to assume you are talking about Fe, since you are talking about ISFJ, you are objectively wrong. Fi is truth and authenticity. Fe is harmony and community. Nothing to discuss there.

&gt;Si-Fe is even more empathy over sympathy than Fi-Se, so what are you even saying?

Directly conflicts your previous post. Aside from that, my first comment was about how Fi-dom is about empathy, and Fe-dom is about sympathy. A widely accepted statement. You were just disagreeing via a set of (confusingly) wrong typology with no insight to back it up... just to cover up your mistake.

&gt;when I inevitably fall to human error :)

&gt;are being made aware of again :)

It all makes sense now, a 12 year old girl is responding to me. "I'm so sassy because I put smilies when I'm actually angry :)".By the way, what type are you? Clearly by not having flair you are either...

A) ashamed of your type or

B) unsure of your own type

Which is it?Yet when I say ISTPs are full of themselves, people get on my case and say "Well actually that's not true because--because..."I fucking knew it. I baited you into answering B because I knew you were one of those confidently ignorant dumbasses who talks about MBTI when they can't even figure out their own type. Perfect read by me, yet again.

You are talking out your ass, as predicted, and will now make some bullshit excuse for why its easy to confuse Ni-Fe with Ne-Ti just because they share Ti/Fe. Absolutely hilarious.

I'm done with you and have you RES tagged so I can laugh my ass off every time I see you speaking as an authority on anything MBTI.&gt;People who don't know ISTPs will say they are full of themselves. we're very reserved. We don't expect anyone to understand us either. I take being full of myself as a complement actually. We'll be happy if we have less people around us.

Exactly my point. This might sound strange to you, but not every type sees "being full of themselves" as a compliment.

I'm not insulting you, its just a fact for ISTPs. Obviously if an ISTP has anxiety disorder, or a tragic past, etc etc (there are always exception, and people try to twist my words into saying there aren't)... then duh they won't be as confident... but a healthy ISTP has a lot of pride and self-superiority. Its in their nature.I didn't read this comment you put so much effort into. I win.I understand all people.

Always remember the context and relativity of circumstance. Just because your immediate surroundings are compromised of people who don't understand you, doesn't mean that people who do don't exist.

Is the relationship with that friend normally this toxic?More words.As your time on earth crumbles to the wind......I create art with my actions......and so I enjoy each second; as others dwell on their anger...My wording is off... but let me put it this way. An ISTP who meets their full potential will establish a lot of pride and confidence.ISTPs focus on what is practical and logical in their immediate situation/reality and their short and long term goals. ISTPs are the kings of "practical" being their focus.

INTPs on the other hand focus on what is possible and logical. They think about all the possibilities, and all those possibilities overwhelm themselves putting them into a realization of self-doubt. "How can anyone know the perfect logic when there are infinite possibilities?"

Meanwhile, the ISTP doesn't care about weighing infinite possibilities, just quickly finding the most effective method and mastering it to its full potential. Not innovating in terms of new technique, but innovating in terms of reaching a level of competency never seen before.

As Bruce Lee said [paraphrasing] "I fear not the man who knows 10,000 kicks, but the man who practiced 1 kick 10,000 times".

INTPs want to research and experiment with each and every one of those 10,000 kicks before choosing one to learn... eventually the task becomes to overwhelming and they just give up realizing its a meaningless task to learn kicks anyways.

INTPs care about innovation and researching a new discovery. A lot of exploring hypotheticals, concepts and methodology. ISTPs care about pushing the boundaries of what is tangibly possible. Becoming the greatest, the first, taking the already established to its logical extreme.I love ENFP's enthusiasm when they are expressing their agreeance. Its like the feeling you get when you're trying to remember something and then all of the sudden it comes to you and you get so excited. Except its like "I've been trying to put this thought I've subconsciously had into words for so long and finally you have freed me of this curse!"

Never stop being enthusiastic about your life's cause, whatever it may be :)Sorry I've got something in my eye ;)Very well written and sound analysis of your self it sounds like. Thanks for the insightful read. It sort of helps me understand my one ISFJ friend to a certain extent.

I will do this when I wake up... I need sleeeeeeep.&gt; I function like an ENFP while at work (I revert to ESFP while off of them- this includes a shift in my functional stack).

There is my claim substantiation. I'm not going to write a sourced research paper for a buried comment on /r/MBTI 8 people will see, just to appease you.

There are so many threads and comments about people "switching between types". Or "I developed my extroversion so now I'm an extrovert!" Or can't decide between two very different types. If you browse here, your experience and knowledge of MBTI is all the substantiation of my claims that is needed.

Yet these ignorant claims people on here make come with such **confidence** and *indignation* when it is pointed out they are wrong. Your comment confirmed exactly what I am talking about. Rather than self-reflecting and refining your understanding... you attack the messenger.An INTJ, INFP and ESFP are in a comments section.

The INTJ makes a sound observation and poses a question.

The INFP makes a sarcastic joke about the observation.

The ESFP doesn't understand the joke and goes on a long winded rant wasting their own time. If only their head was in the clouds, they would have seen the joke coming, rather than it going right over them.&gt;Personally, I think that's a slightly distorted way to think.

It was tongue in cheek. Obviously everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.

That is what the winky face denotes.Why does everyone have such shitty friends that they feel they can't be honest with? Y'all associate with some terrible people.Thanks.

In other threads I have been downvoted for my observations on ISTPs. I think there are some ISTPs who think they are so abstract and misunderstood, that when someone nails them down they are viscerally offended and enter contrarian mode.What is your type?

I don't get why people don't put their MBTI flair on. Whats the fun in an MBTI forum without displaying your type?You're in timeout, mister.When met with an unstoppable force, I choose to entertain myself with humor.You will find there is more truth in my emptiness than there is in your justifications.Don't feel embarrassed for expressing your views. Dissecting the seemingly small and mundane is often very important.So, you're ashamed? Do you think people will judge your type rather than your words because you dislike your own type?Comme je l'ai dit, vous êtes d'autres ont peur va juger vous en fonction de votre MBTI.

Quelle est votre MBTI ?A generic alt-rock song about thinking you're more unique, different and outside-the-box than peers... but in reality you're just playing a generic alt-rock song just like everyone else.

Sounds like most INFPs to me...ENFJ? Really? Hmm... that actually surprises me. If I had to guess before seeing this, there so many more types I would have put on this list before ENFJ.Thanks for sharing. I wish they also had a breakdown for cognitive functions...I think the fallacy here is assuming the test-taker:

A) has an accurate perception of themselves

INFPs are all about knowing themselves and constantly discovering themselves due to Fi dom. Aux Fi can make it very hard for an ESTJ to properly identify and express themselves. Bill O'Reilly (ESTJ) for example, sees himself as a saint (and lets you know it!) while he fear mongers, creates prejudices, misleads/misinforms his viewers; among other dishonest actions.

B) is honest while answer the questions (again, maybe they are lying to *themselves*)

ESTJs are very image conscious and can logically know what answers would paint them in a more positive light.

C) that these disorders can even be properly identified from self-testing

Narcissism seems like something that might very well be hard to identify in a test, and more something to easily tell in-person from their views and actions.Me: INFP

Dad: ESTJ

Mom: ISFJ

Brother: ENTP

Sister: ENFP

All Si/Ne, 3 Fi/Te, 2 Ti/Fe

I wonder how genetic MBTI is. Mathematically speaking (based on surveys ~25% N, ~25 SP, ~50% SJ), it is equally likely one of us siblings would be an SP type as an N type if it was completely random. It would also seemingly be way more likely for us to be SJ types though as well. It makes sense none of us are Se/Ni, but again, I wonder why none of us are SJ.What website(s) do you prefer? I've always used 16Personalities for friends to take.Good point. However, Narcissism is often about only seeing things as how it affects you and reflects your self-perception.

For example, I saw an interview with Kanye west (Fe, with clinical narcissism). In which he was asked what were the effects on his life of his ["George Bush doesn't care about black people" comment. A normal person would answer that talking about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcgPsEubkjo)

A) The social/political repercussions felt by others (and those repercussions affecting him)

B) The opinions and reactions other people had towards Kanye (instead he projects his own interpretation onto others as a factual interpretation)

C) How it actually affected the Hurricane Katrina efforts (completely ignored)

Instead he responded saying...

D) "It changed my life for the better, people understood me a little bit more.... the truth just comes out.... like what comes off the top off his mind.... I'm speaking from the heart."

Talking about how other people started to understand **his own perception of himself** better.

Maybe I'm not wording my thoughts correctly... but there is constantly little "slightly off" responses Kanye has where things are framed liked that.The thing is... I make educated guesses, and the test usually confirms my guess. That is why I use 16 Personalities... it seems to do a good enough job. Their type descriptions do a great job of helping them to see if adjacent results are any more accurate or not too.

A lot better than most other website descriptions.Exactly. And that is the why I use it. It is fantastic for beginners. Everything is color coated, visual, caricatures, plenty of reading material. What it lacks in depth/accuracy, it makes up for in engaging newcomers and giving tools to help remember/differentiate the types.

I've found in general that ENTPs

A) have the hardest time typing themselves

B) are the most skeptical of MBTI and results in general

Do you think there is any outside chance that you might be ENTP?

I am not defending the test by any means, they are HiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiGHLY flawed... but from my experience, every ENTP I know (and I've seen 3-4 of them on this subreddit alone) associates themselves with other N-types more than ENTP. So many that are convinced they are INTJ, or INFJ for example. Its very strange.Interesting, thanks for sharing.ESTJs.

**Trigger warning: MBTI stereotyping incoming. That is the point of this thread, so don't act offended that its happening.**

Extroversion, confidence + lack of open-mindedness (my least favorite trait combination), way too much respect for authority/patriotism, and sticking with their loyalties even if what they are loyal to has completely transformed. They horrify me on a level no other type does.

If they perceive you as a peer/underling you can't logic with them, yet sometimes they will trust the authority/expertise of people who shouldn't be trusted. In their views and opinions they can be very illogical, which is concerning since they aren't even an F-type. They are stuck in their ways, and will run you over if you try to bring attention to the issues with what they are doing/believing.

I don't want this whole post to be all negative so... I think they can have a good sense of humor when they aren't in bossy mode. And they're the most hardworking mothafuckas in da biz, ya heard?Psychosis is outside the parameters of MBTI.CritSrc, you're always forcing me to upvote you when you post.ENTPs are the verbal bullies of the N-types, but secretly never want to fight. ESTPs are less creative/insightful with their verbal bullying, but secretly would rather fight.In reguards to Fi, nope. I'm as cool as a cucumber. I'm usually the one calming other people down who are getting angry over stupid shit. Their anger *is* the "bullshit" that I must calmly extinguish.

Maybe more of an Se thing?&gt;bringing up enneagram on /r/MTBI

*triggered*While that may true for you, I've met a lot of ESTJs who use very selective research to reiterate what they want to believe.

&gt; If I can cast the shadow of a doubt I talk to experts from each side again and re evaluate my original stance.

And in relation to this...

&gt;yet sometimes they will trust the authority/expertise of people who shouldn't be trusted.

Sometimes there are fields where "experts" on one side are objectively wrong (climate change and evolution are the low-hanging fruit examples there). There are "experts" who's agenda is specifically guided by a company/organization paying their salary. Rather than looking into the expert's background as part of the research, they just look at the "facts" from both sides with the assumption that they aren't getting bullshitted.

This example is for a few people I know personally... obviously it probably doesn't apply to all ESTJs.

Thanks for your response, and I hope I'm not sounding like a dick here.&gt;Regardless of type, we should all strive to be smarter and more well informed despite our initial thoughts and preference 

Truth. The struggle is real.


While not always true, I feel INTPs are the best at this. However, they have difficulties in other aspects of life.Intelligence and ability may vary*

Just like everything in life, just because someone is a certain type, doesn't make them automatically good at something.Absolutely, I agree. There are so many different "types of intelligence" that exist. While certain NF types might have the potential to have good person reading, its all about how your life plays out and what skillset your life helped you build up.

So many MBTI pages I've seen describe INFP types as "having a sixth sense" (makes me roll my eyes). I feel like that is just a short-hand way of saying...

&gt;Uses Ne and Si subconsciously to jump to conclusions. Then because it was a subconscious conclusion there is no "work shown" or step by step thought process to cross reference afterwards.

The conclusions might very well be logical, and had logical steps in logic... but when pressed for "Why did you think that?" there must be some introspective analysis to translate subconscious thoughts into tangible language.And INTPs are very aware of the logic behind their interactions and thought process. So it all depends on the definition of self-aware.Yeah I second INFP. Not sure where your father-in-law is getting ISTJ from...

&gt;I value justice more than mercy

You are more of an emotional decision maker than you think OP. Craving justice is an emotional need, not a logical one.Yeah, its sort of impossible for someone to determine your type with all those barriers, cultural differences, and lack of intimacy.

&gt;Is there any chances I could be an INFJ?

Based on your description you sound solidly INFP, and nothing truly indicated to me INFJ.Make kids take the test against their will. Then...

Tell the NF types "I understand you, school sucks maaaaaaaaan"

Tell the NT types "You're smarter than me, just try harder in class"

Tell the SJ students "Stay in line or I will tell your parents and the principal"

Tell the SP students "I'll give you oral and take you skydiving if you do good on your next test"

Ez game ez life.

- Scientific journal of BombasticaTruth.

Though I think you should at least jerk off the poor SP and Se-aux students.&gt;I don't really think school sucks in theory, it's just poorly implemented and in need of an update. Admitting that you think that such problems exist as a teacher earns you my respect.

Then the teacher will say "Man, school kinda sucks but its a lot more complex and nuanced than that... wanna discuss the philosophy of schooling with me so I can earn your respect and become your mentor? I promise I won't jerk you off."Here in the USA...

We live in a world where Fi's inconvenient truths are seen as being a dick or childish; and Fe's subtle lying and going along with whatever evils is seen as "being a good caring person".

We live in a world where Ti's worth is left to go to waste or seen as outlandish; while Te's blind money making and power gaining pursuits are seen as a positive attribute.

Its a Te/Fe/Si world. Step in line.http://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm

46.4% of the population is Te/Si or Fe/Si.

12.5% of the world is Ne/Fi, meaning right there is an instant roadblock of communication and understanding. No dominant cog shared with half of the population. They don't understand Ne/Fi so they see it as selfishness.

6.5% of the population is Ne/Ti, meaning there is another roadblock in way of thinking between them and half of the population. They don't follow their lines of logic because it is less efficient, impractical or unproven.

NJ types are Te/Fe types which is what often makes them successful at their pursuits. They have a point of contact with the rest of the world, and how it is run.

While SP/SJ types don't share T/F... SP types share with SJs the "down to earth" nature of being an S-type. While SPs and SJs might not connect with the way of thinking, they respect each other's no nonsense nature.Dom is the most important thing people connect with. Their OWN dom functions are their gateway to viewing the rest of the world.

What I'm saying is, a Fe dom is more familiar with Fe-aux than Fi-dom. SJs are the nucleus of the world... the F-type SJs are Fe-Dom; hence they are more in line with Fe-dom and Fe-aux than Fi-dom. Fe is seen as the nucleus of feeling types.&gt;Sure, Te and, to a lesser extent, Fe are still very well established especially in business and politics

Agreed.

&gt;but the incredible rise of Information Technology, a distinctly Ti-oriented field, and the massive modern push of social marxism, (even in the United States), which always favors the individual and minority, show a definite trend towards the upholding of Ti and Fi.

Agreed.

&gt;Part of the problem, something that will always be a problem, is that Fi, by its very nature, is not scalable to the level of a whole society. I know this isn't a perfect analogy, but it helps to illustrate my point, so here we go: If Fi is individualism itself, then it is still the distinct role of Fe to wish that individualism becomes a universally accepted value. Fi doesn't care for universal or societal values. That is Fe's domain. So, a society, by its very nature, will be more aligned with Fe than with Fi. It is not a problem with any particular society, but with societies in general.

Agreed.

I was going to dissect this post for discussion, but there is no point because its near perfect. Great analysis. Wish I could give you gold.

To expand the discussion. Fi = individuals in mind, Fe = community in mind, Te = efficiency, Ti = logical truth

Do you think with the rise of Ti/Fi that there will also be a bigger push for honesty, and transparency in society? One ran to be correct, rather than efficient? One with more debate and discourse rather than faction vs. faction rivalries?

What other benefits will there be from a rise in Ti/Fi? What do you think could be the downsides of the rise of Ti/Fi?&gt;I honestly have no clue xD. I don't think it's something that I'd be able to discuss without a TON more knowledge than I already have.

To answer my own question... I just discussed the snootiness of France at dinner tonight. Perhaps more Fi = more snooty pretense XD

&gt;Greed is universal.

Except for some of us INFPs! I personally am embarrassed by wealth (I'm not sure if that is an INFP thing or not). That is why Frodo was trusted with the ring... he is corruptible by power and greed, but it is a lot harder than for others.You could try what I do and just cut out Mammals. All the chicken, cheese and fish you can eat! Chicken tacos instead of steak tacos, grilled chicken sandwiches instead of burgers. The best part of all, apparently Potatoes aren't mammals so you can still have french fries!ENTPs and INTJs are the best at devils advocate.Yeah I agree, INTP one is good. INFJ one is good on occasion. INTJ is good on occasion.

INFP is literally just a 24/7 suicide prevention hotline. There is no use trying to post anything actually interesting on there because it instantly gets buried by the exact same threads reworded differently each time.

ESTP/ISTP ones are ass as well.

See: [my post 4 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/)

Despite the votes being in favor of change, the comments yelled loud in clear "don't change I like the same posts over and over".I tried to make a change in the past, and apparently it didn't resonate: https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/Yep...

So many things disappointing about that thread. I learned a lot about INFPs from that thread that I am actively aware of now and try to prevent myself from falling into. It can be so frustrating when INFPs stop being open minded. INFPs are at their best when they are channeling their Ne, not their Si.

I try to force myself to think about things in terms of Ne and Ti (motivated by Fi), rather than thinking in terms of Fi and Ne (motivated by Si). If that makes any sense...I don't think its a moderation problem, but I like how proactive and open to criticism you are being!

Seems like all the threads are about dating, emotions (or lack-there-of), taking pride in (or having an unaffected attitude towards) being an asshole.

If you check the frontpage right now there is seemingly the same threads about very very similar topics.

I don't think moderation would fix that (since there ARE nuances of difference between them), however you could have a weekly "dating/relationship advice" thread that refreshes weekly.

For the MBTI subreddits it is mainly user error, not moderation error... however encouraging more variety and consolidating redundant conversations are good actions mods can take.Yep.... I tried my best to fix it, but no one cared https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/&gt;  I mean sure, it's a really practical solution. But it reduces visibility drastically

That is the point. When most of the posts are about one subject, that is the only thing visible. The purpose of consolidating is to allot visibility for other topics while keeping the one subject paramount in a stickied thread that is always on top.

I'm not going to go back to arguing the exact same things I already argued in that thread. If you wanted to participate you should have had your voice heard 4 months ago. You won and /r/INFP is still shit so congrats. Lets let the dead horse lie.

Still unsubbed and haven't missed it for a single day.\#riseaboveYeah exactly... INTP is more social anxiety.

And I'm not saying its a bad thing that these threads exist. *Apparently* /r/INFP has prevented some potential suicides. However, the whole entire sub is about depression, leaving no room for conversation.&gt;ENTP

Probably because you are a dick to them, so they don't feel internally motivated to do anything to help you.N O A M

C H O M S K Y

B O I ZYour heart deceives you. I suggest learning more about MBTI rather than just going "I like these people, so they are my type".I can't possibly narrow it down to one but...

Ian Curtis, George Orwell.... Elliot Smith, Kurt Cobain, Nick Drake, Bjork...

Lots of musicians.

However, a lot of the people I look up to the most are INTP. They are wonderful at my weaknesses, but see the world in a similar way. Jimmy Wales, Edward Snowden(?), Einstein. Tons of FSF, EFF and Linux people.

And then the ENFPs that have done so much that I look up to. Ralph Nader, Julian Assange(?), George Carlin.You mean Bill Hicks isn't an INFP? ;_;He is a black leader, hence he must be an ENFJ! /sJeeze, talk about melodrama. People disagree with you so you delete your account.

&gt;implying everyone here isn't already aware of socionicsCelebrity types is notoriously inaccurate. They are right about 75%+ of the time, but some of the ones they are wrong on are insane. I use the website for people new to MBTI... it is a fun site, but I don't think it is wholly accurate.

I would be more than willing to hear your personal reasoning though.Based on the reality of being an INFP... we would get some Aquaman level bullshit like:

- The ability to [feel the pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQZmrdwK7YM) of anything/anyone it observes.

- The ability to predict the future, but not be able to convince anyone of your predictions or even properly put them into coherent words.

- The ability to read someone's past.
Exactly what I'm thinking as well. Its like you read my mind. To expand on what you just said:

There is constantly more and more evidence about red meat and cooked/cured meat causing cancer. Tons of correlation with heart disease as well.

We can't eat a lot of meat without it being cooked (cooking is a fairly new concept in the grand scheme of the universe). To think that its okay for us to eat something that requires us to cook it, seems a bit farfetched to me.

Personally I feel pretty sick after eating beef (something I noticed even when I constantly ate beef).

We are so closely related to pigs that we can use their heart valves as replacements for humans!

Its just one of those things that there is so much soft-evidence that all leads to the same message of "Maybe we shouldn't eat mammals?". I'm not going to push my theory on anyone else, but I've noticed it, so I will apply it to my own life. Glad someone else has come to the same conclusion!/r/INFP is absolutely terrible, its been dead for over a year in terms of content quality. If the quantity follows suit, its directly because of the quality.Ditto... I made a thread about making the subreddit better.... majority of voters agreed, majority of commenters disagreed. Nothing changed.

My favorite thread type... "Do any other INFPs listen to [very popular band]? Is that just an INFP thing?"In addition: ISFPs are more physical than ISFJs.

I think with those two changes it would relatively sound...

EDIT: To clarify, this chart is nowhere near anything close to being scientific... but its just a dumb chart that kind of lays out the whole "Mind, Body and Soul" dynamic among the types.[Yeah... they're sort of mediocre at everything rather than actually being good at something.](https://i.imgur.com/W0QgS4N.png)Your sarcasm detector needs a bit of work, however.I don't think you fully grasp MBTI, OP. I'm going to assume this is a tongue in cheek bait post.I've thought about this exact topic many times before!

The Jaws, Corey Duffel, Danny Way, Cardiel, Dustin Dollin type are definitely SP risk takers/thrill seekers.

However, there is also the Rodney Mullen and Tony Hawks who are also Se type, but they are very low-risk and more about technical skating and innovation rather than thrill seeking. Tony Hawk does SOME thrill seeking skating, but not nearly as much as his vert counterparts like Danny Way. These Se types are more about reaching milestones and being the first to do something that people didn't think was possible before. They're like record breakers. Danny Way fits into both Se categories though to be fair.

Then you have some clearly Ne skaters like [Richie Jackson (INTP) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQa8UpCpnnE), [Ed Templeton (INFP) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4OwWSrn0uU) or [Brian Anderson (INFP?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW-rdtd3_7I). They don't really care about whats trending in skating at the time or being the "first" to do something (like the Se types are often great at pursuing). They just sort of skate and create in their own way that represents them. They don't actively skate anything big, they just skate what is interesting to them.

Andy Schrock (110% ENFP, right?) is another example of a Ne skater. He will do whatever tricks other people are lame, but he will do it with the biggest grin and enjoy himself.

I'm not exactly sure about Si or Ni skaters. Not familiar with any that definitively fit into either of those.

I actually wonder about Rodney Mullen. [He's a weird dude... a deep thinker, and said he hates competing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vib-kyKnz08) He almost feels like INFJ to me at points. He seems like Ni + Ti. But not sure if ISTP or INFJ. I think hes an ISTP with a very well developed Ni though.He is a very different ISTP from others though. Tony Hawk has that eye of the tiger. If he wants to do something, he just goes into that unstoppable force ISTP mode. That MJ/Kobe mode.

Rodney Mullen is so Buddha-like. He is chill, peaceful, hippy-ish, doesn't want to compete, just wants to exist.

These are the types of things that make me thing there is one more exponent to the MBTI formula. Like rather than 16 types, there are 32. I think 16Personalities is on the right track, but aren't quite there.

You notice that same split dichotomy in some of the other types as well.He is absolutely and introvert. Its a one man TED talk... You have to constantly talk and put on an outgoing persona. Don't confuse talkative/energetic with extroverted.&gt;I'm almost certain that Mullen is an ISTP, we can definitely be deep thinkers.

And I didn't mean to suggest otherwise... however, I feel like he almost over-thinks things in a very Ne/Ni way. I agree that he is ISTP, but hes very different than most athlete ISTPs for sure. ISTPs use their thinking for tangible results... and his tangible results are more of a spiritual/emotional result. Obviously those can have a tangible effect on your life, its just weird how head-in-the-clouds he is compared to other ISTPs. Clearly he gets ISTP-like results, so I ain't arguing.

&gt;Interesting thoughts on Ne I've been wondering about how intuition plays a role in skating. 

Its weird, Ne types almost see skateboarding as an art, or a leisure activity to turn off their mind, or a means to an end for their other life pursuits.

Ed Templeton was all about the art of skateboarding, getting indie music in his videos, making art, starting a business, and making the company all about its art.

Andy Schrock isn't the best skater, but hes a dreamer. He wanted to own a skateboarding business because he loves skateboarding enough to make a career out of it, but isn't good enough to be a traditional pro.

Brian Anderson never had the goal of becoming a pro. He didn't think he was good enough so never tried (INFP low self confidence) and his friends forced him into it. He seems to supplement his life with skateboarding and art.

I'm not trying to suggest its universal... but its almost like ISTPs see skateboarding as a sport/activity of pushing your limits and doing things never done before. NPs seem to see it as an artform and a way for self-expression.

What do you think?Cool video! Thanks for sharing. I'm not very familiar with skiing but it looks like he is doing some very outside-the-box tricks as compared to the usual I see. Check out Gou Miyagi or Richie Jackson if you are interested in the skateboarding equivalent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePhqEdThzLc

&gt;As I've gotten older, it's become like dance and art and self expression--exactly what you are describing.

Exactly... it is a physical art. An improvisational short-form performance art if you will.

Yeah it is pretty interesting to compare and contrast what brings each type into "extreme sports", and what they bring to the sport in return.Thanks for the read. I love all forms of art, but am less knowledgeable about individual film makers. It was interesting to see your interpretation of these people through the eyes of MBTI.&gt;That attitude annoys me from both perspectives.. 

Agreed, because it IS both! I hate when people have to make something like that black and white.

&gt;I've always thought BA was an ISFP but you could be right about INFP

I'm not ultra familiar with him either... but I watched his Epicly Later'd and read a really in-depth personal interview with him. He is either ISFP or INFP... but I really got the INFP vibe from him for sure. Hes very political and conscious about many topics that transcend skateboarding in a way that an ISFP would ignore because it doesn't really affect them. He is very stubborn with letting his principals and morals take priority over his ability to profit financially. He values small businesses, skateboarding's art culture and being against giant international corporate entities that abuse their power.

He has also came out as gay recently and has done a lot of spreading the word and interviews on the topic.

I don't know, very much seems like an INFP.Personally, I've always been a sports nut. I've always been talented at sports. I was really fucking good at basketball. Specifically passing. I could see everything unravel before it happened, so crazy passes were really easy for me. I was also really good at grasping and understanding Zone defenses. Those were my favorite. Man-to-man is about atheletics, but zone is about smarts. That is the type of things in sports I love the most.

I'm pretty dang coordinated, and have good balance. I'm not great at skateboarding, but I've been doing it since I was 6 years old and haven't stopped since. Flip tricks were always very difficult for me but I enjoy everything else about skating.

If I didn't have health problems, I probably could have played some low level college basketball despite being on the shorter side.Its funny because a lot of people couldn't believe he was gay either.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZU5K3y7QhUYou should argue with that man about his business model.The customer is always _____.If he charged more, the consumer would think they are getting something of value. He values himself at free... the customers do as well.Reddit is just too predictable...In my observation.. INxPs are better at cooperative, ego-free, discussions rather than "debates". INTPs and INFPs can swap knowledge all-day and come upon some very interesting thoughts.

ENTPs are better at taking (established) thoughts, ideas, stances and conveying them in the most convincing form. Along with on-the-fly logic judo to make even the most reasonable arguments seem dumb.

Yes, INFPs CAN argue... but I feel we are better in text arguments than in-person debates.

EDIT: a word.They're also great arguers. However, I don't think they are as good at on-the-fly embarrassing their opponent as ENTP. INTJs are good at pre-prepared arguments they make ahead of time. It depends on what type of preparation is allotted ahead of time so they can plan for every avenue the conversation might go down. ENTPs can just do it more adaptable.To expound: https://youtu.be/aogsJ4t4aBE?t=202

(INTJ) This is such a great, well-thought out, well-constructed argument. However, it was prepared ahead of time. Its basically the difference between a Ni formed argument, and a Ne formed one. Ni is about creating a bulletproof idea ahead of time. Ne is about reacting to each hole shot through their argument as they come.I do not know many ENTJs personally, so this will be on my observations of more public figures (podcasters, youtubers, etc.)

Their argument is in accordance to whatever their long-term goal of the conversation is. The goals might be as simple as convincing someone of a truth, or a longer term goal that extends outside of the realm of this single conversation. They have a paramount goal going into the discussion, and will let auxiliary stances/biases/principles slide if it is not apart of the the conversational goal they are pursuing. Avoiding pointless disagreement that are not part of "the path" to the other person understanding the thesis. They will especially let their ego/emotional biases go and attempt to remain most respectful and professional in favor of achieving that goal. Their ability to not react emotionally can be their best tool in convincing auxiliary spectators to side with them... always giving the appearance of being entirely logical.

They know their truth, and want to garner support from others in the cooperative pursuit of that truth.

Does that sound about accurate for you?MIS-TYPED! MIS-TYPED! REEEEEEEEEEE!

(jokes of course)Agreed. I feel like INTPs are more "passive debaters" than ENTP.

If you attack them, you better make sure your attack is entirely logical or they will let you know. I also think INTPs often like to respond with a question. That question will often freeze you and make you have to deal with that hypothetical devils advocate, or will lead you to the conclusion of "okay, yeah, I'm wrong".

ENTPs are more of "bullys" in debates than INTPs. It depends on if the audience values logic/truth (INTP) or charismatic presentation and comedic methodology (ENTP).

If INTP is allowed to have equal time speaking without being talked over, then INTPs are good debaters. However, to dumb audiences who are easily emotionally manipulated, they can "lose" to many extroverted types.

I also think that INTPs are so open-minded and willing to dissect every hypothetical, that they are more likely to admit "I don't know" or admit the other person is right, than some other types. ENTP are often to stubborn to admit they lost a debate... while the INTP is just glad that a misunderstanding was cleared up and everyone learned the truth to add to their knowledge-base.

Catch my drift?I agree with much of what you said, but I didn't explain myself in a few spots. Again, this is based on INTPs and ENTPs I know personally... results may vary.

&gt;It all comes down to what it means to "win a debate". We all see our political scenes and shit, being logical and factually right doesn't necessarily get you the most points in a debate, because not everyone is a Ti.

100% agree, that is exactly what I was implying.

&gt;I think that's just straight up wrong. The open-mindedness function and willingness to analyze any new information is Ne more than anything.

Now this is the part where we disagree, and I owe a more in depth explanation. I agree that ENTPs are more open-minded outside the context of a debate (and outside the context of a conversation with Fe group pressures as well) I could rant about that for hours. However, *inside a debate*, ENTP's Ne is focused on the variety of ways to rip apart the argument and what types of arguments they can make for whatever perspective they are arguing (regardless of how much they even care about that side of the debate). Their **main** focus isn't finding logical truth (Ti) it is exploring the art of debate (Ne).

For example... the paramount angle your mind might jump to in response is "how can I refute this?". Even in response to the observation I just made (in the sentence before this one), you might be searching for the most poignant way to say that "you are implying that by disagreeing with you, you are right". However layers deep I go with my reactive predictions, you are are ready to refute it on that level... and by me making THAT observation, you are set back to a ground-level debate in which you might attack argument construct as a whole or make a personal attack about how scatterbrained this clusterfuck of a paragraph is.

Excuse the above paragraph, but that is always the predictable pattern of arguments I subconsciously predict when talking with the ENTPs I know. If you predict the ENTP's argument structure, they quickly formulate a new one continually to avoid being predictable (ironically in a fairly predictable pattern). Eventually attacking "what is the reason for these predictions, it is unrelated to the logic or validity of the argument" or a personal attack "look how pretentious you are being about this argument, its pathetic".

Again though... every type has their strengths and weaknesses. To imply that ENTPs are better than INTPs in every way, is incorrect. INTPs are more sound logicians, ENTPs are more sound conveyers and provokers of logic. They have slightly different motivations, and slightly different goals. In no way am I implying "all ENTPs are stubborn and don't care about the logic/truth, they just care about arguing" however I AM implying that INTPs care about logic/truth MORE.

&gt;That impression might mostly come from the fact that ENTPs enjoy "arguing" more, so they will insist more even if they know they're right, so that his opponent understands and accepts it? Or maybe it's because you've never proved any ENTP wrong :D

Agree. And I have, and they get extremely childish and go into personal attacks so they can feel like they "won" the argument. They don't care about who is right, just that their ego "won" the debate.

&gt;Either way, ENTPs is probably the most skeptical type

I agree they are the most skeptical type. I do not agree that skeptical is the opposite of stubborn. If you refuse to believe everything you're ever told, that is the definition of stubborn. I know ENTPs don't do that, but I am using a hyperbole to show that they are not universally antonyms.

To use a familiar example of ENTP stubbornness... ENTPs are the most likely to write-off MBTI and be argumentative about it before fully understanding all of the facets of it. They also have a very strong opposition to people being put into boxes and see it as an attack on individuality. Obviously this doesn't apply to the ENTPs who have accepted it, but of the 3 ENTPs I know, all of them are stubbornly skeptical about MBTI, and even refuse to acknowledge they are ENTP. They all basically think that "if MBTI is true, I am INFJ". Its really weird how they separately all came to that same conclusion.

Sorry for the long post. I hope you are able to read every word and understand it despite my word vomit. Have an upvote :)Bump, set, spike.Ah yes, the *classic* ENFP quote rings true.

"When in doubt, brag about your high IQ, high emotional intelligence, and being physically active. In addition, brag about your hobbies ranging from debates, science, philosophy, art, reflection, writing, hiking, riding bikes, to sex."

Such a touching quote :^)

Joking aside... yes I understand you. However, I'm always laughing at everything... so my response to people saying something ridiculous is to just laugh. Life is too silly not to laugh. With how dark and dreary life can be... people choose to take comparatively funny things so seriously.While I agree with "some courses", the fields as a whole are left-leaning socially because that is how the world works. Restricting the rights of sects of the population is against everything social sciences understands. To "not agree", means you will be on the wrong side of history.

But yes, the "cucumber is a gender" bullshit is bizarre brainwashing.I agree with everything you said besides Hilary being an INTJ. I don't think that is definitively true.

Not sure why you are getting downvotes... a very reasonable comment aside from that. Alt-right is predicated on emotional thinking (fear, for example). Same with the "revenge on white men" mentality that the regressive left has.Te is more results based. It will forego the "little battles" in favor of the greater picture. It will make compromises if it positively affects the final outcome.

Ti = everything must be logical

Te = everything must go towards meeting the goal

...in a roundabout way.You finished writing this comment. Good job.INFPs think they're all dumb.

\#conjectureFrom my experience and observations, ENTPs hate it. I know there are some ENTPs on here who like MBTI, obviously you're an exception to the following.

A lot of Sensors I know see it as a neat little thing they look at once, and forget about. But ENTPs get outright offended by it.

1) They don't learn enough about it and think its outright psuedo-science.

2) They mis-type themselves completely (often INFJ/INFP for some reason, which is weird). They seem to always think extrovert means they can't be anti-social and hate every other human.

3) They have the "I don't really like putting people in a box. I think people are unique" conundrum already mentioned in this thread.

4) They just like playing devils advocate with everything, looking down on everything, disproving everything, etc. MBTI is just another target for them to shoot down.

Oh well... their more intellectual cousins the INTP enjoy it just fine. ;)ENTPs fit into the latter category from my experience.&gt;The MBTI community is filled with a lot of immature

Its funny... the ISFJs I know are the ones who get most offended by my sense of humor. Maybe you need to just lighten up and realize how tongue-in-cheek people can be?

&gt;know-it-alls

MAD BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AN N-TYPE MASTER RACE LIKE US? HAHAHA S-TYPE PLEBIAN.

(example of aforementioned humor that you will now be upset by and look down on me for making)

If maturity and proper etiquette is what you desire, may I suggest a tea-party, a book club, or a banquet hall gala?I agree with you... I would say that falls into the category of "stereotypes" though. While ISTPs like Kobe and Michael Jordan are more inclined to "be the best" at their sport... someone like Dirk Nowitski (INFP) can still form a passionate bond with the sport helped by his mentor relationship with a man in Germany (Fi) and win in a different way. Rather than being most athletic and alpha-male on the court, he embraces his unique outside the box technique (Ne). He has his own fadeaway jump form he has practiced and perfected through hard work (Si and Te). Name another 7'1 guy who is as comfortable shooting 15 footers as Dirk.

That being said...

&gt;The only thing stopping you is yourself

Is the most ESTP advice ever./r/INFP is the second most active MBTI sub behind INTP, I believe.I'm embarrassed you are an INFJ as well.

(jokes)It's a bit skewed though because INFPs are absolute pussies and for some reason feel the need to lurk, because they don't want their feelings hurt by anonymous strangers disagreeing with them.

INFP sub-reddit is absolute shit anyways. I dare you to browse it.

Its basically just a suicide hotline sub-reddit, and people feeding into each other's depressing. Its like a depression Cold War. Constant escalation.In a Fightclub "going to support group meetings that aren't applicable to you" sort of way? Or in a "I have depression so it helps me cope and relate" sort of way? Be careful with the latter. Depression breeds depression. Don't engulf yourself in that stuff too much.Enjoy your diabetes.You forgot a word. https://youtu.be/N8vaJaFCFYA?t=863[Bulls fan here]

Yep. Explains a lot for me as well. I still stand by, the 2011 Finals series was the greatest individual basketball performance I've seen in my life. No disrespect to everyone around him... but Dirk nearly won that series by himself. Its funny how Dirk is able to win with the team he had (again, no disrespect, but come on...) yet Lebron was never able to win without superstars beside him. Dirk is never talked about in the same light Lebron is because he isn't as flashy and athletic of a player.

Him and Marc Cuban's man crush is adorable too.&gt;I like Lebron

How can you like him? He's so unlikeable. Everything about him besides his play is so annoying. Hes a flopping, complaining, betraying, copycat, etc. Gets even crazier treatment from the refs than MJ ever got.

You should watch the Bulls series tomorrow. Help me root for my boys!Same, that's why I go on INTP and INTJ.

INFP, the people aren't so likeable IN THAT CONTEXT. I don't think an INFP circlejerk is the right place for an INFP. INFPs are better at complimenting other types, rather than working in a giant horde of themselves.And Fi-Ne applies an emotional/sentimental attachment to the investment. Names it, gives it a personality. Personifying the investment in a way where you never want to let it go because it meant something really important to you and represents that part of your life.

/sKeep in mind that INxx types make up a majority of the online MBTI community despite being a small minority of the types. You're basically judging a self-selecting biased sample-set as being incorrect. INxx types in general are also rather reclusive and keep smaller friend groups. However, they are more comfortable typing and interacting with people online in text. This would further explain the extreme discrepancy between online and offline commonality of types.

Of course there is plenty of mis-typings, but the internet is a global community. There are tons of INFJs in the world, even if they are proportionally rare. INFJs are pre-disposed towards engaging in MBTI discussion. It is quite possible that there is more INFJs discussing MBTI online than there is ISFJs despite being at least 10x less common.

**TL;DR** INFJs are more **concentrated** online than offline. Yes there are plenty of mis-typings... don't let mistyped people get to you. Just troll them instead. I know this is broad stereotyping... but trust me when I say this:

From my experience... People who can't figure out their type yet are obsessed with MBTI are usually ENTP. It is a combination of inflated ego, lack of self-awareness, lack of being able to look at self-objectively, confusing anti-social with introversion. Tons of different factors.

Its quite hilarious. I know the most ENTP ass ENTP ever, yet they think they are INFJ or INFP. I've also seen this on /r/MBTI 100s of times. ENTPs tend to see themselves as NFJ for whatever reason.

INTJ friends know they are INTJ. INTP friends know they are INTP. INFP friends know they are INFP. ENFJ, ENFP, etc. know what they are. ENTPs are always the ones have a complete inability to comprehend their own type objectively.

Its like some weird combination of Ne-dom with a very weak Fi. They see themselves as a Rorschach blob.Hold on a second. Are you implying that that MBTI community is a random and unbiased sample size? Especially when there is a direct correlation between type and interest in MBTI?

ESTJ are the most common type in the world, yet; only 786 users: https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/

INTP is far less common, yet; 32,775 users: https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/

&gt;but finding Ni types is like finding a needle in a haystack

INTJ and INFJs are fairly reclusive. To suggest that "I'm not meeting them, so they must not exist" is having your statistics ignore that the stats being studied involve their own sets of human behavior. Analogy: If one of the MBTI types was always 100% alcoholic and you never went to bars, of course you wouldn't run into any of that type. Unless you start breaking into people's bedrooms, its going to be harder to find INTJ/INFJs than it is finding ENFPs/ESFPs.

On top of that, I have met so many ENFJs. I know 3 ENFJ males (rarer than female) alone. And I don't know that many people XD

You are out of your mind if you think people choosing to engage in an online community isn't a biased sample set. Its also crazy to analyze stats of people you are meeting in person while completely neglecting the personal differences of how those people might live their life.This specific study has a lot of anomalies in it that make me question their methodology of acquiring an unbiased sample pool.

According to this study there is twice as many Canadian French ISTJ females as there are ISFJ females.

We know there are gender correlation between F and T from every other study. ISFJ is by far one of the most prevalent among females.

There are so many things about this study's results that are absolutely head-scratching compared to every other MBTI study. I would not cite this as your main source of MBTI type distribution any longer.Aka overvaluing anecdotes.&gt; I'm saying the people I meet in my day to day life are an unbiased sample.

And I am saying it is certainly NOT an unbiased pool. Again you are dealing with DIFFERENT PERSONALITY TYPES. By definition their tendencies are different and that means your chances of having a meaningful interaction with the different types all vary.

&gt;INTJ and INFJs are fairly reclusive. To suggest that "I'm not meeting them, so they must not exist" is having your statistics ignore that the stats being studied involve their own sets of human behavior.

Hence why I said this^

&gt;As a Computer Science major, I spend a lot of time around introverts

Mainly INTPs.

&gt;I love me a good party and meeting people is great

Most INxx's I know hate parties. Anecdotal of course, but it is echoed by much of the MBTI community online as well.

Wanna know what me and my INxx friends do in our free time? We sit on the computer and play games/talk with each other. Of the 10 of us (all INTJ, INFP, INTP) two of us goto parties with any consistency. One of them exclusively goes to his own frat's parties. One of them exclusively goes to underground electronic music events (not mainstream "EDM").

Believe me when I say, you do not have an equal chance of meeting us as you do our ISFJ friend. We keep a very tight-knit group, the ISFJ is constantly meeting and hanging out with new people.Great breakdown. Agree with the SJ vs. NJ analysis.Embrace your hidden Ne through the vector of your supperior Fi! **Embrace it I say! EMBRACE IT!**Bonus round: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLA7AlnDftEI never said that... but has yours been awaken to the extent that that you are on the street of NYC in a rainbow one-sie screaming at inanimate objects? Or making bird/chicken sounds loudly at an inanimate object?

Ne always has potential to be more absurd than it isPrecisely why I said:

&gt; confusing anti-social with introversion

That is a common misconception among people new to MBTI. You were experiencing the inverse of that dilemma.

I'm not trying to suggest "if you don't know your type, you are definitely ENTP"... however, they seem to be the type most prone to continual confusion on type.&gt;This isn't necessarily a personality aspect, but lately whenever I've browsed /r/INFP I've noticed that I can no longer relate to a lot of people's submissions.

/r/INFP is shit. Case closed. Its like a meme parody of INFPs. Aka its a bunch of depressed other types (and INFPs) doing a stereotype impersonation mimicking what they think an INFP should act like.

Its one step away from being a creepy anime board of that saccharine Boxxxy pretend cutesey shit alongside the dark misunderstood anime sword wielder with crazy hair who stares at the ground and talks in soliloquies.

Just because that sub is shit doesn't mean you are or are not an INFP.Welcome to my whole life with my dad.I get along with pretty much every INTP wonderfully.

INFJs always seem to hate me though. I pry too deep and they get scared that I predict things about them before they are ready and willing to present it to me. My ability to read people scares them, so they retreat. It makes sense since they like their emotional privacy.

People say INTPs are out of touch with their emotions... nah, its INFJs. They are like actors who would rather put on a show than present the whole truth.

Fi = using appearance and interaction with the world as an expression of self

Fe= using appearance and interaction with the world as a TOOL for community oriented goals

Or as I described it with the following:

&gt;They aren't out of touch with their emotions... but their external presentation is.

&gt;Their appearance is a tool rather than an expression.


INTPs however, are ready and willing to be truthful about their feelings if approached correctly.

Me + INFJ in a room would be: me trying to have a productive/meaningful conversation while I try to learn about them and then the INFJ going silent after 10-30 minutes because I tried to learn too much about them too quickly. Go figure.

*EDIT: Reworded the post. I wrote it in 1 minute and people are dissecting it like its my manifesto on INFJs, haha*INFP + INTP is my favorite. Communicating on the same wavelength from different perspectives. You get a lot of mutual conversations rather than heated debates.

...obviously as long as the INTP and INFP aren't illogical.

Runner up is probably INTP subtly fucking with (see: trolling) an extrovert like ESTJ or ESFP without them realizing. I've seen it happen too many times and its great.Tell that to all the INTPs and INFPs I have wonderful conversations with.They seem to always have a specific bigotry too. I have never met (personal anecdote of course) an INFJ who is universally loving. They need to have a scapegoat of minorities (trans, gays, Mexicans, Jews, blacks, etc.) to pin the ills of society on. And they don't see it as strange or unjustified. Its very creepy to me.

I challenge their beliefs when they start going on their hateful tirades... probably why they dislike me.

I also love when they try to act like they abide by logic and evidence-based discussion, but they are highly religious. The ultimate hypocrisy.

&gt;INFJs aren't out of touch with their emotions

They aren't out of touch with their emotions... but their external presentation is. You will notice a lot of male INFJs will compensate their masculinity with weightlifting, tattoos and pitbulls. They go out of their way to show how masculine they are despite being emotional nice guys.

Their appearance is a tool rather than an expression.&gt;However, this kind of judgement is thoughtless bullshit, indicating someone who can't get far enough outside of their judgements to understand differences in information processing.

Bad wording on my part... I think I described it better in the replies.

Fi = using appearance and interaction with the world as an expression of self

Fe= using appearance and interaction with the world as a TOOL for community oriented goals

Or as I described it with the following:

&gt;They aren't out of touch with their emotions... but their external presentation is.

&gt;Their appearance is a tool rather than an expression.

I think that sums it up pretty well.

&gt;There's really no good way to have a meaningful conversation with someone who takes this approach, in my INFJ perspective.

I was just summing up an array of personal experiences with a cheap goading sentence, don't take it so seriously. That is another disconnect, playful/humorist approach of INFP doesn't mend well with INFJs.

&gt;But there is an awesome solution here! You stay away from people who you don't understand and yet judge negatively based on your own self, have conversations with other people, INFJs you might otherwise impose yourself on don't have to bother with you, and everyone's happy.

I don't censor myself, nor do I censor others. Open communication is key going forward. INTPs and INFPs I talk to understand this. INFJs seem to be well in favor of censorship and community compartmentalization. I am very kind and well-mannered in person. You're making a lot of judgements from a Reddit post I wrote in about a couple minutes. Putting up walls as you are suggesting is exactly how ignorance and prejudices are formed. That mentality you just presented is probably why so many INFJs are bigoted.&gt; I also don't see why being religious would mean hypocrisy.

In regards to logic and evidence-based discussion. By definition, religion is on "faith", the antithesis of evidence and logic. To say religion is logical and evidence based is an oxymoron.

&gt;Well my mum is an INFJ and I can tell you that healthy INFJs who don't hate a certain group of people do exist. On the contrary really, for which their Fe is responsible I suppose.

I know both INFJs and ENFJs that are racist or transphobic, etc. Not "oh you said a bad word" political correctness whistle blowing, but actually have a hatred towards a group.

Their Fe says "everyone would be a peaceful community together if we excluded Muslims from our community". That sort of thing.&gt;I didn't say religion is logical

I didn't mean to suggest you supported that sentiment, I was just clarifying my point.

&gt;but that only because someone is religious doesn't mean he can't be logical in any other field they are talking about.

The very basis upon which one's reality is formed is fictitious and relies upon a book written by man being wholly accurate. Keep in mind this book was re-written and re-translated numerous times, each with clear political agendas and goals in mind. If that is their bedrock for the rest of their beliefs and discussions, then yes, it trickles into the rest of their beliefs. I think you are downplaying how important religious beliefs are to people.

I am agnostic not atheist... any thing beyond life is possible, but to suggest that your belief is any more correct than another because its in a really old book is absurd. Especially when the religious followers don't follow the sentiments of their religious texts, only the laws.

How many capitalist Christians do you know vs. communist Christians? Do you think Jesus was about collectivism, and helping the poor or capitalist business practices and people proving themselves through hard labor? Hypocrisy.&gt;Weightlifting, and working out all of your muscles is a nice activity to do, regardless of your type

I agree. I have just noticed a lot of INFJs gravitate towards that sort of masculine embrace.

Especially musicians you will often see it. Henry Rollins and Tupac come to mind. Tupac might be ENFJ but it still applies... he is a man who did ballet as a teen. Yet when he grew up he put on the tough thug persona to help get his message across to the world of a masculine thug culture.

He uses his persona and presentation as a tool.

&gt;a great antidote against the "crazy entitled american left liberal" that seems to plague too many people these days

Yeah, sadly the party elites are the ones who have created that illusion. They have abandoned the economic policy that made them popular with hard working blue collar folks. If they embraced themselves as the labor/worker party they used to be, they would win every election until Republicans adapted. However, corporate money is where both parties loyalties lie.I hope you realize how pretentious, self-absorbed and self-centered you sound in this post. Its like a delicious humorous ball of irony given the sentiment you are *apparently* trying to convey.See, there is the type of playful goading and sarcasm I am talking about. Embrace it! Use it for good! It is MY GIFT TO YOU.[Build bridges not walls maaaaaaaan.](http://img.costumecraze.com/images/vendors/forum/65363-Black-Hippie-Dude-Wig-With-Headband-large.jpg)

Nah, joking aside though I appreciate you having this open dialogue with me rather than disconnecting and retreating. I really do.

You've helped open my eyes a bit to the disconnect. Its just very hard to interact with INFJs because I have to act like a completely different person or they get offended which is the opposite of most of my interactions. I can be myself around INTJs, INTPs, INFPs, and my version of empathy/compassion **helps** them and is seen as a positive. "Being myself" has a positive impact on most people I interact with, so that is what I attempt to do to help others.

Yet when that is applied to INFJs they recoil in horror. INFJs prefer sympathetic acts over empathetic words. [I think you should watch this video as it REALLY underscores the INFP/INFJ disconnect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw)

"Ya want a sandwhich?" is laughed at in this context of the presentation because it is not empathy, its sympathy. However, in the context of poor people who need sandwhiches, sympathy is the correct frame of mind to tackle the problem with. Neither Fi or Fe is better, they need to coexist (and most importantly work together) to build a better future.

You might see George Orwell's 1984 as pointless because it doesn't solve anything, it only points hypothetical issues out... but the first step to solving a problem is conveying and creating a collective mass empathy for a problem. George Orwell did precisely that.

All I'm trying to say, is try not to get on a high-horse about INFJs vs. INFPs because you are missing the point of them having different types of impacts on society, both of which are important. Fe is results-based, Fi is idea-based. Both have meaningful impacts on the world, one is just more tangible and directly observable.

All the songs INFPs have written have kept me and my friends from suicide (Fi and Fe types alike). This is not something you can statistically track... but our achievements later on in life would not have happened if not for the emotional empathy of their songs. That is Fi having an impossible to prove impact on society.

**Hopefully I conveyed my thoughts in a respectful and clear manner. If I didn't let me know where and how I can improve. I don't want to cause any harm.**&gt;In my limited observation, it seems like online INFJs have a tendency to come to some conclusion far sooner than a type like INTP would be inclined or even think credible. Is there some kind of internal awkwardness for INFJs if they reserve judgment or just accept the state of undecidedness?

&gt;As an INTP, sometimes I literally consider more than 10 ways to convey the same idea, but obviously only one comes out. And often that variant is the one that ends up offending an INFJ due to some ambiguity or the self-refinement the writing has gone through where I lose track of the fact that everyone doesn't have the same objectiveness/openness as INTPs.

This conveys some of my thoughts on the topic perfectly. INTPs do such a great job describing analysis of interactions.

The indecision of Ne makes one really chew on information and interactions before making judgements. I respect someone who is willing to change their stances as facts come to light rather than holding a vendetta. No one is perfect, so do your due diligence in combing over new stimuli and information to constantly refine your views. Its important! Those wholly confident in their convictions will be wrong a percentage of the time. The acts of those who are confidently incorrect are the cause of much of the worlds issues.

In a rapidly changing world, malleable, open-minds will be key to keeping society afloat. Those who shut down because they are "offended" by conversation and discourse will do what they can to censor the conversations of others. Without open discourse, a floodgate of issues will follow.&gt;Of course, "losing" this Minesweeper game is like offending an INFP/INFJ, which, for someone as socially oblivious as an INTP, it is ridiculously easy to do

As an INFP, I feel the exact same way when dealing with INFJs. I've never had any problems with INFP, INTP, INTJs... but INFJs its exactly as you describe: minesweeper.

My INTP friends and I sarcastically jab at each other because it means absolutely nothing. Humor is what brings us together. Yet INFJs have this disdain for humor like no other. Its weird because the ENFJs I know are some of the funniest people ever.God I love INTPs.

Its just fact that INTPs are the superior type and all others should bow down.

Edit: No bamboozle.Ne is just filling in the gaps of things that don't need to be expounded on. Understood without needing to be said.

Ne feeding off Ne is like a series of "you just inspired this slightly related idea" in a constant feedback loop. To outside observers it can sound like complete non-sense... to the people in it, it is an engaging and stimulating exchange of ideas.I was being genuine. INTPs are my favorite type. Looking back I understand how that comment could be interpreted as sarcastic, but it really wasn't.

&gt;so that I can fully interact with them, without having to police my thoughts and my words more than usual

Loved that line.

&gt;Once you have lost enough arguments and discussions with yourself, and once you're confortable with the possibility of being wrong or of not knowing enough, you get to be more humble toward others

Love this line as well.A logical world is an empathetic world. INTPs are logically inclined towards an empathetic system. INFPs are empathetically inclined towards a logical system.

Both types are truth seekers. Logical truth, and moral truth. A logical world is a moral world and vice versa.

They both like outside the norm artistic expression, that of which can't exist in a Fe conformist/Te efficiency-minded society. Ti-Ne and Fi-Ne are outcasts in a Si/Fe/Te reality.Do you know any other INFJs? Do they complain about this?

Are you more paranoid and secretive with online conversations than in person? Strangers/new people vs. old friends? etc.&gt;is whether or not this individual feels entitled to people giving her/him personal attention and energy, or whether or not s/he understands and respects boundaries and choices not to do that

I respect privacy and personal space more than anyone. I am actually trying to learn to be more proactive in interacting with people in time of need.

You're confusing Fi making INFPs care about **individuals** with this idea that Fi making INFPs care about **themselves** as individuals first and foremost, which just isn't true. Every INFP I know bends over backwards to help others at the detriment of themselves. Its certainly not an ego or bragging thing either. I've done so many charitable acts in which I haven't even told my closest friends nor do I virtue signal to others. Meanwhile I know both ENFPs and ENFJs who constantly put their charitable/selfless acts on display. Its not a Fi/Fe thing to be selfish/egotistical.

INFPs are driven by empathy for others... but again we are not tangible results based like Te and Fe types... we are idea, moral filter types. While INTPs seek their logical truths, INFPs are also truth seekers. We seek moral/emotional/personal truths. Authenticity. We care about the individual needs of those we empathize with rather than a one size fits all for wide swaths of people.

Another thing to keep in mind is that INTP and INFPs are very dynamic types. Lots of development and personal change happens for those types in their developmental years and into adulthood. We are constantly refining our world views. So don't give up on an INFP you disagree with, just gently guide them through an open minded conversation. The thing I've found I hate most about INFJs as apposed to INTPs, is how closed minded they are. There is no INFJs entertaining theoretical propositions ego-less, they have a goal in the conversation. I'm not saying that is a fault of INFJs, its just a trait of INTP/INFPs that makes me feel completely comfortable to "discuss" rather than "debate".

Again with the dynamics of the types. I know INTPs and INFPs who were racist when they were young, but by the time they hit 18 they were completely changed. Because there is no "Ni" nucleus anchoring their ideas, they can have very fluid and evolving views without feeling like it completely turned their world upside down.Here is what I mean... do you respect someone more who seeks the perfect morals, or someone who acts on their morals in its current state? Someone who theorizes about a hypothetical foodbank, or someone who works at the foodbank every week?

That seems to be how INFJs view Fi vs. Fe.That doesn't make sense at all. That would mean we are claiming INFJs are the only type to have prejudices and society would be better without them. Which is not at all what I am saying.

Again... I am not saying every INFJ is like that, just the ones I have met. I mean go look at what Billy Corgan thinks of trans people. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=devi+ever+billy+corgan&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web

There is a public anecdote. Again, anecdotes aren't empirical, I am just discussing my observations.

As /u/Aurarus said:

&gt;Or moral oppressors, like terrorists (understandably), Trump supporters, Republicans, racists, homophobes, etc.

They are very much about scapegoatism rather than reforming the individuals.Wat.

Meeting them online mostly. Self proclaimed INFJs who act and communicate like INFJs. One was against trans, one was against muslims, one was against gays, one pinned all of societys ills on "illegal immigrants". Always a scapegoat.Now the "was that sarcasm" tables have been turned on me! ;)&gt;Prying is something you shouldnt do without people's permission.

The conversation IS the permission. You can vocalize "I'm not comfortable answering that" without just running away and shutting down completely.

&gt;Think about it, I don't think you'll like if someone was trying to pry into your Fi world without your permission. 

I don't like invasions of privacy (spying), but in a conversation I am pretty much an open book.

&gt;My interaction with infps have been great, no problem.

I've had two in person interactions with INFJs. One was a nice classmate we would share thoughts together... but it was a very shallow relationship all things considered. She wouldn't open up a ton.

The other kept trying to get me to hang out with her, and then one of the times she just completely shut down and avoided me and I haven't seen her since.

Seems like the deeper a relationship I have with an INFJ the more scared they get of me wanting to know more about them.Empathy can be what motivates you to create a fair world. Again, we are discussing semantics but if you really want me to reword it...

Logical systems are fair systems, empathetic systems are fair systems. Both Ti and Fi are in pursuit of fair systems. Catch my drift?I was mostly just trying to have fun with the resolute of a dead-end conversation once they started taking things too personally. Humor is my shield against ignorance and my weapon against prejudice ;)

But yes, I often have to be the one looking like a bad guy to truly help friends. No one else has the balls to do it, so I get disliked for improving someones well-being. Yet if you bring it up people claim you're some self-righteous asshole with martyr syndrome. Ya can't win, can ya? Cest la vie.Now you got it on LOCK ;)Glad to hear :)Well as all INFPs know, the quick easy way to solve any problem is always suicide ;)

Hard way is self-discipline, self reflection, conscientiousness and habit forming.

I don't think its necessarily a negative trait to have, but if you use it too much it hurts yourself more than it helps them. Its an act that is selfless, let appears selfish to others. Its quite a paradox.

Really pick and choose your battles. The less you do it, the more selfish you are, yet the less selfish you appear; so just learn to be a bit more selfish and not help people as often. Really comb over the situation before determining if it is worth the risk.Precisely. An INTP and INFP would both seek to iterate on that system to adapt it to complex and unpredictable patterns of humanity.

The collaboration of the two balance each other out. Its illogical to have a cruel system, yet sometimes INTPs might not see the human consequences of their ideas. Vice versa, you can come up with a empathetic system that has logical loopholes in it. INTPs are great at finding and filling those logical fallacies.

Logic and empathy are two sides of the same coin in my mind.

INTPs and INFPs are like two separate people pushing an accordion together. They both want to compress the accordion completely, but it requires coordination and equal force to reach that common ground right in the center. Really weird and abstract analogy, but it illustrates what I'm getting at. Coming from the opposite perspective to find that sweet spot in the middle.&gt; I read your statement and my response is that I II don't know about other INFJs, this is me in particular) don't want to guide a friend or lover through anything. I want a peer with whom to engage in reciprocal and mutual dialogue.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Meaning - I want to learn with people I choose to engage in dialogue in a way that isn't patronizing on either side. There is a flow, a rhythm, to such a connection. If it were a dance, it might be one in which there is no lead or one in which we switch off as needed over time with a mutual sensitivity to how and when.

That is exactly what I was trying to convey honestly. When I talk with INTPs it is like this. When I talk with INFJs, it feels like I am getting a lecture on a "fact" of the world. The INFJ is refusing to adjust their world view in the context of the conversation. INTP conversations feel rather ego-less and just feels like two people exchanging information to get to the truth that neither side knows for sure (and more importantly neither act like they know for sure).

&gt;to guide them to a place that was healthier. She said that people don't organically want to change and face their issues directly and that I would need ot provide the impetus if I were to be in the kind of relationship I desire.

&gt;I was appalled by this view.

That is why INFPs make such good counselors/therapists for people. They are willing empathize and help you with your small problems. We are very sensitive and caring for the individual. In a world that viciously treats everyone as hard shelled "adults", you need someone who can open up their hard shell, so you can open up yours. That is the basis of empathy, two people connecting on exposing their weaknesses, failures, pain, etc. Two people sharing their times of weakness is what helps people feel less alone in their situation and feel the will to dig themselves out of the hole.

A pattern you keep coming back to is that you seem to think INFPs don't respect peoples' **autonomy**. But that couldn't be further from the truth. The basis of Fi is authenticity and finding out what that person's personal autonomic drive is. I've found so often people going through life denying themselves their dream and giving up on using their unique talents to change the world. My idea of helping someone is to be the catalyst for their natural personal growth. When I see someone has a unique talent or perspective, I encourage them to pursue it further. I identify their strengths and hold a mirror to those strengths.

You seem to be conflating this as "INFPs walk up to fish and tell them they can breathe oxygen", or that we are condescendingly talk down to people try to "fix" them in our image. We see the potential in people that others don't, so we tell them to focus their energy and time into that unique trait rather than it getting wasted and them filling a job ANYONE could do (essentially wasting their individual impact on the world).

Hopefully that illustrates it better.

&gt;I'm going to say that it is healthiest for us to connect with true peers who are utterly self-motivated and self-guided in their actions of growing and learning.

But that's the thing. INTPs and INFPs aren't naturally self-motiated and self-guided. We are non-conformists who feel very alone in a Si-Fe-Te world. We are continual outcasts who have unique talents that don't fit into traditional career trends. When 99% of the world is telling you to act against what you know about yourself, sometimes that 1% of assurance and realization can make a world of difference and give you the strength to step out of line from your current life trajectory.

&gt;It seems to me that for them, the Ti-dom provides a sort of hardness and love of argument that my information processing stack does not provide for me. It seems to me that hitting up against Fi that needs to shift worldviews might be exhilarating for an INTP where it is draining/exhausting for me.

That is the thing though, its a mutual give and take. You're look it at it as a competitive debate of INTP pushing their views on INFP and vice versa, but it it is not, it is egoless. Its sharing, not debating. Its not a debate its more similar to a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic

The thing is INFP and INTPs are fine with grey areas and not settling on a conclusion, but rather using Ne to talk about all of the possible conclusions. We love the hypothetical. Conclusions are a sign of weakness almost. I guess the "debate" part is that we constantly disprove our own and each other's tentative Ne "conclusions" back and forth until we fine an equilibrium of truths related to the situation. To fully conclude in this context is to show non-humble pride almost? Maybe that is where the disconnect comes in? INFJs have conclusions, NPs have theories/hypotheticals?

Who knows...One hundred percent. Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan are a great comparison of INFP vs. INFJ. Especially down to the part where Cobain killed himself XDNo, in a direct real-time instant messaging context.[Not at all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith#Death) why [would](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake#Death) you [suggest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Curtis#Death) such [a thing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Cobain#Death)

;)

^^Hopefully ^^you ^^can ^^see ^^the ^^hyperlinked ^^text
Yep, my INFP friend and I do that constantly. Its actually more shocking when they finish a sentence and it wasn't the sentiment I was expecting. That is rarer than us knowing.

Its funny, just from the intonation of his first 0.1-2 words, I can pretty much tell what hes going to communicate, haha. Its hilarious.

Eventually we just degenerate into nodding and moaning in agreeance and switch topics because we realize we are already on the same page so there is nothing further to discuss.Your ego comes into play and you retreat. Precisely what I was talking about with INFJs.

&gt;but more and more it's feeling to me like we're just talking past each other

I don't get that feeling at all. I'm open minded and learning from you, you're closed minded and retreating from an exchange of ideas.

&gt;You seem to want to educate me about

You say you want this to be a mutual peer experience, yet you only want me to consume your ideas, and not vice versa. 

You need to realize how pretentious and closed minded you are if you want to continue your path of understanding. Peers teach each other. Cowards close their ears to new ideas.

Really look in the mirror at how egotistical and self centered your post is. "You aren't listening to ME and MY ideas". "You're trying to EDUCATE ME". "You don't want to learn from ME". "I hope MY intellect was able to guide you". Its all about talking down to someone while you are on a high horse of infallibility in your mind. You absolutely lie to yourself about wanting a "peer" experience, you don't want a give and take, you just want someone to agree with you.

You really have an inflated sense of self that disgusts me.Thanks for your response. Very informative and interesting. Thanks for the link too.

&gt;The adjusting (for INFJ) often happens in between conversations, rather than within the conversation.

This is a great point and is the most difficult part of being Ne is. When you are having a conversation with other NP types, they just understand. They follow everything I say, no need to restate anything or overly provide context or frame the next topic. I have to "adjust" to talk with other types. Your post explains those interactions very well, thank you.

&gt;You guys play with ideas on the outside and form conclusions on the inside. INFJs play with ideas on the inside and form conclusions on the outside. Maybe? (This is me trying to play with ideas on the outside.)

Interesting. I think that's a good call. Obviously NPs form ideas on the inside too, but I think *the refining process* requires outside communication. I do my best thinking alone in the shower, and exchanging ideas with INTP/INFPs. Where-as it seems INFJs form their conclusions in solitary and then present the idea as a whole complete final product for consumption? Meanwhile opening my partially finished ideas up for critique and iteration is the best process for me.

Also sorry, about some of this conversation with that TK person. Its pretty apparent to me they are a full blown clinical narcissist. I know they don't reflect other INFJs and have a specific personality disorder unrelated to MBTI. It makes open dialogue very hard when dealing with people like that.TK is clearly a narcissist. Read all of their posts in this thread. I said my piece, hopefully they can digest it and self-reflect. Doubt it... narcissism is pretty incurable.&gt;But if the initial conclusion is not completely disagreed with but rather built on or accepted with certain modifications, the INFJ might feel more comfortable letting the conversation partner into their inner perceiving world to play with these ideas together (and in real time). Which is kind of what I'm trying to do now. Ish.

Thanks for letting me in :)

&gt;I'm unclear as to why you think INxPs are more humble than INFJs?

I think indecision and open-mindedness are forms of humility/humbleness. To enter a conversation with a fully formed conclusion that can't be manipulated is a bit pompous don't you think? Its a form of pretentiousness to not dynamically consider other points of view.

&gt;Nope. INxJs are dominant perceivers. They seek closure in the external world but their internal world is malleable AF.

I guess that is the crux of the discussion then. INTP/INFPs play around in that indecisive external world. That is our playground. That is our sandbox. That is our test realm. Ne conversation is all about challenging the black and white and turning it all to grey.

What you're saying is the INFJs internal world is grey, and they act on the external world in a black and white manner, correct?

I can definitely see why that clashes so heavily. The INxP's words are like grey liquid being sprayed out of their mouth, while the INFJ is shooting black and white solid blocks out of their mouth. Rather than blocks colliding with with blocks (INFJ vs. INFJ) the blocks just kind of get wet while the gray liquid passes by the blocks (INFJ vs. INxP).

Sorry for the weirdest analogy ever. Hopefully it makes sense to you too.I'm just kind of confused why they are getting so upset over this conversation. It goes back to the "minesweeper" analogy the INTP in the thread made.When I say "ego", I was harkening back to the INTP/INFP conversation definition of ego.

When we have conversations its a dialectic not a debate. There is no egos or someone trying to "win"... it is purely an exchange of ideas. INFJs tend to always have an "ego" in this definition of the word. They almost have this resistance to being taught. They want to present their ideas full and uninterrupted. Any attempts at playing devils advocate/refinement with the idea is seen as an attack rather than a co-operational form of truth seeking. Its like "I put so much thought into this idea that if you claim its wrong, you're attacking me" or something like that? On the contrary if I present an idea to an INTP, they might point out some additional points, alternative perspectives or some minor flaws in it and I will go "oh I never thought of that, thanks!".

Hopefully that clears up what I am saying.

TL;DR INTP/INFP form of discussion is a co-operational "dialectic", but INFJ interprets it as a competitive/oppositional "debate" mentality.

Edit: some wordsYou're projecting a bit. INTP's Ti is often in search of ideas that create a better future for humanity (their Fe).

Plenty of selfless INTPs create systems for human innovation with no financial benefit. Look at GNU, Creative Commons, FOSS, Linux community in general. They use their Ti to logically fulfill a Fe world vision.

In no way am I implying INTPs are Fi. What I was stating is that often INFP and INTP gravitate towards the similar sentiments on how to fix society. Again a logical world is a fair world. A Fi world is a fair world. A Ne world is a free world. Both types are extremely socially libertarian in solving problems. They value autonomy and outside the box thinking. They identify problems and come up with ideas to solve them from different perspectives. If you average out and mix their perspectives together you get a fair and logical system.

&gt;and they start playing the devil's advocate for why that shit won't work.

And that is why they are great thinkers. They can continually critique an idea until it is solid. A Fi goal can be productively pummeled by Ti critique to form a fair system. Vice versa with a Ti idea being pummeled by Fi critique to form a fair syste.

For example an INTP might come up with a very inhuman system that would work flawlessly in concept... but they forget about the human element and how that would put a wrench in their plan. An INTP might support eugenics, but an INFP would point out that creating a program like that would set precedent and become a tool for a dishonest government to abuse for political reasons. INTP didn't consider the human element, INFP did. That sort of teamwork of ideas.&gt;I back off because they tend to get too wrapped up in their own feelings and it's awkward/ cringey/uncomfortable.

This is what I mean though. INFJs are afraid of vulnerability, and opening up. They think its uncomfortable. We want to know your own feelings, so we are making that vulnerable leap first, so you can feel comfortable to follow suit. We aren't doing it to be selfish or something, we are doing it so you can do it too. We are very curious about the individual we are talking with.

&gt;But it always ends with the INFP either ranting about nonsense or throwing flags that if I say the wrong thing they'll throw a tantrum, so not worth the trouble considering I, as an INFJ, like harmony. 

Rant with them! I'm curious though, have you ever actually had an INFP "tantrum" at you? How old were they at the time? Male or female?&gt; If someone rubs me wrong and I don't feel like I'll get anything out of it

I guess this is the difference. INFPs want to try to learn about people so they can help them and embrace their individuality. Its not like an ego thing of "this person NEEDS ME" or anything; its just its always nice to exchange personal moments and learn/teach with a peer.

&gt;Also, I dislike ranting unless there's something to be gained from it.

And that is why INFP and INTPs get along so well. They love to rant to share and learn things so both people come out of the conversation with a more refined view on [x topic]. There is no goal or agenda beyond *"knowledge"*.ENFPs? It depends on who and what topic. As long as its not a hot-button topic for them, then sure.

ENTPs however, often like interrupting and completely controlling the conversation. They would rather have an audience for a rant, and/or a competitor for a debate.

Its weird, despite having the same cognitive functions, the order of the stack REALLY changes what each function represents. While INTP's main priority is searching for Ti (logic) through Ne (hypothetical)... ENTP's like exploring Ne (debate) through Ti (logic based arguments).

To clarify: INTPs main goal is to find their logical truth on a topic through open minded Ne discovery. ENTPs main goal is to use their logical truth as a weapon to debate/argue. They use their malleable creativity to catapult their Ti spears at an opponent. I've seen ENTPs convince an audience that they were right while arguing something they know is wrong. They enjoy the art of debate more than the pursuit of textured logic. Hopefully that makes sense to you.

TL;DR not as much because ExNPs like exerting themselves more and being more domineering rather than give and taking in a conversation.Wooo! Vague stereotypes, here we go.

Daniel: ISTP

Jason: ENFJ - Very confident in this one.

Terry: ESTJ

Kyle: ENTJ?

Peyton: ESTP

Maybe your coach is ESTP too and sees himself in Peyton, I don't know.

Lemme know what you think.&gt; ISFJ: Didn’t get permission from mom
&gt; 
&gt; ISTJ: Didn’t get permission from wife
&gt; 
&gt; INTP: Didn’t get permission from waifu
&gt; 
&gt; ESTJ: Wasn’t allowed to bring work phone
&gt; 
&gt; ENTJ: Wasn’t allowed to bring interns
&gt; 
&gt; ISTP: Forgot to inform parole officer
&gt; 
&gt; ENFP: Forgot to go

These were my favorites, well done.True. I know plenty of ESTJs that are VERY fake though. Could be ESTJ...Two of the ENFJs I know are playful with great senses of humor. They are also "individualistic people persons". ENFJ sounds pretty spot on to me.

&gt;I could see Peyton being an immature FJ.

ISFJs are usually rather humble and reserved. Maybe an ESFJ is possible. I guess its for you to decide if they are Fe/Si or Se/Ti (or perhaps Te/Si, Se/Fi).I think INFP/INFJ + ENFP/ENFJ are confused more often than "Fi and Ni".I mean its sort of apples and oranges.

Ni can sort of imply is a confidence in your ideas/beliefs. Fi is a "being in touch with your inner-self". Fi is valuing individuals and individuality. Ni is not being dependent and being self-motivating.

I mean the above isn't entirely accurate, but a weird question gets a weird response.
/r/INFP is a cesspool; OP don't judge INFPs based off that sub. Like this guy said, lots of mistyped depressed people and other reasons why the place is crap.

Its like everything wrong with Reddit mixed with everything wrong with MBTI communities stirred in a pot and /r/INFP was born.

I tried to change it: https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/

Haven't browsed that terrible sub since then. /r/intp and /r/intj are way better subs.Exactly what I described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/

Haven't browsed the sub since.
Yeah, I thought I would try. There are plenty of good INFP forums... I'll leave /r/MBTIdepression-- I mean /r/INFP alone.I was banned from /r/infj XD

I'll check /r/ISFP out though.True.. however the "Hit or miss" is better than the "miss or miss" content on /r/INFP.

INTP/INTJs will also touch on subjects that aren't directly related to MBTI. INFP is mainly just "hey iz dis an INFP thing or no?" and depression threads and "omg look at this cute webcomic repost".A parent who doesn't force religion or overly rigid structure on their children.&gt;existence

So you're like a Rick and Morty fan but for the bible?I would say don't cut yourself on it, but that's too predictable. -puts sunglasses on-You're not giving /r/INTP enough credit in relation to some other subs.

But if we are making the comparisons then /r/INFP is /r/im14andthisisdeepISFJs will let Nazis happen if it means avoid conflict though. ISFJs CONFIRMED NAZI ENABLERS.But the people you hate... oh, the people you hate. Constant petty revenge that they don't even know is happening to them."Traps are gay" - ConfuciousAs I'm sure you know, most people aren't very bright!Haha, no! I was joking that because they were trying to overcome the depression stereotype that they weren't allowed in the depression shanty-town known as /r/INFPhttps://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/4tn10w/i_think_it_is_time_for_a_change_on_rinfp_and_i/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpageYeah, that's ESTPs' and ESFPs' job!

I think what we've learned here are that the stereotypes are true for Se-primary, not Se-secondary.Genetics are Quaternary. MBTI describes the genetic makeup of a personality in which your "by nurture" experiences build upon.

The reason we can't prove MBTI is because we don't fully understand the human genome and what each part represents. Once we start pinning down "personality" genes, there will be some major breakthroughs in how we understand human behavior.Is there a stereotype that ESFPs always understand sarcasm?Everyone's so basic on that show though.DARE HE IS!

This his high quality OC, OP.YourMovieSucks - INTPInternet deprivation makes one do more interesting things.I think if we learned a valuable lesson here. No matter what your type is, most people have basic taste in music.

One of those people who thinks Hamilton is the pinnacle of art and obsesses over it. Or is super into bad musicals like Harry Potter The Musical and will have themed parties centered around it.

Or maybe one those people that form connections and communities over some super lame hobby or interest. Possibly one of those communities formed by a business that preys on housewives selling their overpriced products to other housewives.

Or one of those people who obsesses over centrist politics. The "third way" or "radical centrism" dorks. They think CNN is both infallible and unbiased (like there's such a thing). They pompously defend the millionaires they've never met as moral beacons and know every bit of political drama that goes on, but knows nothing about actual policy and political ideologies.Haha... only the third part is with disdain. My best friend had to deal with those types on a daily basis for years. The stories were maddening. The sad part is a lot of those people actually have a lot of power and influence despite not knowing what the fuck they are talking about.

The first two types are harmless. I honestly feel bad for the people victimized by those businesses that prey on peoples loneliness and urge to belong to a community.One of the greatest groups of all time. Check their albums out front to back.**This is a thread about stereotying, so obviously this doesn't universally apply. I'm friends with ISTJs. Please don't get mad because you are nothing like this. I understand.**

This is why I personally have problems with ISTJs. They are often "henchmen" of sorts. The type of people who will excuse/justify any of their own actions with "hey, I'm just doing my job" even if the thing they're doing is ultimately immoral.

An open-minded ISTJ with a moral compass is a good ISTJ. A close-minded or selfish ISTJ can be despicable. Often times they value the "duty" of their job/role over any other factors. They're great when they're working for a good cause. When they refuse to analyze the role they are playing in the grand scheme of things, they can contribute to the ills of society without a conscience.

They will also sometimes over-simplify things in ways that are convenient to their current situation or world view. Obviously the world isn't simple, so over simplifying things leads them to being stuck in their ways about certain topics.

One commonly held belief I've seen from ISTJs is that problems black Americans face are their own fault. Context, history, situation, uneven policing, etc. are all thrown out the window because ISTJs just want to look at the results. They will analyze the "effect" in cause and effect, and ignore the "cause" part. They don't want to analyze whats wrong with current the system, they want to analyze whats wrong with the people within the current system. They are about upholding the rules/system, not reforming it for the better.

Hopefully those are some good examples?&gt; also I'm not that familiar with the overall system in america

Then maybe your "hot take" needs a bit more time in the oven. The Civil Rights Act was only passed in 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964

That is EXTREMELY recent. My parents were alive for that. Do you really think a society can recover from systematic racism in one generation?

Keep in mind that US policies specifically preyed on racism following this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_drugs

This then accelerated with Reagan (1980-1988, and the following politicians followed in his footsteps), and the statistics speak for themselves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States

Our system is terrible at actually "reforming" people. We focus on punishment, rather than rehabilitation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism_in_the_United_States

Black man with a kid goes to prison. Kid grows up without a father for years. Father comes out of inhuman prison situations even more hardened, and without the tools or resources to turn his life around. Father resorts back to the only ways he has known how to make a living and goes back to prison. Son has a terrible springboard for the rest of his life, and is at a severe disadvantage compared to his peers. This situations worsened by in-equal policing/justice system. This story is way too common among black communities. If we actually cared, we would reform our prison system, but instead we focus on corporate profits and make our prisons WORSE with Private Prisons that rake in money on the basis of imprisoning people. Its disgusting and dystopian.

I'm not downvoting you, I'm giving you a chance to learn.Yep! COINTELPRO is sooooooooooooooooo fucked up. Not enough people know about it. When I tell people about this stuff they can't believe it.

The stuff they were doing to MLK (of all people) is ridiculous. Murdering civil rights leaders like Fred Hampton and de-panting him for an photo of his corpse. Despicable.

Side rant: This is part of the reason why it disgusts me Democrats have been jerking off the FBI/CIA and James Comey for the past year. These institutions have always been involved in anti-democratic practices. Keep in mind that surveillance capabilities have increased exponentially since the 60s. Surely things they are doing today are worse and more sophisticated.

We already know NSA and other agencies actually manipulate online discussion. Its not just about surveillance and investigation... it is manipulating the thoughts and discourse to alter the course of history.Exactly. I was about to say "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" too. That is such a toxic mentality, and perfectly describes the Democrats right now with the FBI, Russia, etc. You said everything better than I could have. Great points.

If you want some Youtube political commentators on the same wavelength as us check out [Secular Talk](https://www.youtube.com/user/SecularTalk/videos) and [Jimmy Dore Show.](https://www.youtube.com/user/TYTComedy). They can both get a bit outrageous (comedically speaking) at times, but their thought process is crystal clear logic. They are left wing but they call out Democrat bullshit just as often as they do right wing bullshit. Very principled people with integrity. Gotta love em!There could be a correlation, but we have no way of knowing. Your statement that more blacks are sensors is a bit unfounded.

I think you could claim more blacks **in the public eye** have been sensors. For example, a lot of cited MBTI figures for N types are philosophers, scientists, and thinkers of the past. These are roles that Afican Americans were barred from until more recently in history. Meanwhile blacks in America have been able to pursue sports (something more correlated with SP types) for a longer portion of history. However, the representation in the public eye of history is not necessarily representative of all humans.

Ultimately the only way of knowing is a number of studies with large data sets. I don't think I've seem any MBTI studies with a significant black population surveyed. It would be interesting to see if there are though. The gender discrepancy of MBTI is one of the most fascinating things about it and explains a lot of the perceived gender differences on average; while also explaining why gender stereotypes aren't universally true. Maybe there is something similar for race, but its impossible to say.I love INTJs, the ones I know are goofy and hilarious.He's a good speaker as far as **presenting himself** as intelligent and professional. But he will talk for 3 minutes straight and say nothing of substance. He is like a politician in that regard.

He will heavily imply something, and everyone will pick up on it (his fans and opponents alike) but he is purposely dog-whistle politics about it so he can say "Whoa, whoa, whoa I didn't say that!" when someone challenges him on it. Its one thing if you are exploring thought without an agenda, but he pushes an agenda and then claims he just "asking questions". Its very dishonest.

He's basically taken basic self-help rhetoric and turned it into a political following. Very strange.

Here is a good debate between the Peterson and Zizek ^(Kappa) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgIz49hbjto Yes, lots of far flung word play.

Also dark jokes and jokes about suicide.Yeah I love doing that!

Two concerning outcomes. The one you mentioned. Or everyone is outraged and doesn't understand that it was a joke.

I made a joke like that, and everyone was confused/outraged and one girl got it, defended me, and was laughing along. She was the one that got away... I should have asked her out right there and then :)

Damn though, you guys are breaking down INFP humor so well, in such detail.SP types are Beats. SJ types are Bose. NT are Sennheiser. NF are Audio Technica.

LolwutThat's weird because I know a ton of ENFPs who's actions are often inconsiderate of others. When they are actively making the decision, they will be nice to people, but when they are pursuing their own happiness, they often do it oblivious/uncaring to the consequences it has for others.This can apply to me as an INFP. I'm one of the best advice givers. But I don't do shit.

Clinical depression sucks, guys. Don't let anyone belittle it.The suicidal optimist.As long as it wasn't "scripted" I would actually watch this.A big hint is if the credits list writers. Check the credits/IMDB of your favorite reality shows and see for yourself.

I would like to know why you guessed xSTP though! The skateboarding and sports?PM me your Discord or Steam username!I think Offspring's lead singer is definitely an ISTP, and this song seems to be right up your alley: https://open.spotify.com/track/3M3gKehdtIR2krOZfkw2iKBernie is ENTJ. Many INFPs worked within his campaign for sure, but INFPs aren't leading revolutions.I am very sure of ENTJ.

He's definitely not an NP type. ENFPs are more likely to be very willing to ruffle feathers, and that can get in the way of politics. Bernie is all about Te results-based politics. He is more about fighting the big battles for tangible results, rather than taking every little tiny skirmish along the way. He's more effective, despite his "purist" supporters (NPs) having issue with him not fighting every little battle that comes along.

Bernie definitely leads with Te rather than Ni. Again, he is all about results based change, and is willing to do the work, even if it means working with people he doesn't like. INTJs don't have the patience for that sort of bureaucratic bullshit. Politics is too irrational and not predicated purely on ideas/logic for INTJs from my experience.Yeah that makes sense. Where is that excerpt from?&gt; I rarely get emotional at all in public but when it gets bad I come home and vent to people I trust and they can really hurt me when they tell me I’m overly sensitive.

Maybe you are surrounded by some negative people. Sometimes introverts will self-reflect and ask "whats wrong with ME?". However, sometimes you have to realize you environment/peers can be the problem. No one is perfect, and that applies to the people you come home to.

People are more influenced by those around them than we like to acknowledge. If you're surrounded by people who properly deal with their emotions, versus those who repress them; that can affect how you feel about your own emotions. If you come home to people who repress their emotions, and then call you overly sensitive for trying to sort through yours? Well that is going to have an effect on you.

Food for thought. Its hard to be objective about the people you are closest to (especially family) if you don't know another way.

&gt; while I simultaneously HATE giving up the truth just to be friends with everyone.

Here's a compromise. Warn people ahead of time that you are brutally honest every time you give your view on things and make it clear that a lot of people are put off by it. If they take that disclaimer each time, it will give them time to prepare emotionally for what you are about to say, and know that you're not specifically doing this to them. Honesty is fine, but you have to make sure its not blindsiding them. A lot of people expect social norm agree-ability, so when you pull that social norm out from under them it can be really jarring-- and again, make them feel like you are wronging them specifically. Be honest about your honesty before you give your honesty to them, haha. You can give your same truths with a lot less edge and surprise.

EDIT: Random related side rant. Make sure you aren't one of those guys who goes "I'm just being a realist" or "I'm just being objective" or "I'm just being factual" and then proceed to give a subjective opinion not based in statistical data. I see that a TON with people discussing politics. People like to act like just because their opinion ruffles feathers or depicts a more cynical reality, that it is by default more truthful. Know that just because you are "logical" that opinions are still opinions, and the simplest perspective isn't always the most accurate.Well what was the old web animation!?

If you are just going to join every thread on here and talk about how superior Socionics is, then why are you on /r/MBTI in the first place?

I'll go with [Joy Division - Isolation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViMA_qDKTU)But honestly think about it... Think of how much of a sociopath you would have to be to live in modern America and be able to enjoy life like in the top image. Like imagine having your head so deep under a rock that you don't feel the need to help make a change for the people around you and/or recoil into depression. So many people are suffering around us, and it would take an immense amount of head-up-your-ass to feel hunky dory these days.&gt;depression is actually counter-productive in that regard

Hence why I said "or recoil into depression". Depression isn't a choice, its a mental illness that is rampant right now in response to how messed up our society is. US is the only country in the world that has a healthcare system as broken as ours.Then why is the rate of depression so much higher in America than in other countries? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_of_depression#By_country

You're setting up a false dichotomy that is contradicted by empirical data.And Sweden who has some of the best and highest rate of reporting of social issues is all the way down at 60.

I'm confused what you are even arguing. That depression isn't an epidemic in the US right now? Why?So you're just being pedantic and going off the rails from the original topic. I see.What part of it? Americans are currently at historical highs of unhappiness, depression, and stress. We are one of the only industrialized countries to not guarantee healthcare and instead let private health insurance companies profit off our suffering. Our labor rights have been crumbling since Reagan. Business consolidation due to lack of enforcement of anti-trust laws has created near monopolies in which the economy of scale are impossible to compete with. Go to a rural area with a Walmart and see the absolute vacuum of economic destitution it causes.

Are you:

A) completely unaware of the circumstances around you? or...

B) don't care?Hence, narcissistic.Because everyone is subject to politics. I'm concerned about your well-being, as you should be concerned about my well-being. The days of Baby Boomer "me-me-me" politics needs to end. We've got to start looking out for our neighbors' interest, because our lives are all connected and what impacts your neighbor impacts you.

To quote another:

&gt;You're "just not that into politics?"

&gt;Your boss is. Your landlord is. Your insurance company is.

&gt;And every day they use their political power to keep your pay low, raise your rent, and deny you coverage.

&gt;Its time to get into politics.&gt;No, we don't. I don't owe anything to anyone and no one can tell me what I should or should not do

And that's the baby boomer school of politics that gave us Ronald Reagan onwards through Trump.

&gt;And what if I'm the boss and landlord myself? I couldn't care less about politics

Landlords definitely care about Rent Control laws. Bosses definitely care about labor rights laws and minimum wage laws, for example.

All of the above affect you directly or indirectly whether you care or not.

But if you want to play into that hypothetical fallacy.

Whether or not your friends and neighbors are imprisoned due to a plant is political.From my experience, I would say swap INTP and INTJ. My INTJ friends always complain about inefficiency and people being bad at their job, and sorta bragging. INTPs are more non-confrontational.Yeah, I feel like you guys would just think it through ahead of time and realize that the chance of a **FELONY** is nowhere near worth the reward when you could just buy your own computers for mining.That is just a random generalization. I know ENFPs who are always the most outgoing in the room. I know ENTPs who are more reserved. There are ENFPs I know where I can't get a single word in. It will be a room of 4-5 people total, and they are talking 60-80% of the time.Outgoing, not extroverted. Introvert/extrovert are different from how outgoing someone is.I've just been really upset with how quiet you have been lately when we hang out and chat.Oh, so **that** is why the INTJ sub doesn't suck like some of the others.

This was funny though, thanks for sharing.
I'm guilty of carpooling with friends if we're going to the same place (but we would meet up somewhere that's best for everyone then carpool). Saving gas is nice, but being with my friend is even better.

Now, when it comes to money, I make an effort to not let people treat me. Especially if I've yet to treat them, I feel morally obligated to repay them somehow.

Also, I'm selfish, yeah. It's how I relate to others. Hate me all you like, but a lot of my selfishness is me attempting not to hate myself, so I really am sorry if INFPs come across that way. Intuition and introspection are a cruel mix.

ISFPs are fun people that I personally enjoy. Very caring and I definitely trust them, even if they live a much more spontaneous lifestyle than I do.
Well, I'm less self-aware at the time since it comes naturally, but I do try to know myself.Edit: Downvoted for sharing my own experience and forgetting to mention something so easily implied as the nature of ISFP outgoingness? Screw that.

That'll teach me!How about that edit?They is reflexive. Read the first sentence and then the second. The second sentence expands upon the idea in the first sentence: "INTJs try to prove you wrong and tend to be argumentatitve, stern."

They aren't always what, you may ask? They aren't always argumentative, stern, or trying to prove you wrong.

Was it really that convoluted of a statement? Perhaps I should try to be more clear, but I figured, especially in such a casual situation, that it would be clear enough.INFP and I am currently addicted to Jpop and Jpop covers. Currently, the particular one is [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzf-LbRaemA) cover of a Vocaloid song.

It just hypes me up so much.To be honest, it sounds like he just had something he was honestly invested in and you decided to ignore him when he was dying to share it.

Sometimes I get super excited about things and want to go talk to people about it, even if I know they don't care.Alright, so I would turn the friend in anonymously. 

Why? I don't want to be involved in this at all — and I wouldn't appreciate the friend trying to make me aware of such illegal, unethical doings.

If the friend said it was an important thing they'd like to talk about I'd probably show signs that I'm not up to talk about super illegal stuff. I mean, I'm not even a fan of marijuana usage and underage drinking, so confessing a murder to someone like me is a definite no-no.I used to be around 99% introverted, so leaving the house for anything other than school used to be passed up.

To this day I hate involving myself into situations like this that require me to be involved. I would much prefer to give an anonymous point in the right direction Assertion: you're a self-loathing ISFP who needs to take a nap and play nice.Seeing from your replies in this post, well, the only negativity has roots in you. In the most honest and caring way possible, perhaps you should be careful not to channel such feelings and stereotypes. I checked your history of posts. You hold many polarized views and find humor out of getting reactions from them.

Additionally, stating there is something fundamental about a group is a much harder assertion to prove than, say, there being something fundamentally wrong about yourself. Quick to point fingers, are you?

The likelihood of every ISFP being "fundamentally wrong" versus that of yourself is astronomical. Take it from a Fi user, look inside and then, after accepting your qualms, look upon others.

In all honesty, I seriously can't tell if you're a troll, an angst-ridden child, or a legitimate jackass.There comes a point when you get so satiated by thinkers that you don't even bother trying to persuade some of the more stubborn individuals, regardless if that's really logical or not.~~I'm a whiney bitch.~~

I’ve kind of, well, faced a lot of my fears and anxieties. I grew a lot emotionally from throwing myself at my biggest fear out of desperation. To the point where I wrongly thought that everyone should do that insanity wolf BS and would have zero sympathy.

Coming out of that, my emotions are stronger, but my spunkiness matches it. I’ve literally told a person to “go away,” and have made low key insults back to a few rude customers at work.INFP:

As an INFP, I do this sometimes. Try not to take it personally. I sometimes just need time away from people because I get so overwhelmed with everything in my life and it just takes it out of me to have to socialize all the time. I value my alone time very much and sometimes will just stay home for a day and turn my phone off because the thought of someone being able to contact me at anytime and the expectation of an immediate response just stresses me out. I go through up and down periods of wanting to socialize. If I get depressed or if I'm even just tired, I want to be left alone for a little while. I'll come back around when I feel up to it. Male INFP. Very true. I would be curious to know if sexuality ever correlates with gender/MBTI.I ran over not only one, but TWO squirrels yesterday! Lots of crying in the car ☹️

According to my SO they have healing spells.  So I might relate to this a little more but still don't take it very seriously.

But my advice would be not to be in a rush to type yourself. Take time to learn what it means. It was well invested time for me. Knowing that you are INTP or INFP doesnt matter unless you understand what it means.Seeing your own weaknesses in others can be annoying. Especially if you've outgrown some of them and others haven't. American INFPs tend to have very different values than me, which can cause friction.

"The same type" often compete for the "same space" in social situations, which can be frustrating. I have heard that some Fe-doms tend to have this problem. But I also know two Fe-doms that are best friends, because they have learned to deal with this. I can imagine that Te-doms compete for the "intellectual space" instead of the social and that can cause friction.ISTPSounds like my BFFI doubt someone seriously wants to be INFPStart with hugs, small steps *hug*I think that might be a bit exagerrated. We would probably stand up for friends. But we might not necessarily be white knights running around the world saving against X. I think a more balanced INFP would not see the world in black and white terms.

For example, I am convinced religion is harmful. That doesn't mean I lash out at religious people, unless they do obvious harm. Actually doing something, is difficult for us.INFP, forgot to buy breadIt does not matter what type your are, if you don't know the difference. It is not an identify, it is a more or less useful tool. You can learn a lot about yourself just knowing you are IxxP.

Before you take this into consideration know that from what I've found, the best way to find out your type or what functions you use is to just think about it yourself and come to a conclusion (which took me forever) or simply ask the people who know you well what they think. If you're lucky enough to know someone who has read about or knows enough about mbti to type you, seriously take what they say into consideration, if not then just ask someone if you fit a certain behaviour or act a certain way that aligns to a type or function. Anyway, from just reading this I originally was thinking Ti user paired maybe with Se? As I read on I got the feeling you were an introverted feeler, and having finished I would say you're an ISFP. I didn't see any use of Te or Si in what you said and so I ruled out ISTJ and ESTJ and ISFJ and ESFJ felt unlikely. Although you seem to trust your 'gut feeling' I think this is coming from the use of Se rather than Ni so that made me less confident in you being an INTJ or ENTJ. Also, your need to object against what others say made me feel more confident in you being an Fi user and less confident in you using Fe, so just to limit the options I cut out INFJ and ENFJ. Amongst other reasons, what made me chose Se over Ne (which I'm still not overtly confident about) was that you seem to be interested in what you could be doing as an activity with your friends. Overall you seem to be more focused on your own world, if only a little, and this also led me to chose introversion. As for whether or not you're a thinking type, I would think you aren't because you clearly a use Fi a lot and you seem seem to be a lot more emotionally fuelled. So that's how I arrived at you being an ISFP. Once again, this is just what I got from this, I don't know you at all, so this could really be wrong, and I recommend you simply look over this yourself. Hope this helps! 
[More than one study](http://eng.uwo.ca/electrical/faculty/mcisaac_k/docs/mbti-IJHCS-v2.pdf) found that ISTJ was the most common type for software engineers (the linked study mentions some previous studies). Certainly in my experience there are at least as many programmers who prefer S as prefer N. I found this a bit of a surprise early on, since I have a strong N preference.

What is clear than people who prefer Introversion and Thinking are over-represented in programming.[One MBTI study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-6494.00006/abstract) found:
&gt; Twins’ scores on the continuous scales were subjected to behavior genetic model-fitting procedures. Extraversion-Introversion and Thinking-Feeling yielded heritabilities of about .60, consisting largely of nonadditive genetic variance. Sensing-Intuition and Judgment-Perception yielded heritabilities of about .40, consisting largely of additive genetic variance.

For Big Five (which correlates pretty closely with MBTI on four out of five of its scale) wikipedia says:

&gt;All five factors show an influence from both heredity and environment. Twin studies suggest that these effects contribute in roughly equal proportion.[39] Of four recent twin studies the mean estimated broad heritabilities on self-report measures for the Big Five traits were as follows:[40]
&gt; 
&gt; Openness [N/S]: 57%
&gt;
&gt; Conscientiousness [J/P]: 49%
&gt;
&gt; Extraversion [E/I]: 54%
&gt;
&gt; Agreeableness [F/T]: 42%
&gt;
&gt; Neuroticism [no MBTI equiv]: 48%

So as a rule of thumb, you inherit about 40% to 60% of your preferences.My list was pretty similar:

* IxxPs: tuners. Adjust and optimize the present as they go.

* IxxJs: nudgers. Work behind the scenes to bring about long term plans.

* ExxPs:experiencers. Dive into and create stimulating experiences.

* ExxJs: marshallers. Marshal people and/or resources to bring about long term goals.You'll note that event in the official MBTI Manual, cognitive functions are just given a brief aside. Despite decades of searching, there hasn't been any empirical evidence for the cognitive functions and type dynamics.

I also think having a representation for the fifth scale of the Big Five is a plus, especially with more neutral terminology. So more power to them.The OP is problematic, in that it liberally applies theories and categories from socionics (which does not map cleanly to the MBTI) and applies it to MBTI. There is no easy one-to-one mapping, and applying socionics categories to the MBTI leads to confusion and misinformation.

Secondly, the statements presented here don't appear to follow empirical facts. For example, INFPs are have a perceiving preference (at least as measured externally). The subscales of Perceiving (from the MBTI Step II) are:

* CASUAL - Relaxed, easygoing, welcome diversions
* OPEN-ENDED - Present-focused, go with the flow, make flexible plans
* PRESSURE-PROMPTED - Motivated by pressure, bursts and spurts, early start unstimulating
* SPONTANEOUS -Want variety, enjoy the unexpected, procedures hinder
* EMERGENT -Plunge in, let strategies emerge, adaptable

So we would expect both ISFPs and INFPs to tend to share these characteristics. Not, for example, to "Do things sequentially, from the beginning to the end" or "Feel like there's a 'right' way to do any particular task, such as preparing dinner, and get confused or distracted if the steps go out of sequence." Certainly perceivers as a whole do not "prefer following step-by-step instructions."

We also wouldn't expect there to be a big difference in the level of optimism between ISFPs and INFPs, given their preferences. In fact, the S/N preference doesn't appear to make a big difference as far as optimism pessimism go. Looking at the [Big Five research](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c577/f9803f6b3b1173d4dc2bc10182b7a17e7817.pdf), it looks like high Extroversion (very close to MBTI Extraversion) and low Neuroticism (no MBTI equivalent) are correlated to optimism, and to a lesser degree Conscientiousness (approximately MBTI Judging) and Agreeableness (approximateley MBTI Feeling). Openness to experience (approximately MBTI iNtuition) doesn't correlate one way or the other, so we wouldn't expect ISFPs vs INFPs to differ much.

If we look at the MBTI Step II subscales for iNtuition vs Sensing, for Sensing we have:

* CONCRETE - Exact facts, literal, tangible
* REALISTIC - Sensible, matter-of-fact, seek efficiency
* PRACTICAL - Pragmatic, results- oriented, applied
* EXPERIENTIAL - Hands-on, empirical, trust experience
* TRADITIONAL - Conventional, customary, tried-and-true

For iNtuition, we have:

* ABSTRACT - Figurative, symbolic, intangible
* IMAGINATIVE - Resourceful, inventive, seek novelty
* CONCEPTUAL - Scholarly, idea-oriented, intellectual
* THEORETICAL - Seek patterns, hypothetical, trust theories
* ORIGINAL - Unconventional, different, new and unusual

So given that, it seems highly unlikely that INFPs would be more list followers (for example) than ISFPs. 

I could go on from there, but these lists of differences don't follow from either the simple preferences (sensing vs intuition), type dynamics (which I'm dubious about empirically), or cautiously applying from Big Five research.

What we WOULD expect is that ISFPs would tend to be more hands-on and practical, and INFPs would tend to be more conceptual and novelty seeking. So ISFPs would tend to choose careers that combine a hands-on approach with an aesthetic or personal approach. So ISFPs are likely to be artists, physical therapists, veterinarians, etc.

INFPs tend to prefer careers popular careers like being a writer, designer, teacher, psychogist, etc, where the theoretical and novel plays a somewhat greater role. That's because the whole "quadrants" things is socionics, not MBTI. (Although people do sometimes mix the two systems.)I agree that it's mostly about marketing and protecting their market via licensing (in a way benefits them), but the MBTI has solid research behind it (even according to the creators of the Big Five, which is the gold standard academically). Much more empirically grounded than "the cognitive functions" and type dynamics.Actually[ four of traits of the Big Five correlate strongly with the MBTI dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator#Big_Five), so they tapping into similar characteristics. I think it's difficult to argue that they are truly measuring different things on four out of five of the dimensions.

The MBTI does have some practical advantages, like the use of more neutral language, and some attention paid to describing the effects of preference combinations. On the other hand, since the preference-strengths/traits are distributed in a bell curve, the MBTI emphasis on complete dichotomous type can be misleading (and leave some people frustrated that they can't figure out their complete type). Lots of people have at least one middling preference/trait.Only problem is there is absolutely no empirical support for the cognitive functions (despite decades of people trying to find some), and lots of evidences for continuous traits or preferences. In practice, preference strengths fall along a bell curve, with lots of people having only middling preference. The correlative data also supports that middling preferences have middling effects on behavior, while stronger preferences make more of a difference. 

So there's no evidence for truly dichotomous preferences, much less the rest of cognitive functions and type dynamics. It's a fun theory with nice patterns, but there's no evidence it describes or correlates with anything real (unlike the MBTI itself or the Big Five). See "[The Case Against Type Dynamics](https://www.capt.org/research/article/JPT_Vol69_0109.pdf)" (published in the main research journal for MBTI-related research) for more.If you look at MBTI studies and Big Five studies, most indicate that [MBTI preferences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9529660) and [Big Five traits](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1996.tb00522.x/full) are about 40% to 60% inherited. Yep. The MBTI literally measures preference on each axis to determine a type. There's plenty of empirical evidence (and studies) that support the MBTI. There's no empirical evidence for the functions, despite decades of people trying. Actually the MBTI itself is a valid instrument that ranks right up there with the best of the Big Five instruments (even according to the Big Five's creators). There's lots of studies that show that preferences as measured by the MBTI correlate will all kinds of interesting things.

There's no empirical evidence for cognitive functions, despite decades of people trying to find it. There's no evidence that ESFPs, on average, show a greater preference for Sensing (because primary function!) than Feeling. There's no evidence that the J/P scale acts as any kind of master switch. There's no evidence that people develop "functions farther down the the stack" as they get older. There's lots of evidence ESFPs and INTPs, for example have the little in common, rather than having a lot in common because "function pairs" or "tandems."

So throwing out the cognitive functions (or treating them as, at best, descriptions of preference combinations) while keeping the MBTI makes perfect sense empirically. You can [start with reddshoes post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/67y4rv/sci_show_criticises_the_mbti/dgufgkm/) that links to this [meta review](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.4902&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf):

&gt; In addition to research focused on the application of the MBTI to solve applied assessment problems, a number of studies of its psychometric properties have also been performed (e.g., Harvey &amp; Murry, 1994; Harvey, Murry, &amp; Markham, 1994; Harvey, Murry, &amp; Stamoulis, 1995; Johnson &amp; Saunders, 1990; Sipps, Alexander, &amp; Freidt, 1985; Thompson &amp; Borrello, 1986, 1989; Tischler, 1994; Tzeng, Outcalt, Boyer, Ware, &amp; Landis, 1984). Somewhat surprisingly, given the intensity of criticisms offered by its detractors (e.g., Pittenger, 1993), a review and meta-analysis of a large number of reliability and validity studies (Harvey, 1996) concluded that in terms of these traditional psychometric criteria, the MBTI performed quite well, being clearly on a par with results obtained using more well- accepted personality tests.

McCrae and Costa, the creators of the Big Five, weigh in on the Big Five in [this study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_From_the_Perspective_of_the_Five-Factor_Model_of_Personality). They find that it taps into four of the five scales of the Big Five and acknowledge that there are many correlative studies for the MBTI.

They go on to argue (as one might imagine), that since the MBTI is really tapping into Big Five scales, it should embrace that fact. Conversely, the Big Five could benefit from aspects of the MBTI, including being approachable and describing aspects of preference combinations.


Hah! That's a good way to put it... with the additional low neuroticism. So, looking at your Big Five results overall, most of your Big Five traits are pretty neutral, except for Open Mindedness, so I'm not sure there's a ton to be gleaned.

The instrument you took uses different sub-facets that most Big Five instruments (most have 5 sub-facets for each Big Five facet), so that makes it a little more difficult to know how to map those sub-facets onto the MBTI.

**Extraversion** (correlates with MBTI Extraversion at 0.74): your average Big 5 score: 50... right in the middle. Not a ton of information there, although the only sub facet you scored high on was energy level. Your Sociability sub-facet score was low, so that might make large parts of the MBTI Extraversion description fit you poorly.

**Aggreeableness** (correlates with MBTI Feeling at 0.72): your average Big Five score: 42. So, perhaps mildly Thinking. However, the Trust sub-facet generally isn't covered by the MBTI. If we drop trust and average the other two sub-facets, we get a score of 47, which is very neutral.

**Conscientiousness** (correlates with MBTI Judging at 0.44): your average Big Five score: 56. That's a fairly neutral score, and it's unclear how much "Productiveness" would map to MBTI Judging.

**Negative Emotion** (does not strongly correlate with any MBTI preference)

**Open-mindedness** (correlates with MBTI Intuition at 0.49): your average Big Five score: 81. That score shows a clear tendency toward open-mindedness and is above average on all for sub-facets. So that's a moderate indication that you would prefer intuition in the MBTI sense.

So I don't think there's a lot to be gleaned there, other than you have a strong Open Mindedness trait, and your other Big Five traits are fairly neutral/average. Since Big Five traits (and MBTI preferences, in practice) follow a normal distribution, it's likely that most people will have at least some traits that are pretty middling. That's all good and well, but can be frustrating when working with the MBTI, since the MBTI pushes one to identify with one side of a preference scale or the other.The official MBTI instrument's scales each correlate with individual Big FIve scales from 0.44 (Feeling with Agreeableness) to 0.74 (MBTI Extraversion to Big Five Extroversion). There is no MBTI equivalent to Big Five Neuroticism (although 16types adds an "Assertive/Turbulent" dimension to make up for the lack).

Before the Big Five, there were a number of peer-reviewed MBTI-based academic studies. After the creation of the Big Five, mainstream academic pschology abandoned the MBTI in favor of the Big Five.

The creators of the Big Five (MacCrae and Costa) both critiqued and praised the MBTI at the time. There's a fairly long post with references [here](https://www.personalitycafe.com/threads/another-mbti-debunking.283457/) that goes into more depth.

I think the MBTI itself is more defensible as evidence based (especially when viewed as a continuous scales rather than dichotomous categories and types) than type dynamics are, since no one has ever found credible scientific evidence for type dynamics.Empirically, there's no evidence for the functions and type dynamics but solid (if not as good as the Big FIve) evidence for continuous (rather than dichotomous) preferences being descriptive and valid. I know the the functions are considered more "advanced" in online the MBTI world, but there's never been (despite decades of looking) solid empirical evidence for the functions and type dynamics. And yes, I am aware of Dardio Nardi's EEG work, but even he admits his work is at most a "pilot study" and he doesn't provide any empirical data. 

If empirical evidence comes to light that supports functions or type dynamics, that would be great. Meanwhile, "the functions" and type dynamics are lacking in any empirical support. The function descriptions can be salvaged (to a degree) if one redefines "Te" as really being "T+J" and "Fi" as really being "F+P". But it also means that "E+N" are just as valid and descriptive as "F+P".I think the longer post I wrote to covers it (not written by me), but the general gist is that while INTPs (for example) should be "Ti-dominate", no one has been able to measure that that's the case. For example, we might expect (if function stacks were correct) that INTPs tend to test higher on Thinking than ENTPs (who are supposed to be Ne-dominate). 

In truth, we don't see that at all. Even tests written to try to tease out individual functions don't show results consistent with type dynamics. 

Instead, what we see empirically is more consistent with normally distributed continuous traits (like the Big 5 has). What the MBTI tradition brings to the table (in my opinion) is descriptions of trait combinations and more neutral language. The function descriptions from this perspective are trait combinations such that Te is actually a description of T + J (and maybe a little E). Kiersey's temperaments are also useful descriptions of trait combinations.

People like Reynierse[ have also argued](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Case-Against-Type-Dynamics-Reynierse/78591ba42c54c74fa430e3b91cd94a5d3507d72f) that full types are mostly not descriptive in most cases (based on analysis of of data and also given that most people have at least a couple of middling/weak preferences), but that strongest preference pair for an individual is fairly predictive/descriptive.Empirical studies show that MBTI preferences (much like [Big Five personality traits](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8776880/)) are thought to be [between 40% and 60% hereditary] (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-6494.00006) based on twin studies. It's possible that some of that effect may be because of the environment in the womb or epigenetics.Sure seems to be! So is about 50% post-natal environment.I’m taking a psychometrics graduate psychology course and as part of the course we have to create a test, have people take it, and analyze the data to see if the test looks reasonable (valid and reliable).

I was interested in how people relate to their feelings, so I created some questions and mixed in a few other very short tests. The result is a 107 question quiz that should take less than twenty minutes. At the end you are presented with results. I'm hoping to see MBTI correlations.

Feel free to share with others, because I need all the data I can get!

The link to the test is here:

http://tests.cmore.blog/emotions-quiz.html#forumAgreed. Big Five extroversion correlates pretty highly with MBTI extraversion (0.74). Conscientiousness correlates less highly with Judging (0.49), but low Conscientiousness might indicate being a perceiver. The best place to look generally is to use scholar.google.com and do search for studies (if you can tolerate academia). It's frustrating, though, because often studies are locked behind pay walls. Googling for the study and "pdf" sometimes turns up publicly available copies.

Here's the [original article](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Costa3/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_From_the_Perspective_of_the_Five-Factor_Model_of_Personality/links/59e164a1a6fdcc7154d3718b/Reinterpreting-the-Myers-Briggs-Type-Indicator-From-the-Perspective-of-the-Five-Factor-Model-of-Personality.pdf) on the MBTI Big Five correlations by one of the creators of the Big Five.

There's also a [2003](https://jfdeschamps.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/correl-ocean-mbti-furnham-2003-6p.pdf) study that lists the correlation between each Big Five sub-facet and each MBTI preference. &gt; I’ve been seeing downvoting when people are honest about certain aspects of MBTI and I am here to set the record straight.
&gt; 1) YOU ARE ONE TYPE ---- FOREVER. You are not a monk in the mountains of Naples. No, your years of yoga class or the trauma of your ex-girlfriend did not help you transcend your personality type, you got one for a lifetime kid, so get used to it and learn enough to be sure you have the right one.

I haven't seen much longitudinal MBTI research, but [Big Five research](https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug03/personality.aspx) shows that people become more agreeable (correlated with MBTI Feeling) and more conscientious (correlated with MBTI Judging) as they age.

Granted, the Big Five sees its traits as (more or less) normally distributed continuums, but MBTI test results show the same pattern for preferences.

&gt; 2) Learn about cognitive function! None of this S vs. N or P vs. J thing holds any weight. Although it’s fun to say, “Haha look at all your perfectly sharped pencils, what a J!” It’s not what Jung was trying to tell us about the human condition… so do what Papa Jung wants and learn about the real depth psychology.

There is [no empirical evidence for the functions or type dynamics](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7859/1ba42c54c74fa430e3b91cd94a5d3507d72f.pdf). That combinatorial effects that do exist are more easily (and accurately) describe as preference combinations. So, what is described as "Fi" is actually just a preference for Feeling combined with a preference for Perceiving (meaning that TJs wouldn't have those characteristics).

&gt; 3) If you have Ti in your first two functions, you are not using Fi… ever… okay extremely rarely. Or if you have Se in your first two functions, you are not using Ne. Or if you are Ni, you are not using Si and so on. Unless you are deeply traumatized and stuck in your subconscious mind, then no. Trust me any ENTP/INTP/ISTP/ESTP who are using their Fi are in a seriously effed situation and about to make it way worse. (I learned all this from C.S. Joseph on YouTube so check him out if you are curious)

I'd mildly agree with this one, if one interprets Ti to be T+P, then of course people who prefer F+J wouldn't have those characteristics. They'd be least likely to share characteristics with T+P preferences.

&gt; Being one type is wonderful. You can expand on the gifts you’ve been given. You have talents for moral understanding (Fi) or delegating (Te) or connecting with other (Fe) and so on. And to learn what those are and see how you can help others is powerful. Also, you can work to sharpen your second and third function and learn to accept your fourth function.
&gt; I know no one wants to feel categorized but the test shows the power of collaboration. You don’t need to be everything at once. You just need to be to best at what you do and find other people to be the best at what they are.

There aren't hard and fast type categories, just a continuum of preferences onto which people fall (often in the middle). Of course it pays to work with one's nature (sometimes with work-arounds and mitigations for the negatives side), rather than trying to change one's nature wholesale.
Heritability for a particular preference appears to be about 40% to 60% when preferences are viewed as a continuum (and the same is true for Big Five traits).

My straight identical twin brother is INTP (e9w1) and I'm an INFP (e5w4)... although granted there's little empirically available about the enneagram. 

Also interesting that identical twins raised together can be more different in many ways than twins raised together (see https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/01/double-life).Cool! I incorporated questions from a validated Big Five quiz that just ten questions long (two for each trait). Most of the questions were either new ones for my test, or taken from other short tests that might correlate (like the thick vs thin boundaries test).Definitely a lifelong struggle for me. Usually only motivated by what I'm interested in, so have to trick myself into being interested.That sounds medium+ to me. I have submitted a request for a research article that might include the median score and standard deviation. Most personality traits cluster in the middle of the spectrum in a bell curve, so I'd guess that 57% isn't too extreme.Thanks!
Sylveon and Meowstic. Both my favorite fairly equally. I think their categorical labels fit, the intertwining and constraint pokemon respectively.

Sylveon as what I really wish I was like, affectionate and enthusiastic and developing close bonds with others. Meowstic as more withdrawn and playing into the more introverted side.
Or John Wayne. Check out his Playboy interview. Turns out, John Wayne was a Nazi!

http://fusion.net/story/257352/john-wayne-donald-trump-racist-interview/I'm actually pretty good at math (bachelor's in statistics) and I think unicorns and rainbows are lame.
yeah, all depends on the circumstances and what the murder actually entailed. Though, even without that information, I'd first try to work out a solution with them. If the murder wasn't in self defense or a necessary evil, then I'd call it in. I don't see how them being a friend would negate the fact that they broke the law. I'd hope they'd turn me in if I did the same :oNah, those terms aren't typically used to describe isfjs. Most isfjs would usually be described as "amiable"; "routine-bound"; "reserved"; "empathetic". Of course, that's from the popular descriptions, yeah not everyone isn't going to fit in the same mold. I wouldn't peg you as an isfj, but that's from surface impressions and just my basis of experiences with other isfjs. Seem more isfp to me, Fi because of your individualistic feelings (depth of feeling, and searching for that depth in life) and Se because of your taste in jewelry. Lol. But isfj, or infj, are definite contenders I guess. But I am definite you're a 4 in terms of enneagram, which is unrelated, but comes to mind. Check it out. Interaction with others, no matter what, requires a give and take. That doesn't mean social interaction is fake or superficial, but that's literally what it requires. So don't expect much if you don't give much, that simple. External appearances are pretty important, because we have no other indicators on how to interact otherwise. No ones gonna be able to read your mind, less they're some sort of psychic. I'm guessing you have an easier time expressing yourself in different ways, so just work with that. I wouldn't worry too much about image, but it's up to you how you wish to present yourself. Try not to get caught up in the authenticity paradox, and good luck1. My superpowr would have to do with invisibility. I think it would be super cool to slip in and out of existence and scare people, or I could go on those ghost adventure shows and mess with them.
2. Weoweo (could have a jingle and everything)
3. 6, might give elderly folk heart attacks :(
4. 5
5. 8
6. Just my birthday suit
jk, though I don't think I'd have one cause I'd be invisible :7huh, cause it's obvious! I'm not certain on the rest of your personality but I am fairly certain on that. Also a mix of either type 5 or type 6. When you spoke of vulnerability, that was a big hint. Fours typically struggle with feeling fragile, and act in certain ways to cope with that. 4s can be very aesthetic (has more to do with mbti though) and value their tastes, whether it be music, style, etc. 4s are also pretty idealistic, and that can be related to perfectionism. Although 4s are typically reserved and private, they take to introspection and usually have a pretty well-developed inner world. And, though it's not necessarily negative, 4s can be abrasive and defensive, not always because they want to be, but they can become very comfortable with that mode of interaction. check out the descriptions of types 2, 1, 5, 4, and 6 if ya get the chance to. Think it would provide some insight, especially if you're struggling with identifying yourself within personality systems. Funnily enough, although fours are an "image" type, they really do struggle with image and how they present themselves. Also, if it helps, most isfjs are typically 2s, 6s, and 9s. that's why I doubted you were an isfj, but there's always exceptions to generalizations. hope it helpsprobably not universal to infps, but inaction and procrastination seem to be my worst flaws, guess that's relatable to any type though. Most infps probably struggle with feeling too deeply. Taking things to heart, both good and bad. 
Grass is greener on the other side? Since I don't frequent the infp sub so much, I guess I miss those sort of posts, so they don't register to me. I guess my problem with it is that sometimes I think we reiterate too much, discussing topics that have already had the milk squeezed the heck out of em. So, it just feels boring at times. If that's the case, I'll just move on and do something else. To be honest, I do find our sub to be pretentious at times (if that's even the correct word to describe it as), and it becomes off putting after a while. It makes me wonder...We're all just here to connect to another, right? To see if we can make something out of our individual quirks and this whole mbti thing. So, in that way, I feel we could use some more productivity. It's good to mull over things, and process them, but sometimes we linger on too long. 

A good thing to remember, though, is that a lot of these people you speak of might not even be mistyped - they just may be used to unhealthy behaviors and haven't really employed MBTI in positive ways (like recognizing the patterns they default to, and using their knowledge of personality to develop and mature) - rather using MBTI as a means of validating and creating an identity. I feel as if MBTI should be used as a general foreground - from which you build upon and then use to understand yourself and others. Other than that and cognitive functions, I don't think its purpose continues...but...some people get bored, and try to apply it to other areas of their life, where it really isn't needed. That could be where the problem lies. I don't know. Guess I meandered a little bit; either way, I don't mind the infp sub. I just prefer this one instead :P
I don't have many friends because I do this. It's really not personal, I just don't feel like talking to people at all for however long of a time (even months) I also don't reach out to people at all, they have to reach out to me. When I actually write it out it's kind of obvious why I don't have friends I guess. I'll tell you one thing though, I do keep in contact with my boyfriend everyday. 
I  think it's really best to go by how the cognitive function looks instead of by the sound bite stereotypes.

FWIW, I'm not cuddly (unless we are talking about a brand new romantic relationship), I'm prickly, don't like to be physically touched and I need a lot of space. Also, I have BRF, so people (for the most part) don't just randomly bug me out in public. (Which is good.) It's not that I would be impolite to a stranger but the less energy I have to put out in random interactions, the better.Have you read through the cognitive functions?Yay! You can stay in the club!is it sadness? or is it melancholy?  For me, there is a huge difference between the two.  I'm not always sad but for me, life, even when I am happy, is always tinged with that wistful feeling of melancholy, the bittersweet push and pull between happiness, good and beauty and sorrow, bad, and broken.  That's my preferred state. It gives life a lot of depth for me to see it that way.


They're too feelzy to get it!  
Also, you'll be ruining their parade and that never goes well in reddit.Tbh older NTPs easily mimick STJs and vice versa. It's somewhat homogenizing in a way, since we do live in a Te world, and both types have that softer, more passive Si/Ne touch that approves of more collective methods in a sense.TIL! Thanks!You're not wrong btw, there is no said "depth" to any of the thousands of topics brought up.&gt; We later discussed it as her having a strong center of gravity/gravitational pull that impacted me even when we both didn't want that to happen.

Don't you just naturally obsess over that vibe/pull, making it somewhat impossible for that *not* to happen.  

At least with a Si-core that is just as endless malleable as your own, I guess you can truly push-n-pull now, experiencing balance and tranquility eh? :]TK is future and past you, you just didn't know it until now.&gt; The certainly exhibit lack of a lot of negative emotional feedback, until a certain threshold is reached.

It is best said threshold is not reached.&gt; Once Ti gets enough 'rationalization' (it's sometimes not rational, because not everything is rational) that they can and should in fact feel bad, they either doorslam that person or act like caricature FJs.

Well it doesn't help that in trying to crunch^^\(Ti) butter^^\(Fe) as hard as you can results in biting your tongue off...There was this exploding candy they used to sell. Basically crystallized pop with "the same flavor". But due to the compounds they use it had this vinegary, acidly tint(they were acids after all), in the end of the sweet flavor left you with this bitter-ish aftertaste.

Yo /u/madsweet is this a better analogy than just "intangible emotional minefield"?&gt; 10k subs

Oh... no q_q&gt; If anything I'd make a /r/mbti-typing.

[Uuuhuh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/My_mbti_type)&gt; INTJs seem to make the most value judgements of all thinking types, and seem to be among the most short-tempered of all types.

Well they do tend to perceive in broad strokes of sur/reality, hence it is reflected in their values. Makes for fiery emotional states(temper) for sure. 

&gt; INTPs seem like the most conventionally emotional of all thinking types.

Define "conventionally" emotional? SFJ housewife emotional? :]

&gt; xSTPs...have never caught them being emotional haha

Emotion... is but another tool, you may use it as weapon to *strike* your foes with greater might than any strenght you can muster. Or you can make a lady more drunk than the finest glass of wine!&gt; Would be convenient if examples are made!

Sure, here it is.&gt; We don't end sentences with .... or use tons of emojis 😊😊😊 

SOD.OFF! &gt;:-[It's 15k+ that's the critical mass as my Si impression. But eventually it will come and I shall mourn.Now you understand why Ti-Ne can be confused for Ni...Widowmaker's point and click adventure :P&gt; She should start jumping T-bones. Phrasing.

That's essentially showing them that you're a psycho and suffocate them emotionally.&gt; I plan way too much into the future

Like any modern Si-dom....

&gt; and have little care for tradition to be a Si dom.

Aka post war 80s Si-doms which the stupid stereotypical descriptions are using.

&gt; Also, an obvious inferior Se for me.

Why? Does seeing the sky mindfuck you?

&gt; A si's primary goal is take in details and follow the "way things work".

Si has no real goal, it is merely a lens for perceiving the world. It depends on the info the user has gathered over their life as to how they've developed. And Si at best projects "the way things *are*", "the way they work" is much more Ti/Te territory. 

If you just want your "Mastermind" badge, go ahead, but be aware that you'll be led by misinformation.&gt; I think you two are being way too "exclusive" with iNtuition right now.

With Ni, hell fucking yes, it really is rare, and that doesn't make it special, it makes it alien. Often Ni perceptions are extremely broad and in language they come off as extremely *dense* distillation of numerous observations, implications, essences and whatnot. That method of cognition is alien to me and to many, many people, especially when they are not familiar with it.

As for Ne, it has a particular energy and a certain naivete of reality that is easily spotted.

&gt; Or are you saying you guys have tested as sensors constantly and that's why you think these test indicators are inaccurate :p

Also this, and Si is also what represents conventional understanding intuition. Not to mention even Ni-doms would tell you honestly how Si-doms can make much, *much* better predictions than their loose collective ideas compressed into a singular point. Why? Because Si is a subjective representation of reality, anything that concerns the individual can be observed through the mental information available to the person. Of course the collection of experiences can only be from the past, but the process of "simulating" an experience is done in the mental plane, outside of time. Just like "Ni visions of the future" are ideas that are *to be completed*, which automatically excludes the past and present. 

So essentially, looking at time as a main indicator of cognitive patterns isn't the best idea.&gt; It's not some exclusive club where you have to validate someone in order to become a Ni dom.

I do take that approach, until I see evidence of the opposite.  
As for INTP, it's not a bad comparison to ISTJ I find, but OP doesn't seem like the low Conscientiousness type TPs usually are, so -&gt;STJRead Komatik's post, and N has little to do with "abstract thinking", it is a a lens of receiving information that is often disassociated with reality.&gt; Yes, and I literally do think like that.

How so?It's such a shame they canceled it, building a brand new cast successfully is no easy feat.Wow, now I can hear you sobbing on the other side of the screen :D&gt; Perhaps when you only have a very active/used Ji/Pe is when you get the "I'm right you're wrong" feeling.

Actually I think Je/Pi is more like "I'm right, therefore you are wrong.", just think Te, it's damn blatant about it.  
While Ji is more like: 

&gt; "I don't think that therefore it doesn't matter".

"I don't want it to matter, therefore, it *doesn't*." In a sense deluding yourself through hard personal rationalizing. It's a very easy trap to fall in when seeking comfort when under pressure, I do it all the time.I hope your flair is a parody, like someone else I know...&gt; "I'm unsure of my type. Can you guys help me out?"

Sure, I require at least a 3000 character post describing your mindset of what you did yesterday and what was your thought process behind it. If you're lazy and just want your badge stick to the tests... not typology.

&gt; CHANGE YOUR FLAIR OR SUFFER REPEATED HARASSMENT AT THE HANDS OF OUR TROLLS.

My services are open :]  
When I feel like it tho.That's gotta be frustrating for the Si types who take in that info as true.&gt; introvert  
practical minded  
claims not to be ISTJ

[I don't...](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/walkingdead/images/c/cc/Grandma_-_What_is_this_i_don't_even.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131109151911)If Ns ruled, there would be no Earth... or rather humanity on Earth.&gt;  lapse in communication between them and N types

Tbh this is more quadra oriented. Neighbouring quadras have no problem communicating, sure there's a bit of friction here and there but nothing to really offset what the other part means.  

Opposite quadras, now that's where the line is thinner, since basic cognition is directed in a completely different manner, understanding what one is trying to communicate requires more "translation" time and even then, it can still come out wrong, leading to misunderstandings and suspicions.  

It's not that opposite quadras will always have a bad time, but rather it would take actual effort to communicate clearly to the other person. 

Same quadras, that's not really a question, immediate understanding on the most basic level which leaves a lot of room for everything to be transfered by mere charades even. And happen upon an opposite stack, that can be both pleasant and the most intense thing you've ever talked about.Sure thing... Dad!\**groan**

See... he can't even bro like a m8.A defiant STJ, OH NOES! What has the world come to!Nope, [not at all](https://youtu.be/ny1xpc1VvzE?t=3m30s).&gt; The closest he could be if he was flipping into some Ni loop with STP

The aggressiveness and moreso the confusion would be off the charts if it were the case.

Also, it's not even Ti efficacy style of short writing, that usually has more packed than stubborn denial.&gt; Helping people is a chore especially when you dont like people. So I only help people I find value in. Tough luck if I dont find value in you though.

That's just being human...&gt; He worked a lot, and he seemed uncomfortable dealing with anything emotional, which would've been much harder for me

Well yeah, you as 6 year old self are more emotionally developed than him due to natural cognitive preference.

But instead of you being a counselor taking on the emotional toil, he just came down to your level for the fun times.Yeah, it's a nice grouping of shared functions, it is actually applicable as well.&gt; I've tended to believe that them just acknowledging my presence is a pretty good Sign.

Well... be aware that Se-infs can be easily intimidated by your presence.Discord is Google Hangouts done right. Basically a convenient chat software that's been gaining popularity as Skype is a bloated piece of shit.Well yeah, they wouldn't acknowledge it to begin with. I'm int the Se PolR category though which make me very sensitive of Se antics making me fiercely reject them rather than envy them.Point of least Resistance, a socionics concept.It's not a possibility, it's the *default process*. 

We've talked and you've experienced how heavy of a filter Ji is, this is just one of the many methods Ji applies to structure info, by definition it is *required* to be filtered, condensed and summarized.

Ti-Si seeks to form a certain basis, a root of sorts and get a sense of direction from there. Of course to be treated as a vantage point it requires integrity to support whatever info is going to be processed through it. To achieve said "integrity" it has to be formed as an infallible, ideal principle to allow flexibility for the variable facts of reality as counterbalance. It is because of this need for an ideally planted root that you may not acknowledge that you're planting it in sand.&gt; So could that ideally planted root be described as a presupposed/unquestioned pre-assumption that something in particular is true?

Rather *in itself being the absolute*, having it as a "core" that every related to it abides by. Kind of like the law in society, something is confined by principles.  
However establishing said principles is indeed cherry picked information that has relevant data and the key points of facts, data, info are determined and stringed together into a construct that is *consistent within itself*. The last point is key, since if some info that *is actually relevant* is missed while building said construct and then contradicts its consistency in any form, it either has to be adapted and restructure the whole thing, or if it knocks out a fundamental point of the base, it either has to be rejected or sacrifice the entire damned model.  

Of course this is where it becomes context and situation sensitive, Ti-Si is much less adaptable than Ti-Ni as the weight of the experience and reliability of the model is also put into question, and that's mot exactly pleasant. While Ni keeps things a lot more murky and malleable giving more weight to the direct reality of Se.

&gt; A sort of existential (that may be the wrong word) starting point that won't be touched by facts that might oppose it?

As mentioned, it's built on facts, but on determined, subjectified key points creating a sturdy enough wireframe with a consistent feedback loop. Only when empirical proof, or even just a well rationalized argument break said loop is there a chance for opposition, more often it is readopted, but if it breaks the frame, as I said, rejection is a natural reaction.

&gt; ... like a sort of core reference point for all other material/information?

It can serve as a reference point, but it also *processes* said info, which has been sent to this category.

&gt; If so, I can see why my Ti-tert can be of assistance to Ni-dom in the ways it is. It's like it gives some sort of possible (though as the tert, incomplete) anchor amidst Ni's complete disregard for picking a single orienting reference point (angle of vision) to use to process information.

You've usually managed to express your ethereal experiences as beautiful, enlightening, but without an anchor of the subjective you wouldn't be even able to note them in the first place xD&gt; I have a number of general moral rules against which I measure the moral 'rightness'/'goodness' of the situation. And, if asked to evaluate a specific situation, in most of the cases I could tell you whether I find it moral or immoral, based on these rules. But the general principles are axiomatic, and I could not explain why I think following exactly these principles makes something bad or good, they are just general rules that I have formed over the years by observing how the world works.

Yeah, it's something like this, just replace "right/wrong" with "correct/incorrect", focus more on the nature of an object, trying to brake it down into the most basic fundamentals behind it. Sure, things are self-evident to me as I always do this constantly, but much less so to others as it is still a fundamentally subjective process.

&gt; and I could not explain why I think following exactly these principles makes something bad or good, they are just general rules that I have formed over the years by observing how the world works.

While I can argue why something is accurate or not, since it is still based on actual data, I just use personal shortcuts. But when verbalized you actually see how roundabout it actually is, how condensed, summarized it all is resulting in this utilitarian method that is still personal, and unique to the Ti user. Just like formed Fi values.

&gt;  Or is there some overarching logical system that explains the validity of even the most basic principles?

I used to say there's an overarching system but there really isn't, more like an endlessly expanding library of mental models that *hopefully* represent the functions of my surrounding world(Ti-Si).Basically you're a [floating unicorn](https://youtu.be/4eXYFq7PdXY), while I'm a [Bastion](https://youtu.be/x8dDr0TTx7Y?t=2m45s)... /not biasIt's fun for me since "diva" means "wild" with a female gender suffix in my native tongue :D&gt; ISTJ's already have a very negative reputation on Reddit.

Wait... how?! Reddit is basically ISTJ haven![Right 'ere!](https://youtu.be/jtXX3aAPPwg)See Socionic quadras, they're actually rather useful and broad enough as a categorization.So you're still receptive in some form from such attempts when pissed off? :D&gt; Oddly I haven't seen it as much with ISFP but I could be wrong

Their expression is too ~~ambiguous~~ special to be in plain text. Or rather don't care for arbitrary labels.I thought post-apocalypse was what you guys lived for...Ah, this reminds me of Albert Speer's(Hitler's right hand administrator) documentary. The impression I got was that Speer knew what was happening in concentration camps, but he treated them as a function described on documents, that was his job after all. He was never in one, and even if he were he did his best to block out any truth to the slaving labor there.  

He wanted to be innocent, he wanted to know absolutely nothing of it, but he knew, it was clear to him. This kind of cognitive dissonance seemed to haunt him after the fall of the Reich until his last few years, where he came up with an easier explanation: he was the Nazi that survived the Reich.  

So really, he felt guilty when he did all his damnedest to rationalize that he was not, he was denying it to himself with all his mental power. So the lesson isn't that Ji can make you innocent through reason, but rather that you can only *do so at your own expense*, and when it's too much, you either have to accept it, or have the contradiction haunt you.Isn't it more ENFP?If it wasn't, psychopathy would be a lot more common, so you can rest assured :PYou mean, they'll commit sudoku.So are you going to fuck every language that has genders for their words?&gt; IMO I don't think SFJ's and NF's deserve physical beauty.( I mean seriously?

Weeeell thanks for including me. Now I can be skinny fat all I want :3Dammit, don't blow my cover!

See, I do care 0:\^) ^^^[shine!](https://youtu.be/aUIlXI_H0Cs?t=8s)Well it's "shallow" to accept what media feeds you to begin with :]While ~~her~~ his argument is that "it's not exactly wrong". God, you gotta love Ti at these times :DkthxbaiCondensing things to something simple.Your argument:

&gt; To be fair, something being 'natural' doesn't make it necessarily right.

OP's argument, my own impression of it at least:

&gt; "it's not exactly wrong"

\&gt; Ti at work

Now?Oh fucking hell! Too damn true.  
But then again, in-jokes are something Alphas specialize in... amirite /u/Poropopper?&gt; They responded well to being told "you will get this done or else" which I hated from the core of my being.

Well yeah. we need to be put on a harness more or less to do most things. Once we do it, it's no biggy, everyone's content and it still feels effortless, or interesting if effort is required. Interesting in the sense that you've a puzzle to solve on how to do it with the least effort :DAh, projecting insecurities... :/&gt; Starting in my sophomore year of high school and a couple of times in college I consistently tested as ENFP and it generally fit my personality type when I read descriptions of it. Due to some life changes in the past couple of years where I worked in a job that was heavily assessment and data based, and we focused a lot on evidence-based policy (I worked in sexual violence prevention for a college campus), I would say I've become a lot more logical and don't prioritize feelings as much.

Congratulations on becoming part of the Te masses that rule our world. In other words: you are now BORING!   

&gt; My interests have also changed pretty dramatically. I used to be a lot more into theater/music but now I'm heavily into lifting and physical health in general.

Like many... But it does feel nice afterwards doesn't it :D

&gt; Reading the description for ESTP

Now if only descriptions could touch on the cognition behind the reasoning rather than outlooks or images.

&gt; For the MBTI enthusiasts here, do you believe it's possible to "evolve" types based off life circumstances/changing personality, or was I not fully matured yet while I was testing as ENFP?

Nope, you're one type, for all your life, from birth to death. Boring, I know.

&gt; Has anybody else had similar type changes? 

Nope. Nor will take any tests :D

&gt; Would love to hear other's thoughts!

Careful what you wish for :PGive me some time while I [think](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me9t6qvJ4i1qz8x31o4_250.gif) about this.&gt; Not every ENTJ wants to be a CEO and not every ISFP wants to be an artist.

IMO an artistic ENTJ would indeed be a genius, and so would a CEO ISFP.  

I mean imagine the vibes of such personalities who are comfortable with their supposed "opposites".The white ram took off a part of the bumper, it was serious, but the intended target was the black ram on the other side, which was smart and waited for the car.

It's like common miscommunication, just with horns and butting heads :DHow often and what kind of stimuli overwhelm you out of your head?Nah, it's a festering volcano that's been sending ripples the entire time.[Seen this?](http://i.imgur.com/Tgo2CJR.gif)Cuz Snsrz r dam!&gt; I've never met an ISTJ

Bullshit, they are *everywhere*! Maybe you haven't gotten to know one well instead.They get mentioned, SFJ doormats aren't even noticed!I'd argue that you are and you're more like snowflakes than NFPs lolI didn't mean that you act like you are special, but rather you can present your individuality like no other.Every Feeler is an INFP, every Thinker is INTP/INTJ, literally both.  

The truth is that FJs exist and are more wonderful than the walking minefields that Fi is, in return being manipulative ass bitches who make and break society...

While I can assure you 90% of /r/intj are actually STJs(and some STPs), with the odd NTJ who starts detesting that place after a while and skimmers off.

ENTPs are actually ESTJs who've given up on the world, ENTJs are just jerkoffs. INFJs are more often than not ISFJs. INTPs are ISFJs or ISTJs.

Did I miss someone?&gt; And you think Te being "efficient" isnt "logical" but more like just following a set of rules?

Te isn't being "optimal" as Ti see it, and vice versa. Te merely forms the solution in front of it reaching a *desirable state* of solution. It is fast, immediate, time efficient and fact focused, empiricism is king and no one can deny it!

Ti constructs the models seeking evidence to support it from a fundamentalist perspective which is directed at the "solution", but it is not an *end state*, but just *a state* describing an aspect of the model. It is slower, but the understanding formed under Ti is natural to the user and only them, making available shortcuts for future tangling with the model. 

Like for example I had a project with a few calculus iterations, the notes from my ISTJ colleague are with each formulae described and written over and over again. To me that's clutter, I write the constants on another page and just calculate the changing values, putting down the data instead of following the same sequence over and over just with different numbers.  

It's not that she's stupid not to see the repeating pattern, quite the opposite, but rather seeing each iteration as a new state to be treated differently from the last, as the data output is different. But to me, the method behind it is merely consecutive operations I can start combining and summarizing to where I only note down the received data, which I recalculate a few times  just to be sure its accurate, when she doesn't have that concern as much when she has *all* of the data pinned down on paper not to question herself.&gt; I just don't know what to feel about this post besides insulted by most of the comparisons and statements.

Then how about this:

Ti is never wrong, but can never prove it.  
Te is always right, and always says it.

:D&gt; I mean, using absolutes like that, you know that you pretty much guarantee that you've stated a falsehood, right? :P

So you're right about being wrong?! Whelp... [I WIN!](http://www.litbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/a_winner_is_you_1024.jpg)

[Mmmhm \(;](https://youtu.be/l8e4LBSscVo?t=35m55s)&gt; Can't speak so much for NTPs but STPs literally forget it.

Ti-Si can weave itself in a deep ass delusion, the trouble is dispelling it. Ti-Ni is more of a struggle for consistency, since Ni hates things set in stone, that's why they feel they need to hammer it on themselves that it is :D  

PS: Need an STP to clear the bias :PWell... the opposite is true actually, I wonder why...Mmm... the irony is [delicious](https://youtu.be/GuhE_P951Jc?t=10m), how could you be so smart yet stupid at the same time, it is truly fascinating.Ok, sorry about that, I'm being obtuse with my own connecting memes lol

&gt; INTPs that pose as INFPs  
&gt;&gt; Well... the opposite is true actually, I wonder why...

...then I do just that :P (since it's about me being cheeky with that concept of INFPs pretending to be INTPs)

&gt; I don't have Ti, I'm no good at riddles. Why?

I was thinking that jokes, riddles and the sort are more perception based, just with a bit of prose and play on language, since it limits perceiving to begin with, so why not twist it?  

It was ironic to my brain, since NFPs are supposed to be a bit quirky with that, along with more flavor :DCompletely wrong impression of the type. Preferences can be shared between types, but are a limited blur between shared and personal.&gt; MBTI is useful to understand **how people think**

This at best helps in communication which is the lifeline of any relationship. But it is very limited, and shouldn't be even relied upon when personality itself becomes involved.*Especially* ENTPs. Selling bullshit isn't fun, but it's the most profitable thing out there.Trying to sell bs, and earning money from selling bs...Both can do it.&gt; I feel like I can convince myself of anything.

Exactly the "hammering" I was referring to. You are but an piece of iron, to be molded, doused, tempered, heated, etc. to however your mind is set :P

&gt; Edit: Also congratulations on being a redditor for two years! Or perhaps it should be condolences. ;)

Hah, funny story, this is my second account, but it became my main, I've been around the net, seen some things lol, but they also remind me that I have no life T_T&gt; or that there is a certain striving for security and stability.

Uhm... *maybe*, surely it has to, or not, dunno, you tell me :D

&gt; S types tend say something *is* until it *isn't*.

What *is* is taken for granted, *should be* taken for grant, it's *right there* ffs!(S)  
What could be is obvious, it just takes a few steps away from what is seen, it's *right there*, in all this data!(N)

&gt; Does that make sense? Does that seem accurate? Thoughts?

Dunno really, *is/isn't* seems more relative to the Si/Ne axis. Since Si subjective images could just *be* as much as reality, while Ne projects reality in real time to what it offers trough the mind.  

To N, reality is more of an amalgamation of hypothetical converging into something existent.

&gt; Ne as another type of Se when in reality Ne doms think quite differently.

Despite high energy and attention, they are immensely different to me. I'll have to see an ESTP and a ENTP in reversed "roles" to believe the confusion :D

&gt; Ti-Ni is a wormhole down to the deepest crevice of my soul.

That's where the fundamental changes, the bending, the hardening *happens*, within you.

The line is blurred because of that, but the essential argument is that Feeling is still *reasoning*, but what and how it deals with info is fundamentally different from Thinking which is what most understand conventionally as reasoning and rationalizing.Simple, Gammas are complete nutters, always been saying that.

Queue /u/ThisWontDo with a rant essay circling around the point that this is not the case.Grouping types with shared functions -&gt; certain shared vibes.I've heard that the whole alpha/beta/omega temperament was disproved, never really looked into though, so I wouldn't know. ^(But indeed amusing to think :&gt;)Coy ass bint!&gt; So that being said, I'm in the camp that believes you can change who you are because situations are external and you can change how you respond to them by building different habits and ways of reacting. It requires a lot of self-awareness and discipline to change, especially up against family and expectations.

I don't deny any of this. But only when the sun start rising from the west and sets in the east would I believe base cognitive patterns to change in someone's mind.

Anyone can do anything, but for many, *it takes effort*, for others, not as much.Or rather weave the base pattern with many, many others, completely changing nature as a result.  
What originates in the mind, and what one does at the end of the mental process can be wholly different and often they are.

Left is still left, but according to which orientation?Pi or Ji-dom?&gt; I find that on average I'm one that can't let things go. He forgets things pretty quickly.

If he didn't he'd go insane otherwise.Does one need to talk in nonsensical Shakespearean metaphors for to get that you're pleasant company?

When T-users have clear intentions, they can't really ruminate and complicate them too much. So yes, you have to contend with "You're nice." from T users who actually talk to you.&gt; Ever feel that you're not exactly up to their "brain power" caliber tho? I kinda worry about this sometimes

Don't. They don't think nothing of it, so long as you can follow the mindset and not reject it without solid ground, that'd never occur to them.You mean:

AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!&gt; I really don't think INFJs are so sensitive

Fe-aux. Unlike Fi it doesn't concern the ego directly, and is in the aux-tert scale of closer balance.  

I have an INFJ friend who takes pride in the image of being a misanthropic bitch.&gt; Either way, INFJs are butthurt delusional maniacs.

Why not INTJs instead? They make excellent complainers.

INFJs are delusional, but have a more messianic feel really, like all the Beta types :PJe is external structure in a sense, Feeling just involves people most of the time, it doesn't have to be good(positivity is determined by the user still), but more like having clear options and tools you can see.Ah, Daria, the T princess... now if the T didn't also mean tumblr :/I see Je as the natural "authoritative" function, external reasoning, denying Pe exploration due to their nature, limiting when the other is expanding.

I don't mind authority, it serves a function, I just don't like things being time sensitive, I do them when I feel like it(e.g. never) ;0&gt; I'm 14 years old I think I'm perfectly mature.

Yep, sounds about right.Oh yeah... you only follow your *own* "authority".I missed breakfast once and was rather pissy that day, the usual tricks my coursemates pull to not to do anything at university really upset me when it was over.&gt; The model is much less clearly defined as well because everyone has different views on everything.

Well yeah, those who have delved into Socionics have made adaptations of some of their theories and a the vague MBTI stuff from here to where they're confident with their theory, it's a rather combinatoric way to do it.

I've only taken some of the Socionic concepts I've heard from here, never really delved into it. Quadras are rather useful.Take a Big 5 test it will be more useful.&gt; I see it as throwing dices.

It's like throwing a couple of D-100s, and since they're so close to a spherical shape, they don't stop rolling for some time.  
And then you get Ne aux telling you a d20 would've been fine.  

And finally a Si-dom looks at you and is like: What's wrong with just a normal ass dice(d6)?!It's about the atmosphere and that pure force of communication, isn't it? Basically "actions speak louder than words" or rather you don't need words to yell your lungs off and get wasted...

Shut up, snooker has been amazing every time I've seen it on ESPN, granted that's been years ago.INFJs are cute the way they believe they are present in the moment, while actually being in their own cuckoo  land more often than not.

ISFJs are rooted so hard to the ground you've wondering how they even walk. Especially when you can't read a presence for the life of you all between those leaves :D&gt; "ooh I definitely use that" and assumed it was higher up in my stack than it actually is.

Thinkers experience emotion on a much more primal level...

&gt; Ok lol so you are suppose to have the end all be all say in this.

Nah, it's something much more conventional.&gt; Do you think maybe she is an INFP

Yes, those are actual icicles of the essence in the alcohol. They form when put into the freezer. And yes, it's pleasant with olives since they dilute it into something manageable to your liver.

I'll just have my low temp cognac tyvm.&gt; I don't really understand what you were looking for here.

Simple, validation, like anyone else. Except it comes at the cost of devalidation of someone else's being.&gt; But yea I think that's the only problem there.

So the problem is that everyone's guess here is "off" as to what you're trying to communicate?You're telling that to someone who's never been drunk due to the distaste for the actual taste of alcohol.

It's why I don't mind beer, light(aka cheap) wine, and light cognac, which are essentially like soft drinks, with some punch to them instead of pop :P"Objective" or more accurately *external* reasoning exists, that includes Fe btw, but not in the form you define atm.&gt; Like they were just bored and needed a conversation?

Simpler, ego requires validation and seeks it through introverted means(Fi-Ni)-delusion, when denied externally  
(Fi-Se)- interaction.

I wasn't much different in my 19-20s.Yet the principles of validity can be objective: eg- objects are drawn to the ground.  
Sure there has to be a reasoning behind it to *communicate* it, but when it is *done* and can be reproduced, it ceases to exist only in a mental realm.&gt; Rowling's way too blunt with the morality of her books...

Uhm yeah, children's stories can be like that sometimes. Heck even young adult novels as well.&gt; Well if you want to feel special it would have to mean others aren't?

That's the implication. But even so, this is unrelated.

&gt; Is your post an impartial T post or is there a hidden implication there?

Nah, my previous posts were, now I'm being candid.Well yeah, I fundamentally don't get Fi, how the hell it's in the same realm, yet reasons in an alien way!  
Like yeah, Ni is dense af, but I can kind of track and start reasoning it, the substance of their statements, at least the ones I perceive.

PS: Oh, I got confused, it's actually Te. Well, that's kind of better and worse, better because yeah, I get it, but worse because there's not much more to *getting* it, which to me is like: WHAT!? BULLSHIT!&gt; extremely strong and self-defined moral compass that usually guides her actions

Considering her situation where she has no other place for guidance wouldn't anyone? Ti users aren't psychos, and Te users aren't ruthless tyrants...

&gt; Also, she doesn't seem interested in how things work in a stereotypical sense of Ti.

[Why would she be when she already knows](https://youtu.be/HdZsqZKT3oY), and sees no real point to do so, when their actions just reinforce her judgement.

&gt; she uses writing to work through her feelings and whatever is going on in her life, which I believe is something people attribute to INFPs.

Yeah, how often do we see that? It's not a focus by any means, if you're given a writing assignment with whatever you want, hell yeah you'd vent out your frustrations.Good, ISFJs are useful, I had an ISFJ buddy in high school, I could never ever beat him in biology, and he was my "rival" in chemistry. He did it through sheer amount of knowledge, while I was learning on a much more principle based method.How psychotic are you?&gt; Currently pretty much.

Could you describe your mental fatigue, like what's going on in your mind, what you do, why do you do it. Don't spare the context or the keyboard (;&gt; You did not want me to spare the keyboard. I hope you will not regret it :)

A long post, a good post, these are the best when it comes to typing. Writing style, expression, focus, all of there elements points to the intrinsically cognitive directions of your mind which is what we're trying to figure out, no?

I think you're in the Delta quadra: Ne-Si, Fi-Te. And very much an extrovert actually you barely talk about *yourself*, but more what you do and the things that *surround* you. Seeing this conviction about personal expression, seeking to change things, to use them as tools, as fun things(Te-Fi), rather than seeing them as marvelous constructs of navigating the world(Ti-Fe).

So yeah, that boils it down to ENFP or ESTJ, and both can have that same ADD, yet obsess over shit. I can make arguments for both, but I think the crux of differentiating them isn't how many intuitive leaps they can make per cycle, nor how pragmatic you are, but how you treat *personal experience*.  
STJs aren't traditional in the conventional sense, they are traditional in their own world, meaning they make their *own* traditions, on one end it's habit, discipline even, on the other it's a wacky ass weird quirk. But the fundamental understanding is that it's *their own thing*, and they abide by it because of that, they couldn't give a flying rat's ass about social traditions and expectations, they'd rather spit on them because they know better, they've seen better, they've done better. ENFPs are similar in these aspects but are so subdued they don't even notice them most of the time, because they are insignificant than the next "thing" that comes to mind and excites them.

Another way to look at is is Je-dom, seeking external reasoning, with Te being more about order and control, using your tools and skills to change something to a desirable state within the world. Or a Pe-dom, seeking external information, boundless, limitless, limitations are but a means for the mind to comprehend it, there is *always* something out there, and you *have* to see it, that's the usual energy and excitement Pe types exude.Oh, you mean the reason for my quip?

&gt; Good, ISFJs are useful

ISFJs over identifying with Ti-tert and then testing as INTPs kind of irritates me when Si-doms usually kick my ass and their dedicated efforts are something I admire and envy immensely. So yeah, go SJs, may your boundless efforts be recognized... eventually!&gt; The reason I know that my Ne is dominant

I thought we had this convo, do I need to bury you again?&gt; I'm still really confused as most of the descriptions seem very general.

Functions, types, stacks can exhibit *any* behavior for whatever reason, the trick is to track said reasoning back to the mind, to the cognitive process that spurred it. Cognitive functions I see as directions of a compass, where they merely serve as arbitrary orientation of the mind, not much more.

&gt; Could you come up with some more concrete examples?

Yeah, this is why I can't really answer. Usually Te wants this, *badly* (paging /u/ExplicitInformant /u/fuccfas ), you want a clear situation, facts and circumstances, a state of being. While Ti operates through a model, that is constructed for each new theory, creating principles and refining relationships and connections, often they are "incomplete" as there is insufficient info for them to explain themselves in a an ideal closed loop. Sounds like coding, eh?

&gt; Because many expensive words and theoretical phrasing only sinks in when having an example at hand.

So does everyone really. But as mentioned, I'm satisfied with a model, I apply it afterwards. Poropopper is the example himself, and so are you. Te processes *states*, Ti processes *models*, both are focused on factual information of what is correct/incorrect but with a different attitude and methodology behind it.

&gt; I do not know what elements of my life (pretty vague, don't know how to put it differently) are addressed by it?

All of them, none of them, in Jungian typology, every human being is the exception of their type, yet said exceptions are what prove the rules. Immensely confusion and contradictory, but that vagueness has to be accepted, as the human mind *itself is vague, ambiguous and malleable*, and this typology model has to accommodate for that.

&gt;  What is Je-dom and Pe-dom?

Je- extroverted judging: Te and Fe. Pe- extroverted perceiving: Ne and Se.Oh yeah, deliberately so, suspiciously so...My vote's on ESTJ btw, I've been holding that conclusion for a while now.

Same goes for Poropopper whom I will strangle soon™.TJ descriptions are horrible for some reason.Ever hated someone for a moment, well imagine that sticking with you... yes, it's as nuts as you imagine.Cool, too bad it applies to *all* N types.ESTJs massively mistyped as ENTPs *do not help* either!Think that there are multiple levels, and just because you forgive(social courtesy) that doesn't mean they're not out of suspicion for example.ESTP will impulsively vent or bugger off, INFJ will gunnysack when pushed over the edge after continuous provocation.

So in a sense, Pe-doms vent off much more regularly, don't hold in info as much.Both are fun guys with loads of interests. Collecting info constantly, inquisitive, abrasive.

But just like ISFJs overidentify with Ti, so do ESTJs with Ne, when they don't see that the info they are gathering isn't for its sake to refine an existing mental model but to *apply it* to use it for their own ends(Te-Fi), which while more scientific than any N-user can claim, is absolutely against the spirit of Alphas and Ti-Fe in general. Once the scientist stereotype is taken away from NTs, then you'll see that it's actually STJs all along and for good reason.Oh, then you're dealing with a delusional messiah which would take offense to every attempt to question their delusion. It's common for Beta types, but INFJs will be collecting these "offenses" until they've had enough and blow up.&gt; I don't ever see an ESTJ being mistaken as one(ENTP)

Why not?Go home ENTP, yer drunk!&gt; I wouldn't see someone with Fe doing that

Meaning you don't see yourself doing that, why?

&gt; I wouldn't call describing one's family dynamic evidence that she uses Ti

My point was that Ti isn't inherently curious by itself, only when new info affects the mental model they have. And also just that scene shows that she is by no means emotionally conflicted by her judgements either, but she is when new situations come up and she couldn't fathom how to react and to respond to emotional needs. 

&gt;  rather than talking with people.

Well, except Jane, because she's the only other smart character in the show that she can share her "misery" with in comfort of being understood."Fun guy"... T users are just chummy by nature. Same reason ENTJs can confuse themselves for ESTPs.&gt; Just stating my own external Fi-powered uncuddliness.

They're called *fucking landmines* for a reason!Well this has proved fruitful, as expected of Duals :DWhat if I denied your party, because you were bored.&gt; well, looks like I should go to a psychologist and make sure that I'm sane lol

Sanity is but only inner peace and comfort, however one perceives your sanity is but irrelevant to your true character.&gt; I like knowing who I am, and my best role in a group.

The noisy obnoxious jock, aka "The Bro".Why not ISFJ? IxFJs are secret sociopaths, the best there are.Calm down Orwell, it's fine to be an NFP dreamer, but you are no messiah, no one is!Nothing like the pride of the Soccer Mom :D[GO.

MOM!OK, for the record what I wrote roughly translates to "your mom!", which due to the harder pronunciation sounds much more tougher and threatening :DSo, why the obsession? Why do you want a psych profile of yourself so badly? Feel free to rant, don't spare the keyboard, don't mind the typos, just type away and I will read all of it.They're still just as garbage, at least you took a Big5 test which is a tad mroe reliable.&gt; It's like I relate to everything and nothing at the same time.

Well yeah, you're a human being, a complex of all kinda of shades and aspects that are inadvertently your own.

What most do here is discuss a tool for psychological profiling, it isn't empirical by any means, it's quasi science at best due to the methodology of theorycrafting around the concepts of the model. A lot of typing I do is based around tone, certain behavioral patterns, the intentions behind them are what I actually look for, the writing style, motives etc. And even at best I can only *infer assumptions*, and if I do know someone so well with their complexities, it becomes even harder to attribute them to a stereotype that I use as a basis of comparison.INTP. Can't be arsed to give a flying crap about spiritual movements, religions and whatnot. Not as forms of organization that is, it is something personal to me, a personal construct, a personal belief, whatever you want to call it. I like to say I'm more of a spiritualist, meaning I do believe there is more to the world and life than hard empiricism and science, and even if I can wave it as a "product of the mind", that does not make it any less interesting to me.

I appreciate learning about cultures, learning customs, what they serve from a community standpoint and what they serve as a functional standpoint, then make my own twist on them etc. In a sense it's like fiction, it's the origin of fiction, the myth, the belief is what happens to us on a daily basis, and denying that seems shortsighted to me. But I absolutely don't expect anyone else to have such on outlook at all.

Officially I'm Orthodox Christian, but I've never really cared about religion directly. It's funny how 9 year old me who was reading the "Child's Bible" would respond to this :DI've never had coffee in my life :&gt;  
And I've never been drunk either :PJust because I don't consume those substances doesn't mean I'm dysfunctional. I should really develop and establish a morning stretching routine though, as a way to wake up.Never tried coffee really, nor do I want to. And I loathe the taste of hard alcohol, and I just can't consume enough beer to get drunk.So you're essentially telling me to drug myself just to see what's so good about it eh?

I'd just prefer trying my Dad's personal coffee tyvm :D&gt; Do it. I'm your friendly neighbourhood ESTP.

\**gets his airsoft gun out.**

&gt; It's like beer

I like beer, light or dark, with chips ofc :D

&gt; And yeah I'm telling you to drug yourself.

\**files a lawsuit case**

&gt; Millions of people can't be wrong right?

Yes, yes they can be, immensely so! 

&gt; More importantly, you trust me don't you?

NO! I absolutely do not trust you random internet stranger whom I have compulsion to shoot at on sight!

&gt; In all seriousness, there is something wrong with the way society treats drugs in general. The haphazard use of caffeine is indicative of that. Caffeine can really change your life just like any substance with repeated use.

Well, except cigars with whatever they claim is "tobacco" inside, which doesn't have much to do with the actual plant, which is produced in my own country! I have enough fun drugging myself with soft drinks and junkfood(student life) :D

&gt; And coffee is.... An acquired taste. It's like beer, you're a strange person if you enjoy your first cup of coffee. The best you can hope for is 'okay'.

Which goes back to: *WHY?!* It's like hard alcohol all over :D  
I kid, I liked Tahini by itself, it's really bitter, but if chewed where it gets sticky, it's actually almost sweet, like stuffing yourself with sunflower seeds lolAh, it's just amusing to me and gratifying in an odd way when I get to act like hipster just because I haven't developed a habit many are used to. 

I'd even give up soft drinks, I just need actual fruit that is *not* expensive or be like plastic.

However here's a pet theory: Se users, even inf-users can tell the the chemical state of their body because it's a sensing experience directly affecting them. While for Si users it's more like how that sensing experience is *different* from the usual cycle. Like for example I always want a liquid with taste after I eat, so I used to eat cucumbers with a bit of vinegar after dinner. I still eat salad regularly, it's just a pleasant habit, e.g. I don't do it because it's healthy.

I also bet this is the same reason people easily fall in love with cooking, because you get to indulge yourself at the end of your efforts, and every little aspect of the eating experience is under your control to be altered.Sign me up, please!Uhm... you should know better about me specifically by now :D

But I do love my Ni-infused insanities&gt; The Internet has nothing bad to say about them.

Well aside from being immensely delusional mentally disturbed manipulative bitches who can't tell a a heat drought from a flood.OK, ethereal *thoughts about thoughts* can be valuable, but I'm one of the demented few who sees said value.And how many threads are there for the ~~doormats~~ SFJs again... oh wait, Sensors suck, so uh... yeah, fuck yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooou!

Also as a Gamma, the volatile, aggressive side no less, more often than not you burn people to a crisp while deciding to torch their ~~bridges~~ cities.&gt; /u/Critsrc says something insightful about Ni and/or makes a sarcastic cryptic comment (depending on mood)

...

&gt; #(depending on mood) 

[**ಠ_ಠ**](https://youtu.be/JkDb52gTVSE?t=14m54s)Well, you know, you could just ctrl+f ... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯&gt; to avoid the deadness inside?

Eh, I've been there, now I'm fine with it :PYeah, but that's taken as "boring" rather than "practical"."My way or the highway!"  

That's the most often noticeable reaction, but there are loads of other subtleties in its expression.F: *actual* Ni-doms, doesn't have to be physical even; Se-dom as the "teacher" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  
M: FJ  
K: SPs, delusional FPs, SJ posersYou should know quite well.You're essentially exhaling energy over trivialities, dramatizing them instead of effectively solving them and be done with them.  
That's the gist of his thoughts whenever he hears you complaining.True, it just hit me that ESTJs have an ENFP aspect to them :DAt best I relate sports to Sensing, be it Si or Se, anything that requires such discipline and exurbanite practice is something distant from iNtuition which has a completely different focus.

This is more of a pet theory, it's obviously something that's more based on the person than their type. But I'm convinced that Sensing cognitive preference edges out *easily*.No jokes here Mr.ESTJ ಠ_ಠ&gt; so the way I phrase things I don't think really has much to do with my type

Oh my god, I've been typing people wrong my entire life, how is this possible!? 😨

Ok then sensei, how shall I type from now on? From [photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4rr2bq/submit_a_picture_of_yourself_and_well_give_our/)?Here's more broad stroke for you, since you like it: *this is common human behavior, it is required for communication of interests*!

Now depending on the functions and stack, intentions and thoughts differ, but a lot of them end up being the same behavior wise.They had it right below, mind fucking can be satisfying in its own way lolWell, your default process is a *mindfuck for others*, so your concept of a "mindfuck" is on a whole different level :DTasting food and its particular textures are innately a *sense experience* that Si users can selectively focus on. It's a repetitive task, but as you know Sensing also defines the hedonistic tendencies of people: how to indulge yourself within the world. So why not make it a pleasurable experience?

Like, my Dad(ISTJ) always makes the morning coffee because he has made specifically to *his* taste of how a coffee should taste through the coffee machine. Another of his quirks to tasting sense experience is fried chips, he's the one doing the cutting, because he knows the sort of the potato and how big a piece has to be, and for how long it has to be fried for it to be crunchy, yet have a bit of meat inside if it, so it won't crush your teeth, and allows for more texture than packed chips from a convenience store.

Heck, even Se users would gladly tell that they enjoy a texture rich meal they can indulge in. Si just savors it lot more and seeks to replicate it due to subjective influences, it can easily become an obsession.

So yeah, the goal is to savor and recreate a "sense experience" the user has defined as "good", "pleasurable", so they strive for it. And by that nature of course they require *detail* so they can apply it in reality, simply by carrying the *information itself within them*.

It's not that others can't do it, but the way Si lends itself to this focus of "sense experience" that is savored within the subjective gives such characteristics. Se can also lift out a lot of stuff and follow the instructions, but it would be a more improvisational process of immediate creation, based on judgement. Ns... is a whole different aspect, which as usual seeks beyond the realities and experiences. It's not that you can't cook TK, but rather you don't quite see its *direct* affects as clearly, hence you ask :P&gt; I wonder if the Ni-Ti interaction here illustrates at all why it is a mindfuck from your perspective:

Exactly the jackhammer experience it is :3&gt; I wouldn't call it an obsession but there's a flavor of focus on this layer of things

As a Pi-dom focusing on patterns, weaving focuses and influences you know how blurry and thin that line is :P  
And keyword is *can*, not "usually". 

&gt; Actually in my case it is that I can't cook. But that's just me. :)

Unrelated still: I don't know wheather to praise you for holding that out for so long, or to call a hit on you for being a bad host :DI think it's because of vague and basic *familiarity* with it, it provides a base, but not much else, not to mention it's just to support the dominant which it *shares attitude* with. Meaning dom-tert are *by nature* intertwined and the influence and support of the tertiary can be rather easily confused with the characteristics of the dominant process and *vice versa*.  

So the overestimation can become an issue when you put descriptions of the process and then attempting to apply it with mediocre results at best. It's where theory has to meet reality that the tert simply isn't developed nor can be without being overshadowed by the constant dominant process, which is the *constant default state* that is to be supported in the same realm.

Sure I can talk about Si, but touching on its true nuances and complexities is beyond me, without having to retreat into Ti-Si territory that is natural to my thought processing.

It's also because of such factors that individual functions are hard to stereotype, because stacks intrinsically work with *all* four functions unanimously at all times. It's also why I'd like to see more ISTPs comment on some of the less rigid aspects of Ti and how it helps adapting rather than locking models into abstraction.&gt; I'm sure I'm a bad host, which is one of many reasons why I don't throw parties.

Then you're a GREAT host in my book! I hate parties.I get to be emo now, yay!I don't quite get the stigma around this color, but then again I don't really care about colors in general.

PS: Sticking with emo flair tho, this was just a test.Have you tagged as ESTJ, were you with that flair, or were you with an ENTP flair?ENTP - the cool debater  
INTP - the cool scientist/analyst  
ENTJ - the corporate elite  
INTJ - the mastermind  

INFJ - the mystical messiah  
ENFJ - the diplomat  
ENFP - the zany unicorn  
INFP - the cute poet

ESTP - the annoying jock  
ISTP - the mechanic/handyman  
ESFP - the party slut  
ISFP - the artist  

ESFJ - your nagging soccer mom  
ISFJ - your neighborhood religious doormat  
ESTJ - your awful boss at work  
ISTJ - your stick-up-the-ass dad  

What regulars here are trying to do is to distance away from the **BIASED** stereotypes and create *functional* stereotypes instead. Meaning, shared *cognitive, not behavioral* patterns, values, quirks etc. that can be seen throughout people and having this language of navigating the mind itself, in the end to understand ourselves and the greater mental space all the better. At best the descriptions only scratch the surface of types, and some characteristics are just human, others are just outdated(SJ "values") and invalid. In the end it has created this false image of intuitive being better, more interesting and capable, when sensors are boring, stifling or annoying. 

When the reality is that iNtuitives have a greater distance from reality that hinders them at all times, and only in specific, niche cases are their natural thoughts directly useful to a situation, while Sensors by nature focus on the reality surrounding them, always paying attention to it and adapting accordingly, having a much better mindset as to what to do and what to expect, sure it's mundane most of the time, yet that's exactly how the special cases stand out all the more.&gt; I am genuinely curious to know why people believe the way they do

Zing, and that's how an ENTP cannot be confused with a TJ!Present something with more than 5 words and you can forget about your campaign.Ever considered ESTJ? Aside from Te workaholic tendencies, that can also be seen as hermit like behavior with the projects.Eh, she gets frustrated from this kind of newbie stuff as it is very regular to see, and after being in the rabbit hole for too long, it's hard to recall what the surface was like.

On the other hand, one of the most psychopathic types giving pathos advice to the token Feeler is deliciously ironic on its own :DNow if you only had the eyes to be able to focus on the people and the more immediate, relevant stuff :POK, exaggerated, but I'd hear how it is not the case.Especially when they're self-taught and are used semi-seriously, on top of the party being familiar with what I'm referencing.Nah, it's normal, characters being killed off is quite the trend right now, but it solely depends on the way the media chooses to engage you emotionally, and that is no easy feat by any means.

I read a book where the husband of the protagonist died a very unceremonious death, driven by his sins. But at the very end, she died in circumstance that was befitting to the tone and herself: jaded, corrupted, self-loathing etc., sure it evoked some pathos, but it was an underlining rather than a rollercoaster.THEN GET UP ON THAT CROW'S NEST YE SCRAWNY LAD, AND DON'T BE SHITTING UP THERE OR YOU'LL BE CLEANING IT BY YERSELF!It's normal for anyone.Nope, never, maybe as INTP, but I rarely visit there.&gt; 'it's fuckin funny and hilarious!'.

It is, but you don't ask why :P

&gt; I wonder which posts you haven't visited yet.

Very few I haven't seen indeed.Type doesn't describe behavior, or at least not directly, hence the "polar opposite" examples you see, when they're essentially different aspects of the nature of the type.

It's also worth noting that *a lot* of ESTJs mistype for ENTPs, since "they have Ne" and are Thinkers to begin with(Te-doms), on top of having a goofy aspect(which is more derived from ENFP tendencies), and you get the mess where ENTPs want to "rule the world" and work on long term house projects that are very practical, essentially changing their own environment, which isn't exactly something NTPs look in doing.BY JOLLY I SWEAR ON ME MOTHA'! IF YE DON'T LISTEN TO ME YOU SHALL \**inhales** **WALK THE PLANK** ALL THE WAY DOWN DO THE DEEP SEAS OF HORRORS AND NIGHTMARES!It's rather simple: Alphas(SFJ/NTP) *do not seek to change the world*, they want to explore and understand it in all its intricacies, for they are the archivists of the collective unconscious. Deltas(STJ/NFP) very much seek to affect the world however they can, *STJs do so in their own terms*, they intentionally *want to change* a situation, a state to something that is beneficial to them.

So if you ever feel like your buddy demands anything from you, aside from mutual respect to opinions(required for Ne exploration), then yes, chances are they are an STJ. ESTJs and ENTPs ramble a lot, both are goofy, have a sharp wit, can be rather charming, but STJs are something of workaholics by nature, while NTPs are more like curious children. Once you through out any allegations of Si being about traditions, laws and such, see it as a functions that circles around *personal experience as it is*, you'll see how differently it affects these quadras.&gt; So an ESTJ would want you to believe ~~and follow~~ their opinion

More or less, they respect their own independence and give it to others. "Assuming control" is done only when circumstance calls for it, aka efficient organizing.

&gt; ENTP is most likely bantering with you for fun?

It's to explore a thought, an argument, even for a mere moment, to give it some ground before fleeting to the next one. This may seem like a game, but it's more of a mental space, a playground of sorts, and they'd really like for their views to be considered as they come up. 

But really, both can do what the other does, but the approach and effort they put in it will be strikingly different if you look for the different queues.&gt; What are the different queues?

To an ENTP a subject of conversation is more often a signpost, one of many to explore.  
To an ESTJ a subject has a point, something to to tell, factually, inherently limited and focused, tangents don't override it by any means, until *a point* is made.

For an ENTP to organize, they'll be much looser and friendlier about it, at best it would look goofy, and you'll do their request because of the attempt and consideration.  
An ESTJ would demand or just naturally flow in, and you will listen because their immediate reasoning makes sense to the current state of things, they offer direction and focus, and their tone settles that reality in.

I can reiterate theory all day, but observation is the best tool to assess the validity of my claims and see for yourself how it pans out.&gt; Heck I'm an ENTP and I even looked into ISFJ

ESTJ is more likely. But just by considering it, gives you more points towards ENTP lolThe best sense of making sense due to it not making sense indeed.You learn to explore and understand greater and broader things at the end of themselves. Or seek to learn in order to change things.

I also like to learn, as an Thinker, but that serves as an *end of its own*, theory and building on top of it is my main focus. I do not seek to change anything, I seek an ultimate understanding that is ever refining, and if I do make something that *actually represents* reality, it may not be even conceived due to how distant it is from reality.  

Yes, it sounds mystical, but that's the nature of Ti more than Si. It can be like that in many cases, it's also why I can gel with the Ni-doms, eve if their shit is denser than a car battery.

Both NTPs and STJs seek information to sate their curiosity, but while Ti users seek out the fundamentals of the mindsets behind them, the essence of the words, Te users seek *application* and *relation to their ends*. And of course ESTJs being much more grounded, *actually planning for the future no less*, much less fleeting, while still retaining the soft goofiness of Ne-Si types, despite being stern, valiant on their own vs the chaotic world.&gt; Plus the weirdest of the four from the mentioned group was the ISFJ

Si users can take on any extreme so they choose. Cons are their haven for a reason.It's less about being conscious of it, because that's a given for functions high in the stack. It's just that the dominant process is more like a constant state of being most of the time.  
It is just that you *always* are looking in that direction, it's something normal and daily that you don't even notice it anymore. And exactly that is the dominant function, it's just such a strong automatic habit that you don't even notice most of the time until someone else, looking in a different direction points it out to you.Especially if said ENTP is actually an ESTJ who is allergic to Fe and Ni completely incomprehensible.[Essentially this?](https://youtu.be/i5hxhgJAlEw)[This is probably why I won't watch GoT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek2O6bVAIQQ).

Especially when I've already been [spoiled](https://67.media.tumblr.com/b7c34be1d442d4d8f7d644da7362067a/tumblr_mjhj6jANfE1s7o6cuo1_r1_400.gif) by the [Three Kingdoms TV](https://67.media.tumblr.com/b5c7daee7c6d577033d49903661d88e3/tumblr_mjhj6jANfE1s7o6cuo2_r1_400.gif) series. Because T is objectively better than F! Because people said so!&gt; you are confusing, but that's what you're going for.

Zing!

&gt; I always believed your flair

That's the social experiment :3

&gt; although it did strike me how... INTPish you were.

It *really* helps being one(and not an ISTJ), though cheekily obscure quirks are something I just find amusement in.

&gt; I just saw you as sort of the antidote to the "all INFPs are cute and cuddly" stereotype.

That would be madsweet actually.

&gt; But in any case, I'm assuming you're 5w4?

Raw 5, haven't tested in a while.

&gt; why are you so interested in feeling types, then? Specifically INFP and INFJ;

You'd think /r/INFJ(mistyped ISFJs) would fit an Alpha, but the delusion there is unbearable, so I don't even post there lol. At least I can expect to rustle more jimmies in /r/INFP which is woefully indulgent.Si, looking for depth(i) of experience(S).YES!Nah, it's more of the nature of Ni taking the influence of a single point too far lol  
It happens to all introverts at some point, focusing too hard on a single point and then realizing it just should be left as it is: a single, unique case.You judge people *all.the.time*, but not only do you not have the balls to present said judgement ^(*^because ^it's ^an ^ever ^refining ^one ^that ^is ^very ^rarely ^final ^and ^filled ^with ^nuance ^and ^myriad ^of ^influences*), you resent and deny when some else presents theirs, that is actually relevant ^(*^and ^is ^a ^single ^example ^that ^should ^be ^treated ^as ^its ^own*).

HOW **DARE** YOU!!! ^/shameless ^shamingActually I was noting Ji judgements through satirized Fe remarks, but it also neatly falls into what OP does :P

So in the end feel free to proclaim [death of the author](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor)!  
\**DIES**I thought I just did explain it. Again, I was pointing out the Ti/Fi-dom process, we are *always* judging, categorizing, filtering information, it's what we do naturally. But often none of that shared at all.

I don't have a particular stance towards INFPs, I just hate the ~~circlejerk~~ hugbox /r/INFP is. Oh, [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4s5h6b/what_are_the_stereotypes_of_the_types/d56v7l6)! 

Last year, there was a series of uninformed "INFPs" which really ground my gears. On top of the regular threads where "INTPs" suddenly becoming INFPs since intellect, thinking and such is seen as more valuable than Feeling and is more reasonable, completely forgoing that Feeling *is* reasoning of its own. 

So I wanted to be ironic, and set my flair to INFP to see how many will be suckered into the cuddly stereotype as I keep sharpening muh troll edges :3  
Now I just keep it, when I post I hardly acknowledge it, otherwise this would be an alt account for gags instead for all discussion.Hah, good luck relinquishing Te control.&gt; The easiest way to tell introversion is where you get your energy from. Yeah I know cliche but it works.

I've always found this method odd. Since social energy isn't particularly understandable to introverts, or maybe Je-infs.

I see the function attitude as *focus* on the *external* or *internal*. In layman terms: Are you always looking for something/someone around you? Or do you find yourself lost in your head?

Of course people do both(duh!), but to what extent. And with today's prevalence on impersonal distractions(phones), it's not abnormal for extroverts to be thought asocial.A true simpleton :D

But also with a true focus.Aaand this is what I mean when I say that xxFJs are secret sociopaths.Hitler was a genuine patriot/nationalist and with a lot of actual experience to back it up. Racism and xenophobia were common in his time, on top of developing constant paranoia and fears when he came to power, to the point where his vision became complete delusion, which was a thin, murky line to begin with.

But my semi-serious points about negative qualities of types are actually true, acknowledging and being aware of them actually *prevents* what you've mentioned. It's this same reason why you don't see IxTPs as complete psychopaths.First off, chances are you're ESTJ. Second off, tried an FP?  
Third off MBTI *at best* helps *understanding communication*, but once context is introduced, it falls into the deep background where that knowledge is almost irrelevant.Considering its origin, that'll be never.Ah, those were the days, I was so waiting for an INTP post.&gt; Why is there a need to antagonize Intuitives?

Because the previous admin was an unstable, volatile, insecure bastard, who had to show his dick to others and then laugh it off as a joke, while hiding himself from his failures and depression.In other words you're less goofy and more impulsive?Resident troll SniperPanda had enough of provocingly trolling here through alt accounts and being banned through. So with FatalFuryGuy they decided to make /r/sensor as their Sensor circlejerk as their answer to the intuitive circlejerks here(which now are frowned upon, despite the prevailing bias).

They included krishol, an ESFP who was here. And thus SniperPanda started shitting on intuitive bias wherever he found it, because the INxx subs are by no means low hanging fruit of misinformation. And thus /r/sensor became something of his personal haven where he could feel good about himself while shitting on clueless people who don't know typology like he does.

For a place to get a laugh and joke it was actually nice. But I quickly got banned once I mentioned to SniperPanda that he's being childish and is in fact hiding from himself.

Seen him here a few times since then, but I haven't heard of him in more than 6 months.Te users. Actually makes me think that ESTJs fit "the debater" better than ENTPs. Since the latter is more akin to throw out ideas *constantly* and see what sticks, it's an exploration process, rather than challenging their validity, which is what J-doms naturally do at all times, defining and categorizing, where conflict easily arises.

The most heated I get is when something wrong is said, but if **I** or the other party is corrected, that's all.   
However more often a Te-Si user won't back down until you show them the ~~statistics~~ facts that go against the impression of reality they hold by, hence why STJs often escalate and keep debates going for a longer time than a TP who would've moved on.&gt; I want to learn together, in dialogue, as we go, no concern about winning points or whateverthehell.

For me it's not about winning, but feeling bad because of not knowing what I *should*, considering I would debate in a topic I'm *very* familiar with. Ties more to E5 "competence".Red because of *aggressive* protest, with probably one of the most aggressive types, while being one of the most timid, the passive-aggresiveness is real! :D&gt; *Textbook ESTJ E3*

...*Other* side of the coin m8.&gt; I got ENP from the heart in the title and the rest sounded like Fe-Ti.

Pwahahahahah!

&gt; Ti because you made a short list instead of an in depth description

[PWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!](https://youtu.be/_n5E7feJHw0)

&gt;  you said you like to think of all possible outcomes but are otherwise indesisive (Ne-Ti).

Or how about being indecisive *because* of perceiving possibilities, in that order. Meaning that a decision can't be made *quickly*, rather than ignoring that a decision *has* to be made.No, FJs, especially IxFJs are secret sociopaths that *form and manipulate society* as a whole. What you understand as "empathy" is *their* construct! [Be aware of the conspiracy!](https://youtu.be/GRWbIoIR04c) Hey, it's not our fault a Te user isn't using RES :P&gt; person even if you don't know what you think you should

My ego still can't swallow it \**sobs**

It might even relate to obscuring my interests from public :/  
When really they're not even related, and am just closing off potential discussion of interests entirely.STs, STJs in particular have a rather bad stigma of being stick-up-the-ass geezers. Based on Kiersei's old profiling of SJs, which were in a post-Vietnam War mindset. When really SJs are influenced by *current* trends the most, and they also make the best example of "generational gap" of 7 years where different societal influences have very different affects.

However the core of the STJ: being steadfast against the chaotic world always holds true. The only "traditions" they uphold *are their own*, and you express exactly that: I have mine, you have yours. Also *achievement* is something characterized by Enneagram 3 type(a different typology system, you might find it better than MBTI-&gt; Jungian functions). And that mindset is characterized mostly by TJs who often seek to *change a situation* to something they deem better, because functionally it *is*.

STJs are fundamental for a running society, they have enabled for it to advance steadily and surely into the luxury it is today. They are the real "scientists" who put theory under the scrutiny of reality, and even more *seek to integrate it in their daily lives* in order to *improve* them. All of this, along with seeking validation for your own actions and completed projects just fits perfectly with your mental attitude and expression.

PS: Also very few Feelers share your attitudes, and they will feel more like exceptions rather than examples.

PPS: Yes, I'm missing the more humane aspect of STJs also being goofballs and chill company at the pub.&gt; a typical Si user?

What *is* a typical Si user?

I'm not being coy or sarcastic, this is a genuine question.OK, the reasons why thread like this is frowned upon: typing a person through a 3rd person perspective of their behavior is immensely flawed because there is too much distance between the target person's *mindset*, which you're asking us to classify. And it's like shooting in the dark, not only does behavior not reflect mindsets and cognition, but having it presented through another's biased view of their behaviors makes this almost an exercise in futility.

However what you've described is textbook ISFJ.

&gt; -Can come across very... absent-minded? Dumb isn't the right word at all because she's not, but she can seem a bit oblivious at times. She is actually very intelligent.

Introvert...

&gt; -Has a very outgoing and fun group of friends that she's very close to. Protective of the people close to her.

Je user with their company.

&gt; -It feels like she's always sort of taking care of me. Always asking you if you need anything.

Seeking a practical method of keeping a positive atmosphere: SFJ  
NFJs seek a more immediate method, looking to point at the intention, desire of the other party.  
SFJs are open when they want to know you, they don't want to guess, they want to *know* from experience, even second hand experience.

So yea, ISFJ, plain and simple, it's almost disturbing.&gt;&gt; Si types cling to the beliefs they were taught as a child right?
&gt; Likely

Correction, *if* it was a positive experience. If they've been burned by it, ofc not.&gt; ESTJ's don't debate, they tell you how it's done and if you're not listening you're just an idiot.

Huh, sounds a lot like political 'debates'... as in, what most understand as debate...

&gt; Besides, that was a joke right?

**ಠ_ಠ**[SHINE!](https://youtu.be/E9haH_EvFM4)FUCKING BRILLIANT!!!

\**bookmarks**PWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

One word in German I get and you kill me with it!&gt; Why do people have to keep repeating this?

Because a lot of info about MBTI which people *look at and read*(e.g. NOT Socionics, which is very respectful to Sensing overall), it just turns out from descriptions than Sensors are just inferior, less interesting versions of iNtuitives. With today's world of constant distraction, where a word written is as good as any, the idea of iNtuition is just a lot more interesting as it is, since reality is boring, why else do we want to escape it through constant distraction?  

Sensors are naturally intrigued to intuition, and with them getting test results as Ns, they embrace that image of being capable and competent of both aspects of the N/S spectrum. When no one ever points out that lower Sensing has its major drawbacks, and yes, some of them include just being bad at execution and *real things*. While to Sensors, that's the entire point, to *make something* in the end.

&gt; Isn't all of this a matter of perspective?

Duh, now if said perspective wasn't dreadfully warped by misinformation...

&gt; I mean this forums is majority N's

Si is what most understand under conventional intuition. When something repeats time after time, surely it's bound to happen *again*, hence why Si users are ironically more "clairvoyant" than Ni users who'll be damned if their murky assumption is correct or not. Yes they don't make random offshoots, but what they conceptualize is so tied to the mental space on a such a basis where externalizing it to reality is a Herculean feat on its own.

&gt; I just don't understand lol. I find these post pointless

Too bad, because I find [these kind](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4t4rt9/yeaaah_no_this_kind_of_thing_needs_to_stop/) of posts absolutely abhorrent!

&gt; please don't categorize Se users with Si users.

Yeah, yeah, you're freely excluded. Now if only ESFPs could also be here, if they even cared...

But Si users are the biggest offenders. Until the SJ image is completely reformed as proud pillars of society that they are, this will never change. For every N you see here, I will bet you that 2 out of 3 are mistyped Sensors.&gt; So really the only accurate way is just her taking the test herself?

Even that's unreliable at best, since most tests use the Big 5 model and slap MBTI letters on top. Function tests are worse because they don't account for functions being intertwined at all times, and how they overlap.

So ask her to take a letter test, and if she gets an N result, flip it to S, and that should probably give you her actual type... more or less.&gt; Sensors generally just don't give a crap about MBTI. I don't know what it'll take for you people to accept that.

When I stop seeing people pretending something they're not!This, it's why I rarely touch typing threads, despite being okay with their presence.&gt; I don't know where you been looking at. But most popular typing websites just pretty much sugar coat everything. Both S and N is just full of positive stuff. You can't even tell the difference.

&gt; Doesn't mean we like them or consider them to be better.

No, but when taking the implication of descriptions that it *is* better, that's where it falls apart.

&gt; Ehhhh. I'd have to argue that reality can be pretty damn fun lmao.......... To the point of being more fun than fantasy,

Drones on their phones and PCs would disagree with you on that(yes, that includes me).

&gt;idea of being "trapped in your head"

You'd hate any conception of being "trapped" at all too. But then again, if you were trapped in your own head, you'd go insane anyway.

&gt; See, this is what I mean by a "matter of perspective".

And perspective is indeed and individual's lens. Until people asking for typing, newbies, don't frown at being typed as Sensors, reminding people that Sensors are the ones actually doing the heavy lifting must not cease.Yes, I'm familiar with word gender basics, my native tongue has that as well, but "the" is actually a suffix to the noun, which is dependent on its gender and sentence role lmao&gt; It's kind of like walking on egg shells.

You mean Legos?

But I call them **emotional landmines** for a reason.[**TRIGGERED!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H91rPIq2mN4)Despite low self-consciousness as a Ti-inf, your typing is correct.I'll refer to [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQbJEG2BqIo) as to what I think about this and why I won't participate.NO!Psychological Types is DENSE AS FUCK, so I'll point you to other material by Jungians who present Jung's ideas in a much more manageable and understandable manner.

If she didn't wouldn't it be even worse for her campaign, since she'd be showing that she's just as bad and dismissive as them. Anything that may come against your point should also be dealt with, STJs invest more in preventative measures.

I lack context, so I'm not even sure that angle is relevant.&gt; I feel as if Si comes too naturally to only be my tertiary function

How so?Examples?Ah, nothing like puffed up STJs who think they're always right.So, finally decided to join the emo squad, eh?

I want custom flairs back, you make an excellect INFj with all that Ji power &gt;:\^DJust... 75% of them, and 15% STPs... you can lump in NTJs in the last 10%, where their amount is still small next to mistypes.&gt; someone's deliberately being an ass. =/

[Sure there is.](https://youtu.be/2IRkiRfbfys)

&gt; Interesting ideas there, but unless I'm misinterpreting it seems like that's largely about strengthening non-dom functions?

More or less.

&gt; Or are you suggesting trying to do Ti focused activities to strengthen Fi? 

Uhm... no, Ti is merely a reasoning that applies itself on activities, Fi is very much the same. Adapting and applying Ti methods on the other hand is possible, but I wouldn't advise it due to how ingrained they are to the person and are actually rather convoluted. But adapting certain, easier, more comfortable aspects of said methods and reasoning to your own is what would do best ofc. That's the entire point of engaging in the unfamiliar.Lemme add ESFP, the shameless whores...Fe is about emotional vibes and queues, "emotional intelligence" is very much a brainchild of Fe(e.g. reading emotional signals).

But in terms of *Perceiving*, I think Se-Ni has the "vibes" thing down much than Si-Ne. Si vibes are more like correlations with experiences. But Se is about the vibes as they are, the thing is that they are less obvious than what is taken as info, yet that sense can still be detected when its subtleties are present, Se users just aren't *aware* of how they detect and react to said vibes, also lacking the language to describe them doesn't help either.&gt; great deal of creativity

I don't know whether marketing, business has poisoned that word for me, when its function is for them to look more hip than they are. But what constitutes as "creativity" in said position?&gt; I think it all manifests in different ways

Yeah, I was trying to specify it, when functions *are* vibes of their own to begin with lol

&gt; Si would probably have a learning curve to correlate the subjective experience to the real world

Yeah, but said experience *is* from the real world, so that step is usually(and often falsely) ignored.

&gt; Se would take time to understand the more Si side of the source of vibes

Well, they have Ni, so really, that's why more visceral, cathartic stuff becomes so damn powerful it become *sur*real.

&gt; which are inherently subjective to the individual because no human is literally objective.

Getting to something consistent is a triumph on its own, getting a consensus on it would kind of break humanity(underachieved neuroscience is the only thing blocking corps from making us *real* drones)Do it anyway! hahahahahSounds more like Je than Si m8Sauce?&gt; rogue, thief, sneaky archer, or nightblade. Really just stealth is my game, haha.

Same really, bit its essentially a puzzle in essence, RPG design has to resort to quite odd, inconsistent ways of dealing with these concepts, and it rarely becomes that fantasy of the sneaky infiltrator who outwits his opponents since RPG combat is direct and simple, aka who does more damage.

It's why I like Invisible Inc. where stealth is dependent of tactics, info, scouting etc.&gt; cute bite size poptarts.

That doesn't mean they aren't insightful, but replace volume with density.&gt; I can refrain from tearing apart /madsweet and other INFPs

Oi! What's you deal with the ~~not-so-~~victimized INFPs?!Title is clickbait, OP is literally Kotaku! ~~BURN THE WITCH!~~

&gt; I've noticed that (unlike individual mbti subreddits) r/mbti has been getting a lot of negative threads..

If by 3 in a row that means a lot, than what do you say to the constant depression/anxiety threads of /r/intp and /r/infp? Are those positive? Or is it the constant emotional validation that runs on fumes?

Otherwise good stuff.&gt; subset of Fi users?

It's not just Fi users, they're just the much harder to relate to and blow up inadvertendly, but are essentially this subset of Feeling reasoning that disregard Thinking entirely that grinds Thinking users who try to define "what is", and when the priority is to project and define "what should be" makes it immensely relativistic, essentially ruining the essence of what Thinking is trying to accomplish. 

Of course in conflict, both approaches run against each other intrinsically, resulting only in frustration. The thing is that extreme Thinking is so sterile in nature that it draws absolutely no attention, while extreme Feeling is so intense that it naturally gets noted. At least that's how I've defined atm, but I'm sure I'm missing the other side of the coin.Dammit, you were supposed to run with the drama play!

Anywho, bad target selection, madsweet is more convictive than me, and you know my type :DIt's fine, I didn't even acknowledge that I wasn't serious either. We really need to escalate one day and have Feelers trying to calm us down :DYa know, I'll go with my gut and say ENFP... That doesn't mean you can't customize the shit out of stuff in computer science. Ji likes it on either Function :PGIMME!  
We need to cook!Damn, you may want to add Chinese to that or?Well yah, OP is obv ISTJ(serious option though), but Ti-doms do still have their own obsession style of circling something in particular for the rest of their lives, and be *really* good at it.It's mostly based on that every IxTx mistype could be ISTJ, since everyone veers away from that, and [for good reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4t98j3/can_sidoms_crave_novelty_instead_of_stability/d5fortl).

But as I said, Ti can approach those subjects just as well. It's not about the subject, it's about the approach.Hah, I guess I'm "lucky" to be typed correctly from the onset. I'd like to consider Si-dom, since it's just so damn common, but I just can't block info as they can, nor can I assimilate it as it is when required. It's just not my nature.- Goofy - Pe, particularly Ne, includes Ne-tert. Alpha specialty

- Witty - Pe again, both, just different approaches. Judging functions also play a huge role in this, but Percieving has a bigger influence I think.

- Dorky - Si users and N-users. Se *can* be dorky, but even then it has this pride with itself that it doesn't come off as "dorky" lol

- Bubbly - Pe-Fi users? Fe-doms? More of a stereotype here really.  Thinkers can be bubbly at best when they can nerd out without any restraint.

- Frank - T-users, STPs in particular.

- Affectionate - F-users. Fi when they let go of themselves, Fe at most times, but more methodical in a sense.Lurk /r/infp for a while :DAnd one of those days, it's followed by an explosion. But I do admire that it doesn't offset them too much.   
^^Gammas ^^are ^^nutters ^^I ^^tell ^^ya&gt; Because I AM actually like that.

Whoa, you're an artist?!I remember a survey posted a long time ago here. The results were:

STPs score highly on psychopathy. Followed by NTPs quite behind them.  
TJs are more sociopathic than psychos.  
The most psychopathic Feelers are SFPs.  
FJs are the lowest on the psycho-sociopathic scale as expected.It's one thing to tread into dangerous thoughts, it's another thing to actually hurt a fly.&gt; Ironically, the one stereotype I can really relate to is nostalgia, which is often considered to be an erroneous trait associated with Si.

Food for thought /u/tk4442 It's more of an invitation to see how nostalgia affects you and your ISTJ.  

I know you're always observing, but have this as another categorization, if you need to define some things (;Definitely Conscientiousness :/I think it's more due to how we're raised tbh

We aren't raised in a patriotic or anti-culture environment anymore. The biggest thing was the emo phase of the early 2000s and again it's just a leftover from the 90s...

Both are in Looney Tunes...&gt; Te (tertiary function in ENFPs) tends to make an individual very curious and inquisitive. Whereas Ti (aux function in ENTPs) tends to make them slightly more introspective, and spend more time sifting through their thoughts before reaching a conclusion.

[Interchangeable...](https://youtu.be/X9uRCKtaOCU) Te is state oriented. Ti is model oriented.  

A lot of it comes down to introverted/extroverted focus. Te sees every situation as unique and is approached as such. Ti converges elements from all kinds of sources contributing to mental constructs.  

Te seeks to *apply* knowledge in order to *reach a desirable state*. It seeks and imposes external order.  
Ti seeks to *categorize* knowledge in an *internally* consistent manner, that is *unique to the user*.

Or in more layman terms: ENFP *do* care about getting shit done. ENTPs care more *how* it would make sense to them.

And yes, Fi categorizes like Ti in an eerily similar manner as well, sharing the same method of internal mental construct, the thing is that its entirely made out of sentiment, emotion, unique, and by nature, sacred to the user. But of course no one would admit to that because it would make them look weak and flaky, when it has little do with that.If there were any I wouldn't even trust them. If you want intertype relationships look into Socionics, but *do not* take their definitions as absolute by any means, despite their tone and style.Ni-doms. Or at least the one I know, an INFJ, she kinda hides it, but she hangs with guys, which give her space to be misanthropic(ally fun) as hell :P  

With me, she gladly shares some of her more esoteric ideas/thoughts since I do accept them as valid and interesting.Abnormal normality is still normality indeed!Here we do *cognitive* typology.

&gt; lifestyle questions and dating questions

Which has little to do with this. We have accepted a model of very broad definitions and intricacies to describe the repeating *thought* patterns behind said questions. What you see is the result, we want to look at the *mental process* which may or may not have anything to do with it from the start.

Creating an algorithm that's supposed to correspond mental patterns, which are hard to pin down, describe, and define as separate entities, require a certain vagueness to accommodate their never-ending malleability and individual development, with lifestyle and dating preferences is just asking for spreading trouble and massive misinformation.You're still an ESTJ in my heart dear &lt;3How I wish I was...Come back to me when you have some progress on your pet project :PMore of a Te thing I feel.If stubbornness is tacked onto a specific function, it would be Fi...

Unless you accelerate her downfall through her own delusion, good fucking luck!Doing something practical on top of spite, not *just* spite. And besides, you presented her priority: make *use* out of someone else's waste.\&gt; Says the INFj....

But no, really, where is that from? Je can be stubborn, but it still concedes to situational factors, Ji.... not so much.I don't visit the ~~not ISFJ~~ INFJ sub. I'd like to hear how you buddies are stubborn though. Je is naturally controlling, that is true.Ah, the critical obsession period :P&gt; they have to show themselves using Fi why they're wrong.

Doesn't matter, blocked out and driven into further delusion...Yeah, I was gonna say, that's stubbornness more out of chronic obsession rather than delusion. Pi-doms tend to be like that.But you can only look at the world through a *subjective* lens!

&gt; What's a Delta?

Socionics' Quadra grouping. *Function* Buddies in layman's

Alpha - SFJ/NTP  
Beta - NFJ/STP  
Gamma - NTJ/SFP  
Delta - STJ/NFP

I'm sure you see the idea now (;  
And I'm also sure now that you'll see with experience how valid it is to group people with shared functions.*Become* the living weapon!&gt; These are not Si qualities.

You're right, these have *nothing* to do with having or lacking Si.&gt; I'm reasonably sure people usually don't switch function position like that, though (INFJs are Ni-dom, ENFJs are Fe-dom, and the dominant function would be the one most present atan early age).

It's not function swapping. It's the process of developing a social persona as the raw character has to be filtered where the idiosyncrasies  are separated from the worldly environment, as to give space more to the extroverted focus of the Xe-dom.  
Or in other words becoming comfortable with the unconscious within the constantly conscious mind.What's the difference you're looking for?Life is shit. Deal with it. Do it badly to learn how to do it well!(Advice I should be taking for myself as well!)  
No one is born learned. And even with the unconscious insight Ni *can* access(keyword *can*, not *does*), the actual process, let alone information is intelligible. And it's also something Si does as well, the unconscious realm is Pi's playground as the world is to Pe. The thing is that it's so warped, so raw in thought that it's rather hard to assign language to it, and when you do, you look like a complete loony. Hence Ni-doms are "mentally disturbed" as I call them.

&gt; but also find myself wishing I could harness the power of Ni

Why though?

But I certainly would like some Je. Yes, I'll worry a lot more than not giving fucks, but I would like to have some order in my life and have *something* to look forward to. But that's just not the reality, so instead, contend with what you've got, it's what you *make* of it that matters really.

&gt; For example I think if the world/human race had a seemingly impossible problem to solve then it would be an Ni type and not an Ne type who would ultimately find the solution.

Sure, finding and explaining, projecting and structuring the solution is easy. Ideas are a dime a dozen, if even much, *much* more. Meaning they are just that, drawings on paper, wanna know who actually *applies* said solutions? *Sensors*, why? Because they have the mindset for survivability and sustainability, not the possibility of it, but the reality of it.

So no, there is no real advantage to Ni, it makes you more of an alien than a productive human being. Now Je on the other hand has a lot more potential as I see it, but it sure as hell is attached with its own troubles as well.You're being envious that you don't have psychopathic/sociopathic thoughts?!  
Because that comes with the package you know.YOU GET IT! I LOVE YOU![Ahem...](https://youtu.be/K8E_zMLCRNg)Needs some work on Si and Ni. But the thing itself is Ne as fuck!Socionics types Julius Ceaser as ESFP and I am actually inclined to agree. Se-doms can be *amazing* in such positions, yes everything will be chaotic, but *everything* will be mobilized.

Another ESFP that comes to mind is Vince McMahon. He's quite the personality by default, despite being a businessman, he just has a knack for theatrics, humor and his energy makes him seem like bigger than life, that's what he exploits and hasn't stopped for like 40+ years now. He is so focused on his project his entire life, that he has no life outside of it.

Don't know ESFJ personalities. Maybe Patrick Stewart, I typed him in a Top Gear interview trying to track his mannerisms. Ofc this is typing through media which is unreliable, but what I observed was rather genuine.

So yeah, ESFx types have the stigma of having the ESF traits which are seen as superficial, flaky and illogical, anti-intellectual etc. basically things STJs find annoying and ruins their parade(Fe in most cases and Se-Fi overpowering their Fi space, their comfort zone with their own).

ESFJs are in my quadra, they touch an aspect of my own cognition that fascinates me yet I just don't practice, at best I "mock" it when it's more of a cry of lacking proficiency in it(/u/tk4442 , /u/lilyknightmcclellan , /u/rubis_de_tenefix   [; ). While ESFP is 100% roommate who is a stand up guy keeping me in reality, checking if I am aware of my damned life merely through his presence and casual remarks. Yes, this friendship doesn't feel "deep" as I would expect a friendship to be(it ISN'T!) but he's just as glad as having me, to cull the drama surrounding him in absurdist cynicism.&gt; 75% of reddit  
STJs

Yup, sounds about right.&gt; But my view is that ADD/ADHD is a cultural diagnosis. ADD/ADHD numbers are far lower in Europe in comparison to America.

YES! It isn't and never was a thing here in my country!I honestly don't know. But some historical sources should clue you into what Ceaser actually was as a person. 

As for McMahon those are my own conclusions of his productions and the atmosphere surrounding his product.But Si was nothing like you, was it :PBe yourself, but at the same time be able to compromise and go with their flow from time to time.  
And like any relationship(romantic or not) communication is key. - CONSUME

 - SERVEBest MC!Sounds beautifully ISTJ. Unfortunately the internet is filled with great misinformation about SJs, Si in general. So aside from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-4DZHKJdI) there isn't much good material about ISTJs unfortunately. Unless you want to dive into INTJ, which is basically a caricature of Si-Te in some form or another.Being cutesy ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯It's a caricature of Te-aux more than anything. Otherwise it has some qualities of Pi, edging more towards Si(future ~~proofing~~ planning), and just general qualities of T users overall, topping off with common human behavior...Nah, this is just salesman tactics that are just awful. I feel bad for the people who are told to nag their customers like this.&gt; (most get mistyped as INTP - people just see the Si-Ti logic but ISFJ system building has a clear flavour that's different from INTP's system building)

If you are inclined to indulge me, can you describe this in more vague detail?&gt; INTPs are typically guilty of explaining too little - most people don't see the implications of statements made as naturally, so they end up making some statements, seeing a bunch of consequences as self-evident and moving forward

\**CritSrc is nailed to a wall**

&gt; Things get defined a priori as accounting for all cases and being mutually exclusive.

That is indeed limiting, and not really cutting things apart contributes to a sturdier mental model.

&gt; To caricature, extreme bad INTP communication would be a single sentence, and extreme bad ISFJ communication would be explaining the totality of the field of physics. Both typically would benefit from hewing a bit closer to the middle.

Pretty much, when I start explaining, it's hard to decompress what I've adapted as "known info" which becomes second nature to me and retreading it from the start is basically a relearning process.I think functions, i.e. Sensing/Intuition is a better contrast, as it point to the fundamental differences in Percieving, irrationality of the mind.

Rather than the attitude of the functions Xe/Xi which are something of a secondary categorization to the 4 main functions, which have common differences for each function.

I say Ji plenty of times because the way Fi and Ti process in the mind is similar, but the fundamentality of *what* they're processing is immensely different it's alien to either user when they meet.  
While Te, Ti both focus on the consistency of what is correct. The content is very similar, but due to i/e focus the result is very different and shows the priorities of the user's unconscious, rather than their function.Percieving is hella lot more vague, yes, but I still stand by that implicative info vs concrete experience is a greater divide than current observation vs convergent observations.More like Ti-Si and/or Ti-Ne with a tinge of Fe :PFeeling as a mental process is mocked and undervalued by reddit, which is dominated by T-users(i.e. a lot more of them visit than F-users, not that Fs are a minority).

The thing is that Feeling engages the ego much more directly than Thinking, and more so when trying to engage on a Feeling based discussion and language the T-users naturally feel uncomfortable and easily mismanage communication.  

I used to be that asshole arguing against cute things, comedy, venting, FEELZ etc. The opposite of that is the overindulgance in such things(FUCK /r/INFP!). Both are forcing opinions and moods on you, as many things when learnt in moderation, you mature, it's a necessary process, and the internet is an endless supply of all kinds of people, young or old, unfamiliar with aspects of their psyche/character and those who are etc.You mean ISFJs Mr. ESTJ.Both extremes still deserve to die tho &gt;:\^]Not really, weren't you a regular when I switched?&gt; I see you as atypical like blueottersocks (is that her name?) and few others.

His* I believe. And we're all Ti-doms lol&gt; It feels like an excuse to be different.

Why be different, when you can be special™Because you're ISFJ, or because they're actually ESTJs that find you cute.

If I were to go by applied Socionics that is :DSure, but if you want me to sob with you, you'll have to get me drunk. Otherwise you'll have to contend with patting on the head :3I never said *you* have to drink. You just have to get *me* drunk, especially when I hate the taste of ethanol.  

&gt; Anyway, what is it with xxTPs and wanting to pat people's head? Does Fi bring out (p/m)aternal instinct in you? :p

Nah, it's more like a Feeling acknowledgement that is intentionally patronizing :D :DSwitched the flair ofc.Ya, flair's an ongoing quirk of mine.Ne-&gt;Не-&gt;No

It has nothing to do with typology, it has nothing to do with cognition and exploring the intricacies of the mind, it's all about ~~validation~~ supporting each other as the magnificent, special™, fragile flowers that you are.

It comes from the descriptions that tell them that they are unique, deeply compassionate people with amazing personal morals and a knack for writing. Due to the Forer effect(have general traits that appeal to people, and tell them that they are such), anyone who is remotely comfortable with Feeling(SFJs in particular) can identify with those traits, hence you get a mish-mash of ALL the Feelers ~~circlejerking~~ supporting the endless "depression" venting, accomplishing and learning essentially nothing. There isn't even anything to learn Feeling wise even, how to appeal to others' sensibilities, what are your own and why? What is the rationale of Feeling(it's a *rational* function ffs!)? How is that different from Thinking which is seen as conventional logic?

There is no real discussion either, it is diluted and has long lost focus of what it is says on the title: an MBTI type and discussion revolving it, not /r/Feelings .

That's why I hate it and mock it. However I do not obsess over this as I post like my normal self despite my flair, at best cover a bit here and there of being a Ti-dom, by replacing it with Ji(which is a coin term for Ti and Fi together).

Oh, and /r/INTP is the same deal, more mellower with FEELZ, and *somewhat* productive, but I don't give it much credit. /r/INTJ is just circlejerk with power mongering mods.Oh... I don't know... *MBTI/Socionics/Jungian typology*. Not necessarily like this sub, but more focused on the type as people naturally do.Not really, but I am admittedly asking waaay too much for people who just got their test result and just join a community.  

At best the Sensor subs, or the Extroverted ones.Gammas will steamroll through everyone, after they're done they'll realize they have no real structure or sustainability outside of warmongering. And all just to have it crumble from Delta's "righteous resistance movement". 

A lot like real life, no?

Btw Alphas and Betas have no interest in conquering scenarios, the most conflict that is comfortable is friendly competition lolDeliciously coy, but still ahead of you :P

BEHOLD MY POWERS OF FORESIGHT! INxJs got nothing on me!Brosuckhood! Or would you prefer Brosackhood!&gt; Gammas words are "a place for everything and everything in its place". 

You do realize that Deltas won't stand for that forever.I imagine this in the context of a raid :DNah, [let'er rip!](https://youtu.be/Cg257Yi8Os8)&gt; There aren't behavioral similarities, really, in quadras.

Yes there are, immensely. Extroverted and Introverted types are immensely similar. And when you include sister types then everything falls into place. I'd even say quadras are a good criteria for behavior because the distinct values each quadras exhibit *can* be tracked. Behavior is often a bad example for cognition, because what you intend and what you do are two exorbitantly different things, however quadras are broad, yet specific enough to at least narrow down someone's type and then determine on which end they lean.

Alphas are like the archivists of the unconscious, they seek to explore the human condition, understand its fundamentals. SFJs create communities for such a reason, while NTPs endlessly explore the facets surrounding it. Yet the fundamentalist reasoning cognition they all posses can be even focused on scientific efforts, theoretical ones, SFJs not only make great co-workers who foster a comradery , but are extremely knowledgeable about their subjects of interests.

Deltas can also obsess over their interests, but they seek *change*, they impose their will on the world, to resist the world's whims with their own desires. Their experiences are fundamental to their desires and vice versa. ENFPs are just as pragmatic as ESTJs when push comes to shove, and INFPs are more comfortable with dealing with their own faults of the ego. Sustainability in this life is what they value the most, the STJs "provide" it while the NFPs remind them of the human nature to keep everyone sane and afloat. 

Gammas are embodiments of chaos as I see them, the experience is what it is, their desires triumph with their power. They are the most grounded out of every type, but internally, they are the most malleable and confused. The primitive nature of the human is what Gamma introverts are always aware of, how unstable it is, they feel it, they know it, yet the only experience they see is the world's own. Hence why they have the most potential power with the most potential downfall, they shine the brightest, but also in the shortest time. True one-track minds that commit with no remorse, a bad experience is left behind for a new one according to their ever malleable whims.

Betas are post-apocalyptics, they adapt or die. They test the limits of the human mind and body against world, they do not seek to impose. Quite the opposite, they *invite* the world to impose its whims on their minds. That is how they learn the most, that is how they "evolve" beyond their primal condition. They can mobilize like Gammas, but are considerate like the Alphas, the best toolset to truly explore the world and temper the human condition to it. Hence why they are capable of great feats, that can bring people together and advance forward with similar verisimilitude.

Yes, I'm favoring the Sensor side, because that is the obvious one, with Intuition being more of a background support, *which it is*. Sensing is common for this reason as well, it is responsible for evolution and progress, Te is a tool of that, because without information, there would be nothing to categorize or apply.

Keirsey's temperaments do make sense behaviorally, but we're looking at *cognition*, which can be falsely represented by behavior. Hence why I am all for Socionics Quadras as a *criteria* that is broad, yet specific enough that is actually capable of uniting those separate worlds.

Here's more of an example: Compare ThisWontDo's, Komatik's, jermofo's, BlueOtterSock's and my posts here(all NTs), note the tone, note the content, and most importantly *the expression*. It's all similar in content, but very different in the points we focus, approach and express, in the end understanding fundamentally different things through different methods, as much as we try to adapt what we think to words, the differences are there if you know how to look for them.Everyone wants blue :]&gt; I don't see why people shouldn't still be able to make custom flairs.

This would solve everything.

\&gt;Pick a type  
\&gt;Pick a color  
\&gt;???  
\&gt;LOLISFJ, but I have feeling you are dehumanizing her...While fair, you are scarey to the original hosts q-qAnd the goofiest.Except SF, ST, NT and NF are clubs which focus on the first 2 functions. Also a concept from Socionics, because it has *every* grouping you could make &lt;3&gt; socionics does everything rather than focusing on what is actually logical

Which is what exactly?Now this is something I will gladly validate.  
You are comfortably INFP, why? Because you're chill, natural and you are yourself, with no pretentious to what the type is supposed to be.  
Even if you have clearly obsessed about being or not being an INFP, you are still forward and honest about it, you don't want it, you don't identify yourself as it, you just want to be sure how the theory applies to you personally, because you have found value in it.Cuz you loud motherfuckers can't tell what's genuine or inauthentic, to the point you yourselves are sending mixed signals that are interpreted very differently.&gt; TK hates INFPs?

No, she doesn't hate INFPs. She had a really bad experience with one that has had a lot of influence on her. She respects and understands Fi but has also been burned by it, and since she gives a lot of weight to real data, she uses it as a basis.

&gt; When you flip the perceiving functions, it becomes easy to feel that the other person is oblivious in almost comical ways, and it's likely in that situation that they feel the same way about you.

Why do you think I call Gammas utter nutters? ;_;&gt; Intp = texhnolyze

Damn you know me too well. But honestly it seems like an odd mix of an Alpha/Beta show. Oonishi genuinely wants the best for Lux, to keep it in certain order, despite its suffering existance. Ichise, like Lux is more of a Beta, base, primal, but non-intrusive to the point of complete apathy.Who wouldn't be?  

I also liked The Legend of Korra from S02E07 and so on. Fuck the ending though, that ship should've stayed fanfiction, it was my ship too, but I was more flabbergasted, insulted than validated."Anime was a mistake."

~Miyazaki HayaoGet in the fucking mech Shinji!You're both Betas which makes it deliciously ironic to me 👌Not really unfortunately. 

Redline is way too upbeat and colorful, not really something indicative of a Ti-dom. the intensity and viscerality is certainly Se, but less so Ti, it's much colder, dehumanizing even.

Welcome to the NHK has an ISFP protagonist as I believe since his delusions are very malleable and intense, Si delusions are more of a hard nut and reject a lot, the narrative they spin doesn't implode in itself as easily as Ni delusions leaving the user confused. Not to mention Satou is actually rather impulsive.

Haven't seen much of the others which is a real shame on my part lol  
Which actually makes you quite attentive to what the cream of the crop of the medium is.&gt; Shit...weren't you an INTP who used the INFP tag to troll?

[Hi!](https://youtu.be/PIHsoD7-VGs?t=7s)

&gt; I'm not really familiar with who falls in which quadra.

I'm Alpha(SFJ/NTP). Beta is NFJ/STP. Gamma is SFP/NTJ and Delta is NFP/STJ.See Big 5Actually no, the middle of each is supposed to be the best.##*ゴゴゴ* **ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)** *ゴゴゴ*

[For the ~~N~~Fs who don't give a f!](https://youtu.be/nJI8JDnLH3Y)  
If you see it as personalities, yes. But it's more like trait measurements. Think of it like weight to height ratio that's supposed to be *optimal* for the body. It's run by statistic rather than being vaguely generalized for every single person.You're still treating as typology, I am trying to tell you that *it is not*. It's an empirical measurement that compares your trait to a general one, that's all.&gt; INFP 

ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

This is ESTJ material. Does Te have to enslave you for you to recognize it?!  
The social expectations of women have rubbed off on you OP, you've adapted some Fe tactics, but solely for your own interest/ego in order to cover up your more colder, candid Thinking nature, which has its uses, but work in conjunction with others regardless whether you like it or not, so you accommodate for efficiency's sake.  

And yes, there's also that little excitable ENFP in you when you're not obsessing over something or in "get it done" mode.Arguments for Fi-dom?&gt; Has own meanings but are afraid to express them

Well, except here, a more comfortable subjective space. I'd still throw it in the argument of a female T adapting feminine qualities. Essential to Je-doms, even if it is not in Te's raw nature, doesn't mean it can't develop and adapt such techniques in order to achieve said expectations required from them. As I read the entire post it just reads Je-dom, note how *everything* relates to an external situation, not the subject herself, she describes how she relates to a world state, not how it affects her, hence the *Extroverted Judging* preference. 

And another thing is that she sees accommodation as a means to her own ends, so I chose Te, not for itself to create conversational grounds, as one would expect from Fe. The quirks and obsessions are more of Si-aux Ne-tert things that show the world in a much different light than Te. &gt; I have never been typed as ESTJ before

*No one ever does!*  
Because the ESTJ stereotype is horribly outdated and completely misinterprets the essence of that cognitive type.

The only traditions Si users uphold are *their own*. Those timely obsessions/infatuations you have and how you adapt them to your daily life. *That's* Si, *you* make it a habit, it's not forced on you by any means, it's a result of *receiving information and integrating it into your own reality*.

Otherwise this just reads ESXJ. I'm very much inkling towards ESTJ as you seem to be more out for your own agenda, having own projects and directing towards certain goals, which is more of a TJ mindset. While FJs accommodate to create conversational grounds and share interpersonal data, following the lives and relationships between people.&gt; ENFJ, my mirror match is INFP.

OK, OP has to expalin what they mean by Mirror relationships. Because ENFJ/INFP is one with *all functions in the same positions*(Fx-Nx-Sx-Tx), but with opposite attitudes e.g. i/e are flipped.

In Socionics this is the *Contrary* relationship instead. Mirror is sister type, e.g. ENFP/INFP.&gt;  Op, if you read the descriptions for those types,

You do realize no one in their right mind would agree with your average ESTJ description, right?

I doubt [even this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1suo_F7ceg) is convincing :/

I'm still pushing for ESTJ tho./proud sensor bias!Yep, you still don't get it Mr. ESTJ-san :9You're just jelly of SPs, aren't you? :DWhy would I be jelly of rambling nonsense?At least they're *rational*!Si can be anything and everything at the same time. You can have the weirdest and the most conventional people in that type.Why are you devaluing my insecurity of not being a sensor? ;_;Well, it is evident, but let's say it is not for the reasons the internet states :3It's why you may also see them with a rubic's cube as well :D&gt; If anything I've just learned more about how human nature plays out with regards to group identification.

ZING!  
Now with this I identify greatly!That is actually impressive.[You fucking people!](https://youtu.be/AkcL6wzCJl8)Can I suggest ISFJ?&gt;Yeeeeeeah, I'm a basic SJ type!! Hooray for mediocrity!! 

There is no such thing! The only thing characteristic of SJs is that they are more affected by their *personal experiences* on a cognitive basis they develop their entire lives. That's *it*! And that experience could be *anything*, *[anything at all](https://youtu.be/u3SzOzm8lmo)*!

&gt;^^^better ^^^dead ^^^than ^^^mediocre

And this basic mindset is an example, some who is content with what they have and keep going regardless, with diligence and consistency, in order to adapt to the harsh chaotic reality.Because usually people *do not* identify with Mr. Stick-Up-The-Ass Inspector who OBEYS ORDER.Edge embraced? :P  

Well, I guess I'll have /u/crowdedhighways on your INFP seat in my mental space.You were always cool (;[Basically the male version of you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZneBEiFMgFU)

&gt; ~~It's not a phase mom!~~  
A lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee 

[Awww](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Amy_Lee_of_Evanescence_@_Maquin%C3%A1ria_Festival_07.jpg), so that's how people idealize you lel.

Ever asked them why?&gt; Introverted intuition forms a framework

Stopped reading... this is Ti.Frameworks are exclusive to *Rational* functions.Nothing you've said indicates Fe though, I have feeling you're just with an ESTJ, which would be a rather common case. Fe has more of a socialite feel to it, less so with pure application of the physical world.&gt; So this is an Si thought process

Precisely.

&gt; but causing un- Si dom behaviour.

Cognition is not the cause of behavior, it is a factor, but not a direct causation.

&gt; What's the deal?

Introverted functions focus on the *mental plane*, meaning it's all in your head as you describe. What goes on in there cannot be observed directly, it can only be assumed, which is, again, and introverted process of its own that looks at the *psychological affects* based on what information was observed.Totally supporting your case here!/shitpostSpecial™ Feelers  
That's who. You forget that they are specialists in masochism...OK, let me fix this.

&gt; [You are] Totally supporting your case [of Feelers being more understanding] here! [/s]&gt; But it is not a very organised system where I can just pull information from at anytime

Tbh I'm more like this. It might be a Ji-Si thing, a bit more than Si-Ji, since Ji can define. But I need Fi input for sure, yo /u/crowdedhighways, do you often associate scenarios/situations and whatever emotionality with other info in your mind and you *clearly* reiterate it back to yourself.

&gt; afraid of change.

Wrong stereotyping, Si is good at habit building, yes, and some do just prefer being rooted in their comfort zone. Others, not so much, due to the richness and broadness of experience they can appreciate from changes.

&gt;Nor do I think anyone would describe me as a stubborn person

Again, wrong stereotyping. I think it's more of a Je thing who feel like they *need* to state their situational position, but it could still be anyone and everyone.

&gt; I am very oblivious to my environment (often clumsy too), have a horrible sense of direction and daydream a lot

Yeah, that's called an Introverted-dom, your mental attitude is directed at the unconscious, the self.

&gt;  Unlike them, I often forget details over time or once I lose interest in something, even if it was something I was once very passionate about.

That's called being *normal*... otherwise I can't say it's too indicative of anything.

&gt; I rarely see tasks/creations to their completion because I lose inspiration/get bored (unless there's some sort of deadline or its rly rly important)

Eh, modern generation, world of distraction. Te usually does its thing mostly to get it out of the way.

&gt; Now with the ISFP thing, the biggest thing stopping me from thinking I'm a Fi-dom is that I don't think I have any specific values (I can't think of any, except for things like you shouldn't kill people or whatever) and I don't think I believe in anything enough to the point where someone can't change my opinion about it (I can be swayed by others opinions very easily is what I mean).

Well, FJs are secret sociopaths after all. But it's also just being young, aware of the vastness of the mental scape outside your own bubble of regional specifics of people and places.

&gt; But all the other stuff about "live and let live" and trying to be yourself are things I can relate to (although I will admit I do have a tendency to sort of mirror people I admire or want to be like, which I suspect is Fe. But I think that everyone should strive to be themselves instead of changing to fit in.)

OK, this might actually be Fe.

&gt; I suck at games where you need to think ahead; like chess (or is that more Ni than Te?)

T thing would be my bet, trying to build a correct framework of an object. Such games just require objective knowledge, T is more apt for such tasks, while F is apt for human knowledge.

&gt; I an ISFJ, ISFP or something else?

Young, rambling, messy, confused....

&gt; (Plzhlpme)

When you provide a clearer stream of consciousness, sure. All of this is too behavior focused, a raw expression of thought helps best, as it reveals clear intentions and stylings underline the basic patterns of their cognition.

So yeah, most of this stuff is rather normal. If you need a type, I'd go with ISFJ, but I can't be conclusive in that.Yes, functions can never be on their own, but the very act of language and writing is a process of a Rational function which Ni isn't. Ni looks at *the implication* of the psychological affect on the user, while Si looks at the *affect itself*.  

Both converge on certain points, but the implications Ni observes on an unconscious level are chaotic and unpredictable, they touch to the bases of the collective unconscious. Or in simpler terms, they observe the primal mental human plane, hence the patterns they choose to rationalize and share are so insightful yet can't actually explain how they got them, just because it is such raw material from the unconscious that assigning words to it is a difficult process, hence their language becomes ***dense*** and ethereal.

Si has a huge role in the collective unconscious as well, it evolves it on constant basis, creating new content that is etched and shared. Tales, myths are born of experiences, and Si is the function that enriches the collective unconscious with said experiences.It's more of an observation that people who claim to be "Highly Sensitive" do so in order to put attention to a quality they've assigned to themselves in order to receive it.  
Instead of well, *being* themselves, and earning attention by natural means.

I mean, like yeah, I troll and quip left and right, but first I do it for my own pleasure, not validation.&gt; These are people who've been told their entire lives that they're "too sensitive."

Yes, I call them emotional minefields!Ni-doms can be immensely absorbed in thought but physical stimuli is also processed and received by their cognition which takes them out of their mulling, and it is *jarring* to them.  
But having that similar concept applied to Feeling which is inherently rational, even if based from emotion, kinda makes Jungian theory irrelevant, since the point was to separate those patterns for clarity's sake.  

I'm still not really convinced, that's why I said it was an observation(/r/infp ~~circlejerk~~ hugbox is a bad example), not that I disprove the label completely. And if it is what you're saying, I do think it is possible to temper it, or at least not show your reactions at the moment.&gt; what do you want these to be in relation to?

Leave this be for a few days, have it marinate in your mind in a calm manner. Then you may start a new thread with a stream of consciousness on *whatever comes to mind*, be it your day, what you just remembered, what you associate with it, personal interests, how you approach them, that kind of things. There's no need to filter here, being weird is part of any human life, and being nice doesn't mean you can't be critical with yourself. So just a casual stream of consciousness should suffice really. Even if you still focus on behavior as a result of it, it would still be telling of your cognition regardless.

&gt; How have you managed to learn about the cognitive functions and learn which points are stereotypes and which ones are not?

Tricky part is disassociating popular stereotypes with stereotypes closer to Jung's vague, yet broad theory, hence why I'm hesitant on giving a conclusive type at *all* times. Some popular traits are just being human, others are outright false and glorified, a few are on point, but still miss the essence of what Jung was trying to separate and pack into functions as shorthand.

&gt; Any good resources that really helped you?

Experience being a regular here mostly, and [Micheal Pierce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dqqGGUEN60) of course, even if she sugarcoats things, he's on point.I think he means the recognition they receive from their bravado. For essentially talking themselves up and through sheer force of presentation they get recognized instead of the usual STJ being recognized for their actions without the need to remind others about it.Sure thing Trump, you narcissistic compulsive liar 😂The last thing they would want is a mum after all 😂Could just as easily be ISTJ. He's describing rather specific scenarios that have occurred to him often enough where he offers his own solutions to them.&gt; Also, this guy for sure uses Ti. That's the one thing I'm certain of, he knows how every little part of every little thing works. And he's so concerned with WHY it all works, too.

Not necessarily indicative of Ti, Si seeks information on a constant basis, Ti processes information instead."Thought" as in being in your head, not Jungian Thinking lolLel, he deleted his comment.

And for the record, I've learned from the best about Ni-Ti, but I'm not that confident about Ni-Fi :DBut you're supposed to be a [shameless whore](https://youtu.be/7U1aUt7kd8M)!  
Well, my ESFP rommate jokes about that, but he's a folk music orchestra/choir organizer and lead singer, so he's had to adapt to that.It's fine to have dreams and ambitions, but does the thought that they might not turn out as you imagine them worry you? Like *how* do you deal with that aspect?Te makes it less blatant, more sanitized, since it does adhere to *objective and factual* categorizations which Te users expect anyone to understand. Feeling as you know, even Fe, muddles things more easily in order to be appropriate and keep the positive atmosphere(as how Fe has defined ofc), while Te seeks towards a situation they deem better, but considering their emotions and desires first, involving others is still just a check if they align with their goal instead of being on equal footing at all times.

So be *very* thankful that your ISTJ is honest with her intentions and desires, they're often uncomfortable with sharing them.&gt; I haven't experienced this at all with the ISTJ

Well, you're both partners in crime, it's kind of hard not to be on equal footing &gt;:D

&gt;We do seem to kind of organically be in strong accord at that "meta" level of overarching goals and purposes and even shared values.

Precisely.Nope, try again.&gt; Ni looks at the *implication* of the psychological affect on the user, while Si looks at the *affect itself*.#ゴゴゴ ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) ゴゴゴ&gt; But I can't do serious stuff

Who said it has to be *presented* seriously :D  
You could present it as an EPIC MASTER WORLD DOMINATION PLAN! Because sheeple do not know how to exploit this super secret, yet super simple knowledge, the scrubz. 

&gt; Haha shameless?

You missed the link in that :P&gt; MBTI culture paints the Sensors as idiots, SPs in particular.

ftfy :&gt;You know this hurts right :(I think it is atrociously biased towards iNtuitiveness instead...You're implying that no others would appreciate blue :D  
Though I'm *very* biased with blue :P*Especially* the mistyped ISxJs!*Even* you! ಠ_ಠThe profiles and descriptions have to be scrapped and redone from the ground up, that's the essential problem, but only on the surface. The way people start identifying with the false stereotypes, donning them and spreading misinformation just muddles everything about Jung's cognitive theory.

The INFx subs have ISFJs by the thousands, so does INTP for that matter, why do you think it's just as depressing?

If you think about it, INFP would have quite more odd and controversial opinions. You know political debates? Yeah, like that, but actually much more humane and personal, just as strong, but lacking in grounding. Not complete wish fulfillment for Feeling: let's be friends! SFJs *create* their own corner for sharing Feeling, they allow an atmosphere where you are invited to vent away and they will listen, respond and support. Fi is much less pronounced in such activities, just as capable, but more reserved towards it.I may have fucked up with that....When has it *not* been shown :P/r/shittymbtiYou're talking about the psychopathic end of Alphas after all (;

PS: I would participate if the OP wasn't accepted as true, which it is, and instead seen as a false mockery rather than the reality :(TP alright...What you should be looking at is Sensing with this line of thought.&gt; Should all the responses be prefaced by 'I am aware that this is a satirical/purposefully offensive description of types based on OP's interactions with a limited number of dubiously typed individuals, but in that light here is my opinion on the post'? (;

*Not my point!*

I meant that said "satirical descriptions" are what's generally, genuinely interpreted by the many, since it's ingrained in the popular descriptions ;_;  
And then they come here for clarity only to be told that MBTI is a commercialized lie and the vague ass theory beneath it is what one should dedicate to.I commented on this in the same thread of comments, yet, here it is...[That too!](https://youtu.be/ZneBEiFMgFU)&gt; they should be ISxJs

This one. 1 out of then NJs are actually SJs and I am willing to bet you on it! Then there are the INxPs who are also IxFJs over identifying with their tert and being misinformed from the shitty descriptions.For all of IxTJs claims about not having emotions and essentially being robots, they get into heated arguments very easily. While Ti-doms *act* like robots, refusing to give any indications of emotions being present at all :&gt;**I have a very strong opinion on this and I will MAKE you accept it!** /intruding TeFak u!Yes granny, I just said "fuck you" and I am planning how to murder you the next time you pinch my cheeks, I'm a big boy now![Uhm... halp plz?!](https://gfycat.com/IncompleteDefiniteAtlanticridleyturtle)I've always used Skype tho!

But yes, I've also jumped into discord.

More experienced Fs certainly qualify, arguably even more so, since they know how to deal with.It's not just thick skin, but being able to see emotional affect so closely yet not succumbing to it, backing out and reasoning it pragmatically, calmly to where defining a perspective provides clarity above responsiveness.^^Shh... ^^don't ^^tell ^^them ^^that, ^^it ^^hurts ^^their ^^feelings.Flip the N and S and you'll have stats that are actually true and applicable.Massive mistypes due to the Sensor profiles being outdated and outright false.

For the record, it's not accurate, most of the times it comes out an N, and it is interesting for the moment, and they naturally don it here.Nah, they're just in the ENTP sub (;&gt; If only I could read minds. Too bad I can't :c

Well, start with yours, then realize you're actually crazy.Wait, wait, isn't it supposed to be the opposite?! Rambling nutters that have dozens of claims about the *spirit of man*!  
Oh, wait we are talking about ISTJs!Wait I thought he said ESTJs.Correction: They're just wanking in /r/INTJ&gt; Also N's are not rare, you just need to know the right places to find them.

Such as?&gt; 9 out of 10 sheeple are S types.  
Here's my problem: isn't the justification for this second belief BASED on the shitty MBTI dichotomy tests in the first place?

I don't get this question really. I don't quite see the link. So assuming people are more likely to be S types is based on the test dichotomy, instead of this?

&gt; consensus that N types (especially Ni doms) are these elusive creatures

I just don't quite get it.

&gt; Doesn't it bother anyone that we see so many N types here, but apparently none in real life?

Sounds like you have examples. You see a lot of Sensors in your day to day life(outside of old relatives).

&gt; I know the big assumption is that "well N types are more drawn to MBTI so this sub is therefore the world's largest special snowflake congregate", but since when did anyone say that cognitive functions dictate one's personal interests?

OK, so we have that on the right course. But the original argument is that the assumption for Ns being rarer is baseless.

&gt; We really should abandon the dated belief about N's being rare

*How* is it dated?

&gt; "spot the fake-NJ" witch hunts that many a thread has devolved into

Well yeah, NJs are kind of a "guilty until proven innocent" kind of deal. 

&gt; , PSAs warning us that we're actually SJs in denial that make us insecure about our own judgments of ourselves

Like right now. That is considering that Si is massively misunderstood, and on top of that it *is* what takes said misinformation as truth and etches it in your mind ;_;

&gt;  I think it's much better to NOT make any universal claims about universal type distribution

To me, it's just safer to assume Si users really. 

But here's a rather simple reason for an S/N split of 70/30 in favor of Sensors: *Sensors prioritize and affect the world by themselves, iNtuitiveness do not*!  
It is just raw cognitive priority of the Sensor to pay attention to reality, the world, intuitives instead ignore it more often than not. So yes, in a sense they're handicapped, but that doesn't make them incapable, just requiring for them to see the value in Sensing and developing it instead of focusing on the alternative perspectives that may or may not be true. Hence why when put in quadras, you'll notice that Sensors are the ones doing the heavy lifting, the actual work, the actual affect on the world, intuitives instead fall in a *supporting role*, presenting a perspective that is unclear, far-fetched or condensed to where you can't just receive it through experience.

Intuitives being rare is very good thing, once you realize how integral the *Sensing function is to human survival*.&gt;  higher concern for the conceptual, and what connects things together.

\&gt;implying Si isn't like this...&gt; Intuitive can be just as good when doing sensor stuff.

Just as Sensors can be good at intuiting a new perspective. Now try doing it naturally, meaning *all the time*! It's not a skill, it's a state of cognition that naturally leads with certain priorities, you are welcome to rearrange them at your own accord, with the required effort going against your *default state*.

&gt; They provide the innovation this world needs.

Innovation means **nothing** in the face of **integration**. An idea by itself is worth nothing, its *affect* can be worth billions, be it earned or spent.

&gt; Their speciality is innovation and invention, they are the key to humanity's technological advances throughout the ages.

No, Sensors are the key, intuitives merely form the perception of the lock.GIT GUT SON!&gt; What do you mean by this-because if I read you statement correctly, then I'm bad at being a sensor.

Even Se-aux has presence it carries. Like when you thought you wanted something, focusing on the desire only to look forward with your eyes and realize "that can never happen". Introversion means you focus on your own mental plane most of the time, but Si-doms' mental plane *is* their own reality, it reflects their own life, as it has been, as they see it to be, while Se sees the experience as it is in the present form, there's no subjective element of receiving the experience. Despite Fi-dominance, it's a judging affect of desire, ordering the *already received* Se-Ni information.

I have a pet theory that compares ISFPs with ISTPs, like it is said that ISTPs *master* their interests, ISFPs make into an *art*. Meaning that you take the tools given to you from your interest, and instead of learning their manipulation from top to bottom for your own understanding, you instead apply them for your own desire, which by nature is self-expression, you can learn the top and bottom just as well, but only when it is to accomplish what you want to do, instead of scrambling with it to complete a consistent mental model, synchronizing in a sense.

Tangents aside, introversion dominance takes away from your Sensing, but you still prioritize your *current experience* over condensing raw mental information to where it seems to be drawn to. You get a glimpse of the gist of an essence of a mental element, but to *see* it would give you a much more satisfactory answer than letting it go on and on to where it doesn't even seem the same, it's just too malleable.

&gt; What do you mean by sensors pay attention to "reality" and "the world?" Does it mean checking the news everyday, because I check the news everyday. Or is it actually paying attention to global issues? I mean, what's reality for one person is not reality to another. What do we know what "reality" actually is? Is it simply what's in front of you, or is it the world as a whole, or is it something else?

Raw experience, not speculation. Si takes on the news as truths as they present elements of that are already familiar, merely rearranged, and they don't contradict the experiences that are already there. Of course personal judgements come into play that news are manipulative bullshit, and *experiencing* events often has little to do with retelling them. Intuitives simply don't care, they look at what elements of the experience *imply*, and they go wherever said implications lead and focus on them instead of the experience itself. Sensors can also see the same implications, but do not go far with them as they are tangential and to a point meaningless and unrelated with their experience.  
Like you say with "the world" and "reality", since Sensing is focused on experience, and that is inherently limited by the body, a person can be at only one place at a time, giving very limited observations and limited information, but it is reflective of what *is*, not assumed, but *seen* and proven as *existent*. While Intuition takes elements, implications and drives them further and further from said limited perspective and has them being carried on their own, it's not just the presence or repetition(that's Si- conventional intuition), but what they imply and seeing their affect on the world, filled with assumptions to keep the threads holding some semblance of sense, by the Judging functions, and at other times it may not be even intelligible, it was just a perception of elements, but not an experience.

&gt; I'm a sensor who hates sensing. I don't blame intuitives for not prioritizing sensing.

It's not really a choice... ;_;  
You hate Sensing for all the bad experiences, I hate intuition for not letting me embrace said bad experiences.  

&gt; And what's the problem with thinking of multiple ways an event may pan out

That's what Si does, rarely focused on the present, it naturally looks at how something will pan out and how it would affect *their* reality, and what is most likely to happen with the backup of all previous experiences, they can tell what is *most likely to happen*, much better than an intuitive that looks beyond the event and the implications of it in whichever direction, they can get lost in all the speculation, the event itself becomes lost and every which way is given an equal chance of being perceived as true.

&gt; speculating the true meaning of what a politician is saying

By that what it means to *you*, or how *you* see the meaning compared to your own vindications and opinions? To me and many Ne users, it's a power play, Si users feel just the same, but they can't point to proof, while Ne users endlessly assume with no proof, Se sees it as performance, which it is most of the time, while Ni dives into the tangles of said performance and how it reflects their intentions for their power. And of course, all that mired in hard locked Judging, as that's what they exposition, yet sneaking in the subtler affects of Perceiving.  
Speculation is fun in your own interests, naturally, but when you plan something, if anything even, it's for relishing the action, the interaction that gives weight, the experience that paints your life, not the implication of it.

There are a lot of loaded terms in here, feel free to ask for clarifications.&gt; Maybe I'm just an airhead or something

Eh, normal introversion, always lost in thought.

&gt; but wouldn't it be fair to say reality is subjective?

Even Se-doms will tell you that their grasp on reality is still mired in subjectivity, be it their own or others'. Hence why having a navigation tool such as Jungian typology is useful.

&gt; From what I'm getting from this, an Si dominant or auxiliary has a different view of reality from and Se dominant or auxiliary.

Pretty much, on a base cognitive level, people *receive* information differently and that naturally directs them to very different places. Condensing that into repeating patterns is what defined the Functions, they are mere shorthand, just like mathematical functions.Si is rather abstract, but it sure is practical.What was their username? Curious if I'm familiar with them.Ni dominance is more nutty though.What do you identify in yourself with Fi?What do you identify with Ti?The example triggers me, but yes, that's kind of how Ti shorthands work, but also to refute factual data for consistency's sake, things tend to be made up, convoluted, making them more vague in order to be refuted.  
But more often Ti mental models are left open and unanswered in order to be refined. There is crystal judgement, but it is open to crystallizing *more* material as there are hanging nodules.Ehm... ISTJ? And do not even mention [traditionalist](https://youtu.be/JkDb52gTVSE), before you even have a [conception of what Si is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go-4DZHKJdI), which is more often than not your conventional intuition, which is different from MBTI iNtuition, based on Jung's concepts.Si is often described as traditionalist when in modern context, which Si abides by and I'd even argue *"defines"* despite being a perceiving function(accepts info, doesn't categorize or define it really), that's lost its affect and meaning.  
Si is more like habit, a mental plane of sense experiences that paint your life, while it is an archive it is inherently a subjective plane of the mind, making it an imperfect manifestation of the world surrounding you, yet still giving you said plane to orientate yourself in your *own reality*, which encapsulates whatever you interact with giving you a certain sense of awareness as to which constant element moves which way.  
So yeah, there's a lot of nuance and density to Si that many simply do not understand yet is commonly exhibited everywhere in every which culture.Pokemon!*That's* your example of nutty Pi?!  
This isn't even timid, it's just plain normal.I do, it's not a joke, I've tagged him as ISTJ since I saw him explain "Ni", when really it reads like actual Si.&gt; INTJs will often go down avenues that aren't remotely logical, but with a deeply rational outlook.

👌👌👌You'd be surprised about mistyped Fs as Ts since "logic" is valued more in urban societies.

ISFJs are prone to this, but it's less obvious. INFPs who really obsess over their goals may forget that they are desires to begin with.

And of course ISTJs who aren't hard-assed yet take on the softer INTP profile as true, since the skepticism and Thinking constructs are there, but Ne quips, playful attitude and respect of social settings is ignored.Mental respect, basically chillness :PEh, descriptions and then making younger people(who browse reddit a lot more) find scapegoats for what older school minded people annoy them with.

And remember: SJs are literally the spawns of Satan! /s&gt; People on /r/ENTP are Ne **terts** you just have to consider the possibilities :D

ftfyI know the answer to this one!Nope. It should be rather obvious, we are simple creatures :DAs much as I like the concept, realistically achieving it is impossible at the moment.

However: 

&gt; I'm just looking forward to its gaming potential.

When I was with a buddy going through Terraria Hard Mode years ago and stumbling on The Twins, after having our asses kicked and prepping for days, when we fought we were in sync, we could tell what the other intends before we even do it and supplement it. *That* feeling of team work and mind sync is much more accomplishing than any promise or neuroscience development can bring.Contrary relationshipsPerceive the essence behind its factoids through projected application in order to see its positive affects.Fancy writing aside, I'm just saying that in order to see the positives of this relationship, it would be fine to start imagining of how it would be experienced, even if it is based of the negative connotations of Socionics' description. I mean it can't be all bad, and you can still extract something good from bad experiences.

And no I don't have experience of an example to show, since I don't really type people around me.&gt; just imagine how I would experience the other person?

This one :PSi users are arguably better at that lol&gt; and I need to finish some homework.

This pretty much explains Te better than any description :DWhile Ni-Ji looks like stoner speak in comparison :PAnd what would be cool about it? I can tell you that even the most timid Se intimidates me ;_;Actions carry more weight and you know it. But so long as you're not immediately discarding intuitive perceptions for the obvious, you're already doing more than the average Sensor ;PThen you'll have the pleasure of reading that word and then hearing it spoken wondering which damn words were used in combination and which syllables were cut out :DSJs and NJsYeah, it's almost like they wouldn't understand themselves.Ironically it does seem that way, but it's mostly the misinformation that is spread.FJs are secret sociopaths that pull string they don't admit to seeing &gt;:DPi users, yes :DHence the whole secrecy  of it. It's quirky shorthand, I have yet to observe it, more of an impression really.Just presume that what I said is the bs that it is :PPerfectly ISTJ...&gt; I could just talk it out and see it from a **real world perspective with examples**, it would really make sense for me.

&gt; meticulous search throughout different sources  

In comparison I've not even bothered with half of them lol, even when I was obsessed.

&gt; personality traits that might be pertinent:  
\*method of expression and objectivist perspective*

Basically little indication of Ti, which would feature a convoluted mental model you navigate the reader through.  
And with obvious Thinker behaviors, which you see in yourself, adhering to affects of reality rather than the unconscious basically solidifies the STJ attitude. And also the opinionated attitude of TJs, via the expression of low Fi.

It's rather textbook, a clear example even of STJ mindset and expression. Si isn't traditional, it's more like habitual, creating a repertoire or just your own mental hearth of comfort is something many people do not understand properly. STJs in particular, who are very common as well, exhibit this in their own homes, there's always some kind of quirk or project they have going to solidify their position against the chaotic world that affects their "mental hearth", often by long term forward planning in accordance to their *experiences*. Believe me, NTJs cannot compare, what they do is half baked in comparison due to their rush to realize the ambiguities of their unconscious perception-Ni, while Si is a lot more concrete, when you imagine something, you do not see the gist and the vibes surrounding it, you see it as a *specific object* that very much *exists*, instead of pondering *in what form* does it exist, if any for that matter.

And also STJs are the real Scientists of the world who put theory under the scrutiny of the laws of the world. I'm taught many a models in my chem eng degree and I can weave them back and forth within my own mental model without *any* application whatsoever, and not due to encyclopedic knowledge, but understanding that is intimate to my unconscious rather than raw perception. It lingers there still, when it is consciously forgotten, thanks to Si, but Ti is what gives it meaning and how it fits as a puzzle piece than an application.  

The gist is that MBTI/Jungian typology is not by any means scientific, it is merely a construct of intuitive theory, a compass of the mind that some of us find useful in a weird way, mostly for self improvement, giving language to what we already feel in the mind and packing repeating base patterns of the mind into functions(like math), they are stereotypes, yes, but are broad and interconnected, and are not attached to how one *develops* as a person, at best their approach, which can still be wildly different within a single type.

And I pray it never becomes scientifically proven, as companies will use it to mentally indoctrinate people even more than they are now through social media.How do ESxPs fare in comparison? Or just STPs?A Stepford wife as your main villain... that's more fitting for a harrowingly creepy villain than just being evil.Imagine that furor and for of ESFPs then :D  
They can make the most passionate and charismatic villains that just execute convoluted and confusing plans of their own without the care or need to be really structure them, just *do* them and marvel at the chaos of humanity!Execution trumps any vision, sorry. At best I see an ISFP being the "artful serial killer", seeing the act of murder as merely another form of self-expression, but that can also be applied in the method of covering your tracks of whatever half-baked plan you have :D

Though this kind of requires psychopathy, which for Fi user is quite the extreme possibility.Cool, now I can throw you all in the same bottomless pit. I'm not sure if it's actually bottomless or just really really deep with spikes on the floor...Cool, then you should be familiar enough to be fine with it :3Who said they aren't on the walls? &gt;:D\**Throws in ILikeFlannels with all his strenght to arc them right in the center. Jumps in after her!**Through *application and integration*, you know, the part where said "innovation" *matters at all*.Nope, I've long determined that Ji is psychopathic, while Je is sociopathic :P

Thinking just makes it easy and clear, Feeling just complicates it.It's more psychopathic than sociopathic really, that's how I've categorized it. Even if you do see as sociopathy as a subcategory of psychopathy.(these terms lose more and more of their meaning the more I mention them :D)

But on a more serious thought, I do feel like Ti just has a certain familiarity with amoral reasoning, it is inherently tied to the unconscious construct and since, value judgements based off emotional stimuli aren't given the same weight, they don't act as constraints to form "amoral" judgments, which can be convolutedly justified with a bit of mental leaping, instead of a lot.  
It's still delusion in every sense of the word, just easier to achieve than with Feeling is how I sense it.Granted I just finished Pillars of Eternity, whose fantasy setting is based around the idea that souls are an essence and energy that is present in every living creature and required for them to be conscious and the body is merely a vessel for said soul. The concept isn't alien to me, but I've never really *thought* about it myself.

I mean, can you track back the way your perceived that concept?Eeeeh, now it just seems like trying to reason out Si content rather than Ni, which would be much more vague in comparison.

So let's say you discovered Ti and have found a certain argument for consistency in your belief in God. &gt; But let's set factual accuracy aside for a second ;) I'd actually sort Ji in the sociopathic category, and Je among the psychopaths. Je has more regard for social expectations and a better understanding of what's needed to get ahead in the real world. Ji is more independent, and in the more extreme cases has absolutely no regard for conventional morality. So Je is psychopathy: knowing how to manipulate social norms for one's own benefit. Ji is sociopathy: what happens if a person is unable to keep oneself in check/adjust to society's expectations.

Phah, I have the same concepts in mind, just flipping the socio/psychopathic labels lol&gt; Ah, so we're on the same page!

Pretty much. Je-external manipulation. Ji-personal manipulation.

&gt; Was I wrong in my understanding of the difference between socio- and psychopaths? (I very well may be!)

Same, they're personalized shorthands of mine, never pretended otherwise, especially when the net starts taking them and muddling them even more, just like me :D&gt; The only problem is the ethics...

Even by scratching the surface with this, they still managed to touch on human nature in the side quests. It's proof that a team of dozens can still make a game that is more immersive than any blockbuster released this Fall :P

And man, I really like Grieving Mother, imagine what she looks like to others seeing a peasant woman waving her hands in front of PC, who looks like they're having a normal conversation with the person without uttering a word. With that perspective and her earnestness she comes off kind of goofy rather than mystical after a while :D&gt; I ended up with a fair even trade of Ne/Ti, which seems to be the most efficient pair in processing fuckloads of new info.

How exactly? Like how'd you come to that conclusion, why is Ne/Ti proficient for recieving/processing new info?

I'd like to hear that before answering your question.&gt; So does this mean that Te generally tries to stray away form any personal analysis that doesn't involve facts proving (or disproving) their points?

In terms of *expression* absolutely, but it's kind of hard when a Te user starts to argue and engages Feeling, Fi in their case, where they really start just hammering down their opinion as fact. It happens *very* often in debating with them and you can see clearly that they're being passionate and are pointing to facts left and right supporting their argument.   
For statements and finer categorization of the situation, then yes, that's exactly how Te is like, it can be just pointing the obvious, but it is stated and enforced in the external world.

&gt; Does this mean Ti may or may not accept facts if it's consistent with their thoughts?

Yup, I think such examples would be earlier theories in natural sciences. Like the NH4^+ ion for example, it's a complete contradiction that non-metal ions exhibit nonmetal behaviors, aka making acids, when it acts a lot more like a metal ion like K^+, Na^+, Ca^+ creating a base ala NH4OH, instead being an acid like HCl.  
Ofc any chemist knows why(hydrogen bond physics redistribute the electron charge influences, attracting OH^- anions), but looking it from the base/acid principles it is something totally anomalous and shouldn't happen, yet it *does*, and that's a *fact*.

&gt; What exactly defines and develops Ti stream of logical consistency?

Bah, this is where you have me at a corner... Thining is a *judging* function, meaning that it *does* the defining itself, and the development. Ti users are very aware that their mental models are often incomplete, lacking certain parts, certain connections that just don't hold things together. It just has to do with consistency with all the information that has been *re/defined* by Ti for the user to truly assimilate it and handle it as their own, as after all it is a personal, subjective construct that is intimately formed in the mental plane. Hence why "understanding" is a huge part of them, as a person, and when they are proven wrong, it can hit their ego pretty hard, as being correct *is* their ego because it's their subconscious base. Sure, this sounds like Te forcing its opinion down on you, but it rarely is like that, due to Fe they are much more likely to just disengage, but convincing them *is harder* in other cases, since ignoring facts for the sake of inner consistency and delusion is more extreme cases is a quality of Ji.

&gt; For the most part, I feel like I'm able to get a gauge of typing and determining whether someone has extroverted or introverted functions.

See it like this. Extroverted is situation focused, it is proactive most of the time to *set external order*. Te barking commands, Fe swaying away the discussion, defusing arguments, the obvious cases. Introverted is principle focused from the person's perspective, meaning that they apply similar reasoning methods to most of what they are in contact with, it always comes from some other judgements they have formed. Or in simpler words: introverts generalize, a lot of info is summed up into judgements, packages of reasonings, it's very reactive in this sense, as more info is fit into said packages rather than just applied for the situation and discarded, it *stays* with the person, in a minute form, but it's in their mental plane.  
When you give Ti and Te to describe a chain of moving cogs:
Te will look at each cog individually, and determine how *each* one moves accoring to the other, and from what state they come and what state they achieve at the end.  
Ti will look at the cogs and determine that they are all the same shape, with the same teeth and define them as a single cog with different parameters, and determine a formulae that shows what force the proportion of parameters apply.  

While Te will understand the system in greater detail and apply their knowledge much quicker, Ti can apply a similar method to many, many other situations that have nothing to do with the example, it's just a mental principle.

&gt; Is it weird that I can confuse Te for Ni/Si?

It's normal, a lot of people confuse Si for Ni, especially since Si is your conventional meaning of intuition(feeling that something *will* happen) as it is based in the unconscious(your mental plane you can't really pry intentionally into), and is filled with information of the world that matters to you, whether past present, and even future, as it presents what is most possible given the past.  
While Ni is a lot more malleable, it doesn't look at the mental reality per se, but rather what is behind it, which is a lot closer to the unconscious itself, holding a lot of the bases of the human mind. They see elements of experiences, not the experience itself, surrounded by other elements, all swirling around a vague aspect of their mind, an aspect they can recognize but can't really put into words, and of course the elements derived from their experiences come from somewhere else, not their mental scapes. That's how they they often have esoteric thoughts to share, often expressed in a dense language circulating around a point, but they don't name it specifically, they can't, there is just no language for it due to its inherently *irrational* nature(btw Si is irrational too, it just has a better idea of what content). So it's hard for them to condense what they mean around a point, a gist they "get", but can't really apply directly or explain.

&gt; Is it generally true that Ti will be more likely to learn information just for the sake of learning since it's interesting

Thoughts and words signify mindset, as I apply mine, others apply theirs, I seek to learn from them so I can enrich my own navigation of the world.

&gt; Te they want to learn something because it has a purpose or goal or otherwise it's worthless

If it has no application, what's the point? 1+1 may describe two objects, but dumping a pile on top of another does not make 2 piles!

&gt; Te is more like to be open with sharing it's logic outwardly (Extroverted) while Ti is more likely to think to itself a lot before sharing it with the class (introverted)?

Not necessarily in such expressions. But you can still see it behaviorally, Te just applies its "theory", everything is put in place for it to be executed to the desired state. While Ti is much slower, it systematizes content, everything is interconnected and fulfills a purpose supporting another purpose, takes a bit of a while to translate content into a mental system, condensing it into nodes that consistently ping between each other with no hiccups, of course that leaves dead end nodes that prod into directions that are tangentially relevant, but are still products of the system, giving it space for further refinement.

&gt; Does this post feel more Te or Ti in nature?

Well... you are trying the *explain it to yourself*. Or I could be just projecting xD  
If the above is something that feels somewhat satisfying, you can bank on Ti.I hate you!*I hate you*! ^^because ^^you ^^express ^^excellent, ^^legitimate ^^points ^^that ^^echo ^^on ^^the ^^spot ^^and ^^are ^^much ^^more ^^succinct!👌👌👌You're proving his point by diverting and diluting the issue :3So long as it's *their* bullshit, of course!Oooh, I wanna hear this, I'm intrigued and curious.

Sorry, I get your point, but this is the kind of shit why half the population in my country doesn't vote. In the end, it's always a sellout crook on top.

Tbh Trump would make the excellent scapegoat for the incoming 2018 crash.&gt; I'm in California. :P

That's pretty much the only thing I understand xD  
As Cali is one of the last states to vote and usually goes Democrat, so it really depends if Trump doesn't completely stomp NY and the east, while Southwest isn't as split.  
I still believe Trump will win, he's just a phenomenon, a meme even and has become a relevant candidate through that, perhaps he can strike gold twice :3

I want a Trump for prez because he will ensue chaos which is bound to screw the corporatist parties, even Trump's own due to his impulsiveness and how people perceive him. US lives and projects a deep, deep delusion that's been woven into your cultural unconscious, maybe Trump mismanaging or just shouting his "truths" will make some people wake up from the theatre. But comfort is preferable to grim realities as I'm sure many would admit.

&gt; But what I'm more interesting at this moment is your talk of a 2018 crash. This is an interesting prediction. Where's this coming from and what are your references?

Mostly irrational observations. When has an 8th year *not* spelled disaster for the economic world? And now when we're essentially on a globalist scale with 'Murica "leading" on the forefront, pretending that China and Russia aren't killing themselves in their conviction and discipline for economic growth on their own terms instead of brewing "rebellions" and "terrorist" hunts. I think more people will note the bullshit spewing that serves to fill the rich elitists' pockets, since it's *their* system with their power and their authority.Too shallow of personality and development to be typed properly.

Though I proffered Evie, since she just has a design that caters to the stealthy mindset. Also she had the fabulous Shao Jun skin.Tbh MetricExpansion should just lay off MBTI for a while, similar as to how I'm not as regular atm. I've never, ever, seen an ounce of Ni from him, always coherent, always rationalized points, there's no real "translation" between the incoherent Ni perception to words/judgement. Like a statement is as is, there's nothing more behind it.

And it's not that Ni users are *always* convoluted, but at times your bouts can be quite the headspins, not in a bad way (;You know what I say about ENTPs, but even I wouldn't rule out Ti.

But really, leave this for a bit, and have it rummage your mind in a more passive manner (;Eh, depends on how I feel. If I get wordy, then yeah, but my statements are still etched in crystal, but said crystal is usually allowed to grow and be etched again (;If you're that insecure about it, then you are totally ISFJ! /s  

But no, really, I haven't really observed you closely as you would think. You're a cool Feeler who can take a gut punch and not cry about it, that's all you need to be cool in my book, regardless of F type (;I've had a good teacher (;  
Though I'm still wary on my Ni-Fi game, it's not fair for me to just call it alien or "nutty". It is something I fundamentally don't understand, nor do I pretend to.Yup.Wut? I shitpost most of the time! 😂

But overall, there are just a lot of SJs on the net, not excluded from here. Alas, misinformation misguides them into what they want to believe and that is both a blessing and a curse of Si.Ji is self-delusion blocking info instead of false mental perceiving.

While Ni is much more malleable which enables it to fall into an obsession of the false essence readily, but also fall out of it in realization within the same cycle. Besides, a lot of Ni comes down to scrutiny of the real world, while Si *represents* the "real" world for the user.  

But you are correct, the behavior isn't specific to function, but the way it does it is all too common and even shamelessly exploited by media.&gt;  false mental perceiving?

Pi conjuring an image that leads to false judgement, due to info being warped by the unconscious. If unaware, it may lead to misinformation rather than insight.&gt; Heidi Priebe

&gt; **1\. Most of our societal resources are already catered toward sensors.**

Implying the internet isn't a societal source, nor is used by Sensors who are the overwhelming majority as stated LUL

&gt; With sensors making up roughly 73.4% of the global population, it’s only natural that the majority of our education systems, workplaces and social norms are catered toward sensing types.

In a way they are, as the core mindset in their implementation can be still seen in their function. But that's just it, Sensors are the ones doing the implementations, all of them, special iNtuitives™ just had a 1000+ conceptualizations of them for quite some time and even now. But does it matter? Don't fix what isn't broken, adjust it at your own discourse.

&gt; Growing up, sensors are more likely than intuitives to be provided with the tools they need in order to excel.

Or rather they see that raw effort provides for their needs better than anything, there is no meaning or implication behind it. So why really bother if it doesn't concern your life in a meaningful manner? An arbitrary system of vague ass patterns of the unconscious is your last concern while cooking your lunch for tomorrow!

&gt; For many sensors, the MBTI is simply telling them information about themselves that they have already been made aware of

Or rather understand it in *applicable* terms and more directly, *concrete* experiences. They know exactly the feeling, the vibe, some chase after it, others deter from it, for various reasons. But they put their money where their mouth is as they give words and affects their appropriate weight in the real world. 

&gt; **2\. Intuitives – by definition – enjoy exploring theory.**

Implying Sensors don't do that. Sensors are a lot better in researching and building *something* out of said theory, but that also means exploring it first, *how* it would fit in their lives, how would it be applied. The same goes for unconscious patterns. More often sensors demand MBTI to be a science in order to apply it and to understand it on its applicable terms, to use it as the tool it was meant to be, even if they misunderstand the method of perceiving it for what it is.

&gt; Intuitives enjoy understanding the bigger picture of how things connect and relate to one another.

*Si users do that for a living*! Ne users just speculate it to oblivion! Se experiences it and is enriched by it, while Ni peers into the enrichment itself of the unconscious!

&gt; They want to know the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind what interests them, rather than just the ‘what.’

The 'why' and 'how' usually leads to the 'what', hence the conceptualization. But these are interchangeable processes, in the end the affect they have, that 'what' is what matters at the end! But to get to that the 'why' and 'how' are just as much a question a Sensor asks themselves and put them forward in much more grounded and focused terms.

&gt; Since intuitives value the ability to perceive a situation from various different angles, they enjoy using the MBTI as a means of understanding other viewpoints.

Implying Sensors don't kek  
Percieving is just that, taking in info! 

&gt; **3\. Sensors are more than capable of deeply understanding theory – it’s just that they don’t want to waste their time learning theories that are not useful to them.**

This is something more indicative of Te, ^^psst... ^^that ^^included ^^NTJs  
Even in my post I make Te something that Si/Se is, but it's much more different than that.

&gt; Whereas intuitives enjoy learning theory for the fun of it

Queue ISFJs... and even ISTJs for that matter. But at the end of the day, it's what sticks with you that matters.

&gt; sensors who are exposed to the MBTI may quickly lose interest in it if they do not see a way in which it applies to their everyday lives.

Yeah, not just Sensors. But a somewhat more agreeable point, *finally*!

&gt;**4\. The MBTI provides intuitives with a community of like-minded people that many of them have not found in real life.**

You mean like ALL niche online communities?! 

&gt; With sensing types dominating the world, many intuitives types grow up feeling ostracized from or out of place around their peers.

Fuck this mindset. It's a delusional excuse! 

&gt; Even the more outgoing ENxx types often report feeling as though they’ve only ever fit in on a surface level

Extroverts can thrive on surface levels of everything, but then they would have nothing to reflect back on, that's where "depth" and the unconscious steps in to remedy their condition. This isn't even related to S/N!

&gt; For many intuitive types, it is a massive relief to know that there are others out there who think, feel, understand and experience the world in a similar way to them.

Except that I am by no way similar to BlueOtterSocks or jermofo, even if we have the same base cognitive patterns, how we are shaped are wildly different. I mean, I'm kinda scared of those guys due to being an insecure 5!

&gt;**5\. The MBTI provides intuitives with the language that they were previously lacking to describe their problems.**

Again with the cheap excuses. MBTI provides language that can describe certain mindsets, *yes*. Knowing why you thought the way you did, having a compass to track it down is indeed valuable. But it is no excuse for bad decisions or bad actions, those are results of your own devices, deluding yourself with a scapegoat will only result in a downward spiral.

&gt; Intuitives must reason their way to everything

\&gt;Implying perceiving functions reason LUL

&gt;  A continuous lack of follow-through for the INFP can be explained by under-developed extroverted thinking.

See, this is the shit I'm talking about. PICK.UP.THAT.SOAP!

&gt; For the most part, intuitives dislike acting without first understanding the root cause of the problem they are facing.

Really now? I thought this was just Introverted dominant processing. Sure Ti is very particular with it, but I've seen it in Ni, Si as amazing in its concrete projections that seem even more psychic due to their accuracy, and Fi thrives off defining their own meanings!

&gt; And the MBTI finally provides these types with the language that they need to understand and communicate their abstract, existential problems.

Yes, it can explain them in a frame, but by no means solve them. Again, it's very easy to fall back on using it as an excuse leading to a toxic self-delusion.

&gt;**6\. Intuitives tend to spend more time thinking than doing – therefore they spend more time on the Internet.**

Again, isn't this just basic Introverted processing? Kappa

&gt; An INTJ may enjoy designing a system significantly more than they enjoy implementing it.

Sensors also don't always like the implementation, but they sure as hell follow through as they *know* they have to, either to get rid of it and put the experience behind, instead of conceptualizing it.

&gt; many intuitives spend a significant portion of their time reading, researching, debating and sharing ideas online.

If Sensors didn't do that, what would they implement? ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)

&gt; Whereas sensors want to see the potential results of their theorizations as soon as possible, most intuitives are happy to dissect and analyze a theory seemingly forever – and the Internet is a great place to do just that.

Or you know, circlejerking. Validating your opinion to where it becomes a mob mentality... /r/intj 

&gt; **7\. The intuitive community (unfortunately) fuels a sense of backlash toward the sensing community.**

Ah, so this is what it's about, eh?

&gt; Many Ns grow up feeling as though their particular form of intelligence is being misunderstood, disregarded or overlooked by the sensors that surround them. Therefore, it is a relief to finally find a community in which their strengths are both understood and celebrated.

&gt; While finding the MBTI community is a wonderful experience for most intuitives, it has also spurred a unique online counterculture, in which many intuitive types glorify iNtuition as a trait that is superior to sensing and deem themselves a master intellectual race.

&gt; This attitude is often quick to turn sensors off of the MBTI – just as intuitives often see their form of intelligence go unappreciated in the real world, sensors often see their form of intelligence go unappreciated in the MBTI community. This semi-intentionally fosters an exclusive community of intuitives on the Internet – who occasionally sit back to wonder why the hell there are no sensors in the online MBTI community.

So basically young stupid STJs being young stupid STJs in /r/intj  
So what does that make me who overpraises Sensors due to his own lack of follow-through and chronic procrastination, hiding from his life behind the net?Yet it's so spot on 👌Wow ESTJs could be *fun*?! What a revolutionary concept!&gt; when i read your analysis i was questioning whether you were purposefully misrepresenting what she was saying in service of making valid counter points.

First off, for my pedantic tired ass, Capitals serve a purpose, even if you're on the phone (;

But yes, I completely, intentionally, purposefully misrepresented her points for my own select implications. Because it's not whether she implies Sensors can't/Intuitives can or vice versa, it's that vague stuff like this, which isn't even related to Percieving functions btw makes people think what We both said at the end. And this is why I'm this this "crusade" against articles like this that don't even point out the bad aspects of intuition or even low sensing. Just saying "iNtuitives are rare™, but they dominate the i-net, so they can circlejerk" contributes nothing to informing people about theory, how to handle it, how to apply, how to approach it, where to learn it etc. Not pointing the fundamental flaw of approaching it like a club membership hugbox, yet opening windows to using MBTI as an excuse.

And like I get it, BuzzFeed style countdowns are just fun to see, it's easy to write and it spreads naturally across social media. You need to pay rent. But reinforcing the misinformation that plagues MBTI and Jungian typology by extension doesn't help anyone else, it has harmed the "MBTI community" from the very damned begging. 

&gt;  intuitives may have more interest in things like MBTI because they want to find out why they're so weird and struggle to integrate like most others. It's also no surprise that ESXJs get the most crap online because they're the most abundant types in 'society'--pure projection which seems to be more in line with the direction that Heidi was taking.

See, this is exactly the mindset I'm harboring against. Sensors can be just as weird, and even *weirder* than you can imagine. *People* are weird, full stop, interests, hobbies, communities are *shaped by the personality*, not the the cognitive framework that simply exists below it.

&gt; i really don't think most of the implications you're emphasizing, encapsulate what she was trying to reflect at all.

Then what did she reflect really? I'm open to things I missed, I completely admit that I focused on aspects I've seen content like this having on people.If only...You haven't seem him ramble 😂  
It's a rare, but glorious site, even surrounded by his Ti buddies, Ni-Fi comes out.Why? Ni-Ti is nutty as it is.I have an ESFP roommate, he's quite the drama queen. He's a folklore singer, but it's his bombastic, but earnest behavior earns him that typing from me.

And he has another folk singer buddy who I also think he's an ESFP, but even *louder* and more brash whom I just can't deal with.

As for ESFP women, I dunno, I don't really type people actively to follow one. I have my cousin whom I think is an ISFP of sorts, but few observations of her.Pwahahahahahahahah!&gt; I mean, you're not saying you yourself support Trump, are you?

*I* support Trump! Why? Because I want to see the world burn brighter ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  
It would be more honest that way. I'd prefer the fiery cock instead of the whore!

This is a completely unrelated tangeant meant more for reaction rather than being part of your discussion.The best I can offer are Ti-Si oversimplifications that remove nuance and put it in a rigid case of symbols. Meaning it may even *miss the point*.

A lot of /u/relativezen is talking about is the relation of the subject with the object. Let me put forward the theoretical process of INFJ and ISTJ.

INFJ: Real Object-&gt;Se- raw observation-&gt;Ni- unconscious perception-&gt; Fe- external evaluation -&gt; Ti- internal application(to mindset)  
ISTJ: Real Object-&gt;Si- unconscious observation-&gt;Te- external application-&gt; Fi- internal evalution -&gt;Ne- external perception

Of course these are metaphorical and even interchangeable. So let me make it simpler, by assuming you are both working on a problem.

INFJ: Problem-&gt;Se obsevation-&gt;Ni-Ti "recognition"-&gt;Fe shared evaluation  
ISTJ: Problem-&gt;Si-Fi recognition -&gt;Te external resolution

Si-Fi recogntion is *direct*, meaning it relates to the subject on a *personal* level, where it affects what *they like*, *their* comfort, *their* hearth.  
While Ni-Ti is a lot more roundabout in comparison, it is obsessed with the essence, in *understanding* it, describing it in a way that has sense in some form of consistency. More or less ignoring the *physical* affect and the personal affect, but looking it solely from a *mental perspective* that has no *direct* bearing in reality.

Now let me simplify it further using quadras:

INFJ: problem-&gt;apply to mindset  
ISTJ: mindset-&gt;apply to problem

This is the ultimate dissonance u/relativezen was talking about, note how the opposite "objects" are constant for one, yet malleable for the other. Yet one expects their mental processing from the other, as due to knowing only it their lives and how it works, it's just a recipe for disaster. Hence the warning, but you've already has something of a similar affect with a Fi-Si user instead that was so much more dissonant on an unconscious level.  

The way you communicate something most often via Fe externalization has to be received by your ISTJs Fi, *not* by Te, as a solution to an object is to be applied, not to have Feeling engaged more often than not. In a way the compromise is more possible are you are both Fe-Ti and Te-Fi in aux-tert where you understand what the Je/Ji balance is and how it affects the world and your mindsets, even if they are wholly inverted, which can cause dissonance, but still understand the judging compromises if you both understand that your tert is not to be overestimated in handling, but a peer into understanding the other's decision. 

And also agreeableness. Tbh it's more into Feeling territory, if Ti puts out the same marginal answer Te, there is nothing to really disagree, think of it like math: 2x1=2 as 1+1=2. While you've had your qualms with Fi and are familiar with how Fe can actually get to it without tilting it too much. Your ISTJ understands that you have much greater emotional insight than her and has found it enriching to her own, hence she accepts your emotional concerns as something that is equally as important to her as well. Of course this is *my assumption*, but then comes the N question: is this due to mutual courtesy or is it reflective of your actual mindset. Hence the instilled doubt. Which again, I don't quite read from you, but I estimate that you have answered that question as "No.". You're looking for the Si/Ni differences in *how* your mindsets differ and what affects your unconscious perception so that it may *not* cause communicative dissonance between.

Which still comes down to: INFJ/Beta *adapting yourself to the world* and ISTJ/Delta *adapting the world to themselves*. Si is inherently subjective, meaning mental images that are not real can *represent* the reality to the user, more so they are part of the user's reality. While Ni is a lot more chaotic and malleable that it *cannot* represent reality, but instead peer the unconscious from within.  
Hence where Si is a lot more concerned with "real" factors that affect them directly, yet Ni focuses so much on unconscious factors that they obsess over their affected mindset. The dissonance being where the Si user merely accepts the wacko Ni's insights as true when they might not be, not even questioning their validity or origin. That betrays the Ni user's struggle in defining them *reliably* for themselves adapting their unconscious inappropriately.

And again, you both are still *your own particular cases*(look at this, a Je-inf reminding you that a theory doesn't represent all factors of a situation). You are both old and mature enough to recognize these differences and find methods of working around or even *with* them, you both understand the compromises and their consequences/affects of your relationship. You being a 6(w5?), also helps in recognizing how Si-Te pragmatism is valuable to your own groundedness in the world, recognizing not only on a Se- raw perception level, but how it affects your hearth, not just your mindset. And vice versa, how her mindset is just as important as her current state of life, as that is what ultimately directs it, not just the surrounding factors.

And a reminder: this is a much more rigid, distanced perspective through theory and observation of your limited activity on this subreddit. It may or may not be what you're initially looking for, but all the more I hope it helps in your endeavors (;

PS: /u/crowdedhighways wanna see Ni? Read this comment chain and tell me your head is *not* spinning.Due to how rare it is, there is no real cultural construct ala words in language for Ni, unlike Si.  
Hence even with Je descriptions, they are roundabout, dense and even confusing.&gt; I also immediately understood what was meant by shared meta-values vs. shared regular values, so I wonder if the distinction has to be made between Fi and Fe, instead of S/N (so a question back to you, do you differentiate between 'meta' and 'regular' values?)

Meta ala mindset values, what one expects in terms of mental effort/gymnastics, while shared is more like physical/communicative/logistics kind of values which are more tied to activities more proficient for the Sensing process rather than focusing on the unconscious patterns of one's mind as the origin of how they approach. Of course this is just one aspect of it, just the most obvious, but it reaches to other unconscious details I can't quite rationalize as well.

But as I mentioned /u/tk4442  is a 6w5, meaning that before making a judgement call she wants something of a focused perception she can draw a clear symbol from instead of the various tingles jingling around it that give off a similar, yet different shape each time as the slightest difference can give an entirely different meaning. Hence digging deeper for what nuance /u/relativezen offers so she can try to re-collaborate her own observations in a similar direction.

But I think I forgot something important: *communication*! Whatever you discover, you have to share it with your ISTJ TK :D In turn you've gotta hear her out on how she herself perceives it :PI wanted to call Trump a fiery whore(a game reference as I am a huge nerd) actually, but I have the impression he has a wholly selfish agenda, while Clinton's is essentially being Washington's mask more or less :P&gt;One strong point is we've agreed that whatever we each perceive is our own specific perception and experience and since we each have different vantage points, we may see things very differently and that's okay. This helps with simply speaking our own perceptions and taking in each others' without the pressure of then having to come to consensus at that moment. There's an understanding so fat that it's all different angles on the same thing, and we each prioritize understanding what the other person sees and experiences on its own terms.

That sounds like something wonderful to fight for  ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )

&gt;One difficulty is my uncertainty about what to share and how much and when. For example, we had a point of totally unnecessary conflict and stress because I didn't communicate in detail and clearly because I was waiting until we had time to really talk (she gets stressed by emotional processing, so I was actually trying to protect that). I was repeating variations on the same relatively cryptic abstract comment to try to kind of let her know I was struggling and to foreshadow what was to come in the talk, and I wasn't specific, she understandably took it differently than I meant it.

Analogies, analogies help *a lot*. They make an excellent bridging gap between Sensing and iNtuitive communication between *people*, no matter their position in the cognitive stack, even between two Ne-doms for that matter.

&gt;So then I wrote out this very detailed thing based on something that had actually happened, with my analysis and she was beyond appreciative for the concrete example and detail.
And I know she needs concrete detail and specifics. But I don't want to do some sort of Ni chaos (or Ni-Ti processing before clarity) dump on her. And I don't (yet) know exactly what kinds of INFJ-analyses make sense to her or not. I know the Ni-chaos-in-metaphor has felt weird to her before. But in our recent conversations, she has used metaphors and categories to describe her own perspective, which I LOVE because it gives me a perceptual anchor. I just don't know yet what levels of communication will work for us at some of the deeper levels with words.  
It doesn't help in this kind of communication that neither of us considers or experiences words to be our first/most comfortable language.

Well, go back to basics ala pre-school. Get a few colored pens and paper and start drawing symbols to each other. Why do you think the internet [communicates in memes](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3a/25/d2/3a25d2af3967f7160e74023660481d8b.gif)? I'm serious, you know better than to underestimate the power of visual language. Just demonstrate it to her first before asking her to do it, since it would seem childish at first, but that's the point of Feeling exercises half the time (;
Besides, if you start seeing schemes of her plans and how they're supposed to be followed, you'll also be better at following through :P

&gt;&gt;But as I mentioned /u/tk4442 is a 6w5, meaning that before making a judgement call she wants something of a focused perception she can draw a clear symbol from instead of the various tingles jingling around it that give off a similar, yet different shape each time as the slightest difference can give an entirely different meaning.

&gt;Yes, this is very relevant IMO.

Well, you did just say that you misjudged and held a perception in the wrong way. At times you just need to get it out, no matter the time. Just *make* it to *be* the time as she gets shit done :P That's the point of *her* lessons. You are the teacher as much as a student.

&gt; Like, picture a situation the ISTJ usually copes with by moving out of the zone in which she controls her own life and completely submitting herself to the needs and requirements of an external situation but *strongly limiting/controlling the time she will spend doing so.* Now, picture that situation becoming unpredictable as to *when* it will happen, and also now being of a nature that she can't count on a specific time-bounded return to her own (controlled, chosen) life.

If you manage to take this and use it to reverse engineer(backtrack and trace) to my comments, you'll see it more clearly what I was having in mind while writing and even better, with your own relevant context than my generalizations.

And the situation you're describing is your affect on her. STJs *build* their lives around their own control, and you note how being stripped away from her hearth stresses her. But to you, that's *normal*, you've always been *adaptive*, adhering to the situation immediately and navigating through it, rather than seeking to establish your own control and order to navigate on your own terms.  

Betas(you) are like hot steel that is constantly tempered and bent into the appropriate shape. A metaphor for how they adapt themselves mentally and their bodies follow suit to adapt to their surroundings, representing their connection to it in terms of respect and admiration.  
Deltas(SO) are stern as the earth, it provides and holds stern in the chaotic weather affects. Meaning they establish their *livelihood*, using what they have as a resource to fulfill their own desires, comfort and even understanding. What they present at the end are the achievements of their *actions*, not their bodies or mindsets, but their *affects* on the world. As they see the world as a malleable sandbox to build their own dreams on rather than becoming one with it.  

An STJs emotional growth should very much be coming to terms that your actions and decisions are not *objectively correct*, they are objectively *assessed*(Te), yes, but they are still essentially fueled by your own *desire*. And said desire is not mere fuel for working towards a dream, it *is* the dream itself, the origin of it no less, the decision to form the unborn primordial image you visualize and seek to realize.

In hindsight *you* should learn how to adapt *that* mindset to yourself. But not in mimicry, but in a more STP fashion, where you still *adapt*, but adapt to a Sensory environment than just an unconscious one. Like you are actively seeking to focus on what is the most relevant task *at this moment* and execute it in the most direct manner. 

&gt;&gt; The dissonance being where the Si user merely accepts the wacko Ni's insights as true when they might not be, not even questioning their validity or origin. That betrays the Ni user's struggle in defining them reliably for themselves adapting their unconscious inappropriately.

&gt;I want to mark this one out as something I don't understand at all but feel like highlighting because it might be more understandable at some later point.

My idea is that ISTJ accepts your insight as it is without adding or removing anything from it. Hence the *direct*, concrete processing of the info acquired, no more, no less. Yet to you *that's the entire point* to juggle it around and see into *what* it spirals into in the real world, what affect would it have, how would it form.  
Like let's say you're describing an iceberg, and Si only sees the white glacier on top as that is what's there, and what matters. A ship must steer away from it not to sink.  
But to Ni, the top is the least of its concern in perceiving as what is below, how deep it goes, how wide it actually is, does it have underwater formation, what are they? Are there any? Maybe there is anomalous coloration on it, maybe it's a different shape each time, or 2 of them fused together.

Conclusion: Adapting visual language and metaphorical analogies in your communication will help you strengthen your relationship lifeblood(known as communication) immensely.  
But observe the core quadra mindsets in your background: you yourself adapt to the world, she adapts the world to her own.Since we're on the topic of anime: 

- White Album 2(romance&amp;music),
- Princess Tutu(episodic classical opera drama), 
- Great Teacher Onizuka(episodic ESTP life lessons), 
- Welcome to the NHK(depressed ISFP experiences), 
- Ping Pong The Animation(2014)(live!), 
- Kaiji(pure tension and suspense),
- Hanayamata(pure cuteness).  

These are what *I* consider better than any of the series you guys have mentioned :PI think he's the evil one...Eaxctly why I want Trump as US prez, he'll make the perfect chaos storm into such a mess of things so badly that no one can cover it up!I like my label -&gt; it works!Even so, Si is still just as illusive to me. Ni as I've come to understand it comes from TK, Komatic, ThisWontDo and maybe a few remote, anecdotal cases.  
There's always this pattern of trying to string words into something cohesive, when it's not in nature. So it comes off as roundabout, vague and even confusing to me.  

Ti/Fi are strict as fuck in comparison, the language's intention is in the expression of the judgement, rather than the effort in forming said judgement.

While Si in comparison is so ubiquitous in daily life that it's a normality people have culturally accepted, yet not defined in a context of a construct like the cognitive functions.  
Sure, stories and small talk are normal, but often the focus the individual chooses to share can tell you clearly if they are a Se or Si.  

With with Si as being normality, there's little to distinguish. While Ni being such an abnormality, there is no language to note exactly what is distinguishable.

It doesn't mean you should give up, this is merely contextualizing on my part.&gt; (I think) Ni is when you build complex structures in your head, and you "slot" new pieces of information into them. In this way, you are able to get an understanding or a feel for complex systems (such that you can predict how they will behave, or at least feel like you can).

Sorry, no, that's Ti.Aside from his presentation style, which is very plain, but I personally like that kind of content.  
His explanations seek *clarity of essence* while still being at competition with cohesion and engagement even. They are still roundabout and take a few a listens, which can still be interpreted differently as to what he could mean.  
Even his examples conclude on points of unconscious ideas, planting these impressions as a model of sorts to be able to refer to in the actual type, but still noting that it is a singular, superficial even, aspect of someone's personality. Just noting a fraction of a repeating, yet instilled pattern, of a malleable person.

&gt; What function would associate it with sweet things then, like candy, for example?

Si, no question. Pleasure is associated with experience, which immediately looks towards Sensing.  
While for Ni "sweet" will carry a metaphorical sense, like a "sweet" person, a "sweet" thought. A word, language even, is but another symbol to be reflected in the unconscious and explore its possible *affects* within the unconscious plane of the Ni user rather than the concrete experience of sweet taste in different contexts of different foods, places and people.  

Si experiences the affect of symbols in the unconscious. Ni speculates the affects of symbols in the unconscious.  
And the way Si "replicates" reality, it is very reliable in perceiving events as they were and will be, but rarely will it focus on the *present moment*.  

As Si stands on "firm ground" most of the time, to Ni, it's an "endless ocean".France, at certain places can be Se-Fi. But German speaking regions *reek* of Te-Si.📣 ROASTED! 📣\**sigh**  
How the mighty have fallen... an ESTJ from the start, and ESTJ to the end :P  
And this pretty much shows a common STJ approach to MBTI.Ooor just being the beta male wish fulfillment fantasy most anime strive towards...  
If you want to see smart, sympathetic characters, see [Legend of the Galactic Heroes](http://i.imgur.com/RBCMGm6.jpg) - *the space opera* series in every literal sense of the genre.Nothing like unsavored anime elitism :&gt;  &gt; From an outside perspective we might seem dismissive, cold, rude or even boring but once mutual interest is found and trust forms you come to find that it's quiet the opposite.

So basically *real*™ INTJs lite?  

Aside from Fi-Ni being genuinely alien to me, it just creates this environment for an extremely malleable unconscious that even you cannot track or understand, and to do so, you have to reach to the investigative functions ala Sensing+Thinking to put things in some sort of universally comprehensive order. Yet since Fi-Ni is so instilled in the unconscious, which you are mentally focused on most of the time, it is still the basis for your actions, the source of your expression, so the end result often calls to something primal of the mind, while still being inherently yours in every sense, it means something specific to you, but others it could be something completely different which you don't give a shit about :3

SFPs aren't artists in the literal sense, they are artists in their *actions*, meaning that what they do is often filled with desire that is represented in a raw fashion.That is a specific interest, not a broad stroke of cognition :PNo worries, I'm candid by nature (;

Also, you could've just edited your comment lul  

But to answer:

&gt; You actually said that SFPs aren't artists in the literal sense

But I didn't mean to exclude that they couldn't be, but rather pointing that they have a certain nature to be "artful" in their actions and interests, aka they are seen as tools to explore their desires in whatever form. I'm talking in the sense of mental outlook rather than straight real world actions, those are anecdotal to my statements, but rightfully dis/prove it more than any theory I can put out.

&gt; you mean by "stroke of cognition"

"Broad stroke" - a general statement, excluding a lot of finer details. Since I'm talking more about what the theory describes and how it comes out as a mindset rather than application.&gt;  I got provoked by the earlier post where someone asked if sensors rely on their intuitive function to "be smart".

[As you should be!](https://yt3.ggpht.com/-r2RjmSXK0Co/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/_GEgPT00Ues/s900-c-k-no-mo-rj-c0xffffff/photo.jpg)

&gt; I was presented with hard, *tangible* data

I really like this. Sensing is percieving in the most literal sense, you observe what is, what can be:

&gt; swallow[ed] ~~it~~ whole and move on. 

___

&gt; Si looks for familiarity and Ne takes those familiar concepts and recalled previous info and creates associations between them and what I'm currently learning. So in a sense yes, I need my lower position Ne to understand abstractions but that's the case with everything I do.

When a perception that does not match an experience you have had, you have to project one instead, for what literal data there is lacking, it has to be filled with metaphorical data of the unconscious, more symbolic, vague and undefined even by the real world, it has not appeared yet, but to create the image, the unconscious has to conjure it. Hence the primordial "unborn" image of the Si user, something that is real to them as the soil beneath their feel, yet is not present, *yet*. Being able to simulate an experience is what gives them much greater clarity and even preparation for their future endeavors, as the weight of the literal and tangible is taken very much into account, rather than its meaning to the unconscious.SJs are pillars of society. They are (supposedly) most common and I believe that. When it comes to integration, implementation, solving menial tasks, even to just get it out of your heads, you are unmatched and unsung.  
STJs take responsibility by the horns and *implement* whatever progress is applicable. Because your natural mindset so eerily adaptive to just that, seeking and *implementing* practical improvements in your very life for you own comfort, and the current urban comforts we enjoy today are the labor of STJs who have integrated it into daily life.  
But with that, also the administration, laws, rules, and ofc **ORDER** was made by STJs, of course with help of other types, but by being the majority, you have a similar approach to reason, and that is still seen despite everything being seemingly a unique situation, the mental mark can still be seen.  

And all of that is *good*, because without it, there would be no pillars for *anything* to stand on. And ironically it's the STJs that whine for change the most, SPs just do them by force and being bull headed, SJs value the societal structure as it reflects their own mental approach, hence why they see what needs to updated for the current situations at hand. Ns can mostly document the affects and reflect it back at you, they are too few to change society, but to share observations of the unconscious.Weeeell, thanks for putting me in my place regardless :P  ENTP is a commmon mistype for ESTJs. Besides, ESTJs are damn cool and take on life for what it is.~~Ni~~ Si-Ti  
That's quite the mind absorbed ISFJ there.

But just mere percentages of a questionnaire say *nothing* of the complex mental patterns of a person.ISTJ, ez pz. What it means is up to you, you make your own world within this chaotic existence.Ez pz as in easy to determine for me.Every type can develop their own eccentricity for entirely different reasons and different experiences.SJs live in every sense of time, *but* the present, which you're so naturally latched to. But it also strikes at the core of the issue you're presenting, which IMO is brilliantly simple in presentation 👌&gt; it's a good thing to question the premises you're given.

But why though! 🤔They are now and are highly offended by your sacrilege. They are looking up your posts to determine your address and daily life and plot their revenge 😈Aaaand my narrative setup has been completely ruined :(  
But obsessive stalking applies. Right?Look, we've worked hard to establish that Sensors are awesome, because they are people too, very *useful* people as well. And STJs in particular ultimately *make* their interests into reality, not a dream, or a wish.Rather, Sensors tend to see through the dream, by not seeing as such or at all. Add TJ/Te to that, you get get very grounded people who rely on themselves against the world.&gt; Tbh I don't notice it all that frequently in strong Ti users.

Understanding a mindset is so much more interesting though, and baby Fe still helps you adapt it in a genuine manner in order to sync with the talker. It's kinda like unconscious assisted system building, herd to describe, but the end product is a great insight for the Ti user. It leaves ambiguity for refinement, but gives flesh to the principals to where they become topical to world, not just to the personal mental space.   

&gt; "the president is a reptilian,"

OK, that one's amusing, you gotta admit 😂

&gt; Listening to a conversation about stuff like that go on longer than 5 minutes I just kinda lose it.

Efficiency goes out the window? Or the rambling becomes nonsensical after the 5th minute? :PFunctions are intentionally ambiguous, the human mind is anything but concrete, it is ever developing and malleable for every single being.&gt; A Ti type, in contrast, has a tendency to go about cold, detached reasoning in a ponderous, formal manner, really likes having absolute rules and is comfortable with long chains of deduction.

[So basically this?](https://youtu.be/weLwNJerdzs)  
It's not that Te can't also do this, but just having to do said mental effort would be an indicator to "fuck it" and ditch the idea to recoup your losses.But only to exploit them even more efficiently for your own ends! /evil laughterSo it's you guys who instigate the naughty vibes and make them desirable, eh?   

Gammas are nutters, I'm convinced by that every day ;_;ESTPs like to mingle on their own terms and tend to juggle quite a bit between people. Their networking methods are kind of fascinating at how quickly you see them hopping around.For ISTP, there's no particular Ti vibe I'm catching on tbh.  

ISTJ would be the easier answer(as it usually is for me), but there isn't much to infer. You're just vaguely expositing experiences.  

What arguments would you have for/against ISTJ OP? And the same for ISTP as well.  

You can kinda put intuition on the side, you're already approaching with experience, not inferences.For some reason I'm reading ENFP. Obliviousness to reality definitely distances you from Sensing, even Si can be aloof, but even then its grounded in its own subjective reality instead.  

Fi-Te is also more likely as you seek to feel good about yourself and you speak like yourself naturally instead of cautiously filter like a Fe user, they do it in terms of environment, not mental preparation. Also Fe-Ti is not exactly "goal" oriented ala Fi-Te either.   

Not much Ne though, but that could be more related to your current mental state. My biggest advice would be to work on that as it is. MBTI won't provide you with much, it's an arbitrary framework of assumptions, it does not give answer to anything.I just mean that MBTI should not be used to explain behavior, it just becomes like an excuse for bad things. It's a real mental slippery slope I've seen numerous times.  

But so far, you're high Feeling, low Sensing. Basically an NF, aka the dreamy type every lass wants, whether in them or in their men. Oh, how "romantic" indeed &gt;:DThe fun thing is that high Ti can *force* things to be logical mwahahahahah!Eeeeh, every function can be frustrating in its extreme. It's the natural order of things.  
Judging functions are much more obvious as they work within the realm that forms reason.Watching her explain herself with all her vigor and impudence when you're just hearing a child cry "BUUUT I WANNAAAAAAA!"Ne is not Ne /threadP-dom vs J-dom.  
That's where the differences shine through. A P-dom sees, a J-dom concludes(what he thinks are considerations).Ne, aside from being misunderstood by OP, is also eerily tied to unconscious processes, name general introverted attitude, as well as natural Pi-tert functionality, namely Ni in this case. To me the viscerality of her Se examples are more than enough proof and the lack of nuance or energy(whatever there is under is under Ji-dom) of Ne pretty much seals the deal for me.

Also, am I *really* being obscurist again? My conclusions are that dense that when blurted they make no sense?  
Well, at least I know to blame myself instead of going for the natural "ppl r dum" response.

Also Merry Xmas ye coy lass (;&gt; I expected a more generalized pearl of wisdom about the true nature of extraverted intuition. :p

Coy as always (;   
I'm too much in the grind mindset, and not too pissed off or tired for that. It's the holidays.

&gt; Are you really taking shots at people on the subreddit? :o :o

More like relatives... *and the sub* too, I don't need more than a minute to see the titles and call out people LUL

&gt; I missed seeing you around, especially with many of the old regulars slowly disappearing from the subreddit. :(

Eh, we're all lurking. I wonder how /r/JungianTypology is doing tho, haven't looked into it.[T-dom's emotional response to your post.](http://rs12.pbsrc.com/albums/a242/mkenny/BANGHEADDESK.gif~c200)Because it's *his* small talk. You know, the concept of ownership has quite the interaction with the ego that is often sought after by many.If you're up for a bit of slaughter, I may track the addresses of the culprits.Brain damage essentially. Types are essentially stereotypes, one is never intended to fit it, but in general certain patterns ascertain and hold true to the stereotype, hence the identification. An arbitrary naming scheme for the purposes of navigation, a tool.  

An enigma of types would at best be within a Quadra imo, and that would take **A LOT** of effort of a singular type to develop their full stack to where they can see through all perspectives and judgments clearly, despite the dominance of a singular function.

As for what you're actually asking OP. I'd say just leave your MBTI obsession for a clearer day, it will *not* give you answers you seek, only more questions of which there are no definitive answers either. A tool is defined by how you use it.&gt; I suppose I just don't go well with Fi doms, I can't really get behind their way of thinking and it's a little unsettling.

Oooh, this sounds juicy. Could you share some of your experiences? And since Ti is just as selfish, how does it differ in approach that doesn't disturb you?Hey, I *love* it when I see someone embrace the S side, it shows humility and honesty to the self, which is much truer than any outside judgement cast upon you.You're welcome (;  
Fuck you too!Se-doms, period. Intimidatingly sharp and extremely aware, they give off a very energetic aura I just shrivel in. Next to them, it's like I don't even exist, I might as well be invisible. And the engagement is like something I feel like I have to answer to, yet I simply cannot, it's basically looking in a mirror and not seeing yourself, this is what you're supposed to be in reality, to be present, yet you see clearly in front of you what *presence* is, and you have none of it, no connection to reality at all.  

At that point I just keep contact to a minimum and let them seek other means of communication. More developed Se users will find it and we can become easygoing friends.  

Se-aux users are easier on my mental insecurities, and are much more chill, less showoff-y.Yeah, this reminded me that I've coined the term "emotional landmines" for Fi users. With Ti, they're still mines, but like knowledge mines, which are "forced" on you depending on the dumb scale the user has for you. But you can kind of get behind that mindset since externally, that's still meant to help you.Look, ISTPs are [simple creatures](http://imgur.com/Nd4Vk4M). If you don't have something *tangible* to present, then keep your distance and **keep quiet**.  

And tangible means something that *exists*, something they can deal with hands on. Be it a pen, or a project. Just something that would require their action and attention. They are nerds in their interests and keep that world to themselves.   

Cheekiness and energetic social interactions are for the Pe-doms, keep it that way, but do not involve Introverts in them forcefully, it's annoying for them and its ill spent energy for you. If you're still approaching them with this very tone, likelihood is that they want to punch you all the way to the moon.

Again, strip the "interesting" and the "maybe"s as much as possible and present what *is*, you have to stand on the same ground they are on.

Respect Sensing and embrace it, as uncomfortable as it is.I still can't fathom that I called it and then it just became a thing... and *it's active*, which is ubeliavable to me as well.Same concern, opposite direction of mindset.Is Ne+Fi shitposting being shitty fanfiction, shipping and doodles?Se doms in particular make great entertainers by nature. Se-aux feel more awkward, they can deliver but the way it imapacts their self-image is too much to contend with. Pe-doms care less about that.Aaaand what makes you doubt ESFP? Recent events leading to anxiety?So, little experience dealing with other Se users up to now? Or rather you haven't noticed this contention for presence as well before?

&gt;  I am or appear very introverted

Well, by Se-dom standards. Any introvert will be able to tell that your mind is still focused on what's surrounding you. That is, if they approach you. I/E is not just about sociability, but that's another topic entirely.

&gt; On top of that, what I described above as to what I do under stress, does that indicate inferior Te or Ni?

Some would say "textbook examples" even. The primal extremes of lower, undeveloped functions show clearer aspects of their nature that are distanced from the nuance of the developed personality.It's never about disposing of the obstacle, but manipulating them to dispose of themselves &gt;;PIxFJ - the biography. If I had to bet on either choice, I'd say ISFJ, since Ni-doms usually come with experiences where the world is strongly fragmented from their mindset, they feel crazy due to unconsciously observing the the essence of the mind, when most ignore it. There is no such vibe from OP, it's basically Fe, with individualism, but at the same time it's practical, less ideological, you directly apply the positives you desire within the world, instead of adapting their image in your mental scape, for that to happen they have to *exist* to be solidified in your own unconscious instead of warping and weaving their threads into something different.Pe-Ti, ok so where's Se/Ne and Ti then? Because Ti is almost non existent(there's no topic for it to work with either! that's intentional on OP's part). Ti structure as a backbone for expression, but is not expressed itself. For Pe-doms, Ji-aux is what holds things together, Pe is just the fluid, Ji is the vessel, the actual form of the content that is the fluid.  
But this is Fe, projects hard substance to begin with.

There is no real introverted function OP is expressing, despite likely being an introvert, they are not aware of their unconscious, which points to Pi ambiguity, Ji-doms are very aware and also very selfish as a result in their mental approach.It doesn't help that SJs are widely misunderstood. Si in its efforts to reinforce its *subjective* take on reality does create a certain convention that is shared through stories and etched in the collective unconscious as well.  

But let me put it this way if you're thinking about "this relates to that" and you have a clear image or a precise idea of what it's supposed to be, than your Pi function is Si without a doubt. That's what makes Sensing *concrete*, what it Perceives is tangible content, clear as day and existant withing reality in some form or another, iNtuition on the other hand is far removed from such concreteness, to achieve an "insight" a "vision" is a slowburning method of mixing and warping that same content Si looks at as *it is*, what it is does not matter, what it *represents* within the unconscious, the base of the mind is what Ni engages in, with the focal point the user's mind Ni is focused on, that place in the unconscious.  

Si is not "traditions", it helps build *personal* traditions, or rather *habits*. Habits built upon what provides a positive experience, because Si *is* said experience, it puts a third eye on them and provides a magnifying glass to truly build on what impacted you, rather than seeking what essence of aspects impact the mind as a whole. Si focuses on the experience, Ni focuses on the essences of the unconscious.  

I still don't have a firm grasp on Si, because like Se it's simple, concrete, what you see is what you get is Sensing in a nutshell, something everyone takes for granted, until the iNtuitives discover that they actively *don't*.&gt; I like to be precise.

Well, there's your example right here. What a word means is of huge importance, as it has its own meaning depending on perspective. But that's high ass categorization.  

Judging on the Thinking side is reasoning based on what is *correct*. And by correct, that means what is objective, with no emotional or personal attachment whatsoever, the ego is distanced from the reasoning of that content. Accuracy of a categorization of something is paramount in its handling between the hard tunnels of reasoning, because Ti works within the unconscious, like a guide to a floorless planet, you better have those directions *spot on at every point*, otherwise, you'll be confusing yourself.Then it's not an obstacle truly.For the record, this person does not use Jungian typology, I didn't answer because they were talking to a wall. We use completely different methods and theories on psychoanalysis that there is no real conflictI'm just noting that it's a different magnifying glass looking elsewhere.Mind if you can put that introspection into words?The only reason something to be done is your desire for it.High T users are driven by Feeling for merely constructing reason does not give it function.  

A functioning line of reasoning falls flat immediately if it is not sturdy enough to take the brunt of the world.

Or in simpler words: "fuck Fi" still very much applies :3  
But TJs can and should attempt to take your words to heart (;LUL I was gonna send you a message. It's a leftover from my more active days when I hated /r/infp, now I'm just ambivalent to what has become of the type subs. 

And yes I'm an INTP through and through to the point where I wish I wasn't, but it's never that simple :P

Just because I care about something and can give a passionate rant about it doesn't mean I'm Feeling dom. Why do you think I troll post half the time (;Sod off!*Now* you've got me right :DLanguage isn't as inherent to the mind as much as we pretend otherwise. You'd probably present a point much better through intonation and body language rather than just text on screen.  
To mitigate those difficulties on presenting what you imagine visual analogies are a great tool to link the feeling to the words for it to be shared with other minds.

Also in your case it may just be Se, much more comfortable in person rather than on screen nonsense. While with Fi/Ti it's the specificity of the reasoning they can have trouble sharing. Fi often notes when people take its line of reasoning the wrong way and is irritated at best and disappointed at worst. Ti won't have it either, they *will* correct you and will demand clarity on the line of reasoning. Or both just give up and let it be, it's best to withdraw and distance instead of seeding more misunderstandings due to niche and immensely condensed personal judgements.Well, isn't it out of it: "In my little corner of the world."Extroverts establish what "weirdness" is. Hence why things like mob mentality in stadiums leading to beatdowns are "normal" while liking anime is being "weird".ENTP  
Eh pretty close, I do have some social anxiety, but it's not as much the social aspect that troubles me.You mean that assigned fondess of certain memories does not translate to it being tied to the function that deals with experience. For longing and attachment to be present within a memory, there has a to be a reasoning behind it, a judgement. Something Feeling does, Sensing just provides the picture, introversion encapsulates it in a sense and finally *Feeling* gives it color and meaning beyond that it is what it is.Or rather Ti doesn't want to dump a book on you when there's no time and at the end it won't be read properly.  

While Te merely wants a specific short page it lays out where there's the least transition into what is in the real world.&gt; heated emotional expressions as anger when it's more of like...passion I guess?

It's passion fueled anger in a passionless environment, when passion is personal, it's a catch-22. Hence why Fe takes it that way.  

Also, not to mention that Fe PolR has its own sets of problems.&gt; That's a very alpha quadra thing to say. :D Even from others I like affected speech/flare/passion, unless it's being taken too personally and it's a defensive thing. Lively debate I guess is what I like. Someone just getting worked up about a thing that doesn't have to do with me doesn't really affect me at all.

 Indeed and it's actually the natural response. But if one really interacts with TJs for for long, they will start to recognize how exactly just anger and passionate annoyance differ. But it's that spark which Te-Fi users appreciate immensely, since you relate to it a lot more than just a "positive" atmosphere, instead of one that's driven and feels more fulfilled with its existence through function rather than the "aesthetic" of tranquility.

&gt; Someone just getting worked up about a thing that doesn't have to do with me doesn't really affect me at all.

Again, the difference between the attitudes of judging. It affects Fe users' immediate surroundings, where high Fe want to put things back in their comfort rails while Ti users just mentally bail out. Just that sight of requiring to defend an ego is uncomfortable to me, while to Fi-Te users, Gammas in particular it's a testament to one's drive, passion and soul.

Well, conceptually at least, in practice things are simpler and more often subdued to keep image and courtesy at where people can in presence with each other without animosity.Paging /u/TK4442 Ti-dom vs Ne-dom, the difference is rather exceptional really.In terms of stack, yes, bute in terms of *function dominance*, it's more apparent. But of course I'm lazy and don't provide what the difference maker really is.

The gist of it is that a Pe-dom and a Ji-dom are like night and day when you're looking from that perspective.Sounds like you're just learning the value of Feeling in a social sense. I like to be directed myself, but demands and overbearingness are not good motivators on anyone, period.  
You can expect Ti users to do what you want but doing EXACTLY what you want without specificity is on your end. &gt; Also, for the sake of my sanity and your shame, avoid the oversimplified responses like "you can't be boxed in by type", "you're wrong because the mbti system doesn't allow for that ", and other unhelpful responses.

Sod off Fe-tert, ur being a meanie! ;(

~baby FeJust another stage of developing of the mind.&gt; So hmm. In some ways, I would say that I (INFJ) am sometimes colder - more detached, more analytical - on the inside than I may sometimes appear on the outside.

Secret sociopaths, that's not just a made up meme of mine!&gt;  /u/CritSrc will confirm that I am both an INTJ and a virgin

Can confirm. /u/TK4442 is virgin and INTJ(personal experience). And as a Gamma, he's crazy as shit!&gt; Introverted intuition is a Perceiving function that ~~focuses its~~ *observes* energy ~~on~~ *of* thoughts, ~~ideas, and concepts~~ *the unconscious* that may reveal something ~~in the future.~~, *anything that may be true*. It ~~analyzes~~ *distills elements of* the past and present and ~~connects dots~~ *converges them to a focal point* to (often) ~~accurately reveal~~ *coincidental revelations* to the Ni user a ~~“vision” or perception~~ *vague "impression"* of what is ~~to come~~.

As you see it's much more ambiguous than being a bloody oracle, that's the nature of Pi functions, they encompass the aspects of the mind that are raw, that exist outside of language itself. Writing is barely able to share their true essence of what they point to within the mental scape. Ni/Si are "passive" where you're not conscious of their processing, yet at the same time, are ever present within every judgment you ever make, they provide the perspective of the unconscious in its raw form which is very far removed from reality or comprehensiveness.Sure it feels that way, but in reality you'll see how passive Alphas are in terms of action.ESxx(they're dead)  
ISxx  
ENxx  
INxx(garbage tier SJs)Ah, a wild ESTJ has appeared!xSxJEgo conflict trip, judgements are so rampant, extreme, and mired in frustration, I can't tell them apart.  

I've had my own doubts about /u/Aurarus being an INTP, but I don't deny that I've had a similar, if less extreme case of these aspects really gnawing at my mind, they still do even, but on a manageable scale.  

I would say this is more of an Enneagram thing since that's more about expression and taking in feedback, not paying attention to your needs and then stressing over them like this.

There really isn't much to add, really, this thread on its own for venting should help, but it's no substitute for Aurarus to take up his adult mantle and do what he feels responsible to do.Reddit is very ISTJ. They naturally just seek spaces where they just see their similar interests. Common type, introverted, so this can be seen as socializing, and Feelers seek a more communal feel rather than just one held of common interests.You mean /r/INTJ, which is /r/ISTJ under the /r/iamverysmart influence.Thank you for proving my point.At best I'd attribute it to SPs, the most challenging stereotype to do this would be the ISFP, since it would have to be something equally intense emotionally for them to do it.

STJs can do this too with sheer practice and experience, but those are of the crazier, quirkier kind that are also quite unique to their own development. The mindset behind it is entirely different.  Ever felt psychopathic? In whatever loose metaphorical sense I mean.&gt; Fi already existing as a facet of humanity.

So you would want to sacrifice that for a more pedantic form of reasoning. Baby Fe is cool headed yet also capable of reading needs and moods of others, accommodation at best is in its basic form, not a required state, just preferable to a fast moving one, passivity is also comfortable as well.

&gt; I want more than anything to be logical and unimpaired by my own perspective

But Ti is all about embracing that subjective perspective to where it is absolute within itself. That is perfection sought after.

&gt; to be someone who can act as a voice of reason in a world of instinct, emotion and fallacy.

That's quite the Delta(STJ/NFP) thing to say. Alphas like to observe a world from a reasonably comfortable state, we are in actuality pretty passive when it comes to direct worldly actions. Hence "archivist of the unconscious" is something I associate with them tbh, it's not that they are the closest to it(that's Pi-doms), but rather have the tools to rummage through it with a sense of purpose and direction, instead of seeking them the outside world.

&gt; So, yeah, even though I've accepted being an INFP, I still often think I'd rather be an INTP with the same interests and quirks beyond type. It would certainly be more useful to both me and those around me, at any rate.

Phah, you wish. Ti-doms have too few strong, inherent, burning desires within them. They don't act cool headed and calm for the sake of it, they simply find no reason to be anything else.

Low Te sucks in the pragmatic world, I get that. But completely lacking it, on top of baby Fe carries its own price.This is such a better existential topic too: Exclusion.&gt; Maybe make it shorter too.

This is the actual roast.&gt; Your life experiences will shape which of the functions you have the most practice with. I believe the consensus of this subreddit is that the "ideal" type functions are set in stone, but we can have different levels of skill with each function. It's fluid. You use different skills for different situations. 

Don't see the functions as skillsets. But rather, a very, *very* loose skeletal structure of repeating patterns, which are instilled in the recesses of you mind. What they attempt to define at best shows someone acquiring and practicing a skill in terms of *mental approach*, but even then it is very ambiguous and mired in the individual's experience and focus, which is also something the functions attempt to structure in a loose sense.  

It's an arbitrary system to used as a shorthand, nothing more, nothing less. It was never, ever meant to define someone's personality, but try to put a term on universal mental patterns Jung has observed from his own and his patients' distant unconscious.Eh, I'd wager on ESFP. Ti candidness doesn't feel as charged as this.&gt; a focus on inward opinions more so

Mmm... I like this 👌🏼

&gt; Fi users are always redefining what things mean to them, *and other people*.

Well, the subjective factor being the plane still. But yes, other people, for opinions derived solely from the subjective are rather limited. That material by itself often leaves the string of reason unsatisfying underdeveloped.

&gt; In all seriousness, Fi is practically very similar to Ti, but to give a brief overview of it, we are more focused on people and ethics.

Definitely a greater engagement with the human factor and what makes the ego tick. Thinking is psychotically detached in comparison.

&gt; Everyone associates ENTPs and ISTPs and the Tis with politics and philosophy

In terms of putting them on some sort of order, sure.

&gt;  guarantee you politics and philosophy are probably more appealing to Fi doms and auxes because of our focus on determining wrong and right. Politics and philosophy are more based on personal perception (obviously because everything is up for debate)

Or rather *representing their own order* of said opinions. And moreso, applying them, presenting them forwards.

&gt;  I would think a Ti user would like something more precise. Of course they do still like these subjects. Tho most of us believe in no objective moral)

Ti material, is idiosyncratic accuracy, "facts" of the individual. There are objective morals for a society to work aka ethics, but beliefs are held by the individual. 

&gt; If healthy, we are not driven by emotions, we seem driven by logic.

Or rather, argue well for your desires, which is what Te users do to get away with what they want done.  
Trust me, outside of academics, very few care for meticulous order of thought. Fi is very capable of achieving it, but it vies for the soul, much closer to the ego, hence it engages it. A Ti user's ego is closely tied to their own subjective web as well, but that is not their innate concern for judging.

I have great respect for Deltas, for how they quietly rule, yet preserve the world's form, in their own little worlds, through perseverance. While Gammas shine forth humanity's will and strength, proudly pushing the envelope just because they want to.  Said sensitivity gives the reasoning of a sensitive perspective. It's not wrong or incorrect even.Yes, yes ESTJ-sama, you are always correct! 🙇&gt; The circumstances of *when* that reasoning is applied make it 'right' or 'wrong', not any inherent value of *either* position. 

Of course, thank you for adding that.  
First you have to open to multiple perspectives instead of discarding them immediately from the judging process. Then you have to apply them *in moderation* as anything in excess is usually bad. And *then* it has to be applied in circumstance as it that is the limitation of the objective world itself.  

My point is that it *does* have objective value, even if it often is easily discardable.Yeah. Feel alien? I mean truly alien as in you don't get people and people especially don't get you.  

No? ISTJ.Well, that settles it. You're an ISTJ.  

There is little practicality to be discerned from MBTI, take it from an idiot who's experienced the foil of applying it. It's a completely made up arbitrary scheme of terms to cover *vast* amounts of ambiguous as fuck descriptions of mental patterns, that is all. But that's more towards Jung's theory.  
Modern MBTI tests usually base off Big 5, which works off empirical scales, something more reliable.&gt; I am always questioning things. Always. If something works in the past, and it works now, I keep it at that rate. If something worked in the past, but isn't woking as good now, then I try to predict how it could work better using my own intuition (not info from the past really).

Yeah, typical STJ outlook. NTJs just want whatever they have on mind *to* work. Making *sure* that it does work is not the main concern.

&gt;  It's to the point where I'm the only one actually working at all now. Customers tell me my co workers have abandoned their work stations all the time. recently even my manager kinda chuckled at me for doing my job. She tries to small talk me but I find it weird because I just see her as this huge authority figure, not someone wanting to hang out.

Again, typical TJ behavior. Executive of their actions, as "the order" is based around. But circumstantially, it's jadedness vs dutifulness. But learn to let your guard down at least on breaks, makes reality more manageable. Even if it takes away from focus, be awkward, be embarrassed, that's what company is for.

&gt; I do people watch a lot. It's really fascinating to watch people interact and engage from a distance. I don't understand people, especially romance courting. I apply too much logic to ever be successful in having true friends or romance. I think if you have things in common after knowing each other to trust them, it should be a great match. I try to apply (INTJ) logic to romance almost all the time which is a disaster.

IxTJ struggles with Feeling in general. Social courtesies are but senseless fluff, yet is oddly required and expected of you. It's intimidating, yet a tolerance and balance has to be built. It is not achieved by your usual executive mindset, hence the uncomfort.

&gt; I always think in the future as an INTJ would, but I'm not sure how an ISTJ would. I hop from subject to subject without a real defined goal unfortunately. Sometimes I'm really into biology, other times I'lll crack open a Network Security book. Other times maybe it's just male fashion and grooming (to fit in). I know I'd like to be happy, and with friends that would make me happy, but this is all using INTJ(?) logic assuming if I did x I'd be happy, or even have "happy" friends. I feel everything Im working towards is totally unrealistic but I know no other way.

Eh, ironically NTJs don't think of the future as much as act upon whim, more akin to SFPs actually. STJs are so much more prone to future planning as a measure to protect their own world of chaotic influence. NTJs thrive in the chaos as their minds *are chaotic* to begin with.  

So between an MBTI dabbler and hundreds of articles, trust whomever you want.&gt; What defines "truly alien?" Just because you feel somewhat understood by a relative few does not mean that you are a certain MBTI type. That's akin to people who use type descriptions and stereotypes to type themselves; it's so far from the truth.

Aaand you still just proved my case (;Welcome to the NHK happens.  
Well, it's something more broad than that, but I can assure you that's the ISFP perspective and experience of it put plainly.Not too much, it's romanticised at parts, but it does keep to the plain, objective perspective of Se/Te as a basis. When shit arises, *then* it goes insane, which isn't a commodity.

Needless to say, what it does focus on, it is rather poignant with it.\**hiss**Aside from interest in math, which does relate to consistent subjective reasoning, what other things that cross your mental expression as Thinking itself?This is a better question for Se-doms tbh, they deal with the force of Sensation directly after all.Intimidating can also mean imposing, as Te users are when they want their way to be done.It's in the timidness somewhere, you need to be close to them to notice it.Ti-dom shall Ti-dom until they are Ti-dom for they are Ti-dom.I see feeling, but no real hint of iNtuition really. Though for a J-dom, that's not too surprising.Ti **dom**inance as in *dominant* function. It's just a shorthand.T is Thinking. Ti is **i**ntroverted Thinking, Te is **e**xtroverted Thining. It's the same function but with a different mental focus: internal systemization vs external application.  

It's not related to ability or skill, but just where the mind itself wanders naturally.Read my initial post again.It's dense wordplay expressing that Ti-doms will show their line of thinking in a very clear cut way to prove that they are Ti-doms, when the expression of their thought represents the nature of Ti-dominance to begin with.

It's like a dog chasing its own tail to prove that it's a dog.INTPs mesh very well with ISFJs. You'll have to look for that innate Alpha outlook from both parties where you are mentally closer than you'd expect.

It's not that INFPs don't mesh well. But hard Fi reasoning will definitely be noted by an ISFJ. Ti is more innately understood.&gt; Remember, intuitives are the active majority on this mbti network.

^^\*citiation ^^neededNe rambles feel much more jumpy. Their tension is in the excitement rather than the uncertainty.  
When reading Ne-doms it's like watching a bouncing ball furiously clashing with the walls of a glass cube just so it can get out and bounce wherever the trajectory takes them.The classic ISTJ mistype. Plan for the future? Good, that means you're solidifying your own position within the world.  

NTJs don't know what that means in comparison, for they are very much on those waves you are resisting against. They don't "plan" for the future per se, they chase it out of curious obsession.  
From an STJ perspective that is thoughtlessly reckless, even if you see them being pragmatic in approach like you, it's like they can't live without risk of shit falling apart beneath their feet.Not to the extent Si-users go to.As OP suggests, you're already attached to the INTJ label as it is your own symbol to claim and reason around.

[This is a recent example I had.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5sfpit/is_there_a_definitive_way_to_know_if_im_intj_vs/ddeo6vp/) It's not as clear, or a good representation, but just notice the answer to my initial post from OP, who is ISTJ and and an INTJ regular. As suggested read into the "vibe" of the answers and more importantly their essence.  

Yes, the gist is someone who is unsure vs someone who is sure. But note the styles of presenting and argument one self. I successfully managed to provoke an INTJ rant, notice how he's being rather forceful, laying his own "truth" that seems convincing, yet on reasoning terms feels incomplete, fleeting, calling to the essence of human nature and its ambiguity. *That* ambiguity is gone from STJs, due to their focus on personal experiences, they are certain, dead certain, like you were certain that you were an INTJ, that they are correct. NTJs apply force, and their ranting style is very particular and probably the easiest one I can observe unique to them. STJs are simplistic in comparison, but next to sounding like you're on the brink of insanity, is that really that bad? NOt to mention, the simplest applications in life are there to make it easier, not more convoluted.

It's also due to my own experience of communicating a few times with an INFJ, who allowed me to really see what Ni-Ti thought patterns are in their particular sense. Along with the conceptualization that *Ni and Percieving as a whole is absent from language*, what you *see* what the mind *observes* is not directly related to words or language, that has to be a conscious association that follows a *judging* mental pattern. "Tit is tat" is so much easier to say when the object you observe has a *concrete* form Sensing provides. [A hill](http://www.runnersgoal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/hilltraining.jpg) is a [hill](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/scribblenauts/images/9/9b/Hill.png/revision/latest?cb=20130301212333) to Sensing, but who said it has to be [bulging upwards](http://i1187.photobucket.com/albums/z399/CraigyGT/172129main_gpb-earth-300dpi20copy.jpg~original) observes iNtuition.The opens the Pe gates, while a J-dom would stereo typically give a laundry list/essay of their doubts. If I have doubts, I compulsively formulate *them* as well, in order to structure pictire and get a sense for what pieces of the puzzle I'm missing.  
While Pi-doms are very open and receptive to information. In fact they devour it on a consistently constant basis. J-doms in comparison *filter* information at a consistent basis, immediately labeling it and distributing it, selectively discarding and accepting what is Percieved.  

While Pe-doms are active. Ne is active imagination in a conventional sense, but its expression also carries a vivid, childlike even, energy with it, it's most clear from ENFPs. While Se is *visceral, presence*, it is raw force that has no reason or word language to it, just like Ne has symbols to jump from. 

Refresher or not. Solely just judging that you don't relate, and have a different image of yourself, [as commented here in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5tn2ur/how_to_quickly_determine_ni_or_si_in_type_me/ddnnxha/), can be attributed to having Si, maybe not Si-dom, but just having it, meaning you're immediately typed to Alpha/Delta. Attribute high Te pragmatism, practicality and application, a bit of pushiness, and you've got STJ - architects of their own personal worlds in a chaotic universe.

I can keep spewing this ambiguous bullshit. But do try and accept the ISTJ label without as many preconceptions and then let *your own experiences speak for themselves*, for that is the true essence of Si that cannot be put into comprehensive language.Sooo... what's your stance on the widely known intuitive bias on the internet?&gt; Since I read on here all the time about how my type is the least interested in mbti and is never anywhere to be found, 

Eh, Je-doms are rightfully engaged with matters of the world. Similar could be said for Pe-doms, but online posting is part of modern spontaneity as well.

&gt; I figured I'd put myself out there to chat

If only it worked like that.

So, what makes you think you're ESFJ, aka not ENFJ ala intuitive bias style? Are you that accepting of the faulty ESFJ stereotype? And from that, how do you break that stereotype, in terms of mindset if you can describe.

Also, what are your experiences with NTPs?&gt; If only it worked like what? I posted here and I'm chatting with you so it seems like that's exactly how it's working.

I mean, chats are immediate. Reddit is more forum based, but it focuses on replies, which is actually great for discussions.

&gt; What is the faulty ESFJ stereotype?

Basically the [mother hen](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom). Sooo... what makes you think INFJ at all?  
The entire post seems pretty SFJ/NTP as it is .Si -the Sensing of the unconscious, populating the collective unconscious with tangible observations, universal symbols and associations that are a shared image, even if the party has not experienced it directly. Immensely important. Ni's role in the unconscious is to distill all of that into a new form, the thing is that the form itself is warped and distilled until Se brings it out from the mental scape, yet then it has so little to do with it.I'm just using the function grouping of Fi-Te + Si-Ne -&gt; SFJ/NTP -&gt; Alpha quadrant.  

Your entire presentation is easily tangible, concrete, specific in clear examples. Really, I'm just looking for any indication of Ni, which often devolves into tangential rambling encirculating a particular point. Elaborating to no end with a different conclusion each time. Even when such a thing is condensed in a presentable form for communication, it feels like "sanitization" aka not to look like a rambling mess when that's exactly what it is beneath the surface.  
Yet Si *is* said surface and is absolutely content with that. No overcomplications, distillations, warping, merging, etc. A clear A-&gt;B association that is concrete to the mind, not speculative/pondering.

Your doubt is born out of your openness to information. You're always seeking, scouting for material at all times. The floodgates are open, yet as they are, there is little time to make cohesive and comprehensive judgements. So there is all the material, but there is no written registry to point at what is where and what category it falls under. Only when it is necessary to pick it out of the pile.Pe-doms -&gt; Pi-doms -&gt; Je-doms -&gt; Ji-doms

As a Ji-dom, people often confuse my structured judgements on observations of I have accepted already, as observations and showing curiousness. I do seek material, but I point to it, for that's what I have concluded to need for the puzzle. When cognitively they are immensely pigeon holed.

P-doms don't point or ask, they truly observe and absorb, it's an iherently passive process that is not well understood in communication.&gt; Can you also tell me the differences between ISFP and ISTP functions so I can get to know if I really was an ISFP before?

Yeah... ISTPs are not-

&gt; cuz I was such an emotional kid and I worked with sympathy and empathy most of the time. 

Even with an emotionally focused family, ISTPs prefer to touch emotion with a 10 ft barge pole.[Yeah...](http://www.communibuild.com/rt/texhnolyze10.jpg)Ah, nothing like a flustered ISFP holding her tongue not to say "no, fuck you" straight up.

An [ISTP would likely sound gloomier btw](http://www.communibuild.com/rt/texhnolyze10.jpg), with very understated frustration.

Also, Feeling is just as logical. But it focuses on the more humane aspects of reasoning, not solely the structural ones.That's a very convincing Ti argument. /sSFP/NTJs are what I consider crazy for a reason ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Ya'll minds are mush next to NTP/SFJs, but in turn you have the most objective outlook on the world hence you have the biggest power and influence on it.  
SFPs make it obvious. An STP's expression is one of self-mastery, not self-expression. It's a mental game for themselves, just as your very words are for you and you alone. But you inherently change your surroundings and atmosphere with your presence. STPs don't do that as consciously, they temper their minds instead of their surroundings.Welcome to Jungian function theory (;No, but they absolutely influence your development.Aka young ESTJs.Yeah, ESTJ stuff. Maaybe ISTJ, but you're still young.  

Very concrete stuff, straighforward too. Not even contemplative, jumpy, elaboration is in the pragmatic details, not the subjective or unconscious essence.  
There is Ne, but it's used as a means of expression, not as a mental state. Te/Fi for sure.Most ENTPs are actually mistyped ESTJ. It's probably one of the most common mistypes, due to tests herding you towards iNtuitive side, which has much more appealing descriptions. While SJ descriptions are woefully outdated, they do represent their mindset, but within the 80s context, not modern and for SJs that's another world.  

&gt; I have an easy time remembering facts when I'm interested or when it's important. For example, I can remember a story someone told me a year ago or a book I read a year ago. Basically, I treat my mind like a vault: I store everything that interests me and find it when I need it. However, on the flip side, I'm also terrible when copying stuff down. Usually when I'm copying down notes in class or whatever, I have to check multiple times to get the right words. This is purely because I didn't process the information into my head.

ESTJ-Te-Si. The vault you describe isn't NTP-Ti, since that's for reasoning, not exploring subjective experiences. And not processing through your head, yeah, forget about Ti, that's a more of extroverted trait.  

Like I said, all your points are very concrete, literal, grounded, believable situations one can picture in their own context. You take away your context to keep impartial in an online board, but it's still so easy to imagine for the reader. You also use that in your arguments: examples and examples. As they provide evidence no one can refute, right? Yeah, NTPs don't do that either, facts merely provide more aspects for exploration, they're even annoying in that you're forced to accommodate the mental model towards them, instead of idealising it into its perfect form that seems the most consistent.  

You aren't comfortable with emotion and emotional expression, only enough to care how you look in order to be able to establish what *you want* to be done. Again, NTPs aren't like that, TPs have understated accommodating behaviours, even if it's just holding their tongue to not start conflict, cracking out a witty joke in the face of tension. ENTPs don't argue, they explore through multiple different aspects that constantly barrage their mind, but they come so fast and are very fleeting. They are very, very loose symbols, aspects that are simply associated through whatever the Perception provides, the reasoning is secondary to the space trip. Even in "arguments", which aren't really, it's not about who's right and wrong, that's just for engagement of the other party, it's about putting some of the perceptions of interest into words, more concrete terms they can implement into their mental model.

&gt; I was talking to a friend, and the girl I was crushing on walked by. I noticed my friend looking in the general direction and thought that he also liked her. Then, I spent the entire week weighing all the possibilities. Another time, I thought of an idea, but theni thought of a flaw in the plan and spent two weeks worrying about it. This was before I even started **implementing** it.

Yeah, see. ESTJ talk. An ENTP wouldn't hold to such a desire much, let alone spend planning power and giving fucks to it, and for *two weeks*. Heck, even I can't do it for more than 2 days, spontaneity is order of life for Pe users(xxxPs). And for Ti users, implementation is a far secondary to the conclusion itself, which is the point, it's even just annoying to follow up on it, instead of being a goal to reach that state.  

&gt; In short: INFPs suck at typing people.

[Ahem...](https://youtu.be/SgWcSuxyvT8?t=1m33s)

Ah, yes, a [very good argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) my good sir. Actually, that's very good example of an "ENTP" being a young ESTJ if I were to stereotype...An ISTP raised in more emotionally engaging circumstances to where you've seen the advantage and tranquillity Feeling offers?Well, thank you for providing me with an example.Yeah, ISFJ sounds the most accurate.Intense *and* daily. How would Feelers cope with that would be my question.It is just way too amusing in a communicative context for a real ENTP.  At this point it isn't even about argument because you are damn closed off to the idea of being an STJ when your very style of rejection screams STJ.

So let's try something else. If we are to assume that this is representative of NTP behavior. Do you really want to be one yourself? Instead of an STJ who *establishes their own goddamn life* and does their best to live peacefully.

Btw NFPs are even worse, pragmatic thinking is a mindset they can operate, but they aren't as natural like you are.Fuck me, if /r/mbti had more posts like this, I'd be regular again.I think it's more due to the emo era of the early 2000s. There's just something to it that I also associate with the ISFP mindset. The thing is that in essence the extreme has been immensely commercialised since then and has lot any meaning from the originating SFPs.  

The thing is that that Si has capsulised that in the collective unconscious, on top of having the internet as a resource of "evidence" that people just can't disassociate it anymore.

*However*, it should be treated as a transitional analogy to the heart of the cognitive pattern:

&gt; We like pop fashion but we modify it to be unique which is what makes it somewhat "hipsterish". We look like ESFP's but we add a twist to it to make it "our own".

*Personalization of and in the literal world*.  

While flamboyancy is something that SFPs are characterised by. I attribute it to the entire Gamma quadrant, even INTJs who are the most timid in there, but their character is certainly one of action, even if it's mostly cerebral.&gt; I'm saying that Gothics are a an extremely tiny minority within ISFP's and also within all types in general too.

Tbh, I wouldn't be at all surprised that it would be a minority of SFPs in a circle or STJs. STJs are so common and organising that creating a subculture space is natural to them. And for evidence, see convention culture./u/mirrorconspiracies gotcha Thanks for post too. I was thinking ISFJ, INFP didn't even cross my mind(SJ bias xD).  

I would also go for INFP. The anxiety seems more natural in that context. While there are some STJ behaviours you emulate, they aren't your default state of mind, but a consequence of your own emotional state, of which you are acutely aware of, even in your sanitised bullet point expression.  
It's rough and you understand it, and more importantly: accept it and see that escaping it is futile. So just take whatever you can get.

And the way you reason out problems to solve them. Eerily close to mine, so Fi-Ne -&gt;INFP doesn't seem to be an unnatural choice of a cognitive function stack.&gt; But some days i get lazy and i just wear whatever.

Take photos of that, show it to your nerdier friends, who will still say you're lookin' good.But it's so comfortable!Now if they saw it as a positive. We'd kill for some SFJ qualities we can just "switch" into :DGeneral rule is that Ti-doms usually don't doubt their type.Then you would know well how rigid his conceptualisations are :P[Ne is but a mere jester under the crystal fist of Ti!](http://pm1.narvii.com/6054/617041e28be9e41324235c0f349a5e2c271e9431_hq.jpg)If you're not confident for typing Ni, you can hit me up. I can definitely spot Ni-Ti, my Ni-Fi game is always up for refinement as well.  
Of all things, I'm not confident about Si, since it's ubiquitous, yet so, so understated than I can't really put it in a proper conceptual construct where I can recognise it right off the bat.  

But I've also learned to use the functions as a transitional tool for expression rather than absolutes.[Just call me \(;](https://streamable.com/vfcm6)Properly miserable from reality I see!You just have this cutesy air to you, but I guess it's just an adaptation to hide your psychotic thoughts ^^plz ^^don't ^^ruin ^^my ^^dramatic ^^imageTi users aren't psychotic, they *can* have psychotic thoughts, but only when pushed to complete mental breakdown will they come to the surface. Otherwise, TPs cater to their emotional needs in an understated sense.Fuck my buzzwords!
"Bad thoughts" as I said don't usually surface from Ti users, as they have an understated understanding and need for courtesy.&gt; and future-oriented

Funnily enough INTJs are more presently oriented, or not time oriented at all, unlike ISTJs who lay their groundwork for years to come, usually by 1 or 2. So can we pelase have a good rephrase for that because it's a common trait for people to get hung upon, when it is so apt for STJs than NTJs who are "impulsive" by comparison.&gt; I haven't had the same experience

Well, this is much better than me having no experience with NJs, while spitballing theory.  

&gt; INTJs seem to live in the present but always have a goal or vision tucked away that serves as a driving force. ISTJs would be more past-present, building up a foundation/storehouse to draw from that makes living in the present and planning for the future clearer.

This is much better presented.  
NTJs seeks to accomplish their vision, they want see its form in reality, because just keeping it as a conception within the unconscious, it has no function, they want to give it function within the world they exist in, to externalise it in a form that is clear. Giving a grounding to their unconscious chaos.

While for STJs their unconscious *is* their grounding, they do use it as a template for it is a mirror for reality rather than seeking reality to mirror the unconscious.  

Now as to how these aspects are placed in time is more of a consequence of time itself rather than a clear differentiation between the two.  

Could you comment on this take with your experiences. I just want Ni "future planning" to stop, because it's a very misguided meme that confuses newcomers.Now do it in code!No shit...[Eh, I don't have one.](https://streamable.com/vfcm6)They are stuck on their *own* rules, principles, laws, that are "rationally thought out throughout anecdotal personal experiences". Of course, the more experienced they are, the less anecdotal the information they base off of.   
But it is also due to that ISTJ being "rooted" to their region where they can build their own influence, creating a hearth of their own to withstand the chaos of the world.Swap INxx for ISxx&gt; literally no logic or reasoning behind it.

[\**long sigh**](http://i.imgur.com/Ku7P1YE.png) He's an ESTJ decrying for empirical evidence, statistics, *something* literal, concrete to justify my view. Because he's never *seen* it. And granted, I don't have it, *there*!   

But when *he himself* embodies the anecdotal evidence he so yearns, yet doesn't acknowledge it because he's so hung up on whatever false image and belief he's built around a type label. At that point, it's not about evidence, stats or arguing, it's about *being right*.  

Yet *I* don't want to be right. In fact that disillusions me. Sensors are incredible and they're the majority for a good reason. What is taken for granted is thanks to them, yet every real iNtuitive has to rediscover such aspects from themselves in a more painstaking manner, since it's not as natural to them, but exactly that making it all the more of a requirement.

And to address your argument, why wouldn't Si users in particular have an interest in MBTI? Heck, we've even even seen **Se-doms** of all types commenting and proudly flaunting themselves with few words, when they're supposed to be above that and be on the road of life tirelessly, not concerning themselves with arbitrary labels of an ambiguous, loose theory.

I have long tired of arguing and proving my point that Sensors very much exist in the majority of the MBTI community as they do in *every* community. Even in a group of 5, there's bound to be Sensor in there, someone who takes interest in kooky perceptions, conversations and ideas, that do fascinate them even if they feel like they have to constantly hammer everyone else into existence.  

Until the idea and understanding of Si erased and rewritten entirely, even for just the current age, I doubt many would face the fact that SJs *make* a community.Nope, still an ISFP.  
^^PS: ^^They ^^have ^^cooler ^^aspects ^^than ^^ISTPs ^^btw!Nope! It's more to do with being very open to non-literal perceptions.ISTPs put themselves out there in a more consistent manner, so they naturally adapt and accept it more. INTPs block it out a bit more and are a more popular type to discuss.  

But if you go to /r/istp you'll see the few threads about it every day.Welcome to the club sister!&gt;Very often, letting something rest will lead to new answers as well.

This should be a Pi-dom motto tbh.  
Though it is true for everyone, it's very particular for Pi-doms who can gain unconscious insights without being active about it.INFP, simple as that.J are crystals, P are liquid. People are mush.  

You've got a very, **very** hard crystal here. It doesn't seem to be cracking any time soon tho.  

And I used to be like this most of the time as well too. It's kinda harrowing now that I think about it. Raw, solipsistic Ti-Si, you can see why I think of Alphas as "archivists of the unconscious", but as you duly note, removing the interactive elements, the sociological aspects, merely reveals a rigidity with no worldly basis.  

Maybe you haven't noticed, but I also just talk a lot of theory without concrete examples. Mostly because I have none ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯More coaxed, I've gone out of my depressive solipsistic period before we met. Also I guess non-internet country life as a kid helps too.  

&gt; What changed in you and why, do you know?

Eh it was a teen angst period of mine where I did feel the essential pointlessness of life, there is no "fundamental logic" is how I structured it. Unhealthy, but I slowly just accepted a few people in my life. Roomie presence also helps even if he didn't know.&gt; just some sort of clean impartial mind (if I am getting it correctly).

Ah yes, the "ideal" of Ti-Si, a *complete*, *static unconscious*. I've also had musings about it. It's like validating overthinking without it having consequence of worldly negligence aka time flow. Naïve, but so very appealing.Nah, I'm talking about expression here. It's immensely rigid, complex, but without essence of Perception. Took me quite a year to truly realise the nature of Perceiving. Heck, Si and Ne I wouldn't even claim to understand holistically.  

A normality is mundane. How does one describe what sound is to someone who has never heard.Make that as literal as possible \^_^Yeah... hi!Eh, just give it time. As much as it is annoying, just get out there and tolerate the world for what it is. Take any excuse to do so.And here's the subtlety of Si-tert as a back up function working within the unconscious. Its concreteness, "groundedness"  is what makes this isolationist Ti method "work", because it *sustains the form* within the unconscious. I bet you feel your ISTJ seems to have her entire life placed in her head and navigating it to her benefit and whim without much effort as it seems because she's managed to nurture it in her mental scape.  Well, with Ti being the dominant preference, that kind of "unconscious reality" is retooled to be an "unconscious schematic" that reflects the respective Ti method of interpreting of reality.

&gt;(by the way, I know I sometimes tag you out of the blue for these r/mbti discussions. I hope that if you ever feel them as a drain or otherwise negative for your well being, you feel comfortable and okay not engaging - and if not, please let me know what I can do differently to support that option for you if/when you need it)

Nah, you always strike the interesting ones or you *make* them interesting enough to consider musing and commenting on (;  
It's a sobering experience for me of sorts, despite being online.&gt;&gt;I bet you feel your ISTJ seems to have her entire life locked in her head and navigating it to her benefit and whim without much effort as it seems because she's managed to nurture it in her mental scape.

&gt; Not sure if I feel this or not but very interesting (I'm still on a strong learning curve about Si-dom)... I would be interested for you to say more on/expand on this if you feel like it and can do so.

Not much else I feel like I can add. I've always seen Si-doms, the few that I know, to have something akin to that, along with my biased interpretation of Si. To the point where I take it as a personal insecurity, though I don't apply it enough to use it as an excuse, just make up other excuses that are anecdotal, heh.   
So feel free to muse upon this at your leisure (;

&gt; &gt;Nah, you always strike the interesting ones or you make them interesting enough to consider musing and commenting on (; It's sobering experience for me of sorts, despite being online.

&gt;Glad to hear this.

Actually now that I think about it, it's a very Beta thing to do. Getting a person into a mental arena of sorts to challenge and reaffirm their nature, to adapt along and temper themselves. *Don't* think about it ;PESFP, you're not privy to speculation and are looking for concrete terms...

I'm too lazy to build you a scenario, especially when my suspicion is that your only true answer will be the actual event and circumstance as it is in the real world, not through words.

PS: You can disregard this, the SFPs provide more solid insight.&gt; Se will golf because it might be fun to win or be exciting when you score below par. They might also enjoy the scenery and calm as it is a positive experience.

Or just launching the balls into space can do just as well.&gt; the Ti-user overestimating their objectivity related to truth.

Good observation. A lot of it comes down to the *impartiality* of the ego that Thinking as a function applies. There's a lot of pretence of what "is" in accordance to Thinking judgements, despite being essentially a micro filter to the Perceiving pipeline. It's more to do with reasoning that is distant from Feeling sentiments and beliefs, despite said ego being formed of the correspondent Thinking judgements made by the user. Competence is often a point of pride, and great hubris of Thinking users, though in my case it's more of being a type 5.  
Please do notice how Thinking-doms carry themselves in a very self-serious manner, even Ti-doms seeking to relieve a situation, there's always a distance, an unquestionable *impartiality* that "clears" the judgements of beliefs and doubts of values, "it is what it is, therefore it is *correct*, not necessarily *right*".  

&gt; I'm perhaps starting to get a sense for the similarities of (unbalanced?) Fi-dom and Ti-dom in terms of that Ji vibe under some circumstances. In the Ti-dom (if this is the case here), I get this feel of a rigid impenetrable wall of self-referential logic that is deeply convinced of its own objectivity while not allowing any other realities through, overriding any possibility for dialogue (at that moment), similar to but not the same as Fi-dom, which I can experience as a rigid aggressive values push.

It's also reflected in behaviour too. Passive-aggressiveness, avoidance, making up excuses to end a convo, isolation(developing solipsism). All of this to avoid confrontation of an already formed judgement that is not desired, because it is contradicting an unconscious of the user is acutely aware of and following with great attention. Contradicting it, means contradicting their entire existence, it's not pleasant and such furthered developments naturally lead to neurosis until breakdown.Ti-Ni is hella more mindscrew than Ti-Si is, that's for sure.Think how the STP nature relates to driving.Wow, I honestly don't remember. I'll look into this manner later today, say, in about 10 hours.Leaning towards ISFP. But even then, I can't be sure with 3rd person typing.&gt; SJs kinda do run shit tho

And you don't have to be an intuitive to notice...Se-Ni is more aggressive to me. While STJs is like there's a |"hardened"| intent behind their actions.  
With NTJs it's more murky I feel as well as just more spontaneously proactive. For STPs it's more down to flow, the wave they've chosen to throw themselves in.Sky can be red? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ISTP it is. Writing style basically. This is not an essay and it's quite simple, even if it seems like a lot in terms of activity, you point to its essence in experience, not its reflective definition of it.

PS: Just compare it to my sentence.As usual, MBTI helps to describe the pathway and the connections, yet without the actual causes.  

Lemme boil it down to crystals: Si-tert is more iffy with how it projects Sensing information. Couple that with an ego-driven Fi, which is highly influenced by ego to begin with, and you have emotionally rationalized projection of events, rather than *actual* events as you have absorbed in essence. You know how Judging, Ji in particular can be extremely closed off, dismissive and narrow in scope, with the limited Sensing info one processes, it's much easier, and natural to just cherry pick. To what degree, that's what depends on the person."Cherry picking" from a Ji standpoint. "Distortion" as an end result of Percieving said judgement.

I'd place my bets on them being separate honestly. I'd also look in the Si-tert influence. It's something Ji-Si users rely upon unawarely(unconsciously, but not all the way to Unconscious levels, that's the planе where it happens, not the awareness of it). And is also a big impact on their "ideal" constructs.Just like Judging is short-circuiting to you for being so narrow, yet extremely rough and packed with meaning. Perceiving to J-doms is overwhelming and to be able to take it all is unfathomable, it's shortcircuit by raw overload, instead of devouring gaps from extrapolating crystals.What TK means is intake of information in the most direct raw fashion. P-doms just *absorb everything* as it is by nature, they don't even think they're doing it consciously, it's just their state of being. While J-doms, the are immense limits, the flow is completely gone in comparison, information intake is highly selective and very deliberate by the J-dom, it has meaning and value for the J-dom to even bother looking at it, and even then, there's a lot of "excess" that's trimmed during the actual process of receiving info.  

What J-doms mean by "being open to new information no matter what" means that they want *new* information concerning their *thought structure* they are working on. Je are very much case by case focused, it matters here and now and they seek to accomplish a state of the environment. While Ji seeks to accomplish a holistic structure of their own though patterns, more often than not they are incomplete, it is at those hanging nodes where they are "open to new information". I hope with this picture you see how that phrase gains a whole new, if loaded, meaning. Je also employ this nature of picking their information, but as I say it is *case by case* basis mostly isolated from each other, since once it's over, that's all there is to it, nothing more nothing less. To Ji, that is not satisfactory, it has to relate to their entire cognitive being somehow, until then, it has no real meaning or reason to be looked at. Hence why Ji-doms with too many completed holistic structures don't come off as open minded as they claim to be. Such a self-sufficient system does not allow to be impeded.Aside from the special snowflake intro. Just the first paragraph screams Si so hard that no Ni user would relate. The 
way they receive data is fundamentally different.Thinkers aren't any less dumber either.I know that I know nothing.  
*~Socrates*Well... case in point.Uhm.... pwahahahahahah!

Aw man. Thanks for the laugh, you're better off not going down this rabbit hole OP.No worries mate, I'm just in a memelord attitude atm.http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/863480.The_Psychology_of_C_G_JungIt's years of jadedness in the Groundhog Subreddit cycle.I also think you gottem!&gt; Ni leverages Se to provide the apparently impersonal, factual information it needs to draw conclusions about a situation.

Yes, I mean it: there is no real explanation that is satisfactory to pure reason. Not with this model, not with any cognitive model. Embrace Percieving or lose yourself in the Unconscious Abyss.

PS: Questions to Gammas(SFP/NTJ), if you start thinking too much do things get too contradictory and out of whack after a while that you *need* world interaction of any sort to keep sane. Like, it's basic solipsism, but for Gammas in particular I feel that your minds are more "unstable" of sorts, needing a more literal anchor to keep in check.To a point, but it's still a wholly human trait to be confused out of your mind.&gt; I'm reckless to an extent. Impulsive, yes, but never to the point where I risk anything important -- 

Translation: Basically when I feel like it.  
Tradeoff: You get shit done!&gt; It's what tames our impulses

It's also what may fuel them as well (;

&gt; Notice that they are not motivated by what's right or wrong (a notion more common in Fi doms than Fi auxes), but rather what promises a greater reward.

Eh, Ji-dom reasoning has a shitton of nuances, now *verbalizing* them is a matter that's more effort than it's worth, because unfiltered idiosyncratic reasoning is not done in spoken language.Here's my ISTJ Stereotype: They are everywhere and basically make up plenty of niche communities with niche, specialized interests. Since they basically make up the entire sustainability of everything in the world.  
So yeah, be "boring", "responsible" and "reliable" so you can shit on the ones aren't kekekeke

The quotes mean what's convenient to your specific life situation of course, because *that* is Si!Ah... you wish...My stereotype: Anything you do and make effort to make *personally pleasing* is said art. And that could mean just slouching on the couch too :DThe ADHD is certainly in writing for sure. But it can be easily confused for Ne as well.  

I'm rather conlicted between ENFJ and ESFJ. But being more impulsive and less referencing to concrete cases, lack of representing your own experience, having a focus(even with the ADHD complications). I'd pick ENFJ, even with my reservations of typing to iNtuitive.An ISTP's best theory is in his hands.&gt; disturbing mindsets, from my perspective.

\&gt;disturbing mindset  
\&gt; Ni-dom  
#**ಠ_ಠ**&gt; INTPs that have this kind of detachment. INTP a little less due to their childlike wonder (Ne!).

Nope! The detachment is much more isolationist, less physically destructive, the psychological basis is all there, but in a much more hermit like behavior that lingers on the mental plane than seeking refuge in the literal source of stimulation.

&gt;I believe it is the result of dominant Ti. The function that produces a sense of detachment when immersed in modern life is the same function that allows ISTPs to be brilliant tacticians on the battlefield.

Tactics I feel like are a combo of Thinking and Sensing being applied in certain ways in certain contexts. Si would be a lot more adept at strategy where common sense of battle is concerned, while tactics on the field are more of a Se preference as they are more about seizing a moment. An INTP can develop a new strategy, but executing it is a wholly different matter where they are not as effective. Hearthstone Trump being a very good example of that.

&gt; ISTPs are incredibly prone to recklessness and addiction

Well... being physically edgy with yourself is something I would attribute to SPs and/or STs in general. But the particular brand OP is talking about is def STP specific. Very Beta.

&gt; Suppose there exists a pure-type INTP who can only use Ti Ne... this person would not function in society, stuck in an analysis-possibility-analysis cycle and completely detached from the outside world.

The problem is that pure Ti can never be satisfied with a reason to life, hence the emptiness. Ti-Si is debilitatingly isolationist as well. Ti-Ne is very tempered, it is still a familiar yet odd essence to most people(aka Si users).

&gt; I say ISTPs are more prone to recklessness and addiction compared to ESTPs is the fact that ESTPs, being dominant perceivers, are actually quite passive.

"Passive" in that context means "passive" to reasoning, aka you wouldn't be looking into the thrill with the idea to off yourself, you'd just embrace the thrill as it is. 

&gt; The key to all of this is self-development.

Or rather get the fuck on with your fucking life and fucking deal with it! Be concerned with your problems and responsibilities and you'll have no time to think "how to kill myself today". Why? Because it [*also* doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/oHAWkpGCP7A)!  
There is no universal answer to life, merely what you become content with!It's 1:30 am and I was fresh off work!Oh man, I had a great exchange about Te vs Ti mindset 2 years ago on another mbti subreddit. I can't remember well enough to hunt it down...

You can ask me anything about Ti. Though only from the Ne-Si side, there are some subtleties about the Ti-Se combo which don't conform to my own beliefs.Extroversion vs introversion. Responding vs internalizing.ESTJ it is. Ti-doms don't really look in any routine or just "getting it done", there is no real state step thinking, it's much more model focused.Te is Thinking, Ne-Fi are another matter.  

The essence of thinking doesn't change with attitude of the conscious, but how it applies itself does. Te is very situation focused and also very quick on that front, while Ti is much more model focused and details things in a consistent manner. &gt; So what you're saying is that I don't consciously say to myself ''Okay, now it's time to feel'' but I rather just naturally feel and that reflects itself on the usage of my Te?

Extroverted Judging is situation based and context sensitive, you may not notice how your line of Thinking changes on a whim by merely changing location. "Well of course I'm different in home than I am at work!", but what connects both to yourself? To a Ji user it's obvious because they don't separate themselves into a situation, to a Je user, they are different worlds.

&gt; Ti doesn't take direct objective action while Te does!

No introverted function takes any "objective" direction, they have their own subjective ones. They *derive* from the objective information, but they do not directly influence it in any way.Mirage relationship, almost the perfect Opposites attract model of Socionics, but with the kickback that it's not complete and more initially interesting than longterm, close investment.  

The emotional stillness of both parties eases initial interactions, but becomes obviously lacking when the bond requires reinforcement. 

Granted I assume you're not married to any INTP, then you'd call them smartly incomptetent. So your fine with the on and off exchanges.  

The entire theory is that both are pragmatic in their essence, however the applicaion is wholly, different, hence stimuli is produced. Coupled with shared cognitive perception, the transition of subjective, ideal model Thinking to objective, applied working Thinking is easy to translate.ISFJ -&gt; ENTP  
ENTJ -&gt; ISFP

ESTP -&gt; INFJ

Again, if we're going the Socionics relationships model.Whoops, tru dat.Cool, want to be a psycho- or sociopath as well? Because that comes with the package =3I mean... that's not wrong.More like inexperienced romantics.Because OP is being respectful to the LGBTQQIP2SAA community! Obviously!&gt; Ni is more practical than Ne

Se, yes. Ni, fuck no!  
By nature Ne is being objective and literal, Ni has no such grounding.  

Te-aux being more practical than an INTP is completely normal, as they reason how to apply themselves rather than in isolation.r/shittysocionics *

Eh, he can't be arsed.None. ISTJ.iNtuition presents the information of the unconscious, Sensing presents the information of the world.  

In layman terms: iNtuition comes forth with the idea, Sensing comes forth with the execution. And since the latter is what _stays_ in the material world, and matter more from a basic survival point, Sensors are a lot more common by nature.  

To answer your question: Intuitives are more creative, but they are practically more useless. Their supporting role is for Sensors not to stagnate, but influence their inferior intuition function, to point out their unconscious images.

And Intuitive can execute like any human being, but does lack the common sense that is often applied, and has to learn it anew every time, instead of being a process that seems natural. Hence, why Ns do the sketching and planning and Sensors do the building.

This is my rigid view. There's plenty more to it, but "creativity" is just one aspect of a whole that is ambiguously endless. Highly depends by what you mean by the word. A concrete example of your experience would shine a lot more light rather than speculating.Everyone's a Sensor until they show otherwise!INTP: Several paragraphs of different conculsions. Rigid, explained reasoning behind each of them.

ENTP: Several of different possibilities, explained reason rife with doubt and a back and forth.

INTJ: Paragraphs with dense sentences that have a lot to unravel and filled with double meanings. Products of initially unintelligible thoughts.

ENTJ: Too busy and active IRL to be depressed or be in a discussion subreddit.

Oh, and tests mean nothing. iNtuition is garbage too(personal experience).Funny, I'd say INTPs are the most confident of the bunch, especially in terms of reasoning, i.e. this thread.

&gt; \&gt;NTP/INTJ  
&gt; \&gt;similar  

wew lad I skipped the Enneagram typing at step 7, I just typed myself as a 5, since it does make the most sense with my selective reading. And I don't take the deep dive in Socionics either, I like some of their groupings, but I don't take them literally, mostly the Quadrants because they are convenient. Also, I don't type people IRL, and here online it's mostly for conjecture.  

So yeah, where's your God now?

~LII 5Add for Betas: secretly want to live in a Mad Max world.

Alphas section is pretty good.You should not have done that, Dave.What would be the Pi version of a pause tho?  

For Ji, I'd do share this *specificity of reasoning*, which is being translated in language in real time during said pause.They'll invite you, on the condition you get drunk asap.

Everyone wants to be the resident INTJ edgelord.Hedonistic™ ESTJ edgelord™.

Not an ENTJ, you lack Unconscious™ sense.  
Not an ESTP, intellectually arrogant instead but not boastful.  
Not an ENTP, too rigid™ with a strong sense of identity. Quite the sense of identity for an ESTP, no?  
Ti-doms have trouble with that, let alone Ti-aux. He certainly fills the activity quota, but it doesn't strike me as Se, seems driven by reason instead.That's what tests would type edgelords.More often than not it is just not worth the arduous effort and hassle to type someone else properly. If you spend enough time with someone in different contexts, it will come naturally, if not, then you don't have a good basis to type someone anyway.There are quite a few ways to see that dichotomy through the function lens.

Pragmatic could be Je or just Sensing in general. While principality would be Ji territory, and intuitives will lean more towards it since it leaves more room for the Unconscious to be Percieved.Well, here's an example of something between me and my ESFP roommate.

I drink a pills to clear my breathing airways. And he mentions that drinking pills with soda may interfere with active ingredient. As a bachelor of Fine Organic Synthesis, he would be right. But I responded "The capsules are resistant to stomach acid for a reason, I really shouldn't add more acid on top :D."Real INTJs are actually pretty cool, interesting people. They can be obtuse, but with a bit deciphering, what they do say makes sense. You just need patience and adjustment to see beyond their combative tone and expression.ISTPs master their interestс. ISFPs express themselves through their interests.

Even in stressful situations, a Ti-dom is still nonchalant to others.It's the exaggeration that it is not in your nature to something that is not in your direct interest, and you don't overlook a possibility for a good time. Intense experiences are what you chase, sometimes to the detriment of responsibility. 

And here's a concrete example with my ESFP rommmate: "I tend to forget myself." - By that he means that he can become so entwined in his immediate happenings that he has no conscious control over what he does or says, most likely exerting force out or reaction rather than executing a decision. It doesn't mean he's thoughtless, it means that he *can* be. Being immediately aware of your surroundings, not giving them any rational thought that is clear means that you're immediately reactive, but you can't tell what who why or when, it just is. Reasoning is secondary and murky, but in the ESFP case, it is the ultimate expression of their will in the most literal sense possible.Lazy ESTP or an ISFP who doesn't get it but wants to anyway.&gt; Ni: another wave in the sea of essence

ftfy

&gt; If I’m being honest, learning about **my own type (INFJ)**

Stopped right there.Because they don't know either :DBut... you're not a Px-dom tho.OP is describing Si\Ne things, Se/Ni types perceive their unconscious elements differently.You're ISTJ. And the human world has plenty of ISTJs, doesn't seem that stale or rigid to me.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯It's on teh interwebz, therefore it *is* passive-aggressive dang nabbit!Will [this](https://imgur.com/Yuy7EBk) do?Ne is the tangible potentiality of experience. Exploring those same mixed elements in a sense.I want to punch you through the monitor.No Feeler input on this? Or is the act of trolling more of a tool for Thinkers to acknowledge the need for levity.Fi as well too.It's a just pedantic matter. "Mind thinks for me" implies a judgement process, when in actuality it is layman for being flooded with Perceiving, which is true for Pe doms. They don't "think" aka reason like J-doms, the intake.An ISTP that *needs* to go outside. /threadDefinitely not a Ni-dom for sure. Also being emotional, doesn't mean you can't be a Thinking type either.&gt; I seek more knowledge

Well, there you go. You "seek knowledge", not "inquire information". Ti content and Ni content per se are entirely different. Ni isn't exactly tangible, Si is because is deals with tangible matter, but as an introverted Perceiving function it's not any easier to identify or describe. Atm I'm very attached to the Ti model based reasoning explanation. Ni on the other hand is unconscious, meaning it's much less noticeably active, it just keeps absorbing info all the time, it doesn't consider what it is or where it comes from, it's all material that coalesces together. And no, it doesn't form a thing or let alone a vision, merely, in that mush there is something tangible that does relate more to the current reasoning inquiries of the conscious, hence "insight".  

Ti insights are much more clearer in the way they click, it's not done through clashing things together like Ni and grinding them into fine paste, it is meticulous filtering process of what fits in the model and what doesn't, it's more "language" based, but it certainly works on its own terms that are defined for its own purposes, unlike Ni, that would be too narrow of a focus and too constricting. 

A Ni-dom has a particular filter in their writing, often with double meaning, their intentions as such may be clear, but they often hint to more beneath the surface. Ti is hard impartial reasoning that seeks consistency in its subjective model, it is never completed, merely left for further building or refining.

An INFJ as a Ni-dom has its reasoning functions to give reasoning tangibility to what they observe. An ISTP has the perceiving functions to have information for Ti to process. In the way both types can confuse themselves is similar: reason on subjective basis, but never reach a satisfactory conclusion, try again.

MBTI will not help you out with your self-identity problems, it's merely *a compass* so you feel less lost when diving into the mind.PHAH!

Here, you deserve [this](https://i.imgur.com/7jz7KWJ.jpg)!Yup, because you have them as something definite not merely tangible.

No J-dom can absorb info as a P-dom. No P-dom can reason info like a J-dom.Well yeah, that's the nature of introverted attitude functions, they're subjective and naturally create idiosyncrasies in the individual.The the fundamental process pattern is similar, but the content, reasoning, conclusions are entirely different. Thinking scoffs at sentiment, Feeling embraces it for example.  

Fi is what most identify as a strong personal drive.Probably  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Si is plenty weird than people give it credit for.You are rational in your way of consciousness, but you can't really save a Beta from being a nutjob now, can you.&gt; Se PoLR function - Bad at it and does not find value in it

I do find great value in it, but *not from myself*, it's atrocious.Nah, you're **EVERYWHERE**, in every community, in every nook and cranny on the web!I basically mean that there's usually bound to be an ISTJ in most niche communities.If we were, every day would be Tuesday.I dunno... [judge for yourself \(;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inHvZ25b5VY)This is alt reality Hitler where he won the war and essentially has built a up a techno-empire!  
This is also a cultural reflection, as there were reports to Hitler mentally deteriorating from stress. Also, it's funny.Him being a troll president makes so much more sense now, doesn't it?  
And it makes quite the resume in board rooms to say "I was the fucking President of the US!".Thank your lungs it's below 1.Same, I'm 5 years with an ESFP roomie. A few months with an ESFP co-worker as well, started much worse with her, but now, I'm happy she's there to keep me honest and direct me to taking a decision decisively.&gt;I just think INTPs are complete assholes, does anyone else feel the same way?

Why do you feel that way?Opposite cognitive attitudes lead to opposite engagements with the world. INTPs get overwhelmed by an ESFPs presence, whereas they get frustrated with an INTP's adherence to structure (that's in their way).  
It's just a small example of PolR function positions pushing their buttons. If you meet actual INFJs, you'll see what that means, even if it's entirely different (pragmatic assembly from experience into wholesome elements vs distilled and marinated insight of experiences).Si is is still Perceiving, Pi-doms are always absorbing info, it's an unconsciously active process. It's pretty normal for someone to feel naked when thrust into a new context. Se users are infamous for being adaptive on the spot, but Si users need some time to Perceive things through their subjective lens and come out with concrete info.  

Ne just immediately jumps to associations towards what is already familiar, which is what you do, but only to the point it gives a basis for you to conceptualize something real. Whereas Ne users are fine with the potentiality of reality and keep moving on and on without much more of a thought, think of it as a breezy adventure that ignores all the requirements of travelling or even going it, all the mundane stuff from which moments originate, it's the highlights that Ne Perceives, the details are merely connective to more possibility.Preserve the Present - Alpha  
Let the future - Beta  
Force the future - Gamma  
Back to the past - Delta

Heavy stereotyping in that btw, I like the schematic words more for the quadras. Think of it more like which corresponding Quadra types are more likely to lean towards which group box.I say the system only exists because you made it lulOh... opposing Pi-doms...

Seen [this vid by MPierce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIL3lMJn4cc&amp;t=0s)? It's really damn good, and it even mentions how the INFP/INFJ go over each others' heads about the same things. And there is certainly some good stuff in there you can find for INFJ/ISTJ.Ah, it's just the S/N divide. Si-dom assumes their observations are obvious, while you're rambling like "wtfamieven". Even in text it just plays out like a fun scenario where the ISTJ is driving and you're just rambling.I've had the Fi side of that. Basically you emotionally close up because you're so upset with someone not going along with your sentiment so you refuse to share any further communication at all.  
It's rather a juvenile stereotype, but it exists....

Now you can think of a way that would apply to an INFJ context. Though I think you'll have more success with the ISTJ, that's where the Fi's at.Doorslamming, duh. Actually I think there's even a Ti version, but it's very different. Thinking is hardcodedly convinced that it is correct, and it's missing a link, a formulae that would "make sense". It's less about a scorned sentiment, and more about something that's judged as inconceivable.  

So in an even wider context, it might as well be any judging function "slamming the door" per se on any further info inflow.Why tho? Too much competition?But what if I like running into SJs?It pays well for a Ji-dom to be open minded and just give into Perception. Yet that is against their nature, their better judgement. However, it is essential for their cognitive evolution.  
The world has plenty of P-doms around.But my comfort shelter! ;_;I'd say keeping friends just isn't a natural priority.Se- what is happening around me  
Si- what is happening to me  
Ni- What could be happening  
Ne- What is potentially happening

This is still limiting, but with the "happen" meme, I think this is well enough.It's not about your opinion being shit. It's about you presenting it in a shitty way!

~fellow F-infSure, but if someone cleans for you, they'd be ruining your organized mess! Heheheheh!Te is far more adept at applying theory. As he mentions, he looks for the *discussion*, the back and forth.  
Stewing in your own conscious won't wield the results you're looking for, externalizing thoughts will not only be helpful, but also much more efficient, as they would often prove the simplicity of something in application rather then the complex replication in your mind.

Basically find an outlet, a group, a course where you can share your interest with others.&gt; Also no surprise extroverts dominant in the e versions of these types would be the quietest online. They are to busy either Se-ing, Te-ing, or Fe-ing their beliefs to the public offline.

Nah, they just do it on facebook/instgram. If they're older, they have a rhythm of just being fine with their own societal space.What I mean is that Extroverts simply engage in different social media and in different corners of reddit that take less of their engagement time, not because they have shorter attention spans, but because they are naturally more interested in their current space rather than online.Yes, yes Mr. ISTP, you don't need to dive into this endlessly ambiguous theory of whack-a-mole.Aww... baby Te is so adorable.Not ~~Hitler~~ Führer enough I say, there's no symbolism to it!^^psst... ^^I ^^think ^^OP ^^is ^^an ^^ESTJ ^^talking ^^about ^^a ^^Fi-dom&gt; Stop looking at me like I’m some sort of alien creature you’re trying to figure out. It’s creepy as fuck.

Ah, quite the interesting reaction! But what causes it?(hmm... hormones, anxiety, insecurity. Will have to look those up later)  
\*keeps staring*

&gt; Oh also, stop shitting on idealism.

Idealism is naïve and completely unattainable. At worst it's used as an excuse for one's questionable means, or even becomes an obsession of the ego. The world has shown time and again how there is no place for it, aside from emotional comfort which is immaterial. Also, it's just fun to poke!

&gt; If I hear “Humans are flawed by nature, there’s nothing we can do” ONE MORE TIME I’ll fucking show you how flawed I can be.

Yes please! ʘ‿ʘJust make your defiant resistance official: RAGE AGAINST THE ~~MACHINE~~ INTUITIVES!&gt; being iconic. Heh.

Iconic or Ironic?Kek, try out Socionics ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)I definitely am, but I also know better than to apply it at every corner. It's a compass that is useful in psychoanalytical speculation, but as hard categorizing, it leaves MUCH to be desired.No /s for me, it means the person is honest with their ego at the very least!Stop telling me what to do MOM!Why, just why is this kind of self-deprecation so damn gratifying ಥ‿ಥ&gt; This is true, but what if your senses were taken away from you completely?

Hence why fever dreams can cause pretty serious anxiety for Se-doms. It's not a product of their senses as they are familiar with them, yet it existed just as much to their conscious, so which one is it?Also, introverted, i.e. natural experience with the subjective plane of the unconscious.Tbh Si of all functions is the one that engages the future as we understand it as a concept *the most*.Si-users naturally become proficient in their practices.Not necessarily just to build upon just past experiences, but also solidifying and securing their situational state within their current life context.F types first  
T types 2nd  

Outside of that pattern, it all depends on context.You underestimate the passion Ti-doms develop for their interests. People do notice that care and attention they put into something. Naturally it's something one is emotionally invested it, but as usual, T users don't mull about it in a value context, despite their inherently allotted value into their interest/activity.

This also reads like Ji-dom post, organized subjective thoughts categorized in a neat manner for future mulling. And a Fi-dom would express a lot more doubt rather than lay the evidence for judgement, they would judge the evidence for themselves, since that enables *their* expression, not someone else's.For Ti it's a simple systematic change. In practice it's an entire overhaul that requires essentially throwing a wrench to what's established, completely negating the proposed efficiency.It's actually kinda fun to see how common the ISTP flair is around here. Ti-doms are very particular about being Ti-doms, and it's not like misinformed Si stubbornness, reasoning *must be* sound for an argument to be given the time of day by Ti.

Cognitive bias is inherent to Ji-doms, it's in their nature. What matters is how they handle it.Found the sensor! ʘ‿ʘGod, you have no idea, I had an ESFP colleague and the way she could get things rolling and even make me be more active on the job was pretty damn amazing. She was quite expeditive and motivated, really smashes complacency.Well, it's not like your roundabout rambling isn't enriching her vocabulary either. She can probably sum up a concept you struggle to communicate with a single word, is it probably exists as a "solid matter" in her mental plane. Even if it doesn't have the dynamism you usually observe for, you can still tell that it's merely under the crust if the initial word.For some reason I feel like this is more spurned Sensing from your part. You are there, with her, to pay attention to what she would point to concretely, whereas she got entangled in the researching process seeking out potentiality, the interactive associations available and how it connects to what's relevant to your project, Si-Ne contextual building.  
But from the objective view of things, aka yours as a viewer, it gave nothing to chew on. So you spurned into your own action with a focus on condensing info as close to the defined focal point, rather than building around it, eventually something connecting it. The method would seem crude from the Si-Ne perspective, but with a deadline, you take what you can get, and with a bit of reasoning, it is often more than enough. In which case the more flow oriented dynamism of Se-Ni, which is *immediate* context focused does serve better than the universal context building of Si-Ne.  

And yes, in a slightly different context that can be immediately turned around like you having an idea of what might happen, whereas she calls it out *exactly* how it happens and you observe in awe at how cleverly she applied herself and/or her own experience/knowledge. Nah, you pretty much got down the pattern. I do believe it is more of a perception axis interaction rather than judging. It's the same thing with my dad, who I also believe is an ISTJ(stereotypical, I know, but damn if he doesn't exhibit the stereotypical qualities of a middle age countryside mechanic, which is what he is). Every time he and mom go shopping in the towns, it takes hours as he has to check every price tag of every thing he is interested in now and for the coming 6 months.  
While me and mom just shop out in less than an hour. And this is a case of where we all share Si-Ne, but in different positions. Yes, there's a boatload of context behind that, but I hope you find it a satisfactory example.Well... [here obviously](https://media3.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif)!

Oh, and also here:

&gt; whereas she calls it out exactly how it happens and you observe in awe at how cleverly she applied herself and/or her own experience/knowledge.

Sensing is very context sensitive. While Se is reactive to its immediate surroundings, again contextual Se-Ni axis, Si is *considerate of its place in the world it interacts with*, she has thought about about exactly to execute her established tasks, and with previous experience, she can do it even more efficiently. So with the Si-Ne expansiveness, with a set, concrete focus where the cognitive perceiving ends and a judgement is made, the consecutive action seems almost automatic. 

It may sound rigid(it's Ti theorizing, c'mon), but that's the only way of universal perception, linear state-based observations.  
Time may flow like a river, but it's much easier to track, follow and predict a leaf that's fallen on the water surface rather than observing the flow itself.

And yes, disclaimer that Se is also keenly aware of its situation, but again, in the immediate sense rather than the universal, that's just the cognitive pattern behind the actions, of which both are equally capable.&gt; that this superpower thing draws on her previous experience? That it has a set, concrete focus (and if so, what is that and why does it not come into play with the other pattern we're discussing)? And/or something else?

Naturally, if you've done something, you can do it again, and the 2nd time will be faster as you know what's what. 

Whereas your OP situation is where she doesn't have that personal experience, so she does the next best thing: seek out an experience from someone else, that's where Si and collective unconscious mesh, and as you know well, Ni draws quite closely from the collective unconscious, that you *need* the concrete examples that are not distorted but have *form*. She takes tidbits from others, and adapts them for her own concrete perception, it has to have a form for it to exist and be acknowledged for the judgement. Instead of ruminating on patterns above patterns that finally come together, eventually. Whereas Si perceptions' eventuality is when they are applied by the Si user.

You'll notice that some people attribute wiki binges to ISTJ, less so to ISFJ, but still, it's a stereotype I would most likely accept more towards to the Si-Ne axis rather than Se-Ni. 

Aaand I'm losing focus myself, not really answering your question. So here's the crunched version: She doesn't know, k? She is not adaptable as you(perception wise)! Her superpower is sussing out her *situation* rather than her surroundings, those are an aftereffect. Whereas your superpower is sussing out a more general, often non-linear pattern and applying that knowledge in an immediately useful fashion, she could never dream of doing something like that, ask her about it (;

&gt; And, is Te involved at all in this superpower thing?

Yes, she does it [LIKE A BAWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c)!

&gt;So about this leaf thing, are you saying that as long as there aren't tons of leaves to look at, and/or if she has already chosen which leaf to track, she is awesome at tracking just the one and not getting all perceptually distracted and fascinated by the complexities and contextual movements of and related to the flow itself?

If that leaf is *her*, you can bet your life on it! And it was meant to accentuate state-based(Si-Ne) vs flow(Se-Ni) perception. Describing water flow each second is complicated, but easy to apply if you're just using eye and feel- experiencing it for yourself. On paper, it's easier to use the leaf as an anchor and provide the difference between its states in timespace- giving it a concrete form that can be stored and shared.

&gt; Is part of why exploring in linear detail not distressing to her the way it is to me is that for me ther is no linear track to follow so I am easily overwhelmed by the associational material around and below and etc etc whatever we're doing as well, while she is focused on one thing at a time even when she's going one to another?

This is more of Sensing vs Intuiting thing, and no, it's not just info overload which we all have in this era. Patterns are numerous, each with its own potentiality and truth, no? But if it has no form, they have no function, Sensing is interested in the form, Intuition is interested in its function, jumping ahead *quite a bit*. A form is established linearly as that is how we perceive reality, something instilled in Sensing perception, but far from absolute in Intuition as the unconscious isn't affected directly by timespace.&gt; Ni's more detached (I think that's a good word maybe??) pattern-seeking.

I think *distanced* is a more apt adjective you're looking for. A view from which the form blends into a pattern of other forms.

&gt; Thank you! You're always so awesome at explaining this stuff in a way that I can (eventually) grasp.

As always, you're welcome (;Not gonna lie, it's amusing to me seeing flustered Si-users cling the Intuitive badge.

&gt; Dude, that's Si.

&gt; NO! \*provides rebuttal in an Si fashion*Maybe OP is from Japan? I'm not sure if Korea and China share that belief as prominently, but I wouldn't be surprised.As a mother, you are *forced* to assign value in your life, hence making you aware of the emotional balance you have to establish in yourself in order to be efficient as you naturally are.  

I'm pretty convinced that you are an ESTJ. One who is aware of how important internal consistent values are, but an ESTJ nonetheless. You are very contextually aware of your situation(Si), and you aren't big on sentiments, doubly so if they're not yours or don't concern you directly(no Fe). So that leaves an STJ type, and you talk more about your interactions rather than your thought process, citing pure examples, hence Extroversion.

You can freely throw out the idea of "tradition", and "responsibility *to others*" is not a priority for STJs either, it's just part of the job to keep trouble out of your corner of the world.I'm not averse to this idea, it can fit just as well. 

PS: Now that I reread the post. It does make sense, even outside the motherly context provided.But what if I am a Se-PolR type then?How about Bayonetta Non-Stop Infinite Climax difficulty? I give you 5 controllers to brake from mashing, if you throw them at any point, you'll be paying!In my case, it's less of a dissonance, though it is a part of it, mostly due to my more rough Eastern European context, too much of American and Japanese media seems "soft" and "wussy" to me, not bothering to speak about the struggles of life, but just scratching the surface and blowing it off with an epilogue montage.  
And of course, there's the opposite extreme of pragmatic nihilism ala Breaking Bad/Game of Thrones/Walking Dead where everyone is an amoral bastard and nothing matters outside their own gain. All the momentous drama is great, but it never amounts to something wholesome to be truly learned from X, because X is *dead*, HA!

Hence I like spoilering myself quite often, as I want to know what I'm getting into, what I'll be investing my attention to, because I can't turn off my analysis mode whether I like it or not. So I like having my constraints beforehand not to misunderstand the work and its intentions. Though I'm very much an anime buff, yet the currently produced shows more often than not bore me with bland ass presentation. Yet, [I found this literal gem last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56DnckxJ-0).As an anti-social sheltered nerd: THANK YOU!It's a stereotype that's rightly associated with Thinking. Judging functions give us definitions, and by nature are easily defined themselves.  
Yes, T-doms can be cold. Yet, as actual people they do have emotions and values in them, it's just not seen as much of a priority by them.Any type, it's more circumstantial than cognitive.&gt;Also, those descriptions were written in a way to be "freakishly accurate".

What do you mean by this? That they overreach what they actually are? I.e. still leaning on old stereotype ideas.The idea of Duality relationships that by constant engagement with a dom to your inf, you are to naturally mature your own self. That is a constant challenge for both parties, it is up to them to build an understanding of themselves and each other through their entire cognitive stack. Hence it is seen as the "ideal" or rather most fulfilling relationship by socionics terms, but that doesn't mean it can't go sour or other relationships can't bloom.But what if logic as a concept comes from Judgement. As Perception merely accepts information unconditionally, its limits are contextual factors, less so than reasoning.Ni word vomit is a bit different. It's much more goopy than soupy. Very viscous in comparison.Eh, I've been here for 4 years now, and I can tell you that after a point, you just get jaded by this. So I snidely just poke at those people with my own take on MBTI, but nothing changes, infact it's only been getting worse.  

The old guard that were trying to make sense of Jung's mess is long gone, or just apathetically lurk here like me, with that faintest hope they could find something interesting, a new take on the theory, an interpretation in a real situation and the like, to *learn* something new through others' experiences. Yet, the ego validation has only gotten stronger and more prominent, which is expected to be cynically honest  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯It will get worse, every sub becomes watered down as it gets more and more populated.Here's quite the example with ancient greek philosophy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jZMkvHCZRcSo, which aspects do you like from either presentation and person?"I'm not romantically interested in you, so you may stop stalking me. However, I still appreciate your companionship regardless of this."Yup, after this message, it's down to him to man up.Likely to be ISTJ  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Not in the least. INTPs are particularly smart in practical terms.It's a J thing in general, since you function with reason, it would be reasonable to assume that others do as well. Then, you meet Pi-doms.&gt;  quantity of ideas seems to be positioned as a valid measure of success at creativity and creative problem solving. I'm now wondering why that would be. Why is the unfettered generation of as many different ideas as possible seen as closely tied with creativity and creative problem solving? What's the link there?

Again, it hearkens back to differing Perception axis. Si is a huge influence on societal ettiquette, and for good reason too. Remember how last time I mention that Si has that "form" it observes, but is uniquely independent from reality as it observes said perceptions on the unconscious plane, in contrast to the swirling patterns the Intuition is more adept at taking on as info.  
Si-Ne's take on exploration is very branching and expansive, universal as Michael Pierce calls it, it projects a situation and what is possible in it. Ni-Se on the other hand takes said exploration, and instead *focuses* until it becomes something *doable*, something that *fits into context*, rather than generate context around it.  

If you assume Brainstorming is taken in the Si-Ne manner, it's a lot more about throwing ideas on a wall and see what sticks. So long as an idea seems sound, it is included, move on to the next one, the cycle repeats. The filtering process of real factors is the trial by error simulation, which includes judging, sifting the ideas that hold up and those that unstick themselves so to say.

Brainstorming in your case is more about managing foci, and trying to put one into use. Your natural process is pattern sifting, not form sifting, a swirling vortex that devours all info that may marinate or dynamically move at any time anywhere through an odd association simply cannot adhere to real factors, because they could never be applied to general patterns, said patterns are supposed to be used to establish the factors, not the other way around! Ne pattern sifting is much more concrete in comparison, because it uses objective information, info that is already established and existing, simply encountered by the user, rather then generated from their unconscious. Ne takes patterns from established forms and Si absorbs them into the unconscious, Ni absorbs and focuses on patterns so Se can receive a form to generate in real time.

Si naturally gels with the Ne pattern of idea generation, brainstorming w/e you want to call it. But Ne looks at the *potentiality*, the raw potentiality of something, Si usually observes the application. As a Ni-dom, you've had to adapt to use foci into application, you're forced to by life itself, society simply won't wait for things to just turn up, you are expected to do it yourself!  

So in the end, your cognitive habit of idea generation is backwards focused on already having the "ideas", but observing it as info, all of it is info that swirls together be it single or multiple, trailing off trajectories you can't feasibly follow all at once, but the ones that resonate closer to reality or the unconscious, proving that they have an eventual form. Whereas Si, it looks at the collection of Ne(potentiality) and coalesces it together into a form, it is not sifting patterns towards a form, but *collecting patterns* into a form, *that* is why quantitative idea generation is seen as the standard by the *Sensing collective unconscious*.  
This methodology is behind the Percieving is how your ISTJ SO got infatuated with the research process itself much more so than the supposed goal you focused on. She had the skeletal schematic of the form, but not the patterns from other forms, whereas you had the patterns and already a focus where to look and sift through.

Like, here's a fun experiment with your SO: how would she put together a puzzle, and how would you put it together. There is a methodology to the action, yes, but what information do you take into account which leads to said action.I know you're busy, and you like grinding my spitballed Ti crystals into fine dust. ;P

&gt; Her: \*starts laughing as I am typing on the keyboard*

&gt; Me: What?

&gt;Her: \*through her chuckles*: It's just that I'm sitting here looking at that [the writing] and thinking about words to remove and you're sitting there adding more words!

&gt;Me: Oh shit you're right \*laughing* with her

Next time, say in a sly, yet shy manner: "But I have so many more words I can't even write. xD"&gt; So then, after we threw ideas on the wall (almost literally, we used post-its), we combined the ones that were basically similar (which was interesting because I started pattern-matching/clustering as related to possible actions/projects that could combine various elements, and not doing it so much in terms of similarity per se.

That's exactly it. On Si side of things, and it is the corporate approach, aka Si-Te or Te-Si, and since it's collectively used by that side of society, it comes off as very manufactured to your SO, who is much more keenly aware of her integral Si subjectivity, taking that away and just leaving the Te structure as it is, it becomes very obvious what the aim is, often not pretty, but "efficient".

&gt; Not to be a stickler for words here, but I will be when i say: I don't think that is actually "brainstorming" as it is defined and used. Mentioning only because it has the feel of some organizational *"thing to do"* in the way it was done in that workshop. It's easier for me to think of the larger category as creative problem-solving or along those lines, with brainstorming being one possible way to do that. Does that make sense/seem useful to you?

Well, there you go, the Te aspects that really mismatches with Ni Percieving. It's also an integral part of the "Brainstorming" exercise, where do you think the limiting factors come from, they are heavy judgement that are meant to control info flow rather ride alongside it. 

&gt; Not sure I am getting this yet.

You can break down my Ni impressions further, you are my Ni inspiration after all, I shouldn't really cast down my own spitballed theory about your own mental process, which you have shown time and again to be keenly aware of. I simply reflect back what I've seen from your language in this sub (;

&gt; Would it be accurate from your perspective to say that for Ni-Se, the core of the creative process is in seeing new patterns - allowing patterns to cohere differently than initially set up or presented? The creativity is in [radical] changes to the form?

From an outside perspective, absolutely this seems like the case. And it takes looking at the proposed end observation for it to even make remote sense from the Si-Ne axis, a lot of judging becomes involved through translating the details.

&gt;  Whereas for Si-Ne, the creativity is in generating lots of content while taking as a given existing forms?

I wouldn't say generation, as people would tell you that you generate a lot of odd ideas, I'm sure your SO has told you this. But as it isn't "generating stuff out of thin air" for you, that is neither the case for Ne. Ni and Ne are simply "blindsiding" each other through their attitude, to both, all info is fair game, but where Ni observes *absorbed* information, Ne has readily available *objective* information. Any Ne user would tell you that "nothing is original, everything is made out something", meaning that something always precedes the existence of a "new" thing, it had a previous form, which naturally ties to the Si's impression of linearity and reproduction as well. For example it's much more cut and dry to say that a Unicorn comes from observing a [Lancer from the sidelines](https://imgur.com/a/EF9tvjS), removing the rider and expressing the pointy tip as a horn makes sense in comparison rather than it being some outlandish fantasy. Which goes back to Ne's observation for potentiality of a form, seeing it as something, established, yet malleable. Instead of taking the malleable matter to establish a form.

&gt; So what does this say or change in my above stab at a description:

Yes, it does, from your perspective. Just replace "generating" with "collecting", and you're there (;&gt; Is this consistent with what you're saying when you write:

Pretty much, then she would know exactly the type of "brainstorming" they're applying.

&gt; Efficient for what kinds of purpose(s) - can you speak to that?

Well, you kind of answered it for yourself:

&gt; but maybe more about the amount of bullshit in the dissonance between the appearance of "we're all contributing in an open and free-flowing way" on one hand with the underlying more hidden control toward, say, corporate-type purposes on the other hand?

It's easier to make people belive they're contributing, when you're really directing them, coaxing them toward your eventual point. A common Je tactic.  
It's efficient as introductory step to someone new, and it's common to cycle people in your marketing scheme.  
But from my initial post, it was meant that it was a neat, organized, systemized practice. Which is used to sell projects, selling potentiality per se.

&gt; So we're not so much describing Ni as we are in a mutual clarifying loop describing my specific dominant function preference that we both name as Ni?

More or less, but the patterns hold up. I honestly don't have any other people I'm sure are Ni-users. But I always like seeing a Sensor flair.

&gt; I suspect it's because how brainstorming is described/presenting, like it's some kind of cool and fun and happy idea-generation factory.

In order to sell the idea that you created something of value, even if doesn't exist, just for emotional validation of accomplishment. Oh, villainized Te is so amusingly stereotyped by media. Doesn't help that rampant capitalism heavily encourages it though, but so does any type of ruthless politicking.

&gt; And yet atthe same time, she was very clear that music often replicates itself, so for example she truly loved this one piece that layered one song on top of another showing how they all used the same basic chords and variations on melody. 

Remixes are extremely common in music. And there are even very well established beats, to the points where they are categorized in actual academic music theory.&gt; I could see it saying a couple of different things, opposite to each other, so curious what you mean.

What I mean is that, the way Te applies its take on efficiency onto people, dehumanizing them into another cog of the machine is just so easy to villainize on paper, and to blame for work being hard on you. Also, I was also thinking of Three Kingdoms(2010) Chinese TV drama, where one of the main characters, who was a faction leader was such an extremely [ruthless politician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao). It's a 90 episode show, and a period epic, I just have a soft spot for how it romanticzes the events of the actual era and makes the characters and their faults feel real and human, despite juggling a huge cast with 3 different faction perspectives in a constant shift.  
But this also diverges from what I was explaining earlier as how Si forms are tied to the collective unconscious. If it has a place in corporate culture, it's probably corporate bullshit, which Se-Ni has little tolerance for, even ENTJs for if they're not the ones exploiting it in their own fashion.It's more down to circumstantial nurturing of the character. Typology can explain  some trends, but only on a case by case basis, it's neat as navigation theory, but not as something scientifically consistent. And with today's tech giving everyone the key to the world, you have *a lot* of reference material to reflect on, so self-awareness has naturally risen with this era imo.  

And no, I don't have any stats or articles to point to to support my point, just general observations from the corners of the web I scurry in."OK, Mom! I don't care to feel much because *life sucks and we're all gonna die*, no amount of *feeling* will change that."Bulgaria, need more Slavs here lolUhm... isn't this more of a Thinking thing? I'd like to hear some Te input on this.&gt; his reputation precedes his actual ideas which is a problem.

When he's being abrasive in his posts, this is the natural consequence. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯[&gt; NTJs being consistent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA)&gt; or maybe....

OP is trying to add nuance but misses the mark through misinformation.I made a joke 3 years ago how /r/mbti is /r/shittyMBTI, yet someone made it hours later...&gt; Even so, he would fit ESTJ

He'd some actual semblance of consistency, and present his pride in a different manner imo.OK, here's a treat for you. I think Vince McMahon is an ESFP. An extremely charismatic performer who seeks to draw out the emotion of the crowd, going to any lengths to accomplish that goal, even if that included not-so-wise business decisions and having to make up 5 hours of a live show every week.I'd be hard pressed to do, if he were, he'd look a lot more like a dictator ala Ceaser, Napoleon rather than a caricature villain that shit talks people to rustle their jimmies. He's purposefully bending truth into a caricature, rather than using it as a hammer against his enemies, letting social media do the work for him, rather than forcing it by himself.

Also, he's no Stalin either, unhealthy ENTJs in power will use any ruthless means to reinforce and keep said power(wouldn't you?), even if it unstabilizes things further.

So yeah, I don't think Trump is a Gamma at all. Gamma flair is more "insane"to me, Trump is just funny :DBut I dun wanna offend anybody ;_;Yeah, this is pretty much Alpha subjective info process on paper. It seems chaotic, and it naturallly is, but the end result is a *universal* insight that builds up overtime. A subjective model of the world, it's fine line for Alphas to consider what they've fabricated and what they see.&gt; With my ISTJ, her linear buildup of and focus on details over time more than patterning seems a useful way to distinguish between our respective info processing.

Contextual reasoning (Te-Fi)-&gt; Universal Peception(Si-Ne) vs Universal reasoning(Fe-Ti) -&gt; Contextual Perception(Ni-Se)

&gt;And, too, I know with my ISFJ friend, there seems to be both a convergence and divergence in our processing approaches.

For Alphas, in my case it's : Universal context(Ne-Si) feeding into Universal reasoning. For OP, it's just reasoning -&gt; perception, since ya'll Pi-doms.

&gt;The OP reads to me as far more conscious and deliberately pattern seeking than my experience with Ni. Kind of like, more obviously practical and somehow more organized (to my perception, though you name it as chaotic from your vantage point it seems not so chaotic at all to me). Also more clearly tied to the information itself rather than the images and symbols and resonances as the anchor points for perception in my case.  
I'm trying to suss out what feels "more organized" to me about your approach than my own. I think some of it is that it seems more - systematic than my perceptual/analytical process is.  

Again, goes back to the *concrete* Percieving that Sensing does in general. It seems a lot more defined to you, yet is still chaotic to Ti. You converge with Alphas in terms of reasoning, through that you are able to understand their conclusions and draw your observations forwards. &gt; Wouldn't reasoning serve perception by helping to consciously analyze/organize/bring it into consciousness?

In a Pi-dom yes. And I meant *taking reasoning as it is into it*, feeding into it, leading into it. Less so Perceiving being a consequence of reasoning, but rather *adding* to Perceiving well of info. And yes, the dominant cognitive function is meant to dominate over the other 3 , so every process by them eventually loops back to the dominant.Again, we're going back to concrete vs general. And also, OP is using different terms than me. Sensing tackles real objects, real situations that have form and are easily defined.  
Often Si-doms will describe certain experiences of feeling like they *know* something, then they check, and it turns out to be real. In contrast, that is the only thing that gives a sense of direction in the general relativity of your subjective plane, so it is *essential* that you don't just stumble upon it, but actively Percieve for it, if not, to at least keep your sanity with your existing real life form(hyperbole).

I still believe conscious processing is very much related to the Extroverted attitude, as it is orientated to objective information i.e. *it exists*. But I'd also say that Judging is also a conscious process, even for Introverted functions, while nowhere as easily descriptive, Ti can still be mapped out, Fi can still be expressed. Si has the concrete object it took its projection from and can point to it, even if it's not 1:1 replica, while Ni has generality. Hence why it is "foolish" for a Ni-dom to communicate what they Percieve, it seems to have no grounding of sorts, nor does its info have a definition.

&gt; My emphasis is on the conscious *analytical* part yes.

With this, you're immediately jumping into judging, categorizing info. Even for a P-dom, this is going beyond stating observations, most often one has to actively *Think*, aligning info in a correct fashion that is correlated to factual information. You can feel the letters of this sentence just locking into place and not budging.

&gt;  I find myself struggling (albeit slowly improving) on doing things without knowing perfectly what I'm supposed to be doing (inferior Ne problems).

Si-dom with no previous experience is like walking on their bare feet, it doesn't feel good. Remember how we commented when your SO got stuck? Same thing, without previous experience, a Si-dom stumbles, and looks for others' experience. And yes, that's a natural process for any human being, but it's the first thing they lean on, while I would really want to structure and define it for myself, the info I would seek would be meant for that goal specifically, it only matters to the answer I reason, not the info itself.

&gt; Ne/Se are mostly unconscious

Perception is *much less consciously driven* is what I would reword this as, coinciding with my previous statement how Judging is "conscious" and I'd say is what we define as "conscious processing". At most, you can consciously direct it, and that's what J-doms naturally do. P-doms on the other hand, and heck this is exactly what the xxxP descriptions stereotype, they are scatterbrained. It's a lot more about the objective information surrounding them, it doesn't matter what it is, if you can touch it, it's real, if you can imagine it, it's potential. Little rhyme and reason and therefore little direction, and most important in societal context *no end goal*, no defined point A, let alone point B, that is merely coincidental. Again, this is hyperbole to reinforce a point, it's just relative general patterns of cognition and what's going through one's mind before they speak or do.

&gt; that is the exact same thing I feel when I try to use my crappy Ne for doing things rather than my superior Si

Hmmm... back to the Si-dom example I started with. I guess this is finally something I can pin on Pi, when it *synchronizes with the collective unconscious* (and thus the objective world?). When you come into an insight that is true about "humanity" for lack of a better word, when it touches on the mental process of someone, be it themselves or others. Yes, Ni insights are "deeper" but rather rarer and less seen, thus by just being more different and general, going outside the concrete projections, so they are "deeper" into the unconscious, but that is accomplished by Intuition being more distanced from the projection.Things make sense and I don't feel like I have to clarify or correct anything, just condense it into crystal. You're on the right track with this mulling (;Needs to be a bot really, then it'd be real funny.Depends on your sense of self-importance.5?Welcome to Pretentious White Trash America!See, these few words are much better than the hardcoded Big5 definitions.iNtuition is general Percieving, that's about it. Details are lest to Sensing, since they are concrete, and a lot more contextually sensitive. General pattern observation is not.  

As for the attitude of the consciousness, I guess observing *projections* of patterns contrasts Ni to Ne better, as Ne looks at "*objective*" patterns that are directly observable in the real world, or whatever you read online, it's still as "objective" to the mind :P

/u/tk4442 do you have any experience with Ne users, particularly Ne-doms?mid-20s male nerdAka it's YOUR PERSONAL "tradition" (;&gt; tortured monster I feel that I am.

Well, that's because you are. An eternal childlike creature that stubbornly exists in a cold, apathetic world of horrible."I'm just a guy/gall. K?!"[Let's remedy this idea a bit.](https://i.imgur.com/IJXlDxK.png)

The contact point of the attitude of the conscious is what seems "reductionist", when it is just a a translation process of sorts because you can't really stuff objects or external info in your mind 1:1 as much as you'd like to, we're not Memory Devices. Think of it like:  
&gt; You don't speak what you think.  
&gt; You don't think what you speak.

Both happen to anyone, regardless of conscious attitude, but it's all the more proof that said transition point is narrow and can't process the masses of info of both plains sometimes.Pretty much this, it's really uncomfortable having to bullshit people while talking to their face.Damn I wish I was an SJ, try again :P&gt; (except for the insecure and misinformed maybe)

/threadWhy consider Thinking at all?And STJs since these social ideals are built by them to begin with. Being the lone subject against the world of chaos.IxTJs care a lot, but they use it as fuel for their pragmatism instead of just letting it be as it is.Needs knives, blood and a depressing black tint if I am to be sold on this :DMore actively nerdy, and appliantly nerdy than just closetly nerdy. Like, you don't care if that's how people see you instead of a wet blanket that's smarter than them for some reason.

But yeah, nerdiness has finally breached to mainstream consciousness of just being very invested in a certain subject, and it doesn't have to be that wild new PC network tech stuff.Ever seen Texhnolyze to inherit that username proudly? :DOr adolescence, take your pick.The way things click to Pi I believe would be much different than Ji. For Ti in particular it's like legos clicking into place.As you see, you are correct in your statements. Even your hyperbole for reinforcing them is softer than mine ;P

It's simply the nature of Judging, limiting information is *the point*. For Je it's a case by case basis, for Ji, it's never a complete framework. That is how they keep a sense of open mindedness to continue accepting info.A framework implies borders, info that falls outside of them, naturally isn't considered, it's an aspect of the filtering process. Reason cannot comprehend the vast swathes of info Percieving innately absorbs, due to said nature and need for comprehension.  ISTJ, in terms of writing style and content, you're an ISTJ without a doubt. Now if only online descriptions can catch up to acknowledging Sensors(SJs ESPCIALLY) for being amazing as they are. But there's no money in that and it's much more easier to fleece cash in selling a myth of yourself, rather than just noting what cognitive leanings you have, which is quite limited and endlessly ambiguous info.

I guess I should just point you to a more [credible source](https://www.typeinmind.com/) by my standards,Ok, at least use LII or ILI if we're going into the Socionics mess and not confuse OP even further than he already is with false info. I.e. look at you comment again.Si-Te or Te-Si, we need A LOT more info than that. Also, you should be able to work with this speculation.[Welcome to hyper categorized psychoanalysis!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics#The_16_types)

Basically Socionics uses the *dominant function for the last letter* if it uses the 4 letter characterization. MBTI uses the the *first extroverted function* in the stack for the lat letter. So as a consequence, Introverted types get their letters swapped:

MBTI | Socionics
----|---------
ENTP | ENTp
INTP | INTj
ENTJ | ENTj
INTJ | INTp
Because Si is seen as 80s tradition instead of modern tradition. "Tradition" being *built up habits* by the user, SJs strongly adhere to their *own* "traditions" they have made as a consequence of their life experienceGod you're laying it thick. You should know that I'm huge proponent of Si until proven Ni, and I have nothing much to off of OP suggesting Ni. I usually look at writing, and see INTJs as "defiant" of societal standards and calling out the bs for what it is(yes, anyone can do that, but it's very particular in their case). Or are "nutty" since I see Gammas as "nutty" from the Alpha quadrant perspective.

And yes, Ni is very much encouraged to be weakened because it would just be weird to people, until they accept it. Yet even then, the glimpses of it still should come through by being "sanitized" into the words, but still keeping the multi-layered meaning.I would gladly consider INTJ because we really don't have much of them here, and the ones I knew moved on and can't stand this place.

And I've also stayed up until 5:30 to see the sun rise too, good times xDThere's nothing else to go off than your writing style and content. I've come to rely on certain patterns I look to identify when I'm online typing. There are tells once you've dabbled enough.Sure thing bruh ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Read my comment, look at the wiki page if you have and try again.Whoopsies! Te-dom

Aka ESTJ is just as likely.Could be as easily applied to ESTJ as they can just as easily obsess over such stuff. I''m not against ENTJ in this case, but at the same time, there just isn't enough info to properly judge.&gt;  Or at least be a bit more open-minded about the possibility. Seems a bit non-ENFP to be so closed off to the possibility if you ask me

[Called uut!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFr74zI1LBM)&gt; The fact that he was in-between J/P

Except for the fact that ENTP is the most common ESTJ mistype. Cuz Sensors and dumb, SJs are evil, and ESTJs are the spawn of Satan himself!&gt; without knowing anything about **socionics**.

Where the hell did you dig up that? Socionics is its own section of psychoanalysis that is wholly separate from MBTI. It's still based from Jung's work, but was also developed with a different mindset and goal, and still is. However there is *heavy* categorizing that goes against the nature of psychological analysis, people are not as absolute than theoretical categorizations. It is neat to check it out, but not take it as seriously as it presents itself as.&gt; As well as a sex worker (dominatrix) And someone who works hard to advocate for better laws and protection for sex workers.

That would imply legality. But why would one not consider woman's oldest "job" since the dawn of humanity de facto legal anyways.&gt; My boyfriend is different in that he’s aggressive and callous.

Se-dom and Te-dom males may tend to express themselves as such, it is absolutely ans aspect of their character. Even as a Ne-aux I absolutely understand aggression and bloodlust first hand.

&gt; His hospital provides him with special white coats designating him as chief, but he doesn’t even wear his regular white coat. He also cares far less about his appearance than my ESTJ friend.

This does not have to be related to type at all. It's an adapted Si "tradition" that he's decided that it just isn't worth it. I can even argue an ENTJ is more likely to present their status, for all the shallow reasons: show of power and style, Gammas always have a sharp flair in their presence, wouldn't you say so /u/therealerijon3, and thus resulting in easier social navigation through dominant control. Another thing is that Gammas don't really consider bureaucracy anything more than an obstacle to be overcome towards their want. Deltas aren't much different in intent, but they are *far* more meticulous and less destructive because they understand the need and where it comes from, hence why when they circumvent it, it's more of a planned out loophole rather than a compromise.

&gt; While my ESTJ friend is impeccably groomed, he’s always wearing this old-ass t-shirts with holes and he really needs to do something about his nose hairs

And bam, a *Si habit one's physical comfort*. Again, he does not care about his own look and presentation on a base level, aka no Se to be found here. *This* is what Si looks like once you understand its true nature, not what Keirsey arbitrarily decided on in the 80s.Hardcore ESTJ stereotype/ideal

Unless we're talking about that campy version.Complete character assassination with your every little fault you've exhibited that has slighted them expressed in the most scathing manner to expose them for everyone to see. It is highly uncomfortable and uncontrollable for the INTP, despite still seemingly being physically reserved even during the ranting. The subsequent adrenaline and feelbad isn't pleasant either, but regrets won't be kept for long.Si observes "stored" information.Suppressed, paranoid Extroverted Gamma. I was thinking ENFP, but your last paragraphs sound ESTJ.

But I would *highly* recommend you attend to a college that is FAR from your family, like in another state entirely, it's obvious that they're a bad influence on your individual growth. Then you can completely forget this MBTI mumbo-jumbo that will not help you in any way to solve your mental health issues stemming from overprotective parenting and going through adolescence into the big scary world.  

Yes I'm assuming heavily and reading into something that could possibly be completely wrong.Fresh account, self-deprecating tone, rebellious tendencies, under 18, parent problems. OP has a lot more on their plate regarding their mental state than defining their type. But I'm glad someone else is reading beyond the stated "people pleaser" persona OP describes.I know this is late, but can we get some Sensing input on this? I also have this need to look crazy when taking a photo, I just love "crazieeee" charades in general.ESTJ woman?

Tests are shit, fresh accounts are for pussies. We are not therapists or psychics. We are(or at least I) armchair theorists, if you want us to apply our knowledge to type you, w/e that helps you with all the shitty misleading trivia info of commercial MBTI.&gt; Then depending on what it is (a bowl of candy vs **moving to a new state**) I'll decide one way or another which course is more appropriate.

This is literally language used to describe TJs. Also, you're obviously a ~~strong independent woman who need no man~~ practical -&gt; STJ. If that upsets you, good! You are another STJ we've alienated for life outside of MBTI bullshit!In OP it felt like your real self was being suppressed by the personas you've had to build up for yourself in your life. Eh, I guess I can attribute it to adolescence ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Also, you focus way too much on yourself to be a Fe type, your concern is not other people, who are cut from the same cloth as you. It is how you reflect off said people and the troubling implications those have back to you. That's in terms of reasoning.  
And as a basis of reasoning, you just rapid shooting examples instead of elaborating a laborious thought process. An Extrovert does not have to be social, at all, that's not what Extroversion is here, Extroversion means a natural tendency to focus on ~~our surrounding~~ outside world&gt; Do you tend to get a lot of inspiration for starting various new projects (you mentioned writing a book), but find the idea of doing it is more exciting to you and kinda lose the drive by the time you need to see it through?

Unrelated to the typing thread. Isn't this just a natural thing these days, with media being accessed at our fingertips vying for attention and that habit just bleeding into our own pet projects. How do you feel about that larger modern aspect?A really old Russian trolling campaign.F-doms naturally reason all the time. - ESFJ, ENFJ(fair minded), ISFP, INFP(goal oriented)  
P-doms reason much less in comparison, but their observational capacity is on a completely different level. - ESFP(stimuli), ENFP(potentiality), ISFJ(experience), INFJ(marination) Ni absorbs info and distills/marinates withing the subconscious. With time, this background process provides *potential* observations gained from said info marination. It is much more fluctuating compared to Si, since it breaks things down into their essence instead of projecting and keeping their form, hence it observes in a much more distanced scape that applies to generalities rather than concrete, real situations.Should've been called out as ISTJ instead and have massive denial about it.Male ISFP?Ti is kinda like Fi, except it has no reservations being detachedly psychopathic.Depends on your case of Social Engineering. Anyone can do it, but Alphas would have the natural knack for it as macro oriented fair-minded people, then followed by Betas, then Deltas, and finally Gammas to where the entire social engineering process is merely to serve their own means.Same type interactions are often very agreeable, but also easily exhausted because of that.And that's why STJs define and reinforce common sense in the social consciousness, even without collectivism.Why not have all the colors for all the types. I bet some ESTPs would love to rock some pink around here.Ti wants to know, Te wants to benefit.You're kind of missing the leading types in that group: ESTJ, ENTJ, ISTJ. Deluded, these types are kind of horrifying.That's the story of most white hats...&gt;don't value them

Rather, a Thinking user doesn't see the inherent value of their own emotions, assigning value and giving any amount of shit = value. It's just borrowed under the rationalizations of accomplishing or describing it in a more factually correct sense. "I want that!" isn't a sufficient argument, a more factual, practical reason needs to be provided rather than sentiment or appeal. T-aux can be fine with the appeal alone, but struggle to completely explain it. T-doms are almost disconnected from the appeal, but are still unknowingly drawn to it, Feeling being a deeply burrowed, yet unquestionable influence.  

&gt; Thinking is a Judging function used to judge entities, including emotions

Yes, but emotions can't really be judged in terms of absolute correctness. There is right, and there is wrong, but there are often times when you see the correct thing as morally wrong, so which one is it? Emotion, values are too malleable to be put under the scrutiny of facts, they can be flipped upside down depending on the situation. For Ti and Fi, there is always a consistency to the subjective model, yet the extreme ends of content they tackle couldn't be any more different. Feeling juggles values and sentiments acquired through experience, what they know to be right and wrong for themselves. Thinking juggles facts and concrete models, seeding out the correct from the incorrect, void of sentiment or assigned value, those expressions are linked to the person's Feeling, which is often suppressed. 

Feelers are stubborn about their desires, but if they are punished for them, they know better how to apply them. Thinkers are still stubborn through their emotion, what's worse is when they've already been validated by factual information. The anchoring rock Feelers may appreciate from Thinkers becomes truly immovable in such situations.

tl;dr Different schools of reasoning: correctness vs rightness. Inherent to everyone in different forms.Everyone's an emotionally repressed and conditioned soldier. I love the characters to bits, but I simply don't have enough info to type them confidently.  
Also Taro liking to split shit into different mediums with different direction on top of frantic tonal shifts doesn't help either.Yes, it's called tunnel vision.Si is Percieving, it can be extremely conformist or wildly idiosyncratic at a push of a button. Such concepts are just that concepts, the function is meant to explain your personal projection of such information.Well, first, let's give it to the Judging functions, since they give reason and meaning. Perceiving is just observation and it's conflict is much harder to develop when both parties are open minded.

So with Feeling and Thinking left. I think Fe would be on the least likely to clash with itself, as both are very likely to learn quickly it's perfectly fine to agree to disagree on their own methods of reading the situation. Then I would rank Ti, even if it's a stubborn bitch to deal with, but both parties can also see the value of agreeing to disagree, it would take them much longer to realize that, but even so, they can understand holding different internal understandings.

Fi is similar in that respect, but the zeal is entirely different, righteousness is involved and things get *really heated*, the sport example you give just adds fuel to the fire because of how fanaticism is highly encouraged in such a setting. Now imagine low Fi-users aka Te-doms. Now imagine them having different directions in their pragmatism. Objective facts which Te reasons around all the time are hard to argue against, but when going in a different direction, imagine the magnitude of the clash and the potential bad blood that can be developed from it. Funnily ESTJs are likely to break it earlier off than ENTJs tunneling on their own ideas, as a Gamma you should be familiar with that brand of single mindedness.

This is the theoretical breakdown, feel free to apply it lightly in some situations and see if it holds up under scrutiny. But as you give an example, context can turn these claims on their heads. Fe-doms can argue for days how to plan a wedding, while ENTJs can just drink together after pummeling each other after the game.Own it anyway! This is hilariously accurate!He's damaged goods unfortunately. So long as he doesn't go fanatical messiah, and his instincts have prevented him from that path already, he'll be fine.The *what* can be debated throughout the process of communication, but establishing the mood for such a thing to happen in the first place is the immediate priority.Learn from her to socialize better and be comfortable with small talk. Once you become involved in the group, she won't be death staring you as much.

Think of it less of " How do I get you to like me when all of your other friends around." and more of "How can I fit more naturally in any social setting and not be as awkward."ENTP salesman.When I say Gammas are crazy, I mean it. If people think ENTJs are intimidating, then they haven't seen an ESFP on a war path.ISTPs master for perfection. ISFPs master for expression.Uhm.... can we get a Socionics chart, that sort of makes sense. It may be stupidly codified, but for data representation, it makes actual sense.Te, Se, Si-Te, Ti-Se

Those are the most natural, the rest is developed outside the cognitive leanings.Consider ESFP too. Se quite forceful, Fe is more technical.SCHWING!If you want to be treated with passive-aggressive behavior, yes.+1 on ESTP, none of your ESFP points have a particular Fi flavor or apttern to them. Infact it's mostly Se with a tinge of Feeling in there, but nothing suggesting Fi over Fe.  
Stoic ESFPs have a certain ruthlessness to them, and usually suppress their recklessness(as percieved by Si-Ne types btw).

I don't really see anything ESFP about you. Do you have an example that seems particularly ESFP on your part, I should be able to break it down with the theory in a rational manner.It's kinda funny, I can type my Dad no problem. But since he's the man of the house and naturally Mom is suppressed, I can't really pick up enough tells per se. A wife and a mom has to be those things first for the sake of a family and a relationship and family.Thank you! It's just what I observe with my mom, it's just her case ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Tone down your energy, I don't mean suppress it, but just try to find a tone that doesn't look confrontational to others. This seems to be a common social problem for N-dom Thinkers. You are merely spitballing possible judgements that are incomplete opinions at best, merely formed on the spot and don't have to represent anything, pushing to see what they could manifest in.  
That's simply rare to observe and experience for many, and misunderstand it as a judgement, when it's meant as and observation process. Even recently, I've taken more of a leap to shit up and listen, I still judge everything, but I also like having more info available from the informing party before I speak.Like anything, it's case by case basis. Person to person, you can try to tell them this, provide an analogy, or even better, a situation where you are merely spit balling about a serious topic so they can grasp the perspective of perspective seeking, not perspective projection that is *much* more common and culture defining - Si-Je.  

As for a group of people, it's best to present it as something absurdest, joke like, a mangled version of reality that represents the human spirit, but outside the comforting, defined world everyone lives in. Larger group settings are more lighthearted, so you play towards that. And also it provides more potentiality, it's down to the involved parties if they are alright with prodding or not. And just be mindful that not everyone can keep up, it's fine to slow down every once in a while and dive deeper into a topic, that is where true potentiality unfolds.I think you'll get a more interesting answer from a Chinese/Indian person who was raised in a more old fashioned way.Eh, it's mostly conditioning on my own accord at elementary school and after. Because I studied on the 3rd floor of the furthest wing from the entrance.In a sense yes, but Si merely provides the fuel for Ti to determine said rigid behavior.STs will be on the top, most NTs will bank on gimmick strategies. Fs are outliers and even more of a case by case basis.And I'mma Be Angry for you!Everybody follows their own laws. However Ti users make their own laws for themselves that do not involve others . TJs on the other hand do, so their laws have to be practical and much more widely applicable instead of the highly specific application of a Ti principle.  
Does that exempt Ti users from being pathological lying assholes? Not in the least, infact, they have a natural knack for it. But that is still the Democratic judgement of working within the system instead of the Aristocratic directing the system to your favor.You observe potentiality, instead of observing what just is.Si - subconscious linked to personal experience rather than potentiality derived from the world.Applying Thinking just comes with experience. For Ti the priority is the navigation of the subjective rather than managing the facts in front of you.  

I used to work in a courier firm as an evening office drone, turned out I ended being the only one there and when others came, I had to assume a managerial role, having to comply with orders while also making decisions for the workflow of my colleagues. So I had to make decisions on the spot, learning that it's more important to just go ahead with one rather than developing it.IxTx

He's obviously limiting his expression. Sounds young and doesn't want to show his negative characteristics in general or just to you. If I had to gamble: ISTJ, but even INTJ is possible with such barebones indo.&gt; Dropped his engineering carrer to become a freelancer.

TPs are slightly more compliant than this. But, I've never discounted that option. Just that a Te-user seems likely, but a Ti-dom is definitely for consideration.I concur, it's a neat resource for describing personality given a navigation framework. But it was never meant as a concrete, set in stone determination of a person's psyche or immediate mood.Rather, humanity would stagnate as it will never move without a want.Because Gammas are crazy and intimidating.Not something special, just *something* that answers to an inner desire.http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/quadras/100% ESTJ  

Concrete, structured judgements. These aren't even observations, these are conclusions, there's no ambiguity to them, or stimulus associated. Extroverted Thinker with these expressions would be a Te-dom. And ENTJs also tend to feels out of place or too riled up in the current flow of things, they have less anchorage in comparison.Aka the usual ~~and highly common~~ ESTJ mistype, because "I can't be a ~~dumb~~ Sensor!"I'm not typing you, so you're safe from my stubborn judgement :PThe "trend" is merely a tool to bend to my **will**! Mwahahahaha!I prefer: 

Alphas = Water  
Betas = Fire  
Gammas = Air  
Delats = Earth

Yes my dear NFPs, you are Earthly! Earthly in the sense that you acknowledge your existance on this Earth, but you want to make damn sure your own little Corner of the world represents *you*!I'm starting to think they're the common mistype of the ESFJs.Memes! The Soul of the DNA!Frankly it's more accurate than half the posts here.ESFPs are supposed to drive me crazy. Yet, I've had one as a roommate for 5 years...I don't really type people much. I've only known one for sure, but he was pretty set on direction in his life. On top of a distant relationship, he had a bro attitude, but is pretty matter of fact, a genuine nerd, and probably thinks highly of himself, but also has the determination and intelligence to back it up.Judger as in you always look for everything to make sense, to be reasoned out in a neat sequence. Or do you feel like you want to take a step back and let it mull for a while to get a grasp of the elements at play.The succinct ESTJ answer. I can't really infer much from your posts either to type you, writing is all I have to gauge you.  

The entire dichotomy is that ISTJs Pecieve, they oberve and are subconsciously aware of their life situation, they are intimately in tune with it.  
While for the ESTJs that's a helpful tool to get to a desired state. They Judge first and foremost, they lead with reason and structure, moreso, they act on it as well.Then why do I, as an intuitive, want to shoot my brains out after reading this...It's actually quite simple. N/S in 16p is just re-labled Big 5 Openness to experience. And *of course* the current generation of 20-somethings and younger are is Open to experience, that is our state of being. On top of that, we're in the information era, access to the world is literally in our back pocket! It's part of our daily routine.I think people should not type fictional characters willy nilly, Especially when what we see them exhibit is very limited human cognition, because they are a 3rd hand interpretation of someone's mind. And that doubles in action series, in log running dramas, where you get to see miltiple facets of human action and emotion in a grounded setting, without having as many metonims in power systems/spectacle, then we can start talking personality types.

Satou from Welcome to the NHK is unquestionably ISFP, and I'm still not sure if Misaki is ISFJ or not.I suggest removing the SJ flairs entirely. To balance that, I'd also like the NJ flairs to go as well &gt;:-)They're both intuition, they don't perceive details, they water them down in generalized Perceptions.Sounds like a stereotypical ESTJ, to the point that I find it suspicious. Aside from being a girl, you don't seem to be noting much idiosyncratic traits of hers, which is actually normal for 3rd person typing.
ENTJs push their current actions as far as possible in the moment. It's only when they get a brake and a breather can they percieve a vague direction and where their force of will is directed at. ESTJs are just as unconsciously aware of these aspects, but in a much more grounded, less spiritually philosophical manner, it's more about the potentiality of the application rather than the potentiality of the spirit. That may seem like they're dumber, but no, that makes them a lot more reliable, they trade the Gamma expedience for long-term Delta stability.  
And ENTJ, like an ESFP fleets through their willforce, it is through their accomplishments that were mere obstacles in their moment they are recognized. While ESTJs and ENFPs are more likely to chase a primordial image, the "I have a dream!" kind of life goals, which are a lot more defined and concrete in their unconscious, rather than a mish-mash of different symbology and implication in a melting pot.
First 2 I agree with Se-doms.

Elena: I'm thinking ESFJ that's in a more tense environment. But she's really raised on attention and I don't have a firm grasp on that type.

Christian: Something tells me INFJ and I trust it. Low physical presence, and agreeableness borne of his own mind, meaning he might be Percieving such from the unconscious. Valuing interaction. Keep an eye on him and see if he seems spaced out when left alone.Another thing is that Elena seems more ESTJ, but the dissonance is the attention seeking she's raised in, when it's obvious that her subconscious interest lies elsewhere. Something has made her ego run on attention recieved, which develops bipolar tendencies if she is kept a raised in such an environment.  

To touch on Ni: not knowing if you will complete a project, not because you can't or are just lazy and easily distractable, but rather you don't know its concrete form to materialize it, to where it feels "right"./&gt;Si  
/&gt;Te   
/&gt;Fi  
/&gt;introvert  
/&gt;specific primordial image  
/&gt;typed correctly as a kid  

The hell am I supposed to type here, you've typed yourself correctly. In the Jungian model no less and you're not even aware of it. You are aware of being a monster, but you hinder yourself. Take that anger, use it to call out bullshit for what it is, take it to the gym, become that tyrannical megalomaniac you dream of being, but *apply it to yourself*! By that I mean if you are still a hedonistic slave to your own impulses what gives you the right to control others?! Straighten the fuck up and get yourself together step by step, clean your damn room for starters! Take care of yourself first and do what you tell yourself needs doing!  

You'll see that you'll be taking on responsibility and in turn that will give your life meaning!She's heavily traumatized and her distanced demeanor doesn't help in peering into her mindset. Also, not really much screentime for her either, another common problem with fictional characters.  

I never really typed her because her dramatic role take precedence, something that's quite consistent in NieR:ABecause we assume everyone is as a sharply smart and observant as us to notice every little personality fault and potential inaccuracy we have.Sensing and Thinking I see as masculine functions, while Intuition and Feeling are feminine. So with that, STs are more masculine, NFs are more feminine.But wouldn't rational STs make more sense, since it is a masculine trait to bring order(for security), and it is a feminine trait to bring chaos(due to reproduction). 

So... ISTP and ESTJ, and that makes INFJ and ENFP the most irrationally feminine. 

/u/tk4442 here's an interesting concept to mull on^And that's why you do NOT mess with ESFPs, or Gammas in general, the price they pay for that is endless inner malleability. They may be able to make things ordered in seconds, but they are chaotic nutjobs on the inside.What if they were inherent in their nature, socially *nurtured* and not exclusive to either gender, but are subconsciously associated as a trait of said gender.Peterson uses Big 5 instead of MBTI. He looks to Jung for his readings of the unconscious, a more broad take on psychoanalysis instead of his ambiguous categorization, because it is, frankly, quite unwieldy.Well, my suggested types are the most top heavy function stack in both directions. Also, Big 5 Extroversion is more associated with social extroversion.  
While the Attitude of the Unconscious as per Jung is about cognition that focuses on the objective, wordy plane or the subjective, mental plane. In that sense of Extroversion, Gammas are the most masculine and Alphas are the most feminine in terms of how they present themselves to the world and handle it. As for assertiveness, I'm betting on Sensing/Thinking functions having some predisposition towards that as well.

But, while juggling categorizations left and right. We see the ESTP as the fratboy jock, the ESFP as the party girl nympho, while ESTJ is the industrious man, and the ESFJ as the mother of the hearth. Like, when it comes to association with the most extreme stereotypical expressions, the primality of Se is seen as immature(because it is in a socioevolutionary context), yet the rationality of Extroverted Judging is seen as the societal structure.Textbook young, hedonistic, nihilistic ISTJ.Well duh, tests are bullshit to begin with.Negative potentiality is horrowingly infinite, but instead of running away from it in a panic, face it forward in order to prevent it. Keep looking in that abyss as you fight against it, running away only casts its shadow further than it was.So you see it as a cognitive mediator.The last Gridman episode was [NUT AF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495729039672213506/508411889655742475/image0.jpg)!  But I stick to my regular doujins, it's the small impulsive pleasures I have. Now to compensate it with actual studying!Don't underestimate my bullshit rationalization skills!Gammas are deranged from my view and I wouldn't have it any other way!God you're such a Beta...

16P isn't MBTI in the least. But it makes for a neat Big 5 stand-in. I bet they've skewed some of these "percentages" due to the fact young people are the majority that use the site.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits

&gt; Extraversion - E/I  
&gt; Openness to experience - S/N  
&gt; Agreeableness - F/T  
&gt; Conscientiousness - P/J  
&gt; Neuroticism - Assertive/Turbulent

It's hardly as romantic or enjoyable as MBTI is presented these days. But the brute force of the the Big 5 psychometrics are more concrete and scaleable as well.It's a statistic, meaning the middle is the average. You can work on Conscientiousness and it will naturally increase with age, so long as you take on life by its horns, regardless of your MBTI type.

Concrete enough for you?Big 5 is psychometrics, MBTI is based on psychoanalysis. Actually 16 personalities is pretty much Big 5 relabeled as MBTI because that provides neat , ambiguous archetypes you can Forer effect to anyone.Psychoanalysis, Jungian psychoanalysis is predicated on myth and legend, looking into narrative and storytelling as guiding lines to a person's belief. Think the Polytheistic religions from Sumeria, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Hellenistic regionds, Nordic coast, once you break them all down you will see that in terms of symbolism of meaning they are quite similar, and Jung saw that, and kept going deeper and deeper with the representations of mental concepts. Symbols are merely a compass for the mind to orient itself like it orients in the material world. It defines things in terms of *meaning*, like a glass is something you drink from, not a transparent cylinder without a top and with a bottom. You define things by how you interact with them, and you define behavior to how you interact with people, people who have stories and myths, legends and tales call forth the potential traits of human beings which can only be neurally "awakened" under the contextual duress. 

Psychometrics is not romantic like that, Big 5 has identified 5 inherent traits, cross-gender, cross-culturally. From there they survey through questions that assign to one of the negative/positive aspects of that trait and use statistics to clump it into results. It's brute force math with the anchor being the defined traits that have been agreed to be stable from person to person from psychoanalytic theory.Every single one of these is valid and have to be used accordingly to the context they are made for. It's just that Big 5 has the brute force data to back up its claims unlike the psychoanalytic approaches which can be written off as "metaphysical mumbo-jumbo" by people who just can't be bothered to comprehend that their story is not far from myth and religion.No, I mean that they can sell an ideal to you much easier than actual data and what it implies for you.&gt; Some of it explains fundamental topics in a way that can't even be addressed by science.

And you pretty much answered your own question. We, as conscious creatures think of things, material objects as to what functional use we use them for, because have highly dexterous upper limbs. And how do we evaluate other conscious creatures? Because their function is immensely multi-faceted that it's hardly a single use, we orient ourselves in accordance to them by *meaning*. And universal meaning across social circles is conveyed by *story* that holds even greater, more elaborate but ever more encompassing meaning to all. And then myth and religion manage to encompass meaning that is so far reaching that it defines the story of each person, to guide them towards their own personal meaning of life.

Science can't account for that, it is merely a description of things that don't change in the material sense. But just because a newspaper is made from a certain combination of processed wood made into a thin, white, light layer and inked on doesn't mean I can only read said ink.It's conscience. You don't tell a lie to avoid a hell that will only develop for the worst over time.Hitler wasn't that bad of a person himself. If you want to be God, you'll have better luck being Napoleon or Stalin.Just to clarify, are you a woman?A rare breed of the naturally Agreeable male. Yeah, focus on communications rather than abstractions. Even in your post you're talking more about people rather than the cause of your own incapabilities. Harness your strengths, don't direct them to where they can't help you.Aand now you're talking scientifically. Dammit, just decide and commit. You're not as good, figure out why and work, work hard like your life depends it, because it does. Do you want to dive deep into abstractive bullshit, statistics and made up terms just so you can engineer properly, or do you naturally tend to pay attention to people, their speech, their mood, their pose etc.Work with people and learn how to sum up their points accurately. You have a very good grasp of scientific language and easily integrate engineering lingo in your vocabulary. So even if you're not the best at abstracting, be the best at communicating in the abstract sphere.YOU ARE THE REASON I HAVE MOMMY ISSUES! FUCK YOU MOM! I WILL PLAY MUH VIDYA GAEMS AT 45![HIT ME!

Practically the same thing, but one just sounds better in American context, doesn't it.Sure, there are assholes, but they make things *work*. Otherwise, they won't be able to cope with themselves.Again, visionary is far more exciting for the clueless, rather than practical engineering for the competent. What are your bets on what's more appealing in entrepreneurial context?Introverts are indeed more prone to negative emotion.In a sense yes, socialization helps in numbing that tendency.You're missing the Soul. But that's all right, you can be an atheist.I swear that has to be the actor of Connor.If you do not have exposure to your more primitive thoughts from a clown or reading a myth, then you are in danger of acting them out, especially within a mob, where your inhibitions as an individual are significantly lowered.

Rather brilliant insight if I may say so.Here's [straight exposure](https://youtu.be/5i2qquegdB4?t=867), enjoy!High Disagreeableness and Conscientiousness have been registered regularly in people who are considered "successful".  

Agreeableness and Conscientiousness seem to increase with age, signifying wisdom of experience and willingness to share it for another's benefit.

Extremely High Disagreeableness seems to correlate with imprisonment, doubly so with extremely Low Conscientiousness, making the combo of a behavioral pattern that is often described as "psychopathic".  

There's a even a study that juxtaposes the average stat of each year with each trait by using the written word as an associative indicator within said year.

And what's more Big 5 applies cross culturally without fail. It's unromantic, but its brute force is not something you want to compete with. Heck, why do you think 16personalities has that 5th indicator?Rather, they want to play around the rules so their precious order isn't disturbed.  

But generally, extreme Thinkers go to jail as a rule.It does, because Thinker emotions tend to be more predatory, so if Feelers truly did want our emoshuns, they'd be hiding under their bed 24/7 because of how horrifying Thinker emotions are.Anger, rage, aim. When malice forms it is absolutely vicious and ruthless, a Feeler is just as susceptible, but the passive-aggressive smearing just doesn't compare to physical violence or calculated murder/dismantling.  

This is why niceties don't earn respect, but rather merit and perseverance. If you are able to take on harsh truths and confront them head on, that commands far more authority than harmonious action.It is in the extremes where you find the naked truth, and it gets pretty hard to deny behavior. Malice is awful, period, doesn't matter if its Feeler or Thinker.Look, there are plenty of Feeler villains in soap operas, and they tend to drag out things in a torturous manner rather than being swift in their judgement.  

I personally prefer Thinker villains exactly because they are honest about their intentions rather than masking themselves behind social courtesy and expectations they manipulate. Visionary villains don't care whether their goals align or not, they just DO them.I gave it to a few people, since it's translated. The percentages are extremely helpful and telling to me. But it's not MBTI.For its lacking depth, Big5 still provides very useful **concrete** information. It may be unromantic, but it is absolutely useful, and one of the few solid measuring tools in the psychology field.It's reliable for sure, I asked people a few questions after test and describing the traits and what they mean. It's just Big 5.  

I have long abandoned MBTI, let alone look for tests.Look, it's a [bit like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiYuy6Kg9aI)Jesus Christ! 1 paragraph and my mind is fucked!  
At least it's intelligible to me now, but motherfucker, it doesn't make it any easier to discern his words.No, he means that if one makes the conscious decision to alienate themselves from all culture, folk tales and narratives. They will have to devise their own, which will be inherently incomplete and thus harmful their spirit and psyche as they have no well to drink from, hence the "uprooted" metaphor, that is not a functional Tree of Life.

And yes, this describes exactly why Jung and Freud stopped collaborating. Freud wanted to keep going down his own narrative, thinking it was his alone, which it partly was, he is the progenitor of psychoanalysis. Jung just noticed that there are immense giants beneath that which are far more powerful than rational comprehension, and thus he kept diving deeper and deeper into metaphysics.If you want to keep your sanity outside metaphysics, absolutely! I'm just too deep to the point where I can't climb up anymore, the Abyss just stays with you regardless.&gt;  to alienate themselves from **all** culture, folk tales and narratives

We're talking on an even more severe level of disconnect. By 19, you had a modicum of a cultural setting that is imprinted in your spirit, so you can function socially with the rest who share said cultural setting. This is foundation, and living abroad, you built upon said foundation layered on with another culture that shares core human concepts as well as its own unique ones. I'm not saying it's good or bad, I'm saying it's there.

Like, throwing out every single moment of your parents, including those where you were a child and making up something else as an alternate explanation, rationalization to differentiate as much as possible. And yes, it is as mental as it sounds, but that's what any pathological liar and/or ideologically possessed *has* to do if they wish to live with their conscience: create a false narrative of themselves.It's just as much of a complicated process. But essentially, if you don't expose yourself to something, you will not adapt to anything. The mammalian brain and nervous system have dormant circuits which only activate under extreme duress.  
And this is also propagated by the conscious in a very simple manner: exploration, the drive to *know*. This exploration process expands your conscious, which is just the spiritual and psychic level of the neurophysiological adaptation.  

This is also why kids are actually pretty lithe and tough in their small bodies, and also why their scratches heal fast, because the exploration aka the expansion of the conscious is *how they develop cognitively at an exponential rate*. And no, the conscious *does not stop until death* either. The brain may stop physiologically developing at 25, but that has never stopped anyone from learning something new. If you don't, you literally atrophy in stillness, aka another set of factors that invite pathological delusion and mania.

Initially I thought you were asking what happens to people who do uproot themselves from culture, I [remembered the case of Parmenides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jZMkvHCZRc).Humans are social creatures, and thus, you *need* a community. The moment you're a part of it, you have an "us" reference for simplicity's sake, the brain doesn't go "oh, it's this individual person with all his complexities" it goes to "group of people I associate with".  

And the moment you have an "us", naturally, you have a "them". From there on it's down to your values whether loyalty is a priority of yours. If you were not raised in a close-knit community, it's natural that you don't.The bigger the "community", the less you associate with people, and the more you offload that burden to an idea that is shared between all. This is at the heart of the "us vs them" pathology, because you don't hate people directly, like "no one would hurt a fly".  

However, if an idea isn't shared or worse, rejected, then you have grounds for hostility.Become the collective!Eh, a lot of the times, I see it introverts arguing that they can be and are social. Extroverts don't refine their thoughts in that manner as often, as they prefer discussing and hashing it out in the appropriate context.

Besides, cognitive introversion/extroversion isn't even social, it's more primal than that. However, as fundamentally social animals, *that* is how we express and most often gauge it by.And that's exactly my point: you're defining a term dependent on context. And that doesn't exclude even how we define cognitive attitudes, it's for categorization purposes in order to make sense of patterns in a linguistical manner that we can communicate to others.

Without external data, an introverted function has nothing to process, without an internal motivation, the external function has nothing to observe. That is my point about balance of human processes, "ambiversion" used by introverts to break off the stereotype is exactly that expression of balance, using extroversion while still keeping the comfort of introverted processing. And as mentioned, humans are social animals, without any kind of social expression, which is always extroverted cognitively, we suffer on a physiological level.It's just the Karen aspect, it's not tied to types.[ALRIGHTY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wX2xBOuzRg)Nah, more like the anime jpeg you gamble for.

I am very much an INFP. When I first read my type description I was kind of freaked out and wondered (half-jokingly) if someone had been stalking me.  I fit snugly into the INFP stereotype. This is unfortunate in some ways, but I hope to one day break out of the mold a bit.Yeah, that's true! My post may not have stated it, but there are many things I do like about myself, such as imagination and empathy. INFPs have many strengths, as well as weaknesses. That's just part of being human. I'd say the unfortunate refers more to the "over-emotional" trait that seems to be one of the, if not THE biggest stereotype that plagues the INFP. It evokes a bit of irritation from many people (especially on the internet!). Though, I suppose you could just interpret it as being invested in everything in life? Haha. In the end though, I am very happy with my type. Be it INFP, ENFJ, or anything else, everyone has a important role to play. No type is inferior or superior to any other type. I'd say it is just easier to see my own weaknesses instead of others' since I have to live with my own problems every day! :)My mother and sister have ADHD. ISFJ and INTJ respectively.Mother: ISFJ

ENFJs and ENTJs are stereotypically perfectly fit for achieving what the society considers social and professional success respectively. I guess you just have to remember what MBTI is about.Hi!Nah, it's how communities work. People will want to feel superior when given the easy opportunity because an online test told them they're special snowflakes. 

Even if that's not supposed to be how MBTI works, but it's sadly how it *appears on the surface*. They're your usual "alternative" people (of all kinds and ages) who've stumbled upon a buzzfeed-grade MBTI descriptions or test page and picked/answered INFJ because it often sounds the edgiest, or most independent, or most unique (but not weird/awkward like that INFP description on the same site their found), or /r/iamverysmart, or the coolest according to deviantart's definition of cool.Stuff covered in snow. Which is interesting, because stuff soaked in water has *quite* the opposite effect on me.INFP and yeah, just use bookmarks.
Well from my experience... It takes a lot of time and effort. I only fully trust two of my best friends (INFJ and ISFP) and I have known them for 10 years (I'm 20 btw).

fuck the maker of this quiz for making it binary sexes only too.

Infp- " wow the world is so vast and there is so much going on!"

Estj- " you are sooooo spacy..." Oh I just posted something like this related to Katie ledecky! Anyone have an idea of her type ? Here is a video of an interview.. 

https://youtu.be/WQWvxmgjupU

Maybe istp! She has that istp chill I think... Haaa so much Fe!!! If I was an addition to this group I would be in heaven ! (Infp here )Infp who had an estj roomate

It worked out well and I'm glad I had her as a roommate. However I sometimes felt bad asserting myself for things...like if I wanted to go to bed early and she wanted to talk... Or if she was playing loud music and I found it annoying, I didn't want to tell her to stop cause well she was having a good time and relieving off stress. 

I liked how she wanted her own space and liked being anti social at times... Cause thats what I wanted too lol 

I also didn't mind that she asserted how to take care of things in the apartment, cause that is not my specialty... I will gladly do things just don't ask me how to plan to do it ! We worked well in that way 
Current type: infp 

Extraverted type: entj/enfj

Introverted type : Intj

Really love that Ni and I would get stuff done.. 

I have SO many friends that are ESFPs. You guys make me feel so comfortable and never awkward. It helps you usually like talking haha cause it's stimulating for me and in a way you also take care of me (that goes for if we have similar values and stuff).

This may come to no surprised but i've noticed that ESFPs are very into facial expressions, and like other extraverts they like to be engaging. So maybe you expect the same in othe people and get discouraged when you don't get that response. I've noticed that introverts are less concerned with how they appear to others and more in their own heads with their thoughts and feelings (not all the time but a lot of the time). i can speak for myself that sometimes i make weird faces lol (i'm an infp)... and i can't help it sometimes... i try to though! i've gotten better at it... but yea it may be that the introverts you are speaking about are just in their heads and their interaction doesn't have anything to do with you... and yea maybe they do hate life so be friendly and nicee and maybe their mood will change !

As with the ENTP... i would have a totally diff reaction with an ENTP then you would have but yea you guys are very different so it makes sense. 

ESTP's really intimidate me... i feel like i'm so slow compared to them, and that they always think i'm dumb... which is silly... but it takes a lot of mental effort to keep up with them... I kind of feel simmilar to what you're saying about being shut down by them... 

conclusion: i really don't find you guys intimidating usually! unless you are very stuck up and snobbish... but i think that could be with any typeI thought infps mirror others and infjs absorb others...I distinguish it that mirroring is mimicking or reflecting the others emotions, but there is a separation of your own emotions and theirs. It is distinguishable. With absorbing though, it becomes internal and it can be difficult to distinguish between your own emotions and others.Yeah I was wondering... Lol
I was in the nice innocent/musical kids group I'm very into mbti and my husband said to explain it better to him I should make a powerpoint or something lol. I found some things online... but does anyone have a good reference to explain how the system works, especially the cognitive functions? 

Thanks!

PS he's an INTP :)That's true for me at least lol. If someone is geniune, even if they are flawed (which everyone is) it's very hard to hate them... But if you are trying to impress me and are super fake it just really bothers me and makes me not want to be around you.Isn't this more related to enneagram than mbti ? Though they do overlap often...
INFP, Hufflepuff, Wampus.

I'm not 100% sure on Wampus yet, I need to learn more about the house. But if Wampus means 'passionate warrior that fights for what they believe in', then I'm in.I'm INFP btw.

I was quiet around strangers and in school, and was very soft spoken. I was painfully shy. Once I started school I was diagnosed with ADD because I never paid attention, and I was always doodling and drawing pictures for the teacher. I also made little 'gifts' of junk tied together like mulch, rocks, leaves, and other stuff. So I guess I was kinda sweet.

At one point when I was a little older I got a kick out of drawing 'torture' scenarios, like people in cages over sharks or lava. I laughed like a maniac when I showed these to people. I guess I was a little weird too.

I was obsessed with Pokemon, ATLA, and Pirates Of The Caribbean, Spider-Man, and a lot of other media over the years.
I also played a lot of video games with my brother and the neighborhood kids. We also made up sorta RPG live action games all the time, and had blankets as capes and brooms as swords.

I'm sure I came of as a little annoying and weird to some people I was more open around.

I wasn't really too athletic or good at any sports.any type can do cool things 🍍

S types are plenty creative.

F types use logic.

Your only as useful as you let yourself be.I'm INFP

I was very quiet and shy and would always opt to work alone in classes without friends. 

But the few times I ended up with a close friend in class, were great. We were the giggly girls in the back that drew pictures and passed notes. But we weren't terrible in class, we knew when to stop.

I zoned out a lot (daydreaming) and had problems paying attention. Up until the last 2 years of HS, and all the way up from 1st grade, I had small groups. Small groups just took the kids out during tests and left to study sometimes, it was also like another study hall.

basically a weird and witch-like dark romantic castle/cottage with a lot of ghibli inspiration and maybe a little Gothic Victorian too?



It is a 15 minute drive out of a cute and busy-ish coastal town and port with nice little flower shops, bakeries, and a whole lot of historical stops and old cool looking buildings. The town is like a cove, surrounded by mountains and forest. The drive is like the one from Spirited Away, and my house would be where the clock tower was. Foggy days are common.



-many secret rooms and passages (I can move around like the phantom from The Phantom Of The Opera)

-a lot of different types of stained glass windows

-many bay windows and little places to sit

-cluttered with old paintings/curtains/books/posters/string lights?/prayer flags?/stuff

-one sort of sunroom with a stained glass dome top

-heavy amounts of detail on everything (like wooden carved tables/chairs/fireplace mantle)

-many different sized windows in odd locations

-exposed brick and stone is common for the walls and floors

-also old looking dark wood floors are common throughtout

-I'd have a few actual size fake skeletons sitting in chairs or in poses with clothes on in a random locations

-I'd have a lot of different styles of Persian rugs hanging on the walls and laying on the floors

-the lighting is always low and candles are used often, but there are rays of light comming in 
through the windows

-mostly an overgrown yard with many trees and a large garden with a lot of different types of 
vegetables

-large victorian looking glass overgrown greenhouse in the back yard

-different colorful flower bouquets and plants hanging from the ceiling and just all over the place

-hidden natural hot springs in the back yard surronded by trees and overgrown plants

-at least 4 dogs running around and a few cats

-there could be legends that the place is haunted or that the owners are vampires hehe

-there are a lot of old crooked looking trees and willow trees all over the place

-red rose bushes in the garden

-there is a mossy pond with lily pads/frogs/fish and an old fountain

-rainy weather and fog is common 

-I hang out/hide out in the old attic that has an amazing view of the mountains/forest, and I can see the foggy sea from there

-the chimney runs often

-an open fire pit in one of the rooms

-there is at least one 'wizard tower' type of connected pillar to the house, which is were I have a lot of star maps and telescopes (so my astronomy tower), and there is very limited light pollution there some how, haha. 

-old grand piano, or maybe even an organ?



Kitchen: many types of spices out and hanging to dry, faded black and white tiled floor, large wood stove and a pizza oven (like from Howl's Moving Castle, with cauldron), cast iron pots and pans hanging up, old tea kettles/plates/cups on display.



It's messy but germ free. Common colors are all dark and rich. I guess the vibe is kinda spooky and dark but interesting and awe-inspiring to outsiders.



Here is a few imgur pages I made (I had to make multiple since I had too many pictures to upload at once): http://imgur.com/a/CN1yR - http://imgur.com/a/RMC98 - http://imgur.com/a/E65PX
and yes I know there are a lot of conflicted styles and types of houses here, but just try and imagine a mash up. My dream house could be castle sized or cottage sized, haha.



I'm going to stop now because I could keep going on and on about every little detail.I love yours and it sounds a lot like mine - and same with the ghibli inspiration :)Well, there are 18 types total so I just didn't use them allHmm ok. I think I'll change ESFJ to normal type after considering this and other reasons..Thanks, I fixed it now.This post is just for fun, it's not really meant to be taken seriously.


Real MBTI is based on functions.


INTJs aren't really seen as 'dark INFJs', they have different functions in different orders that work differently in function, and also, each INTJ is different from each another. MBTI can't predict behavior.


I guess these Pokemon typings are also kinda built on stereotypes too, haha.
Any type.I agree that the stereotypes here are a problem, and that we should not always just blindly follow MBTI, and we should question if it is flawed (which it is).


And even for me, on and off a few times I doubted MBTI's credibility but still I came back, idk why. Yes, this sub isn't perfect. But I do have fun here. 


I guess I could relate to some things said about INFPs and how they work, and I was able to relate to some oddly specific questions asked on the the INFP subreddit in the past. And through my few years knowing about and continuing to learn about MBTI, I learned about myself. And not every INFP description fit me to the letter, but it allowed me to question how those functions worked. But, for me at least, it helped my develop introspection.



For me, this is fun. And I guess you can only choose what you want to believe. 



And, I am not a MBTI practitioner or a psychology major, so really, I'm not credible either, it's just my personal opinion that I formed after everything I've seen on this sub, and with all my MBTI knowledge and experience. So maybe just take all this with a grain of salt. And thank you for the reply, I liked what you said.INFP still cause why not?I could see how that could also workdo you like Altaria? You can be a dragon if you really want to haha, these typings are just a silly/fun thing.You could still be a rock type if you felt it fit you better personally. :DENTP and ISFP, I think I could convince them to help me build our new Swiss Family Robinson style home. I actually built a little shack out of mostly sticks/vines/leaves in the woods near my house with my ISFP friends a few years ago, that was a lot of fun. And I have an ENTP brother that I'm sure would be up for it. Lets just hope the ENTP and ISFP I'm stranded with are similar to my friend/brother, haha. But I think I could have fun with any of the types.Any healthy type can get along with any other healthy type.INFP

1. Invisibility and the ability to phase through objects.
2. I give myself different mock names all the time and usually speak in third person and in a ghosty voice, I also play characters. Ex. Casper The Friendly Ghost, The Ghost Of Christmas Past, and made up characters.
3. 5?
4. 5?
5. Hmm maybe 5?
6. Sometimes I wear a white sheet with eye holes to mess with people. Or floating glasses.

I wouldn't be much of a superhero, I would just be out having fun/innocently messing with people. I would still help people though when I saw an opportunity.

Mischievously cackling would be my thing.Yeah I agree, I wish it was a little more specific like the other onesI just didn't want anyone to start hating anyone else because of their type, or end a relationship. I've seen it happen and it's silly.Personally, I like guys who are honest/direct/frank, have passion(s), are caring and intimate, and not afraid to be themselves/different/(weird).


I liked all your other typings though, ESFP and ISTJ are my parents and their descriptions match up :).Hmm it is better and I especially like the line about authenticity. I think confidence would work as a better word at the end than weirdness in a 'not caring what others think' type of way. I think adding in a thing about how INFPs want to be understood would be good too. Thanks for the reply :).Team Instinct, INFP.Mother: ESFP
Father: ISTJ
Me: INFP
Brother: ENTPOops yeah okayHonest 13 or 14.

Whenever I leave the house.

Maybe 10 minutes?

Putting on the foundation to make my skin look blemish free.

Also least favorite part is foundation because it's hard to find the perfect shade  since I'm so pale.

I like my lips to look natural but with a little pinkness in them. I use tinted lip balm and sometimes I might dab a bit of red lipstick on my lips and spread it around (it just looks pink then).

I never where eyeshadow. But I might put an unnoticeable amount of blush on my eyelid.

No. Unless blush counts? I put blush on under my eyes and on my nose, for a cuter look.

I never really wear eyeliner, I feel it makes my eyes look smaller/darker. And I never where it on the bottom eyelid line. I might where a bit of eyeliner for fancier events, but I keep the line thin and it starts at my pupil and ends at the far away corner.I got ENTJ and yes it's accurate :)Fi users, I think especially xNTJs.INFP - rogue, ranger, druid.Ah, what you are doing there is some mighty fine introspection. I'm the same way. Self-analysis is one of my favorite pastimes. 

A quick question: do you talk out loud to yourself when you pretend to explain things to other people? I talk to myself A LOT, and most of the time when I am introspecting it is out loud, especially when I am pretending to explain something to someone.NF vegan here. My ISFP friend is a vegetarian though, she is a very picky eater.INFP. Self, language, nature.It's more about introspection than lack of social skillsENFP as the tinfoil hat character
INFP as a friendly ghost

(Me): INFP. Usually I fall asleep in a half yearner half fetal with one leg straight out and the other bent up closer to me with one arm under my pillow. Sometimes however I like to lay in the starfish because it feels good for my spine and neck. A lot of times I wake up in the starfish.And remember to say your type if it isn't in your flair. And It doesn't have to be one of these three classes. It can be any class you like from anything.

I like to play the rogue, thief, sneaky archer, or nightblade. Really just stealth is my game, haha.

What do you think his type is?And say your type if it isn't listed in your flair.

Mine is dark, dry, self-deprecating, and satirical.
The vibe I'm getting from your writing seems more INFJ than INFP. Do you like the idea of truth? Or do you like to think for yourself to get your own perspective? As an INFP, I lean more towards the first one. Perhaps? I don't think we have quite enough information to really say for sure. That single letter makes a big difference because your functions are completely different. This might help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYObahl0p6E

I'm quite sure nurture has the larger role, but recent studies have found out that nature plays a larger role than previously thought. So nurture still gets "majority", if you know what I mean.Oh yeah. That kinda gets me sometimes.

I mean, I am sensitive, but I rarely show it. Fi, our dominant function, is a very guarded and private type, so we don't show as much emotion as some stereotypes will say.

But the thing with stereotypes is that they don't apply to an entire population, they may apply to individuals. Of course, stereotypes are still largely generalized--there's more to a person than a stereotype, but some people may appear to fit the bill. It depends on the person, not the population.

Like me. When I was little, I cried a lot. Like, if you ask my classmates who knew me in first grade, they'd say so. But my parents have this "crying is no use" kinda thing running, so I barely cry or show any really "vulnerable" emotion. So I guess it's a nurturing kind of thing...I just don't cry a lot now, anyway.

(Also, I know this might be the wrong place--but how do you make italics in here? I've been trying ctrl + i, but doesn't work, so it's something else, I assume. Could someone help me with this?)Okay...I'm just putting in my two cents.

About Ne and Ni, both can see many possibilities, but the difference is in their thought processes.

Ne has divergent thinking, while Ni has convergent thinking.

Ne will feel the need to explore, broadly, the many possibilities, almost all at once. Ni will go through possibilities one by one, very deeply.

Neither of them are "better" or "worse" than the other. It's just a difference in thought process, is all :)Huh. Well, it typed me correctly, an INFP and all. I'm a bit skeptical of the profile. It seems...a bit too generic?Ne is extensive while Ni is intensive. That's probably where the "shallow" idea came from.Took the 16personalities test in 7th grade, in a class, then thought up of it a year later and took the test again.

I got ISFJ that time and agreed with most of it in the description, except for "traditional" (then again, I now think 16personalities has sorta skewed MBTI imo), went on Quora, looked through their personality type descriptions, identified with INFJ, went with that.

Months later, looked through cognitive functions at thought catalog, decided I wasn't an INFJ, then stuck between INFP and ISFP, consistently scored INFP, looked through function stack again and agreed I was an INFP, and here I am now.&gt;So before I knew about the MBTI, I was rather obsessed with the whole zodiac signs thing

Same.

Capricorn does seem pretty Te-ish to me but other than that, I really don't have any worthwhile commentary on this.I would agree with Si being used for analysis. Si in itself is a very practical function, after all.

I'm considered pretty "smart" in my school; I mean, high grades, all that good stuff. I'm really good at memorizing too, so learning vocab words are pretty easy for me, though I tend to underestimate this. I can also be quite cold too; I mean, Fi is a pretty guarded function when it comes to showing emotions, which might not be what people might think of as a feeler.I guess I can kind of identify with this...hehe.

For example, I message with someone on Tumblr in a kind of polite way, and sometimes I have to take awhile to formulate the correct responses.

And then there are some times I get incredibly bored with conversations but I still carry on anyway just to be nice. Expect shorter responses though :)Extroverted SJ types. I've never met one personally (well, who was into MBTI), and I've only just started some of you guys around. I'd love to get to know you better!It's possible with Fi doms, but most likely only with unhealthy types. I'd doubt that a healthy Fi Dom would say something like that. I've taken the 16personalities test many times and I've always gotten INFP. Always. Though I now personally think the rest is a bit I skewed now, I still think I am an INFP after looking at functions. 

I've taken similarminds and keys2cognition, with *fairly* stable results; mostly INFP, occasionally INFJ but will only stay within the NF category, strangely. 

(Edited spelling)INFP. Horned Serpent. Well, I've seen someone say that small talk leads to big talk, so if people don't like it, they might still have to go through before getting to the meat and potatoes. 

Personally, small talk is tolerable, but I can't exactly keep up a conversation just based on that for too long. At least, I don't think....Fi's morals tend to come internally, with not outside influence, but Fe's morals tend to be influenced by others, like friends or family. 

Like /u/lawdudette said, it seems the same but it comes from a different source. Hence, Fe is extensive, Fi is intensive. I only have three words to say:

That sounds horrible. 

I wouldn't be able to stand those people. 

FINE I BROKE MY THREE WORD LIMIT ALRIGHTHoly crap, that was so informative and *exactly* what I needed! Thank you so much!Like you get so into something but you don't want to so you're like "No. Stop thinking about this. I'm exhausted."Oh, that absolutely sucks :( There are better INFPs out there though, hope you can meet them...

(Sorry if I suck at sympathizing. I have trouble finding the right words to say sometimes.)

I have to admit though, your earlier comment--"I mean what I say"--I think that's a good attribute. There are people out there that don't. When I'm thinking about happy conversations, I like going back and thinking about what was said. I also tend to go back to certain moments and "evaluate" my behavior to see what I could've done. It's more about the person and their experiences. There is technically no "typical" Si user, imo.1. Probs dreamwalking. Fiddling with the settings of dreams and appearing in other people's dreams is a really cool concept [, SO I CAN MAKE MY VERY OWN NEKO ATSUME PARADISE].

2. Nah. I don't think I'd use my ability to do anything particularly superhero-esque.

3. 4.5. I mean if I'm asked to do so, I might use it to do good...but only if necessary. I'd be content just playing around with my dreams.

4. Bah, I don't know...5. 

5. An 8. I might venture to let close friends know, but other than that, my lips are zipped. 

6. Well I can just MAKE costumes in my dreams! Nah. Again, I'd only use this ability for fun.Same though. ISFPs (in my limited worldview) are pretty cool. I was close friends with one during elementary school before kind of growing apart. We're friends now, but not as close. She does have her shortcomings, of course, but I usually don't think "oh, this is so ISFP" or anything. 1. INFP. I'm pretty sure of my type, well...the surest I can be. I actually haven't considered other types too much, which is surprising because of my indecisiveness.

2. Won't specify my age, but I'm a young teenager.

3. They haven't taken the test and my typing is amateur at best, but I'd say my mom is an ISFJ and my dad is an ISTJ.

4. Uh, since I'm in middle school I don't have a specific field of study...but I enjoy creative writing and I have joined forensics (public speaking, not study of crime), the school newspaper, science club (though I bailed out half the year because my dad wasn't able to pick me up and, well, it's hard to explain). I have considered maybe something in music (I play violin), or english, since I like to write and read a lot, or philosophy (though not too many job options), or even perhaps psychology (it's a wide field, after all). At the moment though, I'm still thinking.

5. Haha! Nope. 

6. No. I might want to have children, maybe not...I mean, children are very hard to take care of, I know, and I've met young kids who talk a mile a minute and I get exhausted because I just want some alone time. If I were to have kids though, maybe just one. Or two. Not that many.

7. ...You don't say? Nope. 

8. *silence* Nope. Not at all.

9. Oh brother. Most of my favorite TV shows are Chinese. Well, my favorite is the Chinese Running Man, because it's really humorous, fun to watch, and every episode has a different kind of plot line, but the structure is still somewhat similar. It's very entertaining.  

10. My parents are atheist and so am I. 

11. No problemo...I'm probably too late though.Oh no.

THE FORCE OF FEELING HAS COME.The test. Just. Stumped me.

I stumbled on this post and decided to take the test, scoring a measly 9 (that's right, only a 9). I was really confused the whole time and just stopped trying midway.

Ahhhh...my eyes...ISFPs knowledge are inFiNiTe. I don't play video games much, but I tend to gravitate towards Mage/healer/archer classes. And, in case my flair isn't showing, I'm an INFP. When your inferior Te starts making you think about the most efficient way to fold laundry. Depends, I guess. Both Fe and Te are more focused on cooperation and teamwork in my  book...I prefer working independently, but if I'm with a good group, I'm happy. INFP. Music, language, and self. 

I once read a book about this stuff, so my results came out as expected. I was surprised that my logical/mathematical knowledge is so bad though, at a 2.29. I love talking face to face but sometimes I prefer texting. It gives me time to think out what I want to say, since sometimes I tend to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. It's also good because if you don't want to talk to someone on text, just don't text anything (at least for me; my friends don't really initiate conversation). 

&gt;I get anxious if friends don't reply back on time or i misinterpret their message and then I start to get thoughts such as " if they don't want to be friends anymore" or if " they don't like me".

Oh my god saaaaaame. I always think that, especially since sometimes one of my friends doesn't really reply (as a tendency) right away when I know they're on. Sometimes I seriously freak out hehe...
True. After all, both thinking and feeling are judging functions; they are to help you make decisions. 

But emotions? Emotions structure the world to us. It gives us experience. It gives us a sort of morality--from emotional experiences and objects, which lets us define certain things as good or bad in terms of society. They're important to all of us and our survival. 

It is not facts vs. emotions. If we were to be devoid of emotion, we wouldn't survive. While I'm not gonna suggest any specific ones, typology related books are also quite reliable. 

Although I'm not quite sure how good The Comprehensive (ENFP and INFP) Survival Guide are, the MBTI stuff Heidi Priebe writes are usually more...just for fun-ish, although there are basic descriptions. Haha, tbh, so many people say they hate small talk so much now that it kind of annoys me. I'd be--actually I *am*--a hypocrite to say that I'm not a huge fan of it. I love talking about deep stuff, but I rarely have those conversations. 

Besides, in my world, small talk leads to big talk. I'm fine with the occasional round of social pleasantries and I do engage just to be polite. I like talking about myself. I'm sure everyone else does too, but I like asking people questions about my flaws, or their flaws or parts of their personalities. I like that kind of conversation as it's very fulfilling. 

Small talk is all that other stuff out there that's more common. I don't hate it, but if I lived on it every day, I'd get bored. Because the things I like asking the most about are things about myself and things about ones close to me, as well as their opinions, what *they* think. That's what I love. Look, this might not be helpful, but everyone cares. There are people with the aura that seem like they don't care. In your life, they're thinkers. They do care. They do care, to an extent. Everyone cares about this. They each just handle it differently. 

Everyone has a hint of sensitivity. And even if you became a thinker, you wouldn't be able to escape it. Hahah, I do love looking at your sub though.No, it's just that no one in my friend group is interested in it like I am. My INFJ friend gets horribly confused when I explain it, my INTP friend doesn't know too much and isn't super interested either, my ISFP friend knows...nothing...about it besides taking the test, and my INTJ friend is interested in other stuff.

There's no point in talking about it to them when they aren't really interested, so I just don't.On 16personalities now I *always* get INFP, but on other tests, I'll usually get INFJ, ENFP, or ENFJ. 

Most ENFP.SAAAAAME SO MUCHThat was exactly what I was thinking, yeah. And about not having a huge variety in life maybe have something to do with why you got into a Ti-Ni loop...I'm thinking lack of Se stimulation in your life?Agreed. I think small talk is necessary to get into deeper conversations, but I get you on giving information about oneself when the other party doesn't care. If they don't care, then what's the point of talking to them?

At least, that's what I think. Ah, it's alright. 

I think small talk is necessary because deep talk may be a bit too much for a stranger. Granted, if you are talking about topics you or the other person is interested in, that'd be alright for a conversation, but if you were to suddenly just talk about your latest existential crisis (idk it might not be a good example), strangers would feel a bit put-off with all this baggage from someone they barely. 

When you first meet someone, I think small talk is a good, polite way to start. And sometimes the little things in small talk may matter later on. That's how I see it, anyway. Ever since I decided on INFP, I've always gotten INFP on the 16personalities test. 

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ I got oral-receptive. It's a super cool test!Boo.Wow. That's just super stupid. It's not like all Thinkers go out to hurt people's feelings, I swear to god. MBTI used at its finest. 

Typism it is. 
I believe you confused the survey for a test.Hey man, i know exactly what you're feeling. I quit engineering for the same reason, people made me believe i was good at mathemathics and guess what, i suck at it. Leaving your whole "grand plan" for life behind is really hard, you suddenly find future to be pointless and dark. You just need time and something to keep your attention away from those dark feelings. Ask me away if you need help with anything, i'll try to give you my best :).

I believe i'm an INFP btw.You got that right, we're alive so we must live for the sake of our loved ones if not for ourselves. I'm doing just the same, studying in another field while trying to find a meaning to... anything really. I really suggest you to get a pet animal if possible, (capable of emotional bonding) such as a cat or dog, they really help relieving a lot of stress. Hope you will find whatever makes you happy in life mate, best of luck.Oh i do the same, to hide my own shame tho :3


Yes Fi dom, INFP..Check your example 5 again, INFPs dont have Fx-Tx for their 2nd and 3rd functionsSure thing man, also i dont get the example 7 and 8, did you forget to add the flavors in there ? They're all xx-xx at the moment.Yeah neither do i, but again im not an expert so maybe i just dont know if i know one.Ethan and/or Hila Klein from H3H3 Productions (Youtube)I assume you don't have a favorite then. But why do you find this so surprising? If there are multiple options people usually will have a favorite.Okay i sense a degree of hostility and i apoligise if i sounded rude in my first comment as English is not my mother tongue, but whatever. Edit: Oh i just realised you are not the guy i responded to so you can skip the apology.

Having a favorite of something doesnt have to rely on logic, sometimes you just like something and thats it. Whether you like how it looks or you identify with the thing in an unexplainable manner, it doesnt have to make sense for you or anyone unless you look at it from a psychological perpective, then im sure you will find a correlation which is probably something about our uncouncious.

About your.. weird examples. I didnt say 'always' but used the word 'usually'. On top of that, neither blood types, violent rapists nor grains of sands are things you choose for decoration or artistic pleasure in general. So i think as long as you care about the issue at hand, say buying a car, and have a general understanding of it, then you might have some options you favour over the others. Maybe its just that you dont care about colors all that much.

So long story short, i believe that having a favorite color definitely make sense and is not about logic but mostly feelings.Ah okay now i can see your way of thinking and i can see why you don't see sense in it and i kinda agree since i cannot explain why i like the color of blue while i do not find it superior to the others. But my original question was that OP being surprised to people having favorite colors. You may find it stupid and i understand that but i just couldn't see a reason to be surprised by that.

Aside from that, it's true we don't know what most other points look like and that's why i find perspective to be a scary thing. This applies to everything. I guess we just have to make do with what we have and keep our minds open for the new points of views.Define 'too fast'.
&gt; As Fi increasingly rejects the influence of the outside world, it will lose the ability to express its values and feelings, and eventually it will lose its capacity for empathy almost entirely.

Wait, what, why would we lose our capacity for empathy?
Detective, 69.44% of the rationality score. I don't think that's the most common result for INFPs...?  
EDIT: How is it even possible that I scored 100% in quantitative reasoning...?My favourite YouTuber is the German Let's Player Suishomaru. I don't think anyone here knows him, and since his videos are in German I don't think linking to a video as an example would help a lot.  
But I think he's an ENFP, or *maybe* ENTP with well-developed Fe. Definitely Ne though.INFP here!

You obviously have a strong/well developed Ne function, to me. For one thing, most of the typings I've seen you come across for yourself involve the Ne/Si axis, and you're also super open-minded/exploring towards finding your type.  I usually test as neutral good or true neutral, but it's pretty close! :) I really want to develop my Te and see what happens with it, I bet I'd be 100x more productive. Maybe not ESTJ productive, but still. The numbers don't lie. Yeah, I mean with that much money probably comes a lot of stress. 

Don't get me wrong, I stress out a lot. But it ain't over work. That's exactly why I stay away from the type specific subs, I don't feel like I fit in too well with the theme most of the time. What about those who do not have feelings functions high in their stack?

I relate to this too. What about the STJ's? I'm INFP and got INFJ. 75% INFP

10% ENFP

4% INFJ

3% ISFP

2% ENFJI think he's ISTJ, but definitely more ESTJ than INTJ. Too much Si. VOI-S

61% Visionary

51% Observant (I'm obviously pretty close to the middle on this dimension if it's 51%) 

76% Introverted

And of course, the supporting factor I got this one first (86%) with retentive hysteric following at 69% Made me think of Bender from Futurama The American Midwest 🌪Wistful and hype; the color palette was a lot of lighter blue colors mixed with some soft pink tones
I'm an INFP and got an INTP. How the hell are we going to meet? The odds are not in my favour lol. that's why I think this quiz is definitely wrong :) 
I was super offended by Jung's description of Introverted Feeling doms, particularly because he was all like "this type is mostly women and they're cold bitches". But... yeah.

&gt;Although there is a constant readiness for peaceful and harmonious co-existence, strangers are shown no touch of amiability, no gleam of responsive warmth, but are met with apparent indifference or a repelling coldness. Often they are made to feel entirely superfluous. Faced with anything that might carry her away or arouse enthusiasm, this type observes a benevolent though critical neutrality, coupled with a faint trace of superiority that soon takes the wind out of the sails of a sensitive person.&gt; Maybe that's a way to tell what preference makes up your social circle mostly when you know your type? 

On the other hand, it makes it painfully difficult when you don't know your type, nor theirs, and have issues stereotyping people by their behavior :/I'd get so much done, as an ESTJ.

Oh, well.&gt;Symptoms of adult attachment problems: Difficulty handling conflict with other adults, Controls others through manipulative or overtly hostile ways, Trouble showing empathy, remorse, trust or compassion with others, Resistant to efforts on behalf of others to nurture or guide them, *Lacks cause and effect thinking, especially when around normal thinking*

Internet, is that you?

OTOH, I was *just* looking at the wikipedia page for avoidant personality disorder and... how easy is to see oneself in every personality disorder out there?Mother: ISFP

Father: ESFP

Sister: ESTP

Me: INFP

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Yeah. I genuinely like helping people or to be a ~translator between people expressing two opposite opinions. But then someone would try to *reciprocate* and I'd be deeply uncomfortable and resentful of the intrusion.  Double standards! Yay!Oh, I wasn't offended by that part. A bit terse, but he wasn't pandering to the self-growth community with those texts, so it's easy to let it slide. And I haven't read his descriptions of the other functions yet, so I can't jump to any conclusion. What gave me pause is the part where he goes on to describe the behavior of a hypothetical unhealthy Fi-user. Rather than the content, I found myself reacting to the language and gendering he employed:

&gt; This produces a type of woman notorious for her unscrupulous ambition and mischievous cruelty.

And

&gt; She begins consciously to feel "what other people think." Naturally, other people are thinking all sorts of mean things, scheming evil, contriving plots, secret intrigues, etc. In order to forestall them, she herself is obliged to start counter-intrigues, to suspect others and sound them out, and weave counterplots. Beset by rumours, she must make frantic efforts to get her own back and be top dog. Endless clandestine rivalries spring up, and in these embittered struggles she will shrink from no baseness or meanness, and will even prostitute her virtues in order to play the trump card.

Which, OK, you're describing neurosis there, Jung, *I get it*. I also get that he was a dude born in the XIX century. Doesn't make it any easier to stomach, though :(

&gt;1) What type would you want to be? Why?

Huh. I guess I would want to be INTJ. I don't think I have any other reason besides INTJs are badass.


&gt;2) What does Ni look like to you? Why?

Ni to me is choosing one possibility, the most plausible one, and going with it. It's following that possibility down and foreseeing how it will end up affect things, solely based on that one idea. It's this versus Ne, which is considering every possibility and not regarding the plausibility. I imagine it as a T shape, where Ni is the vertical part and Ne is the horizontal part. 

This is one of the main things that confuses me a lot about myself because I see parts of my life where I strongly use Ni and other parts where I strongly use Ne. For example, I don't lock my car while it's in my driveway because I live in a court and it's a safe neighborhood. While there's a possibility that someone COULD come into my car and hotwire it, what are really the odds? First they'd have to pick my house out of ALL the houses in the neighborhood. That alone is a narrow chance. Whereas someone using Ne might say "but it still could happen, so ya better lock it!"

Then I feel like I have used Ne more often when it comes to personal relationships. Like, if I pick up signs that someone is interested in me, even if ALL the signs point to it, I won't do anything unless they say it ourtight because there's still a possibility I am misinterpreting. I think the reason for this is that facts and probabilities like the car thing are concrete, so I know I can always go with what I think is the most plausible. But when it comes to feelings and relationships, those things are more fluid and differ with every person so you have to consider every possibility. So basically I feel like I use Ni with facts and Ne with relationships. But I know I can't have both, so... Iunno.


&gt;3) Would people that know you describe you as 'certain'? Why?

Probably not! I am pretty indecisive with a lot of things and tend play things by ear. I also doubt my opinions on things. I actually noticed the other day that whenever I'm offering my opinions on things, I tend to say "but I don't know..." at the end of my sentences, almost like I'm invalidating everything I just said. I think I'm sort of open to many different opinions, and when I hear a debate or argument, I can see both sides and go all Switzerland on everything. When both sides have solid support and evidence, it basically just comes down to what you think is morally right. The problem is, I don't know where I stand on a lot of things.

Whew, that was a lot of typing! I also apologize for my rambling!

EDIT: I forgot to say, that story of your friend quitting her job actually sounds sort of like me. I quit my job my junior year because I was doing the school musical, which was a time commitment, and I decided I valued something I loved doing over working a minimum wage job I hated. And I knew I could get away with it. It took me a really long time to decide what I wanted to do. The thing is, I think I have Fi rather than Fe, but my Fi doesn't seem very developed. Maybe that means I'm an ENFP since Fi is auxiliary for them? You phrased the extent of it perfectly. Maybe this IS a Fi-dom thing after all.I mean, I feel like I've always leaned more towards INFP than ENFP. Maybe I just have a hard time recognizing Fi in myself like you said. I can easily recognize the Ne and say what it is I do that leans toward Ne, just the Fi is always confusing for me.Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm an xNFP. Just gotta figure out which one.I'm just not sure if my Fi is developed enough to be considered an INFP. I don't know if it's just that I don't recognize Fi in myself, but I just don't think I lead with a judging function. I have a tendency to consider multiple sides of an issue and don't end up taking one side most of the time, which leads me to believe my Ne is stronger than my Fi. I feel like my Ne directly affects my Fi, if that makes sense.

On the other hand, I don't see myself as having that "extroverted energy" that an ENFP supposedly has. Also, while I feel like my Ne is strong, I also am not the best brainstormer and sometimes overlook obvious scenarios. I noticed that my friend is always very prepared for things because she thinks of almost every case scenario that could happen, and I compare myself and say "welp, I didn't think of that" and am always less prepared. 

I have also checked out the inferior functions and noticed that I relate to both inferior Si and inferior Te. Fe: Some sort of cream/off-white color.
Fi: Dark-ish lavender.
Te: Yellow.
Ti: Tan
Ne: Cyan/sky blue. Really neon.
Ni: Some really dark color but I'm not sure which one. I just see Ni as dark.
Se: Light yellow.
Si: Orange.


EDIT: Oops, accidentally posted a comment instead of replied...This is a tricky one. I do relate to Ti in the sense that:

- I have a desire to know how and why things work. 

- l enjoy math and science and am actually planning to major in physics. 

- Was always curious as a child and "why?" was always my trademark question

- I always get into trouble when debating with someone who uses evidence (Te?) that defies my logic. Because while my logic might make perfect sense, ya "can't deny the facts." When I was in debate, gathering evidence was always the most annoying part and often my downfall because I would come up with my claims beforehand.

However, I'm pretty sure that I'm not Ti dominant, if I even have Ti at all, because it doesn't seem to be second nature for me. A lot of times, it takes a while to get the gears rotating in my head to go on a long, purely logical thought process. I sort of have to get into a "thinking mode" to really be on a roll, if that makes sense. Also, I feel like one of the more important things to note is that even though I think through what is the most logical choice, that's not what I end up basing my decisions on in the end. The reason why I think I have Fi is because I tend to be emotional in my decision making. I go with what feels right. I know Ti and Fe go together and I've considered having Fe but most people say I don't seem to use it. I do care deeply about what others think and sometimes make decisions based on what will cause the least amount of friction with others, even if it's not the most efficient way. However, I show so many more signs of Fi that I think it might just be my Fi valuing external harmony.Alright. I think I'm gonna settle on that once and for all.I'm an INFP and I'm not really attracted to ENTPs. More IxTJs than anything. ENTPs make great friends/acquaintances though!Aw man I LOVE this guy!! He was my favorite last season. To me he always gave off a really ENTP vibe, but I don't have much logic/evidence to back that up. He's just really all over the place and goes with the flow.ISTJ? This feeling is basically one of the core aspects of myself! It's kind of like when people say they hate school because they don't feel like they belong. I never fully understood this, because I always feel a sense of belonging and connectedness with people around me if I start to see them repeatedly, even if I don't talk to them. We all share these moments and experiences in each others' presence; it doesn't matter if we verbally communicate with each other, because we've built this non-verbal connection through everything we have all seen and learned together. Man I sound like a hippie, but it's true.I honestly have been considering that lately. I definitely know I use Ne and Si, but it seems like I use them both equally and very often.Haha I can't help it! It's sort of like I have to really focus on it to actually continue daydreaming sometimes. Ironically though I have terrible listening skills because I think of other things a lot, but I wouldn't necessarily call it daydreaming. Your daydreams are so out there and heroic, that's pretty cool.Physics/Secondary Education

INFP probablyI hate it when people draw conclusions and opinions from misinformation. Like, it makes me mad. For example, if I read on another sub that someone thinks MBTI is stupid because "not everyone is clearly J or P," which implies they don't know about cognitive functions and are basing their opinion off of the faulty tests that type you letter by letter, that just makes me frustrated! Haha. This applies to anything that people can be misinformed about. I think the underlying cause is that I always want the truth to be exposed and hate when people are under the wrong impression. I've always wondered if this is a dominant Fi characteristic because I THINK I'm an INFP, but I've gone back and forth between INFJ, INTJ, and ENFP. 

Now, looking back and reading it, it sorta sounds like Te. But it could just be inferior/tertiary Te? Agh. 
This is another thing that I wonder about, the thing where my mind goes in circles arguing with itself. I could go on a whole string of sentences starting with "but," refuting the last claim made with something else. I wonder if this is Ne??

I'm obviously still trying to figure out where I fit. Any ideas?I'm trying to see if this correlates with certain types. Does anyone else just suck at estimating how serious a situation is going to be before it happens? Like for example, if I'm going to some event, I might think that it won't be a big deal if I'm slightly late, and then it turns out that it really was a big deal. Or, the reverse happens, where I make sure I get there early because I am under the impression that everyone has to be there on time, but then people are still coming in 10 minutes after the scheduled time and it doesn't really matter. The lateness example is just one thing; it applies to just about any future situation. Does anyone else always over/underestimate the seriousness of things? What cognitive functions do you think this mostly relates to, if any?It's kind of frustrating, to be honest. Sometimes I'll just want to get lost in my head and daydream about nice things. Like, I'll start to daydream about seeing my crush out somewhere, let's say the grocery store, and starting a conversation. But then my mind's all like, "that's ridiculous, he doesn't even go to that store," and for some reason, that just makes it impossible to continue the daydream. That's not to say I don't daydream a lot; I just do it mostly about things that have already happened and/or how they could have gone differently.

How do you guys daydream? Do you get lost in your thoughts easily? Are they often unrealistic scenarios? 
INFJ's secondary function is Fe (Extroverted Feeling). They soak up the emotions of others and take them in as if their own. So if an INFJ is around happy people they will feel happy, if around sad people they will feel sad, etc. I have also confirmed this with my INFJ girlfriend and she has also said it's hard to know how she's really feeling while she's with other people because of this. They aren't so much a mirror (INFP is actually considered a mirror) as they are an emotional sponge!  Yes this is true but you also wouldn't necessarily be able to tell if the INFJ was in a shitty mood either because they are very good at putting on a front and pretending everything is fine. My statement was more talking about when they are more emotionally neutral from the get go and then go around others. I'm an INFP and I got RebelINFP: Staring out the window or secretly writing poems instead of doing actual workINFJ's soak up the emotions of others, without really knowing why, so much so that they take in others emotions as their own. 


INFP may see somebody in distress over something specific and recall a time where they felt that same way because they were once in a similar position,and use this ability to relate to the other person. They aren't necessarily taking in others emotions as their own like an INFJ would, but rather reflecting how the other person feels or may feel based on themselves, their past experiences or how in tune with emotions in general they are. In this case I think it's the mixture of Introverted Feeling (Dominant function) and Introverted Sensing (Tertiary function) working together. I also think in a case where we don't necessarily know what is up with the other person off the bat, we may end up having a pretty good guess to what is going on emotionally with them eventually if our Introverted Feeling &amp; Extroverted Intuiting work together. Once those 2 functions work together and we actually figure out what's going on then we reflect again as I said earlier.Communication wise I would say ENFP's &amp; ESFP's

The ENFP that I used to know had suppressed Fi and a tendency to hide their feelings even though you could see it all over their face and a tendency to explode when emotionally frustrated.But general conversation was really easy and we could talk about shit for hours. They were very adamant about being authentic to themselves and gave no fucks about what others thought about that and I thought that was pretty amazing.

The ESFP that I knew was extremely energetic and super fun! Obnoxious at times but in an endearing sort of way. We would talk on the phone for hours and hours or hang out a lot and do really random things and both be complete goofs, she did most of the talking and I was perfectly okay with that.  She'd often come to me for advice about personal issues and I was always really happy to help out and lend an ear and some advice. Probably the best friendship I ever had, there was simply never any conflict between us whatsoever, we just kind of drifted apart.  I'm an INFP and I feel like this is how sensors view me. I relate to this a lot but I think that has more to do with my adhd then it does my type.Nah you guys are awesome even if you can be obnoxious at times. Your obnoxiousness is kind of endearing in the right context. You guys really know how to have fun!"Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.

Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow.

Just walk beside me, and be my friend."

This Albert Camus quote makes me feel all sorts of amazing things!

I don't really change that much, I just become more extroverted and obnoxious, ha.Just let me rant without offering "solutions". Listen, empathise and be there for me. Let me be a hysterical disastrous mess and just offer your emotional support even if you think I'm being ridiculous, or distract me with things I'm interested in. If it's somebody I'm dating, the same things apply but I want them to also hug me and cuddle with me and maybe watch a movie or something. 

Freedom

Compassion

Happiness

Creativity

Honesty

Adventure

Knowledge

Justice

Humour

Solitude

Some of these were really difficult D:
They have told me they pick up on people's emotional vibes when entering a room, and take in the emotions of others. This points to Fe, so I think STJ is unlikely.ISTP or ISFP.At first I thought maybe you were a fellow INFP but as I kept reading I began to see the differences. 

What made me think ISTP was when you said the following few things: 

"Honestly, I really hate talking about things I enjoy. Just never found it useful"

"I don't "strongly disagree" with anything as I feel the effort is too time consuming and impractical. Let each man carry his own sins."

"People say I'm very observant. When people online hear my voice, they are often shocked at how "un-monotone it is". However people usually think I am sad or upset when in fact, I'm probably just in my head working something out."

The reason these quotes made me think ISTP is because my father is an ISTP and these quotes also describe him. He's very stoic, adaptable, practical, can come off as aloof, doesn't like to fret about things, doesn't talk about his interests, creative and into things like photography, photo editing and decoration building. He's often quiet but will randomly come out with these seemingly random words of wisdom that make you kind of go "What is knocking around inside that brain of yours?" 

I'm not sure what also made me think ISFP.

Female and INFP

Maid Marion &gt; Little John &gt; Robin Hood &gt; SheriffThis is interesting! I don't really pay that much attention to my tone or the way I talk unless I'm trying really hard to convey something specific or my social anxiety is acting up. However people have told me the following about my speech and the way I talk: 

- I come off angry and irritable when I'm sad or depressed

- That I'm well spoken and articulate (This is something I have a hard time believing personally) 

- That I come off as extroverted

- Two different therapists have told me that I come off as very philosophical

- I've been told I'm talking too loud by some and that I'm too quiet by others

- That sometimes I talk too fast and throw way too much information at people at one time

- I sound young for my age

- People pick up really quickly when I'm tired but also sometimes think I'm wide awake and lively when I am actually tired.

- That I mumble sometimes (I'm always oblivious to this)

- I get told I change topics too much 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On another note I'm very sensitive to the tone of others. There is so much emotion in tone and vocal patterns, no matter how nuanced or monotone they may sound. It's interesting that you've been able to break this down even further into type!Person 1: Not sure, possibly ISTJ, INFJ or a very unhealthy INFP. Also sounds like she might have ADHD.

Person 2: ESTP

Person 3: INFP

Person 4: INTPThey don't classify it as ADD anymore. It's called ADHD in general now but there are 3 types. Predominantly Hyperactive, Predominantly Inattentive and Combined type. So when I said ADHD I just meant in a more general term. Hyperactive also isn't always physically hyperactive, a lot of times the hyperactivity will become internal as people age. So a hyperactive mind. 


My top 3 were A (30%) S (23%) and I (20%)

I'm a female INFP. Some of the job suggestions I got are things I am interested in but a lot was also missing or not accurate at all.This is the exact purpose of the MBTI for me as well! I just wanna learn how to communicate better and understand different perspectives!The only dreams that I can remember are the nightmares. Some of those have been recurring and almost always involve water and trying to escape or a sense of dread.

- Being on a beach surrounded by tall cliffs while a massive tidal wave was coming in, everybody there was trying to climb the cliffs to escape and everybody was also screaming

- In a car with my mother driving on some sort of doc and then crashing into the water but waking just before the actual impact

- Floating out in the middle of the ocean with a massive sunken ship below. (This is a nightmare because I have submechanophobia)

- Being underwater staring straight at the sunken titanic 

- Me and my girlfriend at a rented cabin that was located on some docs, there was a massive storm and the water was crashing through the windows 

- Going swimming at a pool only to find out there were sharks in the pool. Unresolved trauma is bubbling up to the surface in the wrong social contexts. The blowback of that has got me stuck and now I can't stop circling.I have multiple diagnosed mental health issues and I'm also in therapy and on medication. I'm very well versed in my own emotions but grief and trauma are something that I'm not well versed in internally. The dom-tert loop explanation just gives me some language to use in reference to how I'm feeling, so I can explain it better. I'm using it more as an analogy then in literal terms.I'm actually going on a month long trip soon, so perhaps I can try to do this there.&gt; Do what they tell you to do.

This and the close mindedness is the issue I take with this type. The bossiness and if you refuse anything they say they get super fucking pissed at you.So I took a bunch of statements from a site that had broken down the cognitive functions and I asked the person which ones they identify with most, I've asked them other questions as well. I'm really struggling to type them because I've noticed contradictions or conflicts in their answers and such. 

Anyways this was what they chose: 

“I see a million different ways to look at the concept I’ve been analyzing and I want to consider them all.”

“How can I improve upon – or even perfect – the approach that I regularly take toward my main passion or interest?”

“I must analyze all possible outcomes of a sensory experience, as the physical world is subject to change unexpectedly, at any time.”

“I prefer to plan the majority of my life around the traditional or tried-and-true methods of doing things, as they have proven to be the most reliable.”

 “I have many goals I want to accomplish but often have trouble tangibly setting them into motion. I fear being perceived as incompetent by others.”

"Where does this new hunch or piece of information I’ve acquired fit in relation to what I already know to be true?"

“I will make those around me feel comfortable and happy in a cohesive manner, by identifying what we are all mutually striving for.”

“Feelings make me freeze with anxiety because I don’t know how to moderate them. I am terrified of accidentally offending someone.”

“I must decide how I feel and where I stand on these issues before coming to a conclusion about what to do.”

“I prefer to plan ahead, but when necessary, I can think surprisingly well on my feet, as I feel in tune with what is going on around me.”
I'm currently stuck in a Fi-Si loop and it's making me seriously depressed and on edge. Does anybody know any tips to help me get out of this?How the hell do you cheer up or make ISFJs happy? They are so temperamental and prone to angry outbursts if everything's not what they perceive to be perfect. Please tell me how I can get along better with this type!? I'm an INFP by the way.
Some people have emotions that are usually controlled but just under the surface. Being drunk makes them more volatile and difficult to control. You just don't happen to have that characteristic.

Source: idk, seeing enough emotional drunk people  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯A lot of this suggests Introverted Feeling (Fi), which would point to INFP.I could imagine that two really stubborn Fi users with conflicting views wouldn't like each other, but personally, most of my closest friends and favorite people happen to be ENFP. I haven't known too many other IxFPs, but I always got along with the ones I knew. I think it was more so that in college we were surrounded by people with whom we didn't have anything in common, so we just sort of found comfort in people who thought more like us, even if they didn't think the same things.INFP, and I've been sorted into Gryffindor and Pukwudgie.Didn't find it even slightly funny - just really aggravating. I can't stand people yelling, and I can't stand people doing things just to get a rise out of other people.&gt; I get downvoted to oblivion if I talk about anything besides depression or hugs.

What? I mean yeah, we like to overindulge in our fuzzy talk, but I hardly ever see anything really downvoted there unless someone's deliberately being an ass. =/My oversimplified guess is that a lot of the negativity stems from not being able to reconcile our own subjective worldviews and thought processes with reality.Why do we have to have so many threads dedicated to shitting all over other types?Love that ours is so supportive all around, and just feels nice to be in a sub where it doesn't feel like people are at each other's throats about things 

Could use a little more variety, though. The emotional support and validation is nice, but people can often be caught up in tending to wounds when others want to chat about other things.Yeah, this thread is making me feel pretty bad.Isn't any function limited without balance?Ti doms. I feel like I should understand it to a degree, being Fi-dom, but I guess I just I just don't quite understand the idea of thinking "independently." Or maybe I just have trouble distinguishing Te and Ti.&gt;It's kind of ironic because Fe users contradict everything I believe in

How so? I feel the same way in that Fe types are good at getting me out of my shell, but is it that they come off fake or something? 

Anyway, I know one ISFP for sure (maybe a few more, but not 100%), and they're one of the kindest, most laid-back people I know. In fact, I'm really bummed because I didn't get to know them until shortly before they moved away, but they were one of few people to sort of *get* me as an Fi-dom.

The same friend is a programmer, and I always envied their ability to do that so well. If I had to pick another type, it'd probably be ISFP for the sake of that Se that I lack (and fucking hell, do I lack it).

All that said, I don't think other people finding you boring necessarily has to do too much with you being ISFP. Easier said than done, but from one Fi-dom to another, perhaps you just need to try meeting people in the middle, socially speaking. We hate small talk and impersonal formalities as much as and probably more than anyone else, but sometimes they're just necessary. Put yourself out there, and you might be surprised to find that people will open up to you as well.This makes me think that your troubles have less to do with you being "boring."I think your responses to people in this thread say enough.Oh no, don't get me wrong - I do agree with that idea entirely, just not with the rigidity of OP's understanding of it. But obviously, the truth of one statement doesn't excuse being so bluntly sure if oneself in the face of multiple people disagreeing, nearly to the point of arrogance or condescension.

I'm just saying that I think the problem here is more fundamental than functions or types or anything.Ha, I do this to. Music is big for me, so I'm always thinking things like, "why do these kinds of people like this music? Does the music form the people, or vice versa?"As vehemently as I disagree with people in that sub, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated by it.Lol, I can't attest to most of this, but my ISTP roomie has been playing an UNGODLY amount of Overwatch.I honestly hardly ever even see ISTJs talked about here. As for INFPs...I wouldn't say "hated," but it's hard not to feel like we're among those taken the least seriously.One of us can do it...just gotta make sure to get the right kind of bulb...alright, got it...but is it going to last? Maybe I could get one of those energy-efficient bulbs. Those are expensive, though...and I'd probably have to talk to someone at the store to get the right one...but what if they give me the wrong one? It might short out or something and then I'd have to get a new one, and I should've just gotten the normal bulbs in the first place. You know, the dark isn't so bad.I don't know what I expected in here.Is this how you typically react - internally or otherwise - when there's dissonance between you and other people?Why?So you flair up as INFP...because you dislike /r/infp?So then what *should* all of these subs be discussing?Are there any MBTI subs that already do this well?I'll admit that I'm a bit ignorant to how some of these systems work, but is there anywhere in particular that we should read about them so we're all comparing the same things?Thanks! I think I'm inclined to go with representative democracy. Just seems like a good middle ground in theory, though we obviously see some of its issues in practice going on today. Definitely don't believe in a single entity having power, but I'm not sure whether true democracy can really be practical when considering bigger populations.INFP - SocialistIt is possible to tell the truth without coming off as being mean.You seem to not buy into this idea. Care to elaborate?Generally prefer complementary or collaborative discussion where people build on ideas or branch out from them. I'm not opposed to discussing differing views, but I can't stand "sport" debating or people deliberately being contrarian for its own sake.So in relation to INFPs (inferior Te), what would developing better Te look like? Does that manifest in a better sense of what's realistic, to counteract the idealism that we're (in)famous for? Or maybe something else?INFP - Musical, Self, Language. Sounds about right.Honestly the downvotes are probably stemming from your edit more than the actual post.So it goes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I have one good ISTP friend a few acquaintances, so that's my small sample.

What I like: they bring up interesting points about very dense subjects, and they're very meticulous and thorough about what they involve themselves with (something I basically cannot do). In general - probably just a Ti thing - they seem to be very grounded and comfortable with doing complicated things that would leave me frazzled.

What I don't like: they often don't understand very simple implicit statements - I often need to spell things out much more explicitly than I'm comfortable doing. Their inferior Fe can be *very* pronounced - they sometimes have little to no regard for how others are affected by things they do, and don't seem to understand what's wrong with that. And lastly, they often correct me, are extremely skeptical about, or poke holes in logic about things that are not that important. Mind you, this is purely my experience, which is made that much more difficult by me being INFP.

TLDR - ISTPs can be difficult for this Fi-dom, but y'all can be pretty sharp, so I can deal with the friction.To be fair, we thought my buddy was INTP for the longest time, but ISTP descriptions and functions seemed to hit home for him much more, so he settled on that. I could see either, though, in different ways.&gt; INFPs can confuse us

lol, so I have found. Trying to do my part to meet in the middle - it's definitely nice to have people who are actually friends, to sort of practice how to interact with people who think that differently from me.The two share the same functions in different orders (as you've seen), so I'd say it's probably pretty common. These posts ([ENFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2ebm4s/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_enfp/)/[INFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2c2yug/socionicsmbti_description_by_functions_infp/)) did help me out a bit when I was unsure - I decided that inferior Te definitely hit home for me, more so than inferior Si.Glad to help!This is just as I understand it, hopefully I'm not butchering it.

Inferior Fe can give the Ti-dom a poor grasp on how they affect others, or make them not prioritize it. They won't recognize or care much for social cues and won't go out of their way to assimilate in any social context until they see a need to.

Ti is, by nature, the opposite of Fe. Fe is warm and wants to maintain harmony. Ti tries to operate objectively and impersonally, which the Fe-dom sees as cold and maybe even harsh. So, it suppresses Ti so as to not become detached, and to maintain their warm demeanor.You're right - ambiversion doesn't exist in MBTI.I realize, I just thought that might be confusing/misleading to someone reading who doesn't know.&gt; People on dating sites are using them either because they're desperate to the point of kneeling and begging for some response or narcissistically feeding off attention. It's pathetic all around.

That's pretty harsh.xxTx

At least, this sub sometimes makes it seem that way.Sooner or later threads are going to start hitting my front page and I'm not going to know which sub they came from.You monster.Calling people deluded and linking to a single video as your only rationale is a very effective way to change people's minds.&gt; politically correct spinelessness

Definitely need examples of how this plays into your being an "asshole."Got it. The ISTP I know does this as well - I'll state an opinion on something I think is wrong, and he'll respond with the cause/reason behind it. And sure, there's nothing wrong with there being a reason - of course companies pay jack shit to offshore facilities - but surely you realize that responding in that way can sound like you're justifying it?

Of course, there's nothing wrong with seeing all sides of something, and I know that Ti-doms love to do explore in that way. I think it's just the way that by doing this, you create this air of utter detachment (which I understand exists to a degree). Not to patronize you or anything, but back to your example, just acknowledging that it's unfortunate would make you sound much less cold.

So then it just comes down to whether or not you care about how people receive your commentary. If you don't...well, then in some cases you may just end up being an asshole. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&gt; But there is this other side of me that feels very bad about it, and I definitely don't think it's good.

Is there any reason you don't express this more openly? Do you not want to come off as too impassioned? Do you actively suppress so as to not interfere with analysis? Is it just natural to see the causes/effects before acknowledging that you have a feeling about it? Or maybe something else?

I ask because I've had a lot of discussions with my buddy like this. In one instance he kept speculating about the ways in which Donald Trump could potentially be (functionally) an okay president, and he didn't seem to get my view that, while Trump may be something of a good businessman, his qualities as a person are pretty irredeemable and make him a poor choice. My buddy doesn't even support Trump in the slightest; he just didn't get how I couldn't separate Trump, the person, from Trump, the businessman.

So yeah, I think my occasional frustration comes from how, even in a pretty black-and-white case (in which I already knew my friend doesn't support Trump), my friend seemed to refuse to acknowledge any feeling about it whatsoever, and in doing so, also seemed to imply that having strong feelings about it was wrong. So I'm curious as to why that is.I already tend to feel like the way I think is strange or wrong when I see threads like this (and the general thinker bias of this sub). Surely it makes sense that I wouldn't want the main descriptor of my dominant function to be one with an undeniably negative connotation.I don't know the INFP(s) that prompted this - maybe younger/undeveloped ones - but I can tell you that we're often pretty doubtful of our own knowledge/abilities. Personally, I need people to check all my work on important things, and I'm always double/triple checking things because I know I'm bound to get something wrong. And I'm pretty sure I am not an exception of any sort in that, nor am I proud of it.I got Nicolas Cage. Don't know a whole lot about him, but I can't say I expected that. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Edit: Hmm, apparently he's often typed as INFP. Cool stuff!31/36, which feels about right. I had a lot of trouble distinguishing hostility from other serious emotions, so anything that looked vaguely angry probably got me.If we're talking short temper and being outwardly, visibly angry, I wouldn't say Fi-doms. We're sensitive, yes, but our emotions are more of a "controlled burn" - we're always feeling, but in doing so, we tend to gain better understanding and control over our emotions as we develop. So lots of things might bother us, but unless it's something hugely offensive to our core beliefs, we're not as likely to get outwardly angry about it.

I've noticed that people with inferior Fe/Fi, however, tend to have short fuses. They generally don't pay much mind to their emotions (so as to not impede on their rationality/logic), so when something upsets them, they overload pretty quickly and can get impatient, snap at people, and so on.Take INFP interactions here with a grain of salt, especially in our sub. While we certainly enjoy exploring the nuances of emotion and have an overall melancholy vibe, our sub tends to be more of a caricature of that because it's one place where we've more or less agreed that we won't bother trying to filter or suppress it. IRL, we tend to be much more collected, or even stoic. But there's always something going on under the surface for an INFP, which often amounts to that melancholy air that they have about them.It's not so much that we don't want to talk about what we're feeling - we just don't generally want to be told how to feel or how to deal with it. INFPs tend to be less concerned about being understood or helped than we are about feeling validated. As long as we feel like the people around us accept that we're experiencing some negative emotions and won't judge us for it, we're able to work through it ourselves. That's why we're often very selective about who we open up to.

It's the feeling of being *wrong* or *too sensitive* that will stress us out when some people try to talk us through our emotions. With Fi-Te, you'll hear people say that we want to "feel independently, but think correctly." When people are too blunt in talking to us about our feelings, inferior Te can leave us thinking that we're wrong about something, and thus shouldn't be feeling the way we do. And yet, we still feel that way, so we become stressed about our own feelings in addition to the matter that triggered it in the first place.

Of course, that's all very general. I know it probably sounds silly or even confusing, but with an upset INFP, the best thing to do - when it's inconsequential - is probably to just acknowledge their feelings, let them know you're there to help if they need you, and let them be.&gt;Describe your inner world.

There are so many ideas floating around, so many possibilities and hypothetical scenarios I've thought of. Best/worst case scenarios for everything, many in extensive detail. You'll find everything I wish was, in picture frames hanging on a wall in a room full of everything that is. At my best, I'm creative, imaginative, resourceful, and energized by the idea of creating something new. At my worst, I'm neurotic, devoid of confidence, perpetually dismayed by the world around me, and by my inability to finish things that I start.

As I've grown, the rose-tinted glasses have come off. I know I'll probably never be a rock star, and that I can't be great at *everything* I try. I know that my natural aptitude for things isn't always going to cut it anymore, and trying to reconcile that is a constant struggle. But in turn, I've started focusing on being less self-centered and more concerned with the people around me. I no longer have these childlike ambitions; I just want to be a kind person, and my only real goal is for my name to outlive me. I just want to do something that matters to someone. I want to be well-rounded and value wisdom over knowledge, I suppose you could say.

But there's this constant cloud looming over my inner world, and it's my struggle with feeling like I don't have a place in the external world. I have no real goals, I don't care much about money, and I don't care for what are decidedly American values ("working hard", climbing the ladder, making a good living, being assertive, what have you). And yet, here I am with a bachelor's degree, working a job that I like but can't stand being at for 40 hours a week. So, I'm perpetually caught between my own idealized inner world and what's actually around me. It's a struggle to be myself without being selfish or detached from the world.


&gt;What excites you?

Having a chance to express myself freely, without being judged. Having people look at what I create and say, “I totally get that.” Inspiring people. Feeling like I am, in fact, doing something right, while I’m also doing something I enjoy and believe in. Starting new creative projects. Finding music that speaks to me in a way that nothing has before. People appreciating not just my actions, but my intentions and motivations. Getting to be alone, free to do what I want with no commitments.Here we go again&gt;But, Ne and Se auxs seem to be the quietest of introverts. They're not necessarily the most "introverted introverts" but less inclined to speak without a specific purpose.

I can get behind that. At least in my case, I become hyper-aware of it when people start talking excessively or always seem to need to get a word in. So I try to focus on quality, not quantity, when it comes to what I say.I have an IxTP buddy who is *extremely* impatient with people, especially when he wants an answer to a question. That is, when a person doesn't give a straight answer or seems confused, he quickly seems to assume that they're incompetent and doesn't trust them, even if they ultimately give a correct answer.

In other situations, he's made the classic "everyone has a problem with me" rant, without considering that maybe his blunt and abrasive way of debating (and the fact that he "sport" debates) makes people not want to talk to him.

Outside of those situations, he's fun to be around - not to imply that inferior Fe just makes someone insufferable all the time. But I've generally seen it manifest as people not understanding, or maybe even not caring about tailoring their words/behavior to the people around them. They see it as being fake, and thus can be extremely stubborn about it.

As for inferior Te, that's easy - I have an incredibly difficult time sticking to the "bottom line." I care much less about the actual results than I do about the process, the intent, and what was learned, so it's really hard for me to gauge how productive I am in many situations. Dominant Fi wants to assess things in a very personal manner, and while we want to still stay within the bounds of what's objectively true, inferior Te just can't quite grasp what's most applicable, appropriate, effective, etc. Particularly in INFPs, I think our Fi and aux Ne makes us want to explore how everything could relate to us, making a lot of different options all appear to be potentially "correct." Hence, our tendency to be indecisive.Tough, but I think the ones I have to settle on are:

* Holden Caulfield (The Catcher in the Rye)
* Tommy Pickles (Rugrats)
* Doug Funnie (Doug)

Others I've thought of are Luke Skywalker, Tina Belcher (Bob's Burgers), Arnold (Hey Arnold), and Nick Carraway (The Great Gatsby), though obviously not all are INFP.She seems almost certainly Fi-dominant, which means INFP or ISFP. Because of the whole "phase" thing (totally relate), I also want to say INFP.&gt;  I was crossing a street one night as a truck was approaching. I had ample time to cross but I found myself thinking what would've happened had a tripped and knocked myself out on the road. Usually though I'm thinking about some future hypothetical or the past.

Things like this and your tendency to "lose track of your surroundings," to me at least, suggest aux Ne. Constantly associating things with other things can also be an indicator of that, as well as constantly thinking about future hypothetical events.

That's just my take, though. You didn't mention too much other than trying to be present in the moment that made me think Se. FWIW, INFPs more often tend to be enneagram 4, as well (I'm 4w5). I'll admit I don't have the best concept of Se, though, so my answer isn't 100% confident.Honestly though, I can think of few types that I've had a more difficult time communicating with.Links: [ENFP](http://bit.ly/1wZ0nYn)  [ENTP](http://bit.ly/1DvZq2h)It's partly me, maybe partly the particular ESTJs I've worked with. They tend to be very much focused on the bottom line, and when they ask something, they just want an answer, and they want it right away. When I'm asked something, I need a moment to think, and I'll usually feel a need to explain. They don't tend to be patient about that, and if it involves something not being done, they don't care *why*, just that it's not done.

I guess in terms of functions, it kind of boils down to them wanting to be detached and just know the concrete info, while I want to approach everything in a more personal or situational way.Pretty much :(

Edit: but yeah, we should prolly keep this to our sub.never :'''''''(I wouldn't be that afraid of people trying to manipulate me, but frankly, the amount of judging I see around MBTI communities has sort of taught me to be wary of disclosing my type to people who are familiar with MBTI. =/What would you *rather* see in our sub?I just don't see what the big deal is.Very interesting. I've typically seen Jesus Christ typed as xNFJ - how would you respond to/challenge that?Funny, I'm M/24 and you sound *a lot* like me. All of that sounds pretty INFP to me. I think INFPs, especially when they realize that they aren't really as adept at productivity and logic and the like, tend to say they value logic and rationality. A lot actually initially type as INTP because of that.

But I liked this:

&gt;When playing games, I get really involved and I need to connect to something, to feel like I'm the character somehow.

INFPs really crave personal connection to the things they do - it feeds our sense of self, and our personal identity and values make up the filter through which we process most things.

I think there's a big misunderstanding about INFPs around here, too. Granted, over at /r/infp we tend to get a bit self-indulgent and like to wallow in our misery sometimes, but I'd guess that's because INFPs tend to actually be pretty reserved IRL. But then there's this flood of thought and feeling going on under the surface, and we go and gush it all over that sub, which in turn gives you people who assume that INFPs are geysers of emotion 24/7 because they saw it on the internet.

And lastly, I liked

&gt;Edit: English is not my native language, sorry if something is wrong.

Your written English is better than a hell of a lot of native speakers. INFPs are often victims of nagging self-doubt because we're not always great at gauging how skilled/productive we are at things. That line was just a little cherry on top to me. =)Glad to help!This thread will go great.The "classic" criteria is that Judging people prefer more structure to what they do, like to plan ahead, and generally like to be decisive. Perceivers like to keep their options open and deal with things as they come, and they generally are more hesitant to decide or commit to things because of that.

That all comes from about every post-test description I've read. I know what people all think of the tests here, but honestly I've never really seen the above totally refuted IRL.The only reaction I could muster was a very long sigh.INFP here - generally get frustrated over people who...

* Are inconsiderate/lack empathy
* Constantly play contrarian
* Won't acknowledge that *how* you say something matters
* Miss the big picture because they're busy arguing semantics
* Assume that people who don't think like them are inferior
* Are impatient with others 
* Are totally solipsistic about their beliefs
* Are arrogant or condescending
* Say things are "bad" because they don't personally enjoy them

You probably get the idea by now, I guess.
*Love* the headphones analogy, as an INFP who makes it literal by walking around town with headphones on every day.

I think the Fe analogy seems a little primitive, though honestly I probably don't have any better a grasp of Fe than you do. But my take might be that instead, Fe users are wearing listening devices (hearing aids? lol) that amplify the feelings around them, so they want continual harmony and do what they can to foster that.You're giving me PTSD flashbacks to that time some Tool fanboy tried to tell our whole sub that we were intellectually inferior if we liked poppy music.People say Fi-doms are too sensitive, and yet a lot of Ti/Te-doms seem to be set off by a whooole lot more than us. =P*Technically*, INTPs don't tend to think in terms of Te since they're Ti-doms. But in general, they're often going to be more adept at dealing with "thinking" matters because INFPs (out of the box, anyway) subconsciously want to suppress thinking in terms of Te, as it opposes our dominant Fi.

Similarly, even though a Ti-dom technically has Fe in their stack, it's not going to automatically make them better at dealing with that sort of stuff because it's their inferior function. The INFP will likely have a better grasp of that, even though they're used to thinking in terms of Fi.If anything I just like being able to understand something that other people don't seem to, because I spend a lot of time confused by "real world" things. But I dunno, I don't like being confused or frightened by things myself, so I don't really wish it upon other people.Fi is all about individuality and personal values, so of course we want to feel like individuals and indulge in what we perceive as unique about our types.

But in any case, I don't understand why so many people in this sub seem to be on a mission to knock other people down a peg by calling them "special snowflakes."I think there are ways to tactfully communicate that to people rather than to do something [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5aig1m/whats_the_next_type_you_get_most_other_than_your/d9gp3wv/).Sure, that wasn't right to imply about other ENFPs. It doesn't mean that throwing it back in someone's face is a good way to communicate with them.

Basically, you're asking people to better understand typology, while refusing to acknowledge that you sometimes have to communicate with people differently. You can't just throw out blunt statements and expect them to sit as well with other people as it would with you. If you understand Fi so well, you'll know that invalidating an Fi user is a surefire way to get them to shut you out.Point taken, but I think that also highlights my point - in your OP you're talking mainly about people who think in terms of the subjective. I can't really begin to imagine how tiring that might be as a Te-dom (maybe a tiny bit if I think in terms of my own FiTe), but my point is that when addressing people who think in terms of the subjective, you *really do* have to take into consideration how they'll interpret what you say.

I know you didn't mean any offense by what you were saying (my Fi went off - can you tell?), I just wanted to point that out. Personally, I take criticism a lot better than I used to, but I just need to know that the person giving me criticism first understands where I'm coming from. Especially having inferior Te, it's tough to gauge how practical or rational I'm being, so that reassurance is crucial for me to really absorb criticism and learn from it.

But yeah, I probably do need to toughen up. Ain't that why we're doing all this? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯INFP male - IMO most stances against feminism boil down to either:
	
1) "I don't see any problems so there are no problems and people need to quit complaining."
	
or
	
2) "There are some shitty people who support feminism therefore feminism is shitty."
	
When you remove the idea that feminism is any more than the idea that gender should not govern what we can/can't do, I see no reason that anyone should oppose it.Feminism as basic ideology should not be confused with those few people who turn it into outright misandry under the guise of feminism.I would probably call this being observant, not empathetic.I guess your flare isn’t actually your type? Or just self-prompting the discussion? :-)

My inner world is an absolute mess. While I’m actually not too messy of a person IRL, there are odds and ends of thought and feeling to be found everywhere. As an INFP, I’m always delving into hypothetical scenarios - every possible outcome I can come up with for a situation, often to the degree of detail that I’m imagining the body language and flow of conversation within an event and the people involved. I don’t keep my train of thought for too long at any given point - there’s always something catching my attention, branching out continuously from where I started. Pair it with the classic Fi sense of idealism and personal values/judgement, and you get us constantly thinking, “it would be great if this…” or “that should be this way…” about the smallest and biggest things alike.

That’s just when I have things to think about, but nothing is immediately influencing how I feel. But when something elicits feeling in me, it can make everything resonate along with it. Or if there are a million magnets in my “innerverse,” a feeling will align them a certain way (no need to correct me, I know it’s a shit analogy). When I feel intensely is when I take action, or when my mind starts forming some direction. (You want an Fi-dom to get focused? The best way to do it is to give us something to be passionate about.)

And I guess “resonance” really is a keyword, especially for me as a musician. I almost rely on mood for direction. Without it, everything in my head is noise. In the absence of it, I sometimes (read: practically all the time) need to stimulate feeling with music. I think it’s why Fi-doms are often musicians and artists, or at least highly responsive to music and art. Those vast mediums of expression take feeling and emotion to a much more nuanced level, and they scratch itches we didn’t know we had. I love analogies, and just drawing connections between unlikely things that put things into better perspective.

I’m sure there’s a lot more I could tack onto this, but I think it probably gets the point across.

Edit: One thing I DO want to tack on - Ratatouille (the movie). The [scenes where food is being tasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xizttM_Cbuc). I always really liked those visualizations because they felt really close to the way certain things resonate with me (not just food, of course).Yeah, I probably could have said that better. By saying I rely on mood for direction, I just meant that when I'm not giving myself some sort of a mental pacifier (music, for instance), it's *really* hard to keep my train of thought on anything. I often need it just to keep a steady flow of thought, lest things start becoming noise again. When I need to make some sort of decision I definitely sit there weighing options like you say. That probably came off like "I *need* to feel something to do anything," which isn't really true.

...but shit, now there's probably a bunch of people who have rolled their eyes about this fucking INFP thinking he needs emotions to make decisions. =[Sure thing! I know Fi-doms, similar as they operate, can vary a whole lot from person to person, so I'm definitely interested to hear your take on it. lol, I was just getting done being irritated by an ENTP shitposting memes all over the Facebook group of a fairly large organization we're part of.I want to say lyrics usually carry more weight for me, but it's all kind of a package deal for me. Might be more because I'm a musician myself, but the musical choices made often tell me just as much as the lyrics.Same. I'm a guitarist and percussionist and have played a lot of different kinds of music in various ensembles, but when it comes to what I listen to myself, it tends to be pretty simple stuff. I don't need the bells and whistles of radio pop or prog rock or a lot of other music, personally. Some honest lyrics and a nice chord progression can be as strong as anything else.I *guess*.Also got VOI-S, also thought that. Interesting nonetheless, but I am a little bummed that the sites are most likely related. Was hoping for something new or at least something that independently affirms stuff I already know.I think there are a lot of ways people of different types could not fit in with the world around them, but yeah, as an INFP male, shit feels tough sometimes. But I live in a place that particularly seems to favor ExxJ types, so there's also that disclaimer.If it does, it's only because we prescribe certain traits to genders, which would make them social constructs.It's almost like people of different types are interested in discussing different things...You suggested that we lump all of those posts into one weekly thread. I mean sure, it's a really practical solution. But it reduces visibility drastically, and even more so when people learn to ignore the sticky thread because it's always the same one stickied. So how are people supposed to *not* feel like that reduces the importance of their personal struggles?

Personal anecdote: I was a mod for a music sub for a while, and one thing we had a "problem" with for a bit as it grew was people constantly posting their own bands. We tried a mega thread, and also a dedicated day for posting small artists. People learned to ignore it. The only people engaging those threads were a select few who really cared about finding small, unknown bands, and so it really ended up feeling less like a solution and more like it was marginalizing those artists. There had been more engagement - and more *authentic* engagement - when people were allowed to post their own threads the way they wanted, rather than be buried in a single thread that no one wanted to look at.

What *did* eventually help things was when people started coming up with more creative discussion threads, and more engaging ones. It balanced things and spaced out the "check out my band" posts, so that when those threads came up, they didn't become a constant that people would learn to ignore.

/anecdote

So, my point: you first suggested the above, but you also suggested that the presence of all those "depression" threads just feeds depression. Don't INFPs want validation? Is the commiseration in itself not a big part of what helps us feel less like there's something wrong with us? That's why so many people don't see it as a problem.

The problem wasn't that people in /r/INFP didn't want change, but that you proposed a solution that, while it certainly would cut down the "noise," would ultimately toss people's struggles aside, into a thread that people would eventually forget existed, and abandon outright when they realized no one was reading it beyond a few who really care to check it. If you want to change the climate of the sub, you need to do so gradually and steadily by introducing new discussion that engages people and gives room to breathe in between people reaching out for help or venting. Sweeping people's "depression" threads under the mega thread rug isn't going to change anything in the long run.Fair enough. Well, glad you could rise above it all and move on.It's okay, the thread asked for what the most compatible type is for INTP and the top actual answer just grills INFPs instead.

We can just stay warm together.I don't personally, but I do go practically silent (lest I say something I'll end up regretting). Close enough, I guess?I don't know if it was your intent and I know OP said "get mean," but thank you for writing about INFPs in a way that highlights our weaknesses without just calling us irrational crybabies like most of the other ham-fisted criticism that I see around here. No arguments with what you wrote.   What do you mean??? It's all just feelz before realz right?I wouldn't do it either - is it that ridiculous to not want to take the risk and then feel guilty about it?How naive of them. :[Bisexuality assumes a binary gender system (i.e. attracted to both men and women), whereas pansexuality implies a non-binary system (i.e. potentially attracted to any person regardless of the gender with which they identify). So it just depends on what school of thought you subscribe to.Of course there are situations where the bottom line is really what matters, but in general I value the thought behind something, what was learned from it, the motivation, etc. more than what the results are.INFP Male: Little John &gt; Maid Marion &gt; Robin Hood &gt; The Sheriff (John and Marion were more or less interchangeable for me)

&gt;You are fairly broadminded romantic and reasonably contented. You value kindness greatly and try to live by your ideals. You do not conceal from yourself, or from others, your strong need for security, which may be either emotional or material.

&gt;Men: Perhaps you tend to idealize women and credit them with virtues they don't possess.

I'd agree with it all, albeit I'm a bit reserved about my emotional needs.

As for my reasoning: Little John is the least involved and just wants to tend to Marion (on the surface, anyway). Marion did what she had to in order to help her friends, but presumably compromised her own values in the process—not immoral to me, but not my preferred course of action. Robin Hood is understandably upset, but has no right to take it out on Marion, who was just trying to help him and Little John. The Sheriff, IMO, is manipulative and corrupt. He's taking advantage of Marion's desperate want to get her friends out of jail, and additionally, ignoring his responsibilities as Sheriff to serve his own interests, by using "criminals" as bargaining chips.I like you, TheSwearBotI don't know if you're trying to call out those INFJs for being "special," bit the "doorslam" is something I've always seen people of other types on here ascribing to INFJs, not something they claimed themselves. (Why would anyone *want* that as a defining trait?) 

Edit: but I agree, I think it's a silly thing to keep perpetuating. If I'm a kid at heart as an INFP, then the ESFJs I know are definitely my "grown-up" figures. At least, they shake their heads a lot at dumb things I do and then try to talk some sense into me.*savage*

They're definitely difficult for me as an INFP, but Christ do they keep shit moving. That's gotta be worth something.Hardly anybody labels themselves an "SJW" now—it's basically become a derogatory term.You may want to check these out: [ENFP](http://bit.ly/1wZ0nYn)/[INFP](http://bit.ly/1Kp6TSy). Dunno if you know much about Jungian cognitive functions, but those posts will give you the gist in the context of those types.

For what it's worth, ENFPs and INFPs can be *very* close at a glance. They're naturally curious people, with a strong sense of self. But where they're more distinct is where they focus their attention. INFPs are more introspective and like to explore *themselves*, in a way. ENFPs are also very in tune with their own values like I mentioned, but they tend to put more focus on "collecting" new experiences and dealing with the real world.

So reading what you wrote about yourself, I'm pretty inclined to say you're more likely ENFP than INFP. Can I ask what it is that makes you think you're not INFP? (I'd try not to use /r/infp as a litmus test; we're not super great at giving a *full* representation of the INFP, in terms of what people post.)Similarly, picky eaters bug the shit out of me. I'd rather try and compromise with vegetarian/vegan friends about where to eat than with someone who, out of a whole world of awesome food, sticks to the same stuff all the time.

But, I don't always know the real reason that they're picky, so like you, I try not to let it affect my overall view of them.I'm not saying it's right or healthy, but surely you could understand why some of us might find it hard to reconcile how we want to be, with how we think we're supposed to be. I don't think that's silly.Sure - the most basic example would probably be how social one might be versus how social they feel they "should" be. It's easy for introverts to feel like they're doing something wrong when they don't want to be around people, but then sometimes we do it anyway because we feel like we have to.

The obvious response is to say, "well, don't do things that drain you or stress you out if that's how you feel about them." I'm just saying that even though the answer's obvious, it doesn't make it a silly thing to be worried or confused about.&gt; I just dont see why we care about this kind of stuff. It doesn't serve any practical purpose.

We could debate endlessly about whether there's a practical purpose to all this, but personally, I just don't think everything *needs* to have a practical purpose. I'm just intrigued by how people operate and why they behave how they do. I like the validation that comes with knowing there are people out there who think very similarly to how I do.

I think just the fact that we differ in our views on practicality highlights exactly why so many of us are so into it.I do. Doesn't mean much to most people anyway, but it seemed worth it for anyone it might mean something to. As far as others, I've only seen a handful, and only matched with another INFP and an INTP.Abandon all hope, ye who enter here seeking positivity.I'm stuck with an ESTJ? Fucking *golden*—I will follow their lead as they plan the entire ordeal and get our asses rescued.http://i.giphy.com/fmNp5I53lfUuA.gifThanks for that. Took and got:

Actualized: INFP  
Preferred: INFJ  
Attraction: ENFP  

Sounds pretty much exactly right. =)INFPs *can* be very caring and thoughtful, but it often stems from feeling a sort of obligation to do so. That is, if I see someone on the street who needs help, my first thought is likely something like, "that person needs help...I'd probably be a bad person if I just kept walking...shit, I'd better help them." We'll help someone, gritting our teeth all the way, if it's what we think we're supposed to do in accordance with our self-image.

We think primarily in terms of ourselves and our values, so self-involvement is actually pretty much the default setting for us. Where it goes from there is really up to you, your environment, the people around you, etc.   **Me from age 13-19:** You like *that* music? I only like good music, and I don't like that. So it's not good and you're stupid.Agreed. "Individualistic" might not be quite the word, but something without such a negative connotation would be more appropriate.It creeps back in sometimes  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Baby steps!Here's [the Car Model](http://www.personalityhacker.com/wp-content/uploads/car-model.jpg) from Personality Hacker. Take it with a grain of salt—it's a bit simplified, and people don't all agree on how credible any single MBTI-related site is. But I think it's a decent model to get a grasp of it.

Basically, each function represents a certain area of focus. While everyone uses every function at some point, each type has a set of four that, by way of how each function relates to the others, becomes distinct to that type. Your stack represents your personal thought process, which in turn highlights why we have different "types" of people.

If you read a bit about what each function's focus is, I think it'll start to piece itself together./r/shittymbtiI hope I can be as logical as u one day, opWhere do you see yourself between the Fi/Te and Ti/Fe axes? Particularly inferior functions.Gotcha. I think I actually agree with the top comment; you seem to have some decent awareness of empathy and your own feelings, but I think what you describe, I'd associate more with Si and Fe. 

It's hard for me to articulate (god damned *feelers*), but if every type has a certain "flavor" or "essence," yours strikes me as INTP more than INFP. It may be that the way you write about emotion feels more like you view them in a functional or objective sense. You're aware of them, but they're more like byproducts of your experience; points on a map. Where feeling might be likened to waters to be navigated for an INTP, they're the boat for an INFP.

Dunno if that makes sense at all, but it's always tricky describing Fi, especially when comparing to Ti.   :[What a scrub, has she *even looked up* the functions?^(/s)

Thought I was INTP for a while, because of course I think the rational solution to a problem is preferable. I answered all of those sorts of questions more or less in a way that got me INTP before realizing that I'm definitely an Fi user, not Ti. &gt; Fi
&gt; Maybe roll them in blankets and place them on the couch - not always right to actually let them go out and do things about it, don't want them getting hurt, but let them plan until they are content again and let it go.

:]That I'm just lost in my head when I'm sitting quietly somewhere out of the way.

I mean sure, I do my share of daydreaming. But I remember one time in school—I was in a group project meeting for a senior class (so we had all at least been acquainted before, and they were all extraverts minus me and an ISTJ), and when we were trying to think about the people in our class and how we'd present to them, the rest of my group was amazed that I could name just about everyone in the class, and had at least a vague idea of how we might appeal to most of them. I ended up informing a lot of the presentation because of it.

Granted, I'm not quite "actively" listening when I'm off to the side of the room, but I'm paying attention, and I'm observing people. Just because I'm not saying anything, doesn't mean I'm not engaged in what's going on. :)Thank you. It's kind of hard to say something about it when you feel like the response is just going to be, "quit being so *sensitive*, you little snowflake."I do see ENFJs frequently labelled as "fake," or just Fe in general.

Come to think of it, this sub just *really* doesn't like feeling types sometimes.An insecure Fe user will probably be overly sensitive to perceived social dissonance around them and have an augmented sense of "duty" to rectify it. I've also seen in some ExFJs a feeling of abandonment or betrayal when their friends haven't been in contact.

An insecure Fi user will probably be overly sensitive to criticism or perceived disapproval of their values or interests, and become either withdrawn or defensive about them.

Frankly not sure if I'm on the mark with Fe, but hopefully that makes sense?     Godspeed.

Edit: ah, you've done it. I will cower from afar and watch the fallout.I'm sure OP meant, "I wouldn't want to be treated that way by some hypothetical being superior to humans, so I don't do it to other beings."Oh ok&gt; why would they be more likely to be emotional?

It's not that thinkers are more likely to be "emotional," but rather the idea that, because they tend to ignore emotion, they're less likely to recognize/acknowledge when they've made an "emotional" decision.&gt; people-puzzles

 Why not? Walls of text like that can give a lot of insight to how people think; sometimes just seeing that process tells more than what the person actually writes.

Also, not to sound like I want to reduce you to a bunch of text to be analyzed, but you're questioning your type and seeking insight, which I think kind of invites people to analyze you however they're able.Frankly, I'd probably expect a 14-year-old INTP to write pretty similarly to how you did. And I don't mean to be condescending, but inferior Fe is pretty pronounced throughout this thread.

You seem pretty sure of your self-typing, though, so I'm not sure what we're actually discussing in this thread now?I could never pretend to understand the way you view and think about things, but just wanted to say I appreciate your candor about it all and where it comes from. It's really intriguing to read and compare/contrast between you, myself and others.I don't want to answer based in my own anecdotes, but I had a huge problem with taking compliments growing up. Like, I always felt like I needed to say something like, "thanks, but I'm really not good at ______." I learned in college that it's usually better to just be gracious and say thank you.

But I've always had this weird thing about being talented. To just say it, I'm a relatively talented musician, and I've always been a pretty intuitive thinker, which got me through high school and a lot of college pretty easily. I pick up new things pretty quickly for the most part. But I always felt *bad* for it. Like, I didn't want to make other people feel bad if they weren't as strong at something as I was. I still feel that way, and I don't really know what to do about it, if there really is anything to do about it.

So yeah, maybe if other INFPs can relate, I might throw us out there as a candidate.And even so, it's not like we post about it *proudly*. It's more like we have nowhere else to go with our Fi word vomit, but we at least try to support each other.Not that I don't appreciate concise speaking, but high Ti-types are also very impatient about extraneous info in my experience, so it sounds like opposing "forces" meeting to me.I think it's less perfectionism than it is a pervasive insecurity about how well I'm doing something.Well aren't you just a bundle of joy =]Was raised Catholic, but by the time I was in high school I knew I didn't really want to be part of the organized thing. So I did my own soul/spirit-searching for a while and now just consider myself an atheist who's interested in the different philosophies behind religions.Not necessarily FPs, but NF types are often attracted to each other. I found out a while back that practically all of my close friends and acquaintances that I best get along with, are NF types as well.Also a designer. Your relative sucks./r/outside counts, right? I was really expecting a shitpost here (sry), but this was nice—I like that you highlighted the positives and not just the negatives. :]

As for us INFPs...

&gt;Negative: I'm genuinely unnerved by the amount of "i love all of you" and "infps are awesome" threads vs "i'm a failure", "i'm so lonely", "i'm sad all the time" posts. That kind of polarization makes me worried. I also notice a lot of extreme language that is telling--by extreme, I mean, instead of "sad, mad, bad", you get "heartbroken, enraged, repulsive"--language that is highly emotive.

We're hard on ourselves (but you knew that). And dramatic. Our constant need for external validation is easily what cripples us most.brb sobbing because you are great :']Nailed it.I think from a problem-solving standpoint it's perfectly possible for a high-Ti person to be a great leader. What I've observed in my own experience, though, is that person prioritizing the mental tinkering over the morale of their team, winding up with resentful subordinates, and having no clue why people don't want to listen to them.

Similarly to how, as an INFP, I need to actively keep productivity in mind, a Ti-focused leader needs to actively think about the atmosphere they create within a working environment.Oh god, I've heard some horror stories from professors I had who worked with/around him. He was a brilliant guy - it's  just a shame how he treated a lot of people.This thread will go great.Is it?Our lives are jokes :[You'd need to know *why* a person enjoys the particular music they do.

It felt wrong and dirty at first, but I've learned so much more from it than I ever did staring at a blank document, waiting for inspiration to suddenly appear.No dude, Fi *literally* just means you have a lot of values that are stupid and make no sense because you possess no ability to think rationally.TIL I'm ENTJ. Only I get black iced coffee to match my soul. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Shhh, got a shit reputation to maintainChrist, I start getting anxious when they reach the end of the windowTyped INTP until 16personalities gave me INFP.

I think Fi gets associated too closely with values, which isn't wrong, but I mean everyone has values of some sort. If I recall, you have pretty libertarian values (correct me if I'm wrong), and the way you've talked about them sort of boiled down to "this is what makes sense, and the way you feel about it doesn't change that," which would be very Ti-Fe, as I understand it.

Just my observation, of course. Your posts are just the tip of the iceberg, no doubt.

Edit: also yeah, your enneagram would be pretty atypical for INFP.Isn't this what we do like literally every day in every thread anyway?Pretty often I'm not confident in my ability to make informed/rational decisions, so I'd think that Information Bias is definitely something that applies to me/inferior Te.I grew up being picked on a bit for various things, but I learned to deal with most of it, and avoid what I can't deal with. But now, I'm more inclined to be upset by insensitivity itself (I dunno, maybe like an advocate of sorts). In the way you might be perplexed by how someone could be so sensitive, I don't understand how people could not foresee or care how someone will react to something rude/offensive/inflammatory/whatever.Basically Holden Caulfield meets Tina Belcher.

Edit: to be clear, my inner monologue is a lot like Holden. Outwardly, though, I'm a lot more like Tina and have oddly been told that multiple times.Male INFP - I personally think marriage, while symbolic to many people, is an arbitrary milestone, and that there's no point in waiting if things feel right between all parties. Everyone's different, so I don't feel like there's any point to a specific guideline or milestone in that regard.

I grew up Catholic and came to really dislike it as an institution and decided I was an atheist, though I see the value of religion itself for people who believe in it. But I tend to strongly oppose things dictated by the church, because I don't like the idea of that kind of moral authority.  I've been checking out a lot of different stuff lately looking for that next *thing* for me, but in general, I like a lot of indie/emo/punk type stuff. Melancholy, introspective, aggressive at times, unrefined, etc.

OP, got any recommendations for chillwave-type stuff? I've been recently liking stuff like Washed Out, and Alina Baraz.Question to tack on to this, would someone with inferior Fe conceivably tend to assume the worst about people's intentions? I know a couple of people I suspect to be IxTP, and with them it seems like there is no such thing as an innocent mistake - there is only gross incompetence and malevolent or selfish intent, and so they show little to no patience for the missteps of others.Anger in other people is a HUGE trigger for me, and frankly the only thing I've ever described as a trigger in myself. But when people start raising their voices, or have outbursts, or even just show that they're angry around other people, I don't know what it is, but it flips a switch and I get *intensely* uncomfortable (practically shaking) and want to GTFO as fast as I can.

I do my best to be compassionate, but my respect for people starts to crumble when I see that they can't contain their anger. But I guess I've just always been good at maintaining a facade when I've needed to, so I might have unreasonable expectations - I don't know.I don't know, really! As far back as I can remember, seeing someone get unnecessarily angry has changed my view of them (sometimes temporarily, sometimes more). But I've also always made a point to maintain a cool exterior and put a lot of effort into it, so I guess it's me kind of thinking, "well I'm really emotional and can control it - why can't you?" - however unreasonable that might be in some cases. Related: "you try way too hard."Judge me by a strict set of standards that I don't fit, then call attention to it amidst a large group of people.I'm sure your best friend would appreciate your assessment.Not to oversimplify things, but just exercise thinking about how other people might be feeling in certain situations, or how certain things will affect the group dynamic. You already have a pretty keen sense of your own thoughts and feelings as an Fi-dom; it probably won't be too difficult to develop an ability to read other people in relation to what you know about yourself.

Basically, practice empathy and then act on it when you think you can improve a situation involving other people. Also get an ENFP vibe, considering your remarks on new interests and also social environments. ENFPs also often show introverted tendencies, so it might make sense in your case.Ni, and mostly just because descriptions of it I've seen have basically just liken it to psychic bullshit and whatnot, which it obviously isn't. What's made the most sense to me is the idea that it's concerned with finding the root meaning and cause of things and their implications, but I still have no idea if that's even accurate. Even ELI5 posts I've found haven't really helped.

I've always been pretty sure of my type being INFP, but I've never been quite able to rule out INFJ because I 1) don't understand Ni, and 2) I recently started feeling unsure about whether inferior Te or Se applies more to me, and which is PoLR.Sometimes in this sub I feel like an unwanted foster child that everyone keeps arguing what to do with...Isn't it so convenient that people can just be like, "calm down stop being so sensitive" and continue being pricks?Honestly when I'm playing something like COD it's practically my goal to make someone start getting mad at me over the mic.

But I think you boiled it down well enough already with your comment,

&gt; Not worse, not better, just strange.

A lot of people here are just *not* good at recognizing that, and it's always so glaringly ironic when they call us out for not being "logical" while citing personal anecdotes and shit like that, as though they account for all people of a certain type. (Partly recapping my original comment there for context.)It might have opened the door to some people with beef, but I don't think you were really much a contributor either.No one can tolerate a typo in this thread.I do, and personally, it sometimes creates a lot of stress for me. I'll go to the ends of the Earth to avoid conflict, and I'll obsess over the dumbest things to make sure I'm presenting myself appropriately.

But frankly, it has more to do with how I want to be perceived. I don't want to be seen as aloof or oblivious to people, so I feel an obligation to be play along with social norms and that's always at odds with how I *want* to be. I'll try hard to make decent small talk, exchange pleasantries, be engaged with the group and all that, but it tires me out quickly. And any time I feel like I slipped up and did or said something stupid, it plays back in my head endlessly.

Really, it's an everyday thing as an INFP working in a place with a relatively small professional community. It feels like a constant need to maintain a facade, which I can do, but it's exhausting and stressful, pretty much all the time. But whatever, I guess it's my own choice. Traditionalism: 23%

Liberal Feminism: 73%

Radical Feminism: 64%

Marxist Feminism: 73%

Cultural Feminism: 64%Movies: Drama, thriller, some comedy. Especially love "mind-bending" stuff like Memento, Inception, Eternal Sunshine, Synecdoche, New York, etc.

Books: frankly I don't read enough, but my favorite books are The Catcher in the Rye and The Great Gatsby if that says anything.

Music: rock and indie as broad umbrella terms, but more specifically emo, shoegaze, dream pop, punk, hardcore, etc. If it's any combination of introspective, aggressive, moody, catchy, heavy, or whatever, I'll probably enjoy it. But "introspective" is nearly non-negotiable unless it's instrumental.Changing dom Fi to Ni would mean the inferior has to be Se. If you have that and Te, you then have to have Fi back in play to balance the axes. So then you wind up with INTJ.Word, I think it's very important to acknowledge different types of creativity, not just artistic/expressive creativity. People get down on themselves because they struggle to make art or write music or poetry, but don't realize that they actually have some ingenuity in some other capacity.On the spot and in person, yes. I have a hard time sorting out my thoughts, so I tend to think out loud (or in writing) so the person can at least try to follow my train of thought.

I'm much better at written communication, for sure. My writing just gets dense when I start thinking of all these details and peripheral thoughts that I want to be appreciated.We're infamous overthinkers, and at first we tend to answer typing questions about analytical thinking and rationality without understanding that those generally refer to *impersonal* evaluation. So then we march around thinking we're INTP or INTJ or whatever.

Source: thought I was INTP for like two years One of these days I'm going to A/B test flairs on different accounts to test this.Off the top of my head I feel like Stu and Didi Pickles from Rugrats were INFP and ESFJ, though I could be wrong. Didi may have been ISFJ.&gt; Where I'm from, people are very afraid of making a strong statement or being too assertive.

Dear god, I need to live where you live. I can't stand people who are overly assertive to the point where it seems like they think themselves infallible.
   So as an INFP who thought for a while that they were INTP, I can appreciate the spirit of this post and think it's cool you want to help people get a grasp on this.

But as a designer who deals a bit in UX, dude, ya can't just spit out an ungodly amount of dense, minimally labeled text and expect it to be helpful to someone. Just saying because it seems that a lot of INTPs on this sub love to do that.

And at that, I guess I'm interested in *why* y'all do that. Is it you guys thinking "out loud" to further your own understanding? Is it you trying to get others on the same page as your understanding of the concepts? Not to knock you guys for wanting to dive into a topic in that way, but again it seems like every other day an INTP makes a really dense post with info that was already readily available somewhere else. Good point!Welp I guess that's cool too ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯I'm speaking in an idealistic sense that involves no consequences to people not acting outwardly assertive. Because of course I am.(This sub in a nutshell)"I've never heard of it so it's not really a thing."What falls under "INTP" rock?This is quality content.It's not unusual for an INFP to want to fit in to some degree, especially following the adolescent phase where we're generally trying to forge an identity. For me, it's less about fitting a mold than it is about not wanting to be perceived as someone who willingly goes against the grain in a way that might annoy people (FiNe there, I guess).

&gt;If someone says something about me, for example "oh you're fat" my first reaction is thinking why would they say that.

I personally think this speaks to Fi. Fi is not just about "values," but about the context provided by one's personal motivations. Where an Fe user would probably focus on how that was a hurtful thing to say and it shouldn't have been said (as if in reference to a set of universal "rules"), you're putting weight on what the person meant and why they chose to say it.

I guess I can relate because I've questioned whether I may actually be INFJ because of how much consideration I put into my social surroundings and the way I conduct myself around people, but I've realized that it's really all rooted in the way I want to be perceived, which is definitely a product of Fi.

And also, I wouldn't consider what you described to be "unhealthy." Typically an unhealthy Fi-dom is thought of as stubborn and resistant to reason when it opposes an ideal or belief that they hold to be true, important, etc.I think "This is how YOU made me feel" could be interpreted as Fe in that it could imply a violation of objective "rules" by another individual, whereas the former statement focuses solely on the user's subjective reaction."Healthy" Fi carries a strong sense of self AND is aware of its own subjectivity. You get the classic description of the INFP as an empath because our Ne extrapolates our own feelings and motivations to help us make "educated" guesses as to how others might feel, react, etc. to certain things. At the same time, we have the understanding that, since we know our own motivations are subjective, that those of others could be different, and so we seek to understand others' motivations.

You get "unhealthy" Fi when you can't recognize flaws in your own moral/ethical "logic" and become that stubborn stereotype. Alternatively, because of our Ne showing us how other solutions or beliefs could be right, we get very indecisive and can be prone to  letting others sway or even gaslight us because we feel like we must be wrong. There's also the Fi-Si "loop," in which we might be averse to doing anything new or different because a previous negative experience overshadows what good could happen.I'll have you know that I am *fantastic* at letting very small interactions with strangers turn into regret-ridden obsessions over what I did or said that now seems stupid.  HA. I don't care if the chairs are made of clouds and the ceilings are murals of redwood forests—I would not be caught dead sitting in the center of a room.   We know. Pretty much the first response to anyone here about that test is telling them to study cognitive functions and whatnot instead.Because for me, it's less about the validity of it (not that MBTI in general can *really* be supported empirically) than it is about exploring different interpretations of why people might behave the way they do. Sounds good to me—three weeks is *plenty* of time for something to come up that would require us to postpone/cancel.Pen salesman: are you *sure* you don't need this pen?

INFP: ...shit *fine*, I'll take ten. DAE LOOK AT THIS FEELER SNOWFLAKE????Great contribution!Well shit. Let's all go home guys.If I recall you're also like, 14, right? I know this is like the last thing a teenager wants to be told, but you've got a lot of changing and developing ahead of you. You'll probably do this again at some point. It really fucks me over at work (I'm a designer). My work is decent, but it's always bound to have some random little mistakes that I'd have caught if I could actually be bothered to notice the little things. Do you really think all of those people you're talking about are actually that way every day IRL?Fi in particular is associated with idealism, because for those of us who use it heavily, it gives us a strong sense of what we value, and thus makes us constantly focus on how we think things ought to be. 

And I guess that FiNe is probably a pair that takes things a step further because we extrapolate our idealistic visions constantly, as I understand it.Typical INFP playing the victim like the world's out to get you. Quit being so *sEnSiTiVe*!Oh look *another* fake INFJI do agree with the idea that most people start out with a more rudimentary view that's based on test result stereotypes. But I think in a lot of cases the functional approach just gives people another way to reduce things to basically stereotypical descriptions. I'm talking about the way a lot of people here seem to have reduced Fi to " selfish and has lots of values that they will never budge on", Fe to "spineless and just wants everything to be pleasant," Si to " boring and traditional" and so on.

Basically half the time it feels like "Ti is king, everyone else go fuck yourselves." =/
That's an interesting way to think of it. As an INFP musician myself I think I can relate to it. Like at a certain point when I'm playing guitar, I'm no longer thinking about what I'm doing in terms of technical musicianship, but rather whether it expresses what I want to express. Cool thought!Good thing you're not like the rest of us!As someone who tends to see every possible way something can go right or wrong, it frankly stresses me out to plan every detail of something. I do it when I have to, of course, but I'm most at ease when I have a general plan that's flexible and has a backup or other options. INFP, generally socialist.I used to, but then realized it would keep me thinking. So now it's ambient droning music or a fan. Or both.In general IRL I imagine they're pretty likeable, if not maybe a bit frustrating at times for being very scattered (can relate).

In general on this sub...probably best to just not ask about xNFPs.Your outrage at poorly defined functions is becoming my second favorite meme here behind everybody telling that guy he's not INFP.I'll preface by being *that guy* and saying I don't really believe in "bad" music (especially being that a lot of what I listen to, other people consider "bad").

What I tend to dislike in music is just anything that feels superficial to me. Pop music about having a good time and shit with like ten choruses and the same Melody as everything else (though I'm not of the opinion that pop music can't be "good"). Or music that's overly technical or showy just for the sake of it. Or just really overproduced music where it feels like more thought was put into the sound than the songs themselves (but hey, sometimes that's appropriate).

Basically I start by trying to appreciate  music in its own context. I don't really *react* if I don't like it, but I always have a pretty keen sense of how I feel about music by the end of a song/piece. If I didn't like it, oh well—I'm sure someone else did.Don't sell yourself short—emotional and interpersonal intelligence makes the world go 'round just as much as rationality.I can't really speak to enneagram because I'm not super familiar with it beyond knowing I'm 4w5, but the thing about Fi-dominant folks (particularly INFPs) is that we seek not to impose on others (because we'd hate for that to be done to us), and even more so *hate* confrontation.

It's also not uncommon for us to be self-sacrificing, not necessarily out of pure altruism, but because we feel we haven't done what's expected of us (often inferior Te at play there). So we sometimes end up trying to give people the world because anything less doesn't feel like enough.

So, that could conceivably amount to someone perceiving themselves in a way that would result in them testing as enneagram 9.&gt;So what would happen in case where somebody is doing something a Fi-dom dislikes that involves them, but they don't want to impose on others?

Assuming the Fi-dom is still collected, I think they'd then attempt to get the other person to consider a scenario in which what they've done or said is wrong. When we're trying to persuade, we tend to do so by prompting the person to envision a different perspective. But all of that of course relies on the Fi-dom deciding that the confrontation is worthwhile. We tend to be passive about a lot of things that bother us because we'd find confrontation to be more unpleasant.
 

&gt; How do you usually deal with confrontation? Do you speak up for yourself often or hold back and go along with other people for the sake of avoiding confrontation? Also do you know if there are any differences between why an Fi user hates confrontation vs why an Fe user hates it?

Personally, I tend to avoid direct confrontation until it can't be avoided anymore. But if it's something that affects a group that is my responsibility to maintain (I'm in this situation now and then), I try to help the person see how they're negatively impacting the group, and help them see how they can improve. Even when I do confront someone, I tend not to be direct if I can help it (also depends on the person). I want the person to change of their own volition, ideally, but sometimes they just need to hear it straight.

As for Fi vs. Fe, I think Fi doesn't want to feel like it's overbearing or dictatorial, where Fe wants social harmony (generalized buzzword there, but I dunno how else to explain it). However in my experience Fe tends to be better at actually acting when someone needs to be confronted, because Fe is more attuned to right/wrong and the impact of actions, while Fi tends to be more concerned with the intent of them.

Of course, that's all just my understanding. Others might have things to add or dispute.

Personally, I don't necessarily pretend to agree as much as I express indifference or even openness to whatever it is being presented to me.

Again, can't really speak to enneagram since I'm not that knowledgeable on it. But I imagine what I mentioned isn't exclusive to either?

On intent versus impact, of course we perceive the impact of people's actions, but we're usually inclined to then ask *why* someone did something; maybe there's a good reason why they did something that would otherwise be questionable. I suppose it stems from us viewing morality as relative; we need context to assess those things. And not that others don't do this, and of course we'll draw a line for certain things, but it's just our default way of thinking. Hopefully that makes sense?I think any function could be considered to be of limited use on its own. Classic "not-like-the-rest" INFP baby. :]I think inferior Te makes it easy for us to feel like whatever we do isn't enough, especially when we have the initial realization that as people, we just have a hard time being efficient or productive. It's not always *self-loathing*, but there's certainly a lot of self-doubt amongst us. :/Absolutely. I mean, I can't speak for all of us, but for many I know we spend our childhood with these grandiose dreams of what we want to do and who we want to be. Then as we grow up, I've personally observed that INFPs tend to either wholly reject what they feel others expect of them (the "free spirit" types, I suppose), or begin to feel this immense pressure to do what they feel others expect of them, which leads to the kind of self-doubt and self-loathing you're observing here when they feel they haven't done or can't do it.Personally, I feel it when I feel like I'm losing control. I start doing little things that, in the grand scheme of things, aren't really productive. Anything to make it feel like I'm getting something done. But because I'm not really attuned to thinking in terms of efficiency, the stress just makes me more volatile when someone tries to point out that what I'm doing isn't effective, especially when I already knew that. 

So yeah, I guess the way you put it is one way to describe it.You sound like a whole lot of fun.You sound like a whole lot of fun.Nice reasoningYou could say that about literally any function from some perspective.&lt;3 u ENFJsI feel like INFPs can be prone to confirmation bias. We tend to be highly idealistic and really want our ideals to be validated externally, so it can be easy to just take the first thing that hints at confirmation and run with it.Not necessarily. I think introverts often run the risk of becoming reclusive and antisocial, while extraverts can start feeling dependent on social interaction. But I'm sure it also depends on the person and what's making them "unhealthy."Oh shoot, let's go home guys, theory's invalidated.This is the most ENTP comment I've seen in this sub.So you listen to certain things to influence your mood? That would probably also be consistent with other Si-doms I know, if so.You ask yourself, "now *why* would so-and-so do that? What's their motivation?" and things like that.Same here ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Also wanna add that a lot of times tests don't clearly differentiate between subjective/impersonal "thinking," so the INFP—master of overanalyzing inter/intrapersonal matters—will often affirm those statements about thinking or analyzing, which then spits out INTP as their type.

At least, that's how it was for me, and a lot of folks I've seen post about it.**INFP, so PoLR Se:**

I was on Tinder and came across a girl who I had a handful of mutual friends with. Whenever I see that and I don't know the person, I wonder how they know my friends, so I try to think of all the things those people have in common. Are they all in the same major? Nope. They were in a club with me, but that girl definitely was not. They're all different ages, so they didn't live in the dorms together. Aha! They all go line dancing together every week—that must be how they know each other.

And I was right! But I also could have figured that out just by looking at her first photo, in which she's clearly dressed for line dancing, boots and all, literally standing in the only club in town known for line dancing.

So I guess it's kinda like that.Practically all anybody understands about Fi here is "something something *values*, something something *selfish*." INFP and I'll wait til the god damned sun goes down if I have to.Anecdotal, but my ISTP friend would probably react that way. Ni (or Ti?) doesn't want the irrelevant info, and maybe taking it a step further, inferior Fe takes this scatterbrained chatter as disrespect for their time and they get upset about it.

At least, that'd be my own take on it.Yeeee, am also an INFP who tends to go down Wikipedia rabbit holes. I just love how reading about one thing sheds light on another, and you get more and more of a picture painted of wherever you started (assuming you're reading about related things).I know we've discussed music tastes here plenty, but this time I'm not asking about specific genres so much as the qualities different types might look for, or why they like certain music.

For example, as an INFP I definitely appreciate music with emotional conviction that feels organic. This leads me to a lot of different kinds of music, and also pushes me away from music that I find contrived or too "put together."

One thing I've noticed in high-Se friends is that they tend to demand something definitively big and unique about music—I might even say they prefer more novel music. While I might love a band because their lyrics or demeanor really resonate with me, my Se friends might be disinterested because it sounds there's "nothing special" about the way it sounds.

I've noticed that my Ne-dom friends are all over the place with their tastes, and absolutely refuse to name a favorite genre or artist.

My Ti-dom friends frankly have *weird* tastes. Where I find it tough to listen to some of it that's so outlandish, they seem to like it because it's outside the norm and often very technical. It seems more about what went into making the music than anything else.

So yeah, just some things I've noticed in my extended circle, that I'm interested in seeing if others experience too. Any thoughts or other examples?
Please add an "other" option under sex, or make it fill in!  Or add a separate section for gender and make it clear that sex is referring to biological.Mr Robot is the best
I know an ENTP who has a sort of suffocating presence. (Quick side note: I sometimes see auras around people). He radiates some sort of unpleasant energy that I don't really want to be close to. Fi - Te : What do I want? - What can I do to get it?

Ne - Si: What is possible? - How can I make it happen?

Ti - Fe: What do I think? - What do others think?

Se - Ni : What's happening? - How does it work?

Doesn't describe the functions too well, but that's what came to mind.I am Fi dominant and I find this offensive!

Oh waitTell an INFP that they're annoying. I can tell you, we don't like that.Would a person who prefers Si over Ne have a neater handwriting than a person who prefers Ne over Si? Similarly, could the same thing be said about Ni over Se being neater than Se over Ni?

As an INFP, I prefer Ne over Si and my handwriting is really messy.
Very good content. Thank you for the articles.And I'm going to work on it for a bit before spreading the word around, but if you've stumbled here, that's awesome! Do subscribe if you want to.

Will be working on touching up the CSS a bit, designing a logo for /r/mbti and work on a list of important links.

PS: I'm an INFP myself.Thank you for the high-quality submission, I loved reading what you've discerned about the functions.I read your first two descriptions, then read the third (INFP's, which was written really differently), and had this hunch. Scrolled back up ...and there it was. Written by an INFP. Spot-on ;)In my personal experience, being around "Identity" and "Activity" matches were the most compatible &amp; comfortable for both of us.I'm kind of wary of super-threads. In this particular situation, it won't work the way people intend them to.I don't remember the exact user, sorry. Seeing how it's still "alpha version" means it probably did not get updated after that.Definitely entertaining, love to read them.
Being a male INFP. &gt;female INFP 

That's makes a huge difference though. Either way I hope it goes well for you :) Being a sensitive male isn't exactly a good thing. My biggest problem is that I am absolutely terrible when it comes to dating/relationships with women. I take all of this with a huge grain of salt. This isn't type related. I do think that the cognitive functions are real but they don't tell you much of anything about a person. The stereotyping in Mbti communities are annoying and do more harm than good. Speaking for myself, I will never open up to you or show my vulnerable side unless you do it first. I need to know for sure that I can trust you and you won't be repulsed by it.Thanks friend. 

This isn't true, I day dream all the time. For me it would either be Peter Kropotkin or Noam Chomsky. I just respect them as thinkers in history. I would talk about their ideas. This isn't type related. If someone doesn't want to get over something, then they won't. It has nothing to do with typology. I listen to a lot of death metal where you can't even understand the lyrics, so put me down for the music itself rather than the lyrics. It really depends on the person more so than the type. One ENTJ might appreciate something that another ENTJ might not. You can't really use typology for something like this. If you are looking for inspiration, then I have to ask; what are their hobbies? What sorts of things are they interested in? Why not ask people who have similar interests and hobbies as they do and seek them out for gift ideas? Typology won't tell you anything about that. Oh no, I'm not angry at you. I'm sorry if I came off that way. 

I've just noticed a lot of these sorts of threads come up that try to link so many superficial things to typology which I think misses the point of typology. There was even someone in a Skype group that I'm a part of, and he assumed that I like beer because I'm an Se user. Well no, any type can like beer and there are Se users who don't like beer. 

Of course if you are trying to get a surprise gift for someone you have to make some assumptions (unless of course you ask them which spoils the surprise!) and that's OK. But people with similar tastes are going to be much more helpful in helping you than people with similar cognitive functions. 

Ultimately you said that this is for fun, so I'm likely taking this a bit too seriously. But I have seen quite a few people who do ask these questions and are dead serious, so I hope you can understand my initial reaction. 

Anyway, enjoy your day and good luck on your gift shopping! Oh I love beer ;) 

Looking at the part you quoted, I probably could have explained myself better. I should have said "he assumed that my love of beer was because of me being an Se user". 

Hopefully that clears it up! I hate how bad I am at thinking things through before doing something. I'm too impulsive sometimes. This isn't type related. It's probably just a coincidence then. 

I don't know much about the situation but it sounds like someone doesn't want to own up to the fact that something they did might have been wrong. That has nothing to do with typology. Eh, I'm not all that flirty either.  Mostly due to my own shyness though.  I'm sure if I overcame that then I probably would be. Thanks for the input. 

Can you elaborate on what you mean by "the teeming womb of the unconscious"? DAE intuitive = super smart? It might be an enneagram 4 thing as well. I don't think that this is type related. Depression is a mood disorder that can affect anyone.I just looked it up and it turns out that depression is a mood disorder which is different than a mental illness. Thanks for letting me know.

I still don't think it has anything to do with typology, however. I'm an ISFP and I'm primarily a tactile learner. I learn best from hands on experience. I am somewhat of a visual learner as well. I can relate to this a lot myself. I have a hard time guessing what would happen if I did or didn't do something, so I would rather try it to see what happens. &gt;If anything is boring, it's abstract theories and endless discussions with no practical use.

Agreed!  I'm in an MBTI Skype group and they tend to go on huge ramblings about the philosophical implications of such and such.  I usually just tune those out and if I ever do pay attention I just get all confused.  Like how do you know such and such? 

I take pleasure in every day things (video games, working out, food, death metal, travelling when I can, etc.) because if I didn't then what would I do with myself?  How can you not take pleasure in these sorts of things?  It's not to say that I don't like theories, but I only appreciate them them if there's either a practical use, they're interesting and easy to wrap my head around (most aren't to me), or if they have been empirically verified (ie theory of evolution).Judging by what I've seen, it seems that most people who are into Mbti don't get along with ESFJs.Yes. I appreciate your intent here but being a sensor doesn't necessarily mean that you are practical. I'm an ISFP and I'm one of the least practical people I know.

Also intuitives don't necessarily have a monopoly on being abstract. I would think that the feeling functions (especially Fi) are pretty abstract in their own way. This isn't type related.Using pseudo science to put other people down to make yourself feel good? That's really sad and I feel sorry for you. I honestly don't know why N vs S is always seen as though they're from vastly different worlds as opposed to F vs T, I vs E, or J vs P.  For instance, I've also seen a lot of discussion on INFP vs INFJ with people assuming that they're very similar which they aren't.  INFPs have a LOT more in common with ISFPs than they do INFJs.  Oh woops I responded to the wrong thread! 

My bad, it's still early. I can relate, at least to an extent. 

No matter how hard I try I'm actually very impractical at most things. My work tends to be "messy" irregardless of how clean and accurate I try to be. 

Oh well, I'm sure that I'm good for something somewhere to make up for it. Yeah it's pretty frustrating to hear people use mbti as an excuse for being shitty. I think that the mbti should be used to overcome those weaknesses and to improve ourselvesYes, of course. Anyone can be
This is spot on, and I can totally relate! This isn't type related. This has nothing to do with typology. I don't think that typology should be used at all in relationship pairing. It doesn't tell you enough about a person to see if you are compatible.Sure, we're all human after all. &gt;In my experience it's, xSFPs that struggle with this

This is all very true for me at least. 

It's not so much that I don't think about the future outcomes, it's that I'm not comfortable predicting future outcomes. I seem to have a hard time figuring out what will happen until I've had the raw experience enough times. Only after I've done what I've done can I make a good prediction of the outcomes and be comfortable with it. 

When someone tells me "if you do this, such and such will happen" and I do it anyway, it's not that I think that they're wrong. It's more so that I want to see it for myself. 

Being a sensor doesn't mean that you have no imagination, that you're stupid, or that you can't think deeply.    I've noticed that people tend to try to link pretty much everything to typology, even really superficial stuff. It happens a lot in this sub. I would consider that stretching the theory quite a bit.The biggest thing I learned is that dating and relationships are a total waste of time and being single is fucking awesome Sometimes.

I've gotten along quite well with INFPs and other ISFPs, but the ones that I appreciate tend to be quite mature.  I've noticed that immature ISFPs and INFPs tend to bother me from time to time though.  ISFP here. 

I generally enjoy NYE. Most of the time I have a good time.
Tonight I'm going to hit it up at a pub :) Fi doesn't have much to do with emotions. Imo it sounds like he's the type of person more so to "seize the moment" which is, as far as I'm aware, more indicative of Se than Ne. This is what an ISFP looks like:

https://scontent.fyqr1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/15439803_1359977524020483_2821051612198314945_n.jpg?oh=ce28915eb94dc9962a7f8d7f04ac20a3&amp;oe=58DF9511I'm sorry, but I'm not following youThank you :)In contrast to what you said about FiNe, I don't so much want people to conform to my idea of goodness and virtue, or my values. I want people to think for themselves and build their own understanding of their values and what is right for them. It mostly will not bother me if their conclusions are different from my own because I appreciate different points of view and everyone's autonomy. The only exception is people with extremely terrible values that motivate them to cause serious harm to others.I'm an ISFP. I don't have any talent but I'm kind of a beer snob :PIt's interesting how often people try to defend the sensing functions by making them sound more like intuition. Well for starters your OP is more of a comparison between Ni and Ne than intuition and sensing. 

If sensing was another form of intuition, then why would  there even be a sensing function in the first place? Also wouldn't intuition be another form of sensing? Is thinking the same thing as feeling? Sensing is sensing. 

That said though, the functions do not work alone in a vacuum. Intuition works with sensing and sensing works with intuition. That's why people are Se/Ni or Ne/Si rather than being just Se or just Ne. That might be what you are trying to get at, and if you are then I agree. However, sensing is not the same as intuition.I would argue as far as types go, they tend to be one of the more overrated ones.  No offense or anything, but why are feeling types associated with "emotions"? Feeling is values based decision making, not emotional decision making. I think you do have a good point here.  I do think that feelers tend to be more so concerned with human subjective experience, and emotions do play a part.  It's just more complicated than that. 

In socionics "feeling" is called ethics and I think that is a far better way of naming those functions.  It's a little too easy to summarise feeling as "emotions" imo.

Thinkers can be very emotional too.  I have an INTP brother and when we were growing up he was always more "emotional" than I ever was.  I was seen as the "calm" child XD  

Feeling =/= "emotional".  Everyone's emotional state affects how they make decisions. Feelers just prefer to make decisions based on personal values. In socionics they refer to feeling as ethics, which is a much better description. 

I've known NTs who are far emotional than I am. Why are NT types necessarily more "logical" than ST types? Why are SF types more "illogical" than NF types?  Why are thinkers necessarily more "logical" than feelers?  If anything, the thinking and feeling functions are more "logical" than both sensing and intuition.  

If you want to get into Jung, he described both of the thinking and the feeling functions as the rational ones, but sensing and intuition are the irrational ones.  That's because sensing and intuition just gathers information and stores it in the brain.  How that information is weighed depends on the judging functions ie thinking and feeling. 

And feeling is not as simple as "emotional" reasoning.  LolNice pseudo science I'm an Fi dom and (mostly) vegetarian.

I don't think that lifestyle choices have anything to do with Mbti. The more I read about the functions, the more confused I get! Feelers according to r/mbti anyway. Damn feelers, only able to reason from their emotions and nothing else! Feelers can do that too. Thankfully being a feeler doesn't just mean that you just reason with your emotions.I'm not normally that snarky. 

I think I might need a break from reddit, although knowing me, that wouldn't last very long :PThis is because a lot of people try to oversimplify the cognitive functions. Feeling is a rational function (either introverted or extraverted) that prefers to make decisions based on personal values. In socionics they call feeling "ethics". 

I don't think that anyone ever meant that feeling = emotional reasoning. Everyone has emotions, and they influence how we make our decisions. I've met plenty of emotional thinkers and rather cold/distant feelers.

We also have to keep in mind that feelers have a thinking function too (thinkers have a feeling function as well), and cognition is about preferences. Sorry, you will have to forgive us. You see we can only think with our emotions and logic is impossible for us. Not only that but we're sensors too so we're especially stupid. We just wish we could be as smart as them. Before discovering r/mbti I didn't know that people made decisions based on emotions or logic before. Thankfully I learned that it's as simple as; you either use logic or emotions. I mean it would really suck if cognition was far more complicated and nuanced than that.

Sarcasm aside, a lot of the time I wish to had never got into Mbti. I mean the theory itself is fine even if it is just incredibly simplistic pseudo science. But the communities around it are often pretty bad from my experience. Mine's pretty spot on, except I'm not very artistic.It depends on who they are and what they are talking about.  The same could be said of my interaction with other sensors too.  

BTW OP, how do you know that the ones who are only interested in "small-talk" are sensors?  "DAE sensors are too dumb to have a good conversation with?"Nah you didn't offend me. Sorry for being snarky. 

I just see this sort of thing come up a lot. Some intuitive will post a rant about how "shallow, simple, or stupid" sensors supposedly are and proceed to talk about how "deep" they are. They make it sound like intuitives are the only ones capable of deep thinking, which is completely ludicrous. I'm not sure if they realize how condescending that sounds. If they do then they obviously don't care. That said, it doesn't sound like you're like that, so thanks for clarifying your point. 

I'm not really the type to have "deep" conversations because I'm more of a listener, and not very talkative in general. This means that I also don't have "small talk" either simply because I never seem to know what to add to the conversation. I'm not sure what this says about my type (people often say that ISFPs aren't very wordy), but I just suck with words :PNo I don't think so. The culture you grow up in only changes how you use the functions. 

Belgium for example is considered a pretty "introverted country" compared to a place like the United States. That does not necessarily mean that there are more introverts in Belgium (although there could be), it probably just means that the extraverts are less likely to engage in small talk unlike in the US where it's more common. You mean to tell me that there's more to feelers than just reasoning by emotions????? :o*Gives round of applause*This is part of the problem. If an Fi dom has something to say about something, they automatically are taking it personally and are "too sensitive". In that case I would agree with you I think. Stereotypes come from some semblance of truth for sure, and there are Fi doms who are like that. But I don't think that it's fair how quickly some people are to paint the picture that all Fi doms are like that. That said, in my humble opinion, I think that SJs probably are stereotyped the worst in mbti communities. 

I imagine that most people who respond will be astounding geniuses! Just a friendly reminder that being a feeler =/= emotional reasoning. 

No type is best for a mix of rationality and emotions. People of all types can be varying degrees of "rational" and "emotional"
Ti isn't what makes people logical, and Fi isn't what makes people emotional though. I was in love once. Let me tell you that you are not missing much. Relationships, romance, and love are extremely overrated in our culture. When you are in love with someone, they have the power to easily break your heart and leave you to be more depressed than you can imagine. 

Being single is great because you are able to focus on keeping yourself happy and healthy. I would agree with this, although in my case, I would add a bit of paranoia.  I start to think that everyone is out to get me.  It's kind of sad really :/Honestly, I like both black coffee and tea.  My favourite tea right now is Earl Grey (no cream or sugar).  I wonder how exaggerated Welcome to the NHK is? Either way I think that the main character (I can't remember his name) is a great example of a very unhealthy ISFP. ISFPs can zone out, and be absorbed in thoughts just as much as INFPs can, whether they have ADD or not.  I don't think that zoning out is related to the Ne as much as it is the Fi (and possibly tertiary Si or Ni).  

Keep in mind that the auxiliary function only exists to feed the dominant function.  So the way that INFPs and ISFPs approach the outer world can be very different, but their inner worlds will be much the same.  Honestly, I think my life will always involve some sort of long self discovery type of thing.  As much as I do know myself, there is so much that I still don't know.  Although that might apply to everyone, not just me or other Fi doms.  This isn't an "ENFJ" thing. Just because you know someone who is like this and you think she's an ENFJ doesn't mean that all ENFJs are going to be like this, or that it's related to mbti at all. OK but this does not sound like it's related to mbti at all. She just sounds like someone who really wants to be part of the group for whatever reason, and possibly a bit clingy because she might be a little immature. It's really hard to say why she is like that without hearing her side of the story so I'm going to leave it at that. 

But no, this is not an "ENFJ thing". I'm a single ISFP who is not an artist or a musician. Hmm... Well I'm the long haired guy who sits at the pub by myself trying all the odd craft beers. You can find me there. I'm not much of a talker. It's not just because I'm shy, but I often find that I don't really have anything meaningful to contribute to the conversation. Yeah that makes sense. I honestly can't believe that I thought I was an INFP for so long! What really did it was the fact that my understanding of Se was pretty bad.  Although to be fair, there is a lot of bad information out there.It entirely depends on the person I'm talking to. Not really. 

For instance I've met some INTJs that were incredibly intelligent, and a lot of fun to talk to. I've met other INTJs who were completely arrogant and not worth my time. I've met some fellow ISFPs that I really clicked with, and some others who I found incredibly exhausting to be around. 

I guess if there is a pattern chances are that I'm going to have an easier talking to someone who is mature and has a solid head on their shoulders. But that is not type related.

Edit: It also depends on what we're talking about too. If it's something that I can add to the conversation with, then it will be easier for me than if it's a topic that I know nothing about. 

There's just too many things involved when it comes to conversation and I think that deciding by type is too much of an oversimplification. How can you type someone based on looks? &gt;If we say that you tend to avoid those with an unhealthy judging function, would that be an oversimplification? 

No, I think that's a pretty good way of putting it. If someone has an unhealthy judging function, then they themselves are likely unhealthy. I'm an Fi dom, so hopefully this will help you.

Generally when it comes to making decisions I tend to think "If someone were to do this thing to me, how would I feel?"  "Would I like it if someone were to do this to me?".  I've also noticed that sometimes I will meet someone who I think is really cool, or does something really awesome and I will want to adopt that as part of myself.  For example,  I know someone at work who is very quiet, humble, keeps to herself, etc. and when I see her I often think to myself "I should be more like that, because I like those traits in her".  So I tend to 

I'm not sure if this is related to Fi, or Fe but that's how I am anyway.9w1Possibly? 

I don't know too much about enneagram, but from what I gather 9s seek peace and harmony in their environment. So I suppose in a way that might motivate me to be like that. This has nothing to do with type. Neither of them are better.  It depends on the individual actor.  MBTI isn't about ability.  This has nothing to do with type.  Although more edge lords would probably claim to be INTJs because it's suposedly the "smart" type.  Because the functions aren't about behavior. They are about how someone prefers to gather information and how they make decisions. A person of any type can be an edge lord. The problem is when people get into typology and try to use the functions to explain behaviour, it all just becomes speculation.  If you try hard enough you can justify how any function combination can come to any conclusion.  

I agree that there are some correlations between certain types and certain behaviours but that doesn't say much.   Just because there's a correlation, doesn't mean that typology explains much of anything.  People's personalities are far more complicated and diverse than just 16 different types.  You have to look at so many factors.   &gt;ISFPs are more concise verbally, INFPs ramble more (like you said, exceptions, but still). 

In my opinion this is the most obvious difference between INFPs and ISFPs.  It's not that ISFPs aren't thinking as deeply as INFPs or anything like that, it's because Se isn't very "wordy" where as Ne really is.  I think that might be why INFPs get a reputation for being great writers, they have a way with words that ISFPs tend not to.  I think of Ne as "I will explain this to you beautifully using metaphors and I will make it sound really awesome" while Se is more "I'll just show you and let it speak for itself".    I generally shy away from using typology to talk about relationship compatibility. I think that a relationship between any two types can work, and a relationship between any two types can fail. It all depends on what you are looking for in a partner. This is very common for us ISFPs 

"...... "Honestly I think that the socionics theory of duality is kind of bunk. I mean, I get what they're trying to do, and in theory it sort of makes sense. But how is that going to apply to reality? Relationships are not something you can go into and be 100% logical with. It's not as though we can always choose who we fall in love with, it's something that often sort of happens. Just because someone is an Fi dom, it doesn't mean that they will necessarily be attracted to Te doms and vice versa.ISFPs are not very wordy, generally speaking.I wouldn't be surprised if many of those intuitives were sensors. But a lot of people dislike sensors in mbti communities for whatever reason, so that's probably why there are so many mistypes. That and everyone wants to be an INTx type because they're supposedly the "smart" types. How's the weather up there on your high horse? OK but I've met people like that who were various types. I can think of one that was ENFP and another being ISTP. I can't say that I have ever met an ENTJ who was like that. In fact some ENTJs I've known couldn't stand me and needless to say, we didn't get along. They're not all like that, most ENTJs I know personally are OK, but I have never felt any strong attraction to any one of them. 

I try to keep an open mind and give the benefit of the doubt to anybody I meet really. Typology doesn't really come into the picture with that. I'm not an expert on this, but it sounds like you would be better off looking into the enneagram to answer your questions. The cognitive functions are mostly just about how you reason, but enneagram tends to deal with motivations and fears.

Wanting inner peace seems like a type 9 thing so it would not be a bad idea to start there. I don't know what a meme is because I don't use the Internet for anything other than Facebook because I'm just a dumb sensor :(That's because all the MBTI descriptions try to make every type seem awesome in every way.  That's to make it extremely marketable and so that people will spend money on it.  

Ignore the descriptions, and look at understanding the cognitive functions and you'll get a better grasp on what it means to be an INFJ, or whatever type you're curious about. It depends on the ENTJ and the ENFP, and what they're looking to get out of the relationship. This is very well thought out and explained.  I don't think they meant to imply that all ISFPs are "goth" or that all goths are ISFPs.  I think they were just trying to use that as an example to show how ISFPs like you to use physical/tangible things as a method of expressing their values.  When will people learn? Yeah, you do have a point there.  Maybe they will respond to this thread and elaborate.  I think the problem comes into when people try to describe types as "tending to do.... such and such" but you'll always have exceptions, and when people can't relate to these statements they'll get confused.  For instance, ISFPs get a huge reputation for being "artists" because that's how they tend to express themselves, but I'm not an artist myself so I had a hard time accepting that I was an ISFP.

I was kind of goth when I was a teenager, but I grew out of that in late high school because I got into metal.  I'm now in my 30's and I'm still metal haha XDThe people who push those stereotypes are just r/iamverysmart types who like to feel superior to others on the Internet.  It's best to just ignore them. What exactly is your point? Everyone wants to be an NT, because they're the only ones who can be smart and use logic /s&gt;Typical ISFP who can't understand the big picture... 

Now that actually sounds more like something that you would find on r/iamverysmart :POh I didn't realize that you were joking, my bad. It's just really hard to tell with text, especially since people are often serious when they say things like that. I would say that thinkers tend to feel more comfortable making decisions by stepping outside of the situation and evaluating the circumstances based on the impersonal, objective data. It seems to me that their goal is to be clear and concise. &gt;name a "dumb" type. 

The sensors of course! I wonder if there was a time where someone was dating someone else, but broke up with them because they were a certain MBTI type.Person - "Hey, it's nice to meet you tonight, you look great!"

Their Date - "Hi, it's great to meet you, how are you today?"

Person - "I'm doing well, let's order some food"

*Time passes by, and they finish their meals*

Their Date - "Thanks for the dinner, it was really nice.  Is there anything you'd like to do now?"

Person - "Have you ever taken the Myers Briggs Test?"

Their Date - "No I've never heard of it."

Person - "It's just a personality test.  Here, I'll lend you my phone and you should take it just for fun"

Their Date - "Uhh.. OK"

*Their Date finishes the test*

Their Date - "OK, it says I'm an 'ESFJ' what does that mean?"

Person - "It means that I can't be seen with you. You see, I only date NT types because I need to have an intelligent conversation with my partner.  You're an ESFJ so that means that you're probably overly emotional and pretty dumb too.  So this will never work out"

*Person gets up and leaves without paying the bill*

- Too many people try to link superficial things to typology.
- Way too much INTx worship.  
- Way too much generalising
- I don't see very many discussions that go into good detail over the functions, most things are oversimplified


I'm an ISFP and I'm not "artistic, competitive" or a "thrill seeker". I don't relate to most interpretations of Se. 

Other than that I think ISFP fits. I'm laid back and people often tell me that I'm "chill". I suck at expressing myself with words and I'm pretty impulsive sometimes. I don't understand it either. It seems like a lot of people are interested in having "deep" conversations and they often associate NTs with that (and NFs to a certain extent). Well having "deep" conversations is not exclusively an intuition thing. And even if it was I still don't see the appeal. What use is there in talking about philosophy and other "abstract" things anyway? Sure those kinds of things can be interesting and insightful, but they're not all there is to having a good social life. A lot of people make it seem like having a social life is pointless unless you have "deep" conversations. They don't sound interested in connecting with people because of their smug arrogance. They make it sound like they're somehow above talking about "normal" things. I probably didn't explain myself in the best way. What I have a problem with is the smug arrogance that comes from people who say that they are only interested in "deep" conversations. 

That said, I agree with you here. Sure yeah, if that's what it takes to make you feel good about yourself. Ah good. I'm not always the best at explaining myself :PYeah I don't think that any type is immune to that kind of attitude and I don't think that all NTs are like that. It just seems to be mostly NTs who push the attitude. There are exceptions of course. 

I find socializing too much to be exhausting as well. It's not because I think that people are stupid, it's because I get overwhelmed easily, and I'm kind of awkward so it's easy for me to feel self conscious. I often feel like I have nothing to offer to the conversation and it takes a lot out of me when I try to force it. Sometimes I don't even understand why I do the things I do :/It's because some types get a lot more love than others. It's hard for some people to identify with a type that gets little information and is presented as mediocre. ISFP

The problem with over relying on stereotypes is that it leads to oversimplification. I don't think that it's a problem with "muh feelz". I don't think that it's bigoted to say that INFPs like to day dream, or that ESTPs are always be thrill seekers. It's just not accurate 100% of the time. 

The truth is that I think that it's extremely difficult to type someone who isn't yourself. Questionnaires and tests just point you in a certain direction, not give you all the answers. Typing yourself accurately can take literally years to do. You should be patient, read a lot, and ask lots of questions. Other people's opinions are not always helpful.Thanks for this, it's very well thought out and explained. Please ignore my flair :)

&gt;It's your friends' birthday! Are you the kind of person to organise a surprise party?

I wouldn't be the one who would come up with the idea or anything, although I wouldn't mind helping out.

&gt;Would you go to a concert abroad just because you like the band and wanna go more often?

I not only would do this, I have done this.  If anything, I need to do this more often.

&gt;Do you enjoy lots of meetups with friends?

Not lots.  I enjoy good nights out with my friends, but I can only do it so often until I feel exhausted.

&gt;What about art?

I'm not an artist myself, but I think that art is extremely important in our lives.  I wouldn't want to live in a world without it.

&gt;Do you use a planner?

No

&gt;would you step in a train right now for a last minute dinner at the other side of the counry?

No, because I live in a pretty big country, so it would probably take a week to get there :P  

&gt;Do and think or think and do?

Do and think.  I find that I often jump into things, without fully thinking things through.  It's gotten me into trouble before.

&gt;Hobby?

Metal, beer, travelling, video games.I don't think that's what Si is. 

Si users essentially have a store house of their own subjective impressions of what things are. When they are perceiving the world they make a comparison of what they see, hear, smell, etc to these impressions and see what fits or doesn't fit. I think that strong Si users will have a keen eye for detail because of this. 

I should note that they won't necessarily reject things that don't match they are accustomed to, but they will be quick to notice. I would imagine that a healthy and intelligent Si user would want to understand why things don't match, which can motivate them to make a pretty solid analysis. Thank you :) The thing about this is that it's really hard to tell what his sensing preference is. We have to keep in mind that everyone uses the 5 senses to bring in information, but the functions explain how that information is processed cognitively. Anyone can believe in weird shit and want it impacted on others.  I think this has more to do with mental health levels or disorders than typology.Metal is just so awesome, that it must be because of that! 

I fixed my typo :PI can relate to mine for the most part (though I'm not artistic), but I feel like it could apply to enneagram 9s more so even though it would still be an oversimplification.I'm also ISFP and think I agree with you. 

Honestly I don't understand why someone would want to overthink everything. I find that if I overthink things (especially things that I enjoy) it kind of takes some of the fun out of them. I mean yes I know a lot about my hobbies and such, but I'd rather just do them than think about them. In fact if I am overthinking then I know something is up with me. 

For example if someone asks me why I love metal so much my answer is that it sounds good, and I feel good when I listen to it. That's all the reason I need.Hmm maybe I didn't explain myself well. 

I know some people who absolutely love to detach and analyze everything. They have to know how, and why for so many things. They will spend more time thinking about why they enjoy something rather than just enjoying it. 

I suppose it all depends on what is meant by overthinking. Overthinking because of anxiety is something else entirely, and I don't think that anyone has control over that. Why would our 6th function be stronger than our second function? But I always thought that the auxiliary function is what essentially "feeds" the dominant function? Also, following the logic behind this, shouldn't our 5th function be stronger? I'm not religious or anything but I don't have anything against religion or people who practice it. Great description of what Si is :) This really isn't related to MBTI, probably more so enneagram.  Type 9s come to mind, especially Self-Preservation type 9s.  I also disagree that it's Si doms :) How do you feel about the biases that exist with MBTI circles? There's no doubt that some types are more favorable than others and I think that part of that comes from a lot of resources spending more time on certain types (basically INxx) types than on others (SJs for example). 

Why do you think this happens? I'm pretty fidgety and I'm a tactile learner, but that's just me. I don't think that it has anything to do with typology. It's pretty sad when the first 3 questions of your faq has to address all of the negative stereotypes before actually getting into what an ISFJ is. Why do people think so lowly of ISFJs?

Anyway I think that this is a great thing to have. Perhaps r/isfp should look into getting something like this going :) I feel like such a thing would only reinforce stereotypes.  I'm with you on this. I can't stand being told that I have to do something, and bossy people annoy the shit out of me in general. ISFP - Everything happens for a reason, but not in a cheesy "God has a plan for everyone" way. Everything happens for a reason because I think that there is a rational explanation for everything. We just don't always know what that is. No, I don't believe in God. The "God has a plan for everyone" quote was just an expression. People of all types use the Internet.  Especially younger people.  I don't think that the majority of them are INxx types.Can we not do this?  Whenever this happens, it just seems to promote ego masturbation.  MBTI doesn't measure intelligence.This has nothing to do with type. This would be almost impossible to tell because everyone spends different amounts of time thinking about stuff.Correlation =/= Causation. Besides, to assume that every single ESTP is sexual is pretty irrational.I keep hearing about this supposed disconnect but I have no problems talking to my intuitive friends. In fact we often find meaning in the same things. I'm an ISFP and I don't like any type more than any other. Sorry, it's just that there is way more to someone's personality than their mbti, so it's pretty much impossible to pick a favourite or least favourite type. It all depends on the individual of the type. ISFP here. 

I think that it's very easy for us to mistype, especially as INFPs. I think that this is because there isn't a lot of good information about ISFPs. It's either something to the effect of "they're sensitive people who paint pretty pictures" or something about how we're like INFPs but more attuned to reality (which I don't think is necessarily true). We tend to be pretty hard on ourselves though :/

That said, r/isfp is mostly dead anyway :PSure yeah, I would like to hear your 2 cents.I am pretty sure that I'm not an INFP though. 

Here's the thing about the whole "abstract" stuff. Fi is pretty freaking abstract in itself. In fact I would even argue that as a function, it's probably one of the most abstract of them all (especially compared to the other judging functions). When Jung talked about Fi he made the "still waters run deep" analogy.

In an ISFP their Se only feeds their dominant Fi. So ISFPs are often "dreamy, imaginative, and abstract" despite the fact that they're sensors. They are just as attuned to their inner world of values, passions, etc as INFPs are. The way they go about expressing their values is where the key difference is. I like your distinctions here and I agree for the most part. However, I'm sorry to say, but there was one thing that stood out to me. 

Se certainly looks at "what is" but I don't think that it's immune to looking for opportunities or possibilities. Se is exploratory, it looks for opportunities "in the moment" which means that it too is possibilities oriented. I would think that Se might look at colours in your Ne example and might think of those ideas as well. I think the difference is that Se won't be conceptual where as Ne will be. 

For instance let's assume that an ISFP and an INFP are working on a piece of art. The INFP will most likely want their piece of art to convey some sort of meaning. They are probably less likely to worry about the colours and more likely to worry about their art conveying a specific message. They will likely also love to explain the deeper meaning and how they came about it. The ISFP on the other hand is not as likely to do that, but they are more likely to improvise with colours and come up with a creation based on that. They would rather let the art speak for itself. They might just say that their art doesn't have a deeper meaning, but they created it based on how they felt at the time. In short, for the ISFP it's more so about the piece of art itself, where as for the INFP, it's more so about the message behind the piece of art. 

Anyway I hope that what I said made sense, and hopefully I didn't miss your point.Holy lick, can I ever relate to this one!I would argue that any enneagram type with a social instinctual variant as their top one will care the most.
It's partly why I mistyped as one for as long as I did. While we're on the subject, can we please stop trying to link superficial interests to type? TFW you're an ISFP metal head... I'm pretty guarded around everyone. I'm not sure if it's because I'm an ISFP or if it's because I'm super cautious after being betrayed/taken advantage of so many times This is amazing! What I love about your analysis was the sensor vs intuitive aspect. The biggest reason why I had a hard time accepting that I was an ISFP and not an INFP was because people often describe ISFPs as "like INFPs but more practical". I'm actually one of the least practical people I know and I am glad that you touched on this. I would even argue that xSFPs are probably among the least practical of all the types. I would describe xSFPs as more so hedonistic rather than practical. 

As for the confrontational part, I think that enneagram can make this confusing. As far as I'm aware enneagram 9s (such as my self) tend to hate conflict and would rather avoid it if at all possible. 9s are common among INFPs and ISFPs so I really think that will come into play. For instance, I would think that an INFP 4 might handle conflict better/be more confrontational than an ISFP 9. Likewise, I would think that an ISFP 4 might be more confrontational and handle conflict a bit better than an INFP 9.It's common among enneagram 9sThinkers are just as capable to use emotional reasoning as feelers.  Everyone has emotions (except for maybe psychopaths?) and we can all be influenced by them.  "I don't know what your type is, other than some sort of Fi anomaly"

I've heard that one quite a few times :PNot really&gt;INxx are my favourite types 

Said pretty much everyone involved in MBTI communities. 

I'm not sure how insightful the conversations would be. It would probably be a "DAE INxx types are super smart, special, and are da best" circle jerk. Sort of like most MBTI forums. Feelers don't make decisions based on emotions. Feeling refers to interpersonal reasoning. So do thinkersr/shittymbti is over here So am I I honestly think that the "SJW" crowd is largely exaggerated. I mean, sure they probably exist but I rarely ever encounter them. I think it's more likely that people (particularly right wingers) are quick to throw the "SJW" label on anyone who shows concern for social issues. For instance, I was called an SJW for saying that radical jihadist terrorism has more to do with US foreign policy than it has to do with Islam. I don't think that there's a causal relationship between the types and someone's politics. Yeah, exactly. 

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the people who make those arguments are just following a trend and trying to be edgy. When I was a teenager/in my early 20s I was immature and did things like that. 

I remember back in the early/mid 2000s when hating emo kids was popular, sort of like how hating "SJWs" is popular now. In a few more years I wouldn't be surprised if everyone forgets about "SJWs" and starts hating on something else. 

Anyway, sorry for rambling :P&gt;Of course, an ESTJ can be a progressive and family, culture etc are huge formative factors but I maintain SJs default mode of thinking is quite conservative, not just politically. 

I hear this about SJs a lot and of course there might be a lot of truth to this. But what I find interesting is that my ESTJ ex wasn't like this at all. She even at one point agreed that capitalism sucks and that she would support a workers revolution. She grew up with a conservative family and it was interesting watching her argue with her family about social issues (legal marijuana, universal healthcare, etc).

I'm not using this as an argument against you, but I just found it interesting. Because the functions are about how you come to decisions, not what decisions you make. 

Would you mind elaborating then? &gt;Crudely, function theory suggests people have fundamentally different modes of perception and evaluation of given information (be it sensory or abstract). If we start taking the specifics of function dynamics into account, this is where causality necessarily begins to step in. Someone who prioritizes Ti, as shown literally in the graph above, is significantly less likely to ascribe decisional value to conventional morals and ethics. (Most of Haidt's research is about this, specifically stressing how crucial this is in determining an individual's belief systems based on similar personality metrics to the one above).

This doesn't really suggest causality though.  All it shows is a trend, or rather a correlation.  There's nothing demonstrating that they're that way **because** of having Ti.  I agree it would be fair to assume that a Ti user is not likely to ascribe decisional value to conventional morals and ethics, based on the data presented.  But that's just a trend. 

I also wonder how this information is gathered?  I tend to take most statistics involving MBTI with a grain of salt, considering they usually get their information from people who have taken the tests.  Testing is incredibly flawed.

&gt;Now consider the graph again. Taking the stereotypes of the respective judging functions into account, does it not pan out in a fairly predictable manner? Given an even proportion of all types, do you really expect to find no statistical trends in data measuring political/ideological/religious affiliations? What would be the cause of these trends? A difference in their respective modes of perception and evaluation perhaps? There is the causality

I would say it's not a causality.  Basically what you're doing is looking at the data, noticing a trend, and concluding that the trend is because of  the functions alone.  You're not taking into account personal values, socioeconomic status, etc which are always going to influence people's values and politics.  In other words, it's incomplete and I don't think we can draw conclusively that there is a causal relationship between the functions and politics.



 

So is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYLsjJ8RThQ&gt;What would happen if a person as both Te and Fe functions? How would they decide.

They would explode

&gt;On the flipside, what would happen if they have both Ti and Fi functions?

They would implode

In all seriousness, some people argue that everyone uses all 8 functions, but in different orders.  No, you should check in with a psychologist ASAP :P

People tend to associate day dreaming with NFs (especially INFPs), but I don't think that it's exclusive to them. I wander off in my head all the time, usually when there's nothing interesting happening in the here and now. &gt;but I'm not sure if they really translate to function wise perspective

I think that the reason why is because the functions are not so much about behaviour, but about cognition. FWIW I score rather high on openess to experience and very high on agreeableness as well. I even relate to the INFP description by Keirsey, but I think it's because these seem to be more interested in behaviour and not the cognition behind it. Another one (it's not technically anime) is Avatar The Last Airbender.  Everyone says that Aang is an ENFP where as I thought it was really obvious that he's ESFP.  His Se and his inferior Ni really stood out to me throughout the whole series.  

I think that people are quick to assign "N" to too many characters.

&gt;People need to understand that "Ne" IN REAL LIFE, has a PAINFULLY OBVIOUS, day dreaming/unawareness of surrounding vibe to them. MOST main characters of movies and anime DO NOT have this.

Even then, day dreaming/unawareness of surroundings is not exclusive to Ne.  FWIW I used to be a huge anime nerd. I love music and travelling and I have zero interest in sports. Of course. Everyone wants to be INFJ because they're rare special snowflakes. That and ISFPs (and all S types) don't know how to use the Internet, except for maybe Facebook.  Lol This sounds like something that would likely be more common among feeler types than thinker types. But that's just my guess, as any type might be into songwriting. I got this one too :) 

God damn I love the Persona games! That test was actually kinda fun. &gt;Anyone playing P5? 

Definitely! RIP my free time Why do so many people type Aang as ENFP?  I thought his dominant Se was really obvious, as well as his inferior Ni.  I think that he's an ENTJ. I'm not super confident in it, but I never got the impression that he used Ne (or Fe for that matter). He often does seem to have "hunches" about things (like the first episode where they meet Jet), and that suggests Ni rather than Ne. He also seems to stress efficiency and planning (remember his master schedule in season 3?) and wants to take up the leadership role. That suggests Te to me, but I could be wrong here. 

Now, King Bumi is ENTP for sure!ESFPs are very often zany and fun too. Hmm I disagree.

Let's take a look at what Ne is:

&gt;Extraverted Intuition (Ne) deals with experiencing the outer world, noticing possibilities, and what could be. Ne deals with seeing how all things in life are interrelated, and allows the user to see the world in multiple different perspectives.

&gt;The two primary users of Extraverted Intuition (Ne) are the ENFP and ENTP. They have extraverted intuition as their first main function. The INTP and INFP have Extraverted Intuition as their secondary function.

&gt;Extraverted Intuition is always seeing possibilities. They always want to know “what could be”. They are adept at understanding the external environment, but they always want to take it one step further. They wonder, “if I change this, what will happen?”

Where does Aang do this in the show?  I would argue that this is one thing that he struggles with.  Remember the episode where he does King Bumi's puzzles?  It takes him quite a while to figure out that "things aren't always what they seem", because he's too focused on the tangible details that are in front of him.  Of course he eventually solves the puzzles, but his natural inclination is to look at them at face value.  If he was Ne dominant, I don't think he would have struggled as much as he did.  Of course this is just one example, but I hope I made sense.

Now let's take a look at Se:

&gt;Extraverted Sensing deals primarily with experiencing and perceiving the outside world in the present moment. Extraverted Sensors see, feel, touch, smell, and listen to everything that is going on in the external world. They are constantly taking in new experiences and sizing up the situations of the world around them

&gt;The primary users of Extraverted Sensing are the ESTP and ESFP. The ISFP and ISTP also have this as their secondary function.

&gt;Extraverted Sensors live in the present. They thrive on new and exciting experiences. They are typically athletic and like to display their talents to the world. They also have a keen eye for aesthetics and have an enjoyment for “the finer things in life.”

&gt;They enjoy exotic trips, fine dining, and adrenaline packed experiences. They Se user may find themselves bored with routines and feel the need to do something that makes them feel more free and alive. Extraverted Sensors also tend to be the life of the party. They enjoy fun get togethers and try to make sure everyone is having a good time.

That sounds a lot more like Aang to me.  Aang is a pretty huge adrenaline junkie (going penguin sledding, riding the unagi, etc.) and he knows how to have a good time.  Remember the episode where he has a dance party for the students in the fire nation?  Remember when he just joined the school, just because he felt like it at the time?  Heck, he even ran away from the air temple just to go penguin sledding.  He just acted without considering anything, which is something that Se users (especially Se doms) tend to do.  He's too busy living in the moment to stop and explore conceptual ideas, which Ne users are known for.    I take it with a grain of salt.  Most of those statistics come from people taking the tests, and as we all should know, testing is not a very good way to nail down your type.I think that a big part of it is that a lot of people tend to mistype as INTJs and INTPs as well because of how glorified they are in MBTI communities. A lot of people who get into MBTI seem to see those types as somehow the most intellectually superior (along with INFJs), so who wouldn't want to be the smartest type? 

I'm sure that a lot of INxx types are probably more into MBTI, but I seriously question how many people are actually these types. I know I've said this before, but.... 

Aang from Avatar the Last Airbender is not an ENFP, but he's an ESFP. Yes, he's wild and "zany" but that's not exclusive to ENFPs. His Se is all over the place, not to mention he struggles with inferior Ni on top of that. For starters, I wasn't the one who downvoted you.

But for Aang, he does have a championing persona.  But this is simply because he's the Avatar, he has to be that way.  It's like his responsibility.  But I'm going to copy/paste my argument for him being ESFP, as I discussed this with someone else a few days ago:

Let's take a look at what Ne is:

&gt;Extraverted Intuition (Ne) deals with experiencing the outer world, noticing possibilities, and what could be. Ne deals with seeing how all things in life are interrelated, and allows the user to see the world in multiple different perspectives.

&gt;The two primary users of Extraverted Intuition (Ne) are the ENFP and ENTP. They have extraverted intuition as their first main function. The INTP and INFP have Extraverted Intuition as their secondary function.

&gt;Extraverted Intuition is always seeing possibilities. They always want to know “what could be”. They are adept at understanding the external environment, but they always want to take it one step further. They wonder, “if I change this, what will happen?”

Where does Aang do this in the show? I would argue that this is one thing that he struggles with. Remember the episode where he does King Bumi's puzzles? It takes him quite a while to figure out that "things aren't always what they seem", because he's too focused on the tangible details that are in front of him. Of course he eventually solves the puzzles, but his natural inclination is to look at them at face value. If he was Ne dominant, I don't think he would have struggled as much as he did. Of course this is just one example, but I hope I made sense.

Now let's take a look at Se:

&gt;Extraverted Sensing deals primarily with experiencing and perceiving the outside world in the present moment. Extraverted Sensors see, feel, touch, smell, and listen to everything that is going on in the external world. They are constantly taking in new experiences and sizing up the situations of the world around them

They Se user may find themselves bored with routines and feel the need to do something that makes them feel more free and alive. Extraverted Sensors also tend to be the life of the party. They enjoy fun get togethers and try to make sure everyone is having a good time.

That sounds a lot more like Aang to me. Aang is a pretty huge adrenaline junkie (going penguin sledding, riding the unagi, etc.) and he knows how to have a good time. Remember the episode where he has a dance party for the students in the fire nation? Remember when he just joined the school, just because he felt like it at the time? Heck, he even ran away from the air temple just to go penguin sledding. He just acted without considering anything, which is something that Se users (especially Se doms) tend to do. He's too busy living in the moment to stop and explore conceptual ideas, which Ne users are known for.

As for Michael Pierce, I don't really agree with a lot of his typings here.  I don't think Sokka shows Ne enough to be considered an ENTP (I learn towards ENTJ for him, as he shows a lot more Ni throughout the show), I always thought Zuko was ISFP (but a really unhealthy enneagram 6 ISFP), and I'm not sure what Iroh's type is but I never would have guessed ESFJ.  I was leaning xSFP for him personally, although most people type him as some sort of NF.  

&gt;Ne users just think about stuff all the time, bored to actually do it. The part about Avatar being that way, that doesn't change his personality and is the biggest point. That very much sums up ENFP. For a show to be attractive to viewers, you wouldn't show an Ne dominant just pacing about back and forth with ideas.

They actually did a great job showcasing an Ne dom with King Bumi. He doesn't just "think" about things, he plays a critical role in the show.  He's not a major character, sure, but he was interesting enough for the show. 

&gt;They want to interact with the world but not like Se does. **Se doesn't have a deep goal, just living in the height of physicality.** Ne-Fi has a much more nuance to it, with Avatar pushing against the forces and getting touchy feely about defending the rights of the weak. A good analogous is Eren Jager as I mentioned. Just not as quirky.

The bolded is exactly what Aang is like, minus the avatar stuff.  Aang's goals are only there because he's the avatar, not because he chose them or wanted to have anything to do with that.  It has nothing to do with his personality, but rather his fate.  He didn't even want to be the avatar. Why do you think he ran away from the air temple?  He was basically like "fuck this, I wanna go penguin sledding!" Which really doesn't sound Ne-Fi to me at all.  

Defending the rights of the weak sounds just like an Fi thing, rather than being an Ne-Fi thing.  xSFPs can get very touchy feely about their values.

I don't know who Eren Jager is, so I won't comment on that.  





This isn't type related.

&gt;Can an INTJ feel a lot and still be an INTJ 

Yes Yes, of course they can. r/enneagramAgreed! Can we please sticky this post? Fi is more so about ethics. Fi users (particularly Fi doms) tend to put themselves in someone else's shoes and weigh information based on that. They will typically base their decision on their own sense of values if they were in that situation. 

For a crude example "I would certainly appreciate it if someone hugged me if I was upset, so I will offer that to my friend who is clearly upset".I used the term ethics mostly because that sort of interpersonal reasoning is what often guides ethics. In socionics they call feeling "ethics". When it comes to "logic" I'm usually reminded of the thinking functions. I think I do agree with you actually, but it's early morning and I could use another few hours of sleep :/

Fi is a rational function, and I think that's what you're saying here. It's not just emotions. 
No testing is accurate imo. They should only be used to point you in a certain direction. Well actually they sort of are. Both types have the same auxiliary and tertiary functions and lead with an extraverted perception function. 

Research the differences between Se and Ne, and how they work with auxiliary Fi. That should help you. This is an excellent explanation of what Fi is I always laugh when people say "I can't communicate with sensors" and I see it come up all the time.  

So often someone will make a post like that, and they often stress how they don't know an intuitive at all and that they're surrounded by sensors, and as such, they can't have a """""""deep"""""" conversation.  I find this hilarious because they probably actually do know at least one intuitive in their life (I get that N's are more rare than sensors, but they're not that rare), and their problem isn't even related to that.  They just want to find someone who has the same interests as they do.  Well, meeting an intuitive type won't guarantee that.  It's also hilariously ironic how they want a "deep intelligent discussion", yet their claims are extremely shallow.&gt;At the end of the day, mbti really comes down to the cognitive functions 

Pretty much this. 

Stereotypes are one thing, but they can often get in the way of actually finding your type. I had a hard time believing I am an ISFP because I don't do art  and I daydream way too often.It's not that I have anything against INFJs themselves. It's more so that people see the type as some sort of mystical psychic empath. It's almost as though they're described as being super human. 

I get along fine with INFJs, I just don't understand the fetish a lot of people have for the Ni function.  r/shittymbti is over hereSure yeah, I think I could go well.  Although if they have the same type as me, then they should be (and probably would be) different enough in other areas to make it more interesting.  No spoilers please :) 

I've seen Haru typed as ISFJ before but I'm inclined to agree that she's ISFP 9. I don't see any Ne from her so I don't think that INFP is likely. 

I'm not sure about MBTI (although I think he's a Te user) but Akechi strikes me as an enneagram 1.No, it's not possible to read other people's minds. &gt;we can basically read other people's minds if they have the same type as us because we know how they work 

No, you don't know how other people work, nor can you "basically read their minds" (metaphorically or not) even if they're the same type as you. This sounds like an awful lot of projecting going on.This would be almost impossible to do. C'mon, Coors? There are so many better beers out there :PThe types that are smart enough to know that IQ is pretty much meaningless, and that trying to link intelligence to type is only good for encouraging ego masturbation.I thought she was an xSTJ. I could be wrong though. Forget the tests, they're pretty much useless. Read up on the functions instead. &gt;Sensing - definitely not intuitive. Her arguments about feminism, although well intentioned, are pretty shallow. 

Why does this indicate sensing?Probably about 2 at most. While there are a lot of problems with people, I think that most of them are generally good. It's just easier to notice the awful ones. It's interesting how when someone sees poor arguments it's a "lack of intuition" rather than a lack of an ability to argue. I've met plenty of intuitives who have made shallow arguments. It's almost as though they're seeing intelligence and intuition as the same thing, rather than how intelligence manifests in intuitives or sensors. I'm ISFP. 

The INTPs that I know are alright I guess. My biggest gripe with them is how impersonal they can be. It's almost like they will argue with you for no other purpose than to argue, even when you don't want to. I find that incredibly exhausting. I used to think I was an INFP because I didn't relate to any information around Se. It took me a while and I had a lot of help, but ISFP is the only type that makes sense for me. A lot of descriptions of SP types make it seem like we're "thrill seekers" or "very competitive", and that's not what I'm like. Or when talking about ISFPs they keep stressing art, and I'm not artistic at all. Sure I appreciate art, but when I attempt to make art it generally looks like shit. I relate to the stereotype of INFPs (lost in their head, daydreaming, etc) but I don't think that ISFPs are any less like that. It's just when dealing with the outer world ISFPs tend to be more grounded.

What I've learned is that INFPs tend to be very wordy. They love to ramble on, usually about seemingly random things, although they are often very insightful. I think it's the nature of Ne (exploring various concepts), and I think that this probably why many INFPs are great writers. It's how they express their Fi values. I'm not like this. 

ISFPs on the other hand are not very wordy. We generally prefer to use something tangible to express our Fi values (I think that this is where the artist stereotype comes from) which is something that I can relate to. I tend to have a perspective of trying to inspire people to do things by doing them myself. I tend to be a doer despite the fact that I'm very much in my head. I hope this makes sense. 
The N bias comes from internet pseudo intellectuals who like to use MBTI to feel superior to others."DAE NTs are the best because they're smart and speshul and stuff?" So many of these articles make it seem like sensors and intuitives are different species or something.  Often in such a way that intuitives are somehow more enlightened.

The article is cringe.  This has been discussed here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/66oh3t/persona_5_mbti/

And here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/67ql4x/for_those_playinghave_played_persona_5_what_do/

:)No because N vs S deals with perception.I like the ISFP one because travelling is amazing.I'm also a vegetarian, but extremely flexible.  When going out for supper with people I don't usually speak up because most restaurants have vegetarian options.  If I go to a BBQ I usually just bring my own food.  

I don't care what other people eat.  The only thing that I disagree with is the black and white morality. I don't think that it's nearly as simple as that, especially considering how subjective and contextual morality is.I'm an ISFP and I'm horrible at art. Everything I make looks like shit, and I don't have the patience to get good at it. I do appreciate other people's art a lot though.Sensors don't have any kind of intelligence though, am I right? /sThe intuitive bias exists because internet pseudo intellectuals like to find ways to make themselves feel superior to others.The types that I attract are:I'm an ISFP and I never want to have children. This probably sounds ridiculous but one time I had a nightmare where I had kids. Nothing unusual happened, I just got a woman pregnant and became a father. *shudders*Yes, of course. Overthinking and having an imagination is not exclusive to intuitive types.I did find my love when I was 16. One night after work I came home and my dad shared some of his beer with me. I've been in love with beer ever since.It hasn't really, MBTI is pretty much meaningless. I'm an ISFP, so what?I think that people genuinely like learning about themselves, and MBTI is a very accessible tool that helps with that. The reason why I said it's meaningless (although I probably should have said mostly meaningless) is because MBTI is very vague and has a lot of flaws. It doesn't nearly get into a good understanding of someone's personality or psychology.Is this book related to the MBTI perception functions, or is this just an attempt to take this book and shoehorn it into MBTI?SJs aren't necessarily conservative or close minded. From what I have seen online, it seems like a lot of intuitives can be very conservative.

Being conservative or close minded had more to do with your maturity levels and your personal values than your type.How close minded they areI think that they are perhaps wondering about the 90s sitcom.80% of this sub is why people see it that way tbhWasn't the MBTI created for the purpose of making money?Whether or not you are interested in math or poetry has nothing to do with type. Any person of any type can be either emotional, rational, both, or neither.Humanity is actually better off now than ever before. So if anything, the opposite is happening. That said, "dark" art is really cool :)It's because MBTI communities are chalk full of internet pseudo intellectuals who use the MBTI to feel good about themselves and look down on others. Most people associate SFs with "normies", their mothers and party girls.That's interesting because I don't think that there's anything special at all about being an ISFP or any type for that matter. The problem is that the types are incredibly vague and they do their best to fit everyone into one of 16 categories. All in all you have a 1/16 chance to be any arbitrary type. So what? What makes someone have an awesome personality goes far beyond what some pop psychology can describe.This won't be a popular view but, it's probably because MBTI has to be extremely vague in order to fit literally everyone into 1 of 16 categories. It's not hard to look at them all and get confused to which one you are because how vague it is can make it really easy to relate to any of the traits. 

&gt;what is the point of MBTI

There really isn't one, other than to make some people money. It's pretty much the McDonalds of psychology.&gt;You're all but comparing MBTI to astrology and psychic readings

Fair point, but maybe it's because I mostly see it that way. It doesn't help that the vast majority of information on the internet about MBTI (including on this very subreddit) gives it that impression.

&gt;They are simplified theoretical models

Exactly, they are theoretical. Have the functions or MBTI ever been empirically verified? If not, then it's all just a guessing game, even if it is a more "educated" one.

&gt;And if you get confused by which doll you're supposed to be, it's because you don't strongly resemble any of the sixteen on offer

Agreed, and I would think that this confusion is inevitable. I guess my main problem is that you use these functions in this order, or those functions in that order. What does that even mean? What if, for example, I relate equally to Ne and Se (and therefore ISFP and INFP)? I can't use both of them, so I have to pick one. Also why is it that when I get confused I'm essentially offered a different explanation as to why from every person I ask?

I'm not saying this is all useless, but it is pretty flawed. That's something that users should keep in mind.Having been around the communities online for years, I can honestly totally understand why they would say that. I would most likely agree with them.FascinatingSe is an exploring function that operates in the moment. It takes in tangible sensory information and this information is judged by either Fi or Ti. It focuses on tangible possibilities and experiences and is very observant. This information is then stored in the brain and often pieced together.

 With enough of these observations and experiences Ni will eventually kick in and begin to connect the dots and understand certain patterns. With this the Se/Ni user will try to understand these patterns and begin to make predictions about what is likely to develop. They might not always be accurate in these however. 

Thoughts? 
My brain likes to use the shotgun method, unmitigated cringiness over and over until something witty sticks, usually accidentally. My brain and I don't like each other very much. the sad truth about cousin romanmagic dudes that blow people up from afarU U U U INFP here. im actually an anarcho-communist, so I have a general distrust for american politics anyway. Didnt like the other option, but this was devastating for the social state of our country and even the world maybe. The years ahead of us are gonna be scary times. your baby boy wants to be a film dudeINFP. I like Scizor, Electivire, Heracross, Honchkrow, Lucario, Aggron, Luxray, Zoroark, Gengar, Alakazam, Tyranitar, Hitmonlee, Snorlax,Bewear, Every Porygon, Garchomp, and I always REALLY liked Metagross. 

I always thought there was something... Cheap about using legendaries so I never really had them on my team or was that interested in them. I always thought  Lugia looked cool. Rayquaza, Darkrai, and the Regis are pretty sick. 

Most of the starters usually have a pretty cool design. Particularly I like Torterra, Empoleon, Blastoise, Swampert, Sceptile, Typhlosion, Feraligator. To me, Charizard is overrated and Venusaur doesn't get enough love. He's a G. 

As far as types my favorites are Steel, Ghost, Psychic, Fighting, Dark and Electric. 

My fav Eeveeloution is a toss up between Jolteon, Umbreon, and Espeon. He's original, the only rhinoceros beetle Pokémon, and his typing is really cool. Its a bug that can fight people. In Heart Gold i had one named Punch BuggyYeah, i feel like its more awkward to hide from it than it is to just tough it out and meet my fear face to face. Maybe I would crack a joke about it, Im sure they'd understand What made him special?
I think most INFPs are essentially optimists with calm demeanors, but when our core principles are threatened or we're otherwise "triggered" we can lose it and get completely reckless and impulsive and illogical, lashing out and even violating our own principles to vindicate them (see: illogical). And since we intuitively *get* emotions better than other MBTI types, at our ugliest we know exactly how to hurt you and will try our best to do it. We'll hate ourselves afterwards, but it can happen (I read something somewhere about "weaponized guilt", which, if you knew some of the people I've intentionally hurt, sounds like an understatement).

Otherwise, many of us get depressed and wrestle with self-loathing and indecision, waiting for something to spark our passion. Think Hamlet, or the Romeo of Act I.Don Quixote =DSheesh, what's with all my fellow INFPs trying to rationalize this? It all comes down to loyalty and how I feel about it; outside my immediate family, there are precisely 3 people I would unconditionally help out and keep their secret and never ask a single question. I feel they've earned it. For all others I'd have to consider the who and the how and the why before deciding what to do. If any of it rubs me the wrong way, you bet your ass they're going to jail.As an INFP, *Freedom: The Underground Railroad* doesn't appeal much to me. I think it's the bit about "[striking] the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed", as anything that requires juggling resources tends to make me worry that I'm mishandling them. Moreover:

&gt;Fi develops intense values and must be communicated meticulously.

These values are subjective, not objective, though there is often some overlap. For instance, while I sympathize with the oppressed and do have moderate opinions on these issues, they're not my be-all and end-all, and I do have other values that, for me, rank much higher. The idea of playing a game designed to make me "think about what the rules of the game are saying about racism and oppression" just brings me down, man. It seems too heavy-handed and preachy to be any fun. Fi is about finding meaning in things, with developing strong values a side-effect. Having these meanings spoon-fed to me without anything deeper to ponder, and having some objective values thrust in my face, not only fail to engage my Fi but threaten to stifle it (I'm almost opposed to this game on principle =P).

My favorite game (and, I feel, a much better fit for Fi-dominants) is *Diplomacy*—there's a time to talk and then a time to act, and with actual discussion between players you can read people and then communicate your thoughts/feelings through words or actions or both. This is especially true in online games, where most people's poor tact in their writing and blatant moves one way or another often betray their intentions. Fi's constant search for deeper meaning (and ability to see through inauthenticity) gives Fi-dominants the advantage in a game based on trust (and the occasional back-stab).I dunno, mate. [r/INFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/INFP) could give r/INFJ a run for its money.Exactly.

I'll take an interest in X and immediately picture myself as the best and brightest X-er who ever lived, doing the most amazing X-related things. Then, depending how much (or how little) follow-through I've made, I'll lose interest and move on to something else.Agreed.1. Yay.
2. Anything can happen, but only the things that deserve impersonal brevity and (ugh) *emojis* should be expressed. If it matters then call, or, if it REALLY matters, wait til you see someone in person.
3. INFP
4. "Typical view"? It would be too forward of me to presume anything.
5. This stems from INFPs' personal moralities and drive to find/convey meanings. 'Cos they're personal (and situational), I'd expect every INFP to respond differently at different times. Read my answer to #2 again and notice how I say "it matters", which is a value judgement. Texting gives more time to type out a thoughtful response, but, paradoxically, this extra time means that any ambiguity is implied to be deliberate or, if not, is overthought anyway—in a phone call ambiguity can be chalked up to misspeaking and there's more tolerance for incoherence. When something is important (another value judgement), it's better to be incoherent and personal than precise and impersonal.Witty, pretty, sometimes shitty.

Most of my jokes go over well, but once in a while I do drop a couple of stinkers.Nope.Better nonsense than no sense, but both sense out bad sense. Any imposing's in posing opposing supposings, since seldom does sense dissent sensibly solo. Savvy?Your mom went to college.INFP. I cheat in a couple different ways. Since the days tend to blur together for me,  sometimes I'll approximate and then adjust by 25%, like "It feels like I sent that thing out for repairs a month ago, so it's probably been only 3 weeks." Or "I got an oil change maybe five thousand miles ago, so it's probably more like 3.5k and I'm still good." Tends to do the trick more often than not.

For specifics, sometimes I'll throw out a ballpark estimate. Like when I'm at a bar and a song starts playing, I'll comment something like "Wow. Welcome back to 1997" when it could just as easily have been '96 or '98. No one corrects me so I assume it's all good.

Further back, I have a few dates memorized as benchmarks and make a guess based on how far off an event seems. E.g. I know the Crimean War was 19th Century for sure, and it would have been somewhere after the revolutions of 1848 but before Bismarck and the German unification wars in the 1860s... I'd guess 1854ish?

For most of my purposes, cheating doesn't hurt since my dates don't need to be too accurate. But when it does, it's usually worth doing right.Dating and stuffI might spill the water, but my ENTP friend always spills the beans. Always ends up a hot mess. =/Not necessarily Ne-dom. I myself discovered the joys of pizza with ranch dressing and honey roasted peanuts just through curiosity, trial, and error (though not so much error).

what do you thinkYou got one right, disregarding the X.You did actually. And you were right on Fi, looking back.

If you give up, I won't hold it against you. Story of my life. Haha, I kid.
Went to sleep. Yep, INFPlol, yep. logically those are the only choices left after all.
INP indeed. INFP, I am.INTP biasAs an Fi user, it matters not what others think of you but that you are okay with yourself.I guess we'll have to see.Hello, fellow INFP 9.lolThis is good.
...sounds like fi just saying things as they areUpvoted for accuracy.Funny personHi, me too.agree with polr seISFJ?Just the vibe I getthis is my fav me-meFi enneagram 9Just read some of your posts throughout the thread. You sound like me, so INFP. Enneagram 9?Yes, so/sx I think.For me, it makes me feel more aware of my place in the "social hierarchy". I work in IT support, which is pretty low on the totem pole for IT. Here you have to deal with the users directly rather than focus solely on the technical side of things. It's a mix between tech support / customer service. Also, since I have to crawl under tables to set up computers, I feel lesser than those that just sit in their chairs doing office work. (Though most of this is my problem.) 

so/sx in e9, I've read is described as "everyone's friend". I think this is accurate because I try to get along with everyone in real life. Often I will not state how I truly feel about things to keep the peace and the relationships going smoothly. Basically, minimize my presence, in a sense. 

Another thing is dating sites. I've felt a little shameful to be seen on one. That's why every time I've made a profile on one, I close it the next day. 

Now I've spoken too much about myself. In 9 fashion (trying to minimize my space/presence), I must put the focus back on you.

And I guess speaking from an Fi point of view, what type do you feel like the most?INFP 9 here. Other people's perspectives seem stronger than my own. Have to assert myself more or I get caught under their spell.I agree with this.INFP 9w1 here. When I was unhealthier mentally, I simply went along with what my friends wanted to do, or whoever it was that I hung out with. I simply went along without a preference. This came up especially when deciding where to go or where to eat. 

Never believed I was Fe. But I definitely felt there was a bent towards Fe being described as "focusing on others", yet of course Fi 9 would do this too. I think healthy Fi 9 would be most assertive in what the Fi user wants instead of simply going along with others to keep the peace. In that sense, it might be less "Fe".

There is also the covert method of agreeing with others simply to smooth over relationships and avoid conflict, but in secret, not really agreeing. It's a strategy.

Maybe Fi should be reframed into something else that isn't described as staying true to what one wants or what one believes. That to me seems like almost a behavior moreso than a cognitive function description. 

I think the Fi description in socionics is closer to 9. Maybe the staying true to oneself description you described is more 4-like. I'm not sure. I think it becomes more muddled if one's tritype includes 4 as well. I suspect that may be the case for me. Though now that I think about it I'm not sure. Where does Fi begin and where does 4 end?I think Fi would do it more and for a 9 it might even be easier to hide as they accommodate away almost as if that's what they really wanted. Then of course they show no (anger) that that's not what they wanted. 

To be fair I do find behavioral traits useful. I'm just not a fan of the Fe vs Fi perceptions, since they don't account for Fi E9s, which you did, and Fe E4s (e.g. INFJ, ISFJ e4). I know E4 Fe's would be big on authenticity. Frankly, I think my "friend" (uncertain at this point as we are drifting apart it seems) is an ISFJ 4.

I typed a few more words, but I deleted them. The more I write, the less I understand.Welcome to the INFP E9 club. Now we have two members. :) 

(Just kidding about the club)

I agree with ru-ya's typing.Wow, you just broke it down.

Very nicely done.Haha, thank you. I prefer to let it be. I get the feeling that we're on differing paths, so in that sense it has turned out well.How did you get to working as a software engineer?
INFP male here.

The only reason I go outside to socialize is when I'm drunk.

Don't really know why. I just don't feel like meeting people otherwise.

What kind of trouble do you experience?INFP: Self, Musical and Spatial.
Hey kids look. Its another ESTP taking things too far and making a thread about a common internet flame war. Just let things go. He won because he bothered you so much you made a thread about it. Its you who got trolled. He won. You lost.You're upset enough that you're willing to take time to dig through my posts. This guy reeeeeally got to you didn't he Mr. ESTrumP. I'm sorry about your small hands, but just let it go.Go make another thread about how not upset you are.Seems I hit a nerve. Though I've never heard of this Fuck Boip you speak of. Its he a poet our something?

I also love the trump-like use of a single simple word as a punctuating insult. "Sad!"

Seems like something a loser would do. Very low energy insult.Don't you have like a frat party to goto or something?Make a single witty comeback and I will give you props. Until then you are simply LOW ENERGY.Since your father never will.The ONLINE tests are crap. They are meant to be streamlined and don't take into account cognitive functions... rather than being drawn out and focused on the science of it. Fi vs fe shpuld be tested rather thab just F vs t.

There are more peofessional and accurate versions that we can assumr are being used for population data.

However, you do make an important point. There will certainly be discrepancy based on the accuracy of that.Once an INTJ shuts you out the only thing to do is move on. Other wise it will be an unhealthy relationship of you proving your utility to their life.Interesting... how deep does it go into MBTI. Does it take into effect cognitive function or just MBTI letters?I don't know any religious INFPs besides the one who's dad is a convicted pedo who wanted to fuck his cousin...

I naturally had an internal voice screaming "This is bullllllshiiiiiit" every time I went to church. It's sort of insulting to suggest a genius would dedicate their life to perpetuating exclusionary fairy tales.I'm sorry you had to go through that. Luckily once I was a teen my family was hands off about religion. I hope your family allowed you to leave gracefully.If he was an actual genius he could use his platform for global political change. He's just a self centered narcissist. If one of the hundred of actually genius rappers had his platform, we would have a martin luther king 2.0, instead he starts a designer clothes company and goes bankrupt. Geniuses push the world forward, not perpetuate the status quo.Turns out you confidently claim something yourself enough times dumb people will believe you.Look at this stubborn rationality :)

Real question though. What happens when you find your own ideal was wrong? Do you begin apologizing to everyone you winged or annoyed?You can't resist trolling and arguing about things based on opinions you didn't cone up with yourself ya mean kb?I don't feel I relate to the Fi one at all. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your wording, but how I currently understand it I do not agree. The first half of it makes sense but the mentality and response is all wrong.

Counter intrigue, rivalries and gunning to be top dog don't sound very INFP to me.

Storing up complaints and disappointments and then exploding all at once is more the INFP at is worse.INFP and ESTJ. It's a mutual hate for sure.

One's live and let live, one's a people manager.

One loves meaningless art, one loves meaningful efficiency.

One hates going along with the norm, one works exclusively in the norm.

One loves unique innovative problem solving, one likes sticking to what's proven to work.

One likes talking hypothetical, one likes talking about only what they've seen and been told.

One is lazy and passive, one is hardworking and aggressive.

One's sole focus is morality of systems, one's sole focus is efficiency of its immediate situation.

The list goes on. Just remember that sharing the same functions does not mean compatibility.

INFP and ESTP is another one, but I'll leave that alone. In general as an INFL I've found I don't get along with ESxx types.Estp or entp. Se vs ne. Read up on both types and try to decide.

Like the other guy said, sounds like Se Estp to me with the need for adventure and other things.

Estp is my final answerIn every pessimist lies a jaded optimist. - george carlinI feel like INTJs can be very concise with words and are more about providing answers than asking questions (thats the intps job).

I think No is accurateHi. Im me. How are you?Replace objective with subjective and I think you just about nailed it ;)Downvoted. Man I feel better about myself already!

(Im kidding)

(No really, have an upvote)It's irrelevant. Just ignore it; live, love, laugh, and help each other.

Treat everyone like they will be who you reincarnate as next. Every action you do to others is an action done to yourself.

Now lets just lay in bed all dayNo flaws and no expertise. The Mario of mbti types ;)

I always hear about ISTPs cheating on their SO, having problems maintaining healthy relationships, and giving into Se desires. But you can believe what you want.Ok I'll bite. Why can't you tell if you're ENTP or INFJ?The word for that is "hypocrite"Only if you sniff it and it doesn't stink. (Kidding!)I'd say INTP or INFP. They are sort of the "bullshit" detectors with Ti/Ne and Fi/Ne. Always questioning and over analyzing every social interaction.Read em and weep boys and girls...

http://www.celebritytypes.com/infp.php.

Only type to not have an evil person listed. Even ISFP has a Nazi.

Can anyone name a single evil INFP who's type isn't up for debate? Didn't think so.

Jokes on you, we only hate ourselves and take out our aggression on ourselves. 

\#SuicideNotHomicide
INFP. Done.Of course we can empathize with them... but I feel as long as you have your radar on, you will still realize how fake they are ahead of time.Yeah for that sort of stuff I feel like "hello an I the only one woo notices or are you all purposely ignoring this?"Exactly. It's like minesweeper: people editionTrust me I agree. Celeb types provides a cool site, but their typing is ass at times.

But yeah, if John Kerry is truly INFP then I guess he is the most evil one?Agreed, when people start talking about socionics my eyes roll. The people treat it like a religion too.Finally something that doesn't say "INFPs listen to accoustic music and indie folk".

Interesting data, however like it's said, anyone can listen to anything.Pro tip:

1. Make an okcupid account. 

2. In your interests add your mbti type. 

3. Goto the filter by interests tab.

4. Search the mbti types you want to date.

You now have the biggest mbti dating app possible. You're welcome everyone

(I like your idea though op)I think it had been suggested before but I still think it is a great idea.  Dating is supposed to be fun and adding mbti can keep it funAbsolutely agreed. I hate how much socionics people try to invade mbti forums. And then all they talk about is how much better socionics. If it's so much better, go on a socionics forum! Pls no socionics. PlsDefinitely makes more sense than quadrasAnd what I'm saying is despite having the same cog funcs they act nothing alike. Hence its a pants on head retarded way of looking at things.

And yes it's exclusively a socionics practice to group the types like that. Stop embarrassing yourself. Exactly socionics does everything rather than focusing on what is actually logicalAre you extremely confident? Istp. If not intp. Most entps I know are anti socialSe. Protip: INFPs hate debating in person. We do our best thinking while alone writing and typing. We like to sit and chew on things without the ticking time bomb of "social interaction expectations" rushing us. Instead of "debating" an INFP in person, have a collaborative conversation and you will both learn from eachother. Don't ask any leading question traps or other combative sneaky debate tactics... make it co-operation not confrontation. Personally this is why I get along with INTPs way more than ENTPs. INTPs care most about finding truthful logic, ENTPs care most about proving their logic. It being true is secondary to them "winning" and being "right" in a conversation. (Just my experiences, results may vary)You're talking about debating stances that aren't your own for sport. I'm talking about in situations of actually exchanging thoughts on topics that might not even have "sides".

I'm not saying that INFPs are bad at debate, I'm saying that isn't the most effective way to exchange thoughts with one. Like you said you also enjoy debating online. That is also something I enjoy because again, no face to face instant interaction I can take as long as I need to craft my response without social pressure altering my narrative.

As long as both people are open-minded rather than "taking sides" I am fine with in person. However that is rarely the case.INFP

&gt;Mastermind seems like an INTJ song

And "The Healer" is such an INFP song right? /s
Well Hitler was real, so fuck off with your fairy tale bullshit. ;)Huh? I think you majorly misread my tone and intentions.That's what I meant to imply, thanks for clarifyingIt's not demeaning. It's something I've experienced too.

On the flipside my S friends are more reliable and our relationships are a lot simpler/less dramatic at times.Ah yes, all ENTPs are logically sound... and additionally none of them have mental illness clouding their thoughts. But of course.From my experience, while most are normal... NTPs are the ones who are most into conspiracy theory culture.Why is "queen" in your username?It's debatable on account of how unhappy people are now. Depression and unhappiness are rampant despite how "evolved" our society is. Suicide rate is very high too.

Just because we improved society, doesn't mean we are done improving yet.The disconnect obviously exists, how would you rather have it described?

You're ranting without giving a solution. Let's be productive and problem solve this.
I'm also a bit late now, but as an infp in a relationship with an infj, I can tell you that I agree 100% with u/CrudeAsaButton. I feel like our differences make us more balanced. We've been together for 2.5 years now and compared to the first six months, I feel like we have really found a great balance and are great at working together. We accept that we have slightly different needs, and give each other space to fulfil them. To be honest it's the best relationship I've ever been in, by a large margin. As long as both the infj ad infp are mature and willing to communicate I think that they will make an excellent team.Wow, that was a lot of info! I read a bit and I will continue to read it later. Super interesting, thanks! :)

I did the test you linked and I was an INFP after all. 
My [results](http://www.scottmunson.info/myers/results/) were:
Clear Introversion: 19/21
Clear Intuition: 21/26
Clear Feeling: 20/24
Clear Perceiving: 17/22

I only started doubting being an INFP because I was lurking around on the mbti sub and so many people wrote that INFPs can't do this or that, while some other types can. And the things they mentioned I really feel are my forte. Like sensing what other people are feeling withouth them having to say anything. Or being analytical. I am actually better at being analytical and logical than most of my friends. And being empathical. They said that INFPs are more selfish because they think of their own feelings and how they will feel if they make this or that decision.. But I often put others before myself, to the point of creating problems for myself, just because I wanted to help others so much. I have really had to work on not doing that as much, because it stopped me from taking care of myself emotionally almost completely. But since I once again tested INFP, I guess that those people don't know what they are talking about when it comes to INFPs? And I do feel that the description at the end of the test I did now was more accurate in describing me than the other ones where I also tested INFP (I did a fair amount of them before, because I felt unsure about the results. And for funsies, because mbti-things are very interesting).

And the part you wrote about socionics, I have no idea what any of it means. I have only brifly heard socionics mentioned before, but never felt like diving into it and see what it actually is. SO I can't really say that I understood much of HandsOfGrace's comment to be honest.

Anyway, thanks for your answer and all the information!! :)Wow that was also really interesting to read! Thanks :)Okay. Thanks for your input :) I'm fairly new to all of this and just wanting to know more for fun. Haven't even looked at other stuff yet. But I probably will, at least to get a perspective on what is what! :)I'm not an introvert because I don't like being social or because I'm shy. Extroverts can be shy and introverts can be outgoing. I'm an introvert because social interaction drains me of my energy. That's the difference. If you get energy from hanging out with people you're an extrovert. If you get energy from being alone, you're an introvert.I think Rory might be an INFJ. And I'm thinking Lorelai might be an ESFP.Same here. Also an INFP and for a while I wondered if I might have ADD. I'm an INFP.

* I'd like a [country house](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4c/57/df/4c57df9bb71b31f6d5b899c87814c0b0.jpg) in the woods, preferably near a lake. And I want it to feel a little secluded. 
* I want a [garden](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/8f/05/6a/8f056a65d4aaae1a96428254ca288818.jpg) with lots of different bushes and trees and flowers, so that there would always be something in bloom throughout the whole summer. I would like many fruit trees as well.
* I would like a [cosy spot](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b1/38/8e/b1388e7ace1d6be189d607589721dd8c.jpg) in the garden where you could sit and eat breakfast, or have a glas of wine in the evening.
* I would also have a vegetable patch and a small green house so that I could grow my own herbs, carrots, beets and other vegetables.

**Interior**

* I would like lots of dark wood! And wooden beams in the cealing.
* Different plants in the windows. 
* A music room where I can play, record and work (I work with sound design). 
* A hobby room so that we could paint, sew and do hobby stuff. I want to be able to make many things myself instead of having to buy them. 
* I would also like to power as many things as possible with solar energy, because the environment is so incredibly important to me. 
* It has to be cosy, like [this](https://www.loombrand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/comfy-window-bed.jpg)! I want fairy lights in every room! 
* An open fire in one of the rooms
* Wooden floors.
* AND I WANT A LIBRARY! Kind of like [this one](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/aa/a0/43/aaa043bac23164943ef00919adfc8fd8.jpg) but less rustic and with two reading chairs in a corner.
* I also want an at [home cinema](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/c5/f5/eb/c5f5eb3643535c6ae7e11ae5fbf82894.jpg) that doubles as gaming room!

**Things**

* A grand piano
* A great soundsystem both in the music room and in the living room and in the home cinema/gaming room
* A good internet connection
* A coffee machine

And that's my dream house! Btw, super fun post! :)Yup. Fuzzy wuzzy is just how I like it!
And anytime! Brace yourself for endless cups of tea or coffee! :)

And I totally agree. I Love thinking about that stuff. When I started dating my SO we spent sooo many hours watching "espace to the country" and browsing pinterest. It was the best. And it turned out we have exactly the same taste when it comes to architechture and interior design! I'm so looking forward to when we can buy a house together!Not usually, but that could be arranged haha.

I know! When you start it's so hard to stop. It's like an endless void of loveliness that you can get lost in sometimes.I'm an INFP and my creative process is similar to yours. And I like to mix different genres when I get stuck.&gt; I'm not even subconsciously aware of, or consciously understanding of, emotions I may have. After careful analysis and reflection, I believe, after many months, I *might* be in love right now. Zero emotional consideration in my typical decision making.

&gt;I *could* try to explain the INFP side of that, but I truly just do not understand those people, with their poetry and Tumblrs and flowery language. We speak opposite languages. [...] I really would like to hear from the INFPs how they use each function.

I probably won't succeed, but I'll give it a try.

I think it's the opposite way with many INFPs. I am so in tune with my emotions and every little nuance of them. I will often know within seconds exactly how I feel about a situation and why. And whenever I'm feeling something "new" I want to analyze it as soon as I'm done feeling the new thing. I do it for three reasons. The first is that it's just what comes naturally to me, because my "survival strategy" is that I want to be able to understand my own feelings and reactions to be able to gauge what situations will be good for the well being of myself and those around me. The second is human relationships. In my head I have kind of an internal "map" of all the people I know, and their reactions to different situations and their relationships to each other and their backstories. That helps me know how to handle them if I ever need to work with them or do a project or something like that. And the third is just for fun. I like to analyze these things. It's kind of like a game to me. I'll try to analyze someone and then I'll see if it was correct or not as I get to know them better.

Tldr:
I care way less about the "why" or "how", than I do about intentions and possible consequenses, and that is what I'll base my decisions on most of the time.I do that sometimes (infp) but that's mostly because I process thoughts and ideas by talking about them. It's not because I like to hear my own voice more than others. Whenever I meet someone that also likes to throw around ideas and thoughts I find it super stimulating and fun! It's like brainstorming, but instead of doing it on a paper, you do it with another person and get new input and ideas that you wouldn't get if you did it on your own inside your head. But sometimes when I get extra excited I really have to try hard to shut up, because if I don't think about it I'll ramble on and on.Hmm yeah, maybe you're right. Am new to this and wrote it in the middle of the night. I'll just delete it so I won't confuse people more than nessecary.INFP: Try to see someone elses perspective aside from your own, and also, stop destroying the environment damnit!Yeah, I might have misinterpreted the whole thing. I though S was more of "this is what I see so that is what I'm going to go by" while N was more of "But *what if*". But I'll have to read up on it a little more. Unless you would care to give me a quick explanation..? :)I have two of those in my class. One is an ESTP and the other one an ESFP. They can be so frustrating sometimes, especially since they refuse to admit that they might actually not know more than everyone else about everything all the time. Thanks for this! Judging all INFPs based on one persons drunken mistakes. Wtf..* 1: Powers to heal anything and anyone
* 2: No
* Dunno. maybe a 5.
* Hmm a 2...
* 5, would only tell my loved ones.
* No secret name. Yes, a costume. Love costume parties. This would be like a constant costumeparty."What? I didn't listen I was too busy judging you"

Edit: (i'm assuming your comment was aimed at OP btw? Got a little scared when I saw so many words in caps at first though)Haha yes. I recognize these things in my SO who is an INFJ. But INFPs do a fair amount of these things too, so we can be flawed in mostly the same ways together. Oh, so romantic!Haha yup. When a friend needs advice and I know that I've been through the same thing and I want to tell them what solution I think is best (because when I was in that situation I did the trial and error thing until I found what worked best and then I analyzed everything ten times over to find out why it worked best) it always sounds as if I'm trying to make it about myself. But I really do care, and I'm *not* trying to make it about myself. It's just that I always relate back to past experiences... But lately I've been getting better at not saying "when this happened to me I did this" but instead "Well, some people do like this and that seems to work well".I was not the one who downvoted you, but I think you might have mixed up introverted and social.

Introverted and social are not the same thing. Someone introverted can still be social. I am an INFP and oh boy am I introverted. But when I'm up for it I can be very social too. I agree with this. As far as my experience go this was very spot on. I am an INFP and I'm very introverted. My SO is an INFJ and until he took an mbti test I thought he was an extrovert because he is mostly up for social things and he's very outgoing. Also have an ENFP friend that's verging on being introvert. And I have an ESTP class mate and I've never in my life met anyone that's sooo extroverted.... so this got very wordy. But after all I am an INFP so that's probably why. 
So I'll include a **TLDR:** dated an ESFP and it was very fun but I felt suffocated and the pace was too high for me. 
Then I dated an ESTP and that was not a good relationship at all tbh.
Now I'm dating an INFJ and it's the best.

Long version if anyone's interested:

One of them was an ESFP and we had a lot of fun at first. But he was more clingy than I and he didn't really seem to understand my need for alone time. When I wanted to be alone and recharge he took that as a sign that I was losing interest in him. He was very intense and adventurous, and that was very fun. It brought me out of my shell, which was nice. But when that first intense infatuation started to fade a little, I knew that I would need a slower pace or at least a few breaks to breathe to not feel suffocated. I think he found that difficult because he became very distant and seemed hurt and we only lasted a week after I told him that. 


The other one was an ESTP and that is a tough one to begin with. I was a push over with lots of feelings and he was manipulative and didn't seem to even know what the word "feelings" meant. Not a good combo. But he was also a bit abusive so I don't know what was our functions clashing and what was him being an ass.

Now I'm with an INFJ and it's absolutely great. So balanced and loving and fun. Mostly chill and now and then the occassional adventure. He is also the best friend I've ever had.u/cavendishelous wrote:
&gt;Most introverted introvert - INFPs are pretty high up there

And you answered:
&gt; I'm pretty sure INFP is known to be very social?

That made it sound like you were mixing up introverted and social. Maybe you weren't, but it was easy to interpret it that way when you commented in the way you did. And depending on in which way you mean, it sounds like you maybe don't know INFPs very well. When people say "social" they usually tend to mean in bigger groups. Like 8 people or more. We tend to not like socializing in larger groups. But in smaller groups (like 3-4 people) and one on one we thrive. Until we need to recharge because then we just want to go home and hide from humanity. I think that's what people think of when they think of introversion. That we can be social, but not for very long, and we seem to need longer than other types to recharge.I let myself feel the way I feel until I'm done feeling that way. I used to repress stuff and try to move on, but I found that when you repress feelings they will 9/10 times come back and bite you in the ass sometime in the future. And I also experienced a kind of gnawing feeling in my stomach until I dealt with the issue. To avoid that I learnt that the best way for me is to just deal with everything as soon as I can. I'd rather be 100% sad in the beginning to make room for 100% happiness later, instead of dragging it out and being 50/50 sad/happy for a longer time. I believe that feelings are there because they need to be felt, and they'll go away when they are done. But I also am an INFP so...

Edit: I also mix the feeling sad with analyzing the way I feel and why. I don't think "I'm sad because we broke up". I think "What was the reason we broke up? What was or dynamic like throughout the relationship? Who had which habits and what did they stem from" etc.

It's basically Fi and Te having a party in my brain.Ahh okay. Now I see what you meant. If you look at it that way I'd say that INFPs are very social in little bursts. So I guess I agree with both of you then :)I have a friend who is an ISTP and he does that too :) actually it was one of the first thing we talked about when we got to know each other.
I don't know about other people, but I actually appreciate that in him. I like him a lot, but as an introvert I want to be able to stay friends with someone without having to talk all the time. I hate that kind of pressure. Right now we are in different parts of the country but in the fall when we go back to school I know we will be just as good friends as before we went home at the start of the summer :)Ah, I love when you can have that kind of relationship with someone. So relaxed and no pressure. All of my closest friends are like that. We might not talk for 6 months or a year, but then when we are in the same place and have time to hang out again, it's like we never stopped talking. Not the awkward "soo.... what do you do nowadays heh?" that usually happens when you've lost contact for a while. 
Apart from the doorslamming. INFPs give several new chances and try to fix the relationship. We don't give up on people. We talk about things, and if the person still doesn't change their ways we slowly phase them out. Doorslamming just isn't the INFP way.I so relate to this. I have a close friend who told me that when she first met me she thought I was too quiet and too introverted. We first met *a year* ago, and now we like each other very much. But I still felt so offended when she told me that, even though it's not at all how she feels now. I didn't let it show, of course. But it made me feel slightly annoyed when I thought about it. Whenever someone critisizes something  that is part of me but that I can't help (for example like being an introvert) I get so butt hurt.INFP here and I do that too.Yeah I think the same thing. We have different reasons to act the way we do, but the results are still pretty much the same. If someone met an INFP and an INFJ and talked for a few hours I think it would be easy to think they are the same type at first. Except that the INFJ would probably be better at small talk.I curse pretty much too, and I'm an INFP. The only one I know who curses more than I do is my boyfriend who is and INFJ. He curses *all the time*.&gt;I don't know a lot about ISFP but I identify somewhat with the type as:

&gt;- I like aesthetics, beautiful things, good design. I get moved by music and movies. If I had artistic talent, I'd probably do something like that, though I'd be very critical of my work. I do write creatively though.

&gt;- I have compassion for animals. I volunteer in a shelter.

&gt;- I prefer to understand thru examples where I can figure out the differences rather than pages of theory where I quickly get lost.

&gt;But apart from that, I'm very INFP. 

The points you listed are very INFP too, just so you know. Many types have traits that overlap. For example INFJs and INFPs act similarly (but for different reasons). 
Anyway, I do all the things you wrote about and I'm an INFP. Even the detailed memory thing. For example: 8 years ago I started high school. It was the 18th of august and I wore a black tshirt with pac man ghosts on it and the locker I got had number 137.Oh it's like that for me too. I dont remember the start of everything I've done. It was just an example. I remember that day because the day before I hung out with my best friend for the first time in three months and we found this old typing machine and talked about how frikkin nervous we were to start high school.. So I also connect memories to other things that happened around it.You can't link something that's a file on your computor. You have to upload it to imgur or something and then link that instead.I honestly don't agree with you there. I am an INFP (have done a bunch of different tests several times and gotten INFP everytine except once when it put me right in the middle of N/S) I relate way more to your description of an INFJ. I don't know about other INFPs because I don't know any, but I am self aware and everything I know is like a huge map in my head and I like to play "connect the dots" to see how everything fits together. Also I put others beforw myself to a fault, because it ends up with me being drained and not having the time to do what I needed because I was busy helping someone.

People always seem to view INFPs as  selfish emotional beings, incapable of logical thinking. Fuck that.Combination of the freefaller and the foetus (is that really how they spell it?). I am kind of half on my side and half on my stomach and have both my hands near my face. And I have the lower leg stretched out and the upper one is folded like in the foetus position. I also like sleep with an extra cover so I have something to hold on to. I don't like when my knees or elbows touch each other, for some reason.Me too. But that's the thing. Once we've fallen for it, we never do it again. After that our radar picks up on the first signs and start adding things together and keeping track of what the person does straight away.Infp - Was choosing between vet school and music. Chose music.ThisThis. It's so weird to see how everyone loves them and thinks they're great, when there's something so obviously fake about the whole thing... I don't know about other types, because I'm not educated enough about them yet. I think everyone can fall for a psychopath, especially if you're young. But as an INFP I learnt from that experience, analyzed it to bits and looked up signs etc to never fall for one again. And it has worked. I think it's that we scan and analyze the surroundings so much that really helps us. When we see a first sign our inner radars start beeping and after that we will keep an extra eye on the person. And also we will detect if somone doesn't feel genuine. It's so weird to meet someone who all of your friends like because they're so nice and charming, but to you it just feels like bad acting.INFP. Much talking. And much of the said talking being done in metaphors. Not much would get done, but everyone would always have a shoulder (or ten) to lean on. And there wouldn't be very much going on in the science world. But there would be music and art everywhere. And sometimes the streets would be empty in the middle of the day because all the INFPs needed to recharge and are hiding away in a dark hole somewhere. And much "oooh"ing and "aaah"ing going on about how beautiful the sunset is or something like that. 

.... I kind of see this as a whovian city in my head. It all seemed a little Dr. Seuss-esque.Mm, yes of course. It's scientifically proven that it's impossible to not look great in sunset lighting.I'm pretty sure I had one in my class before and I kept wondering the same thing. Are people blind or don't they care that half the things she did seemed like bad acting??Yup. So much these thingsThank you for subscribing to ~~cat~~ INFP facts! Hello mysterious cinnamonroll. I am a dreamy lost cinnamonroll. Apparently.Ehum .... r/totallynotrobots What do you mean by cinnamon rolls? Don't get me wrong, I'm not offended that you see me as a cinnamon roll, they are delicious. But would you care to elaborate? 

And also, I know this was based on your personal experiences, but I don't agree with INFPs being lost. Dreamy, sure, but not lost. If anything we're the opposite of lost. We constantly scan our surroundings and the people in it. We like analyzing a lot too, so we actually have a very good overview of most things and can also zoom in on the details if we want to. It's a hobby to many of us. When I'm bored I'll analyze people and social structures for fun. :)INFPs are rare creatures. If you really want to spot an INFP we suggest you try in their natural habitats, such as somewhere deep in the forest, or on the internet!

Unless you were asking very personal questions or something, I don't think you did anything wrong at all. Maybe she just had a bad day or has social anxiety and doesn't know how to handle it or something. It most likely hasn't got anything to do with you at least :)INFP.

I love to think about social things! Like social structures, or relationships or why someone works the way the do etc. It's like a fun puzzle, except you don't need little wooden pieces. All you need is your brain.

I also love getting nerdy when it's something I really like. For example I get pretty excited when I read about music theory or psychology. 

And I do the imagining conversations thing a lot too. It's fun!I'm not trying to be rude or boring just because I'm quiet at first. It's just that I get *exhausted* from small talk. I don't know why, but I just do. I hate it, sooo much.

And if you don't give me the side eye or look down on me for being "boring" at first (trust me I'll notice if you do), I'll feel comfortable around you and then it doesn't take long at all before I open up. And when I do, I'll be just as energized and spontaneous as you. But I'll be it in small bursts. Like I can have a day where I'm super social and out going and fun, and want to go on adventures and stuff, but then I need two or three days to wind down afterwards.Hey, you don't have to be socially competent to be a good person. I bet you're awesome when people get to know you.

It's funny because I used to think "I'm being stupid, they are not giving me a side eye, I'm just overthinking it". But then two of my classmates (who are now two close friends of mine) confessed that they used to look down on me and think I was a "boring old introvert" the first month after getting to know me. One of them even said that before we became friends she disliked all introverts. Probably because she never gave them a chance and pushed them instead of letting them do things in their own pace. 

It's also funny how people often seem to call me "butterfly" or other stupid things, because they say "you have grown so much, you're not at all shy and quiet anymore! I'm so happy I got to be part of your personal development".
Like dude, I have always been that way. I was just as social and fun before I met you, it's just that I won't let you know everything about me or ask you to go on a hike with me before I know you a little better and it takes longer than just a few days for that to happen. Sigh.I've never met another INFP, not that I know of at least, so I don't really have anything to go by. Well, maybe what other infps write in the infp sub, but a post on reddit is just a small snippet of who they are, so I don't feel like that's enough to know either.I like ISFPs! I like that you don't have to do things or talk all the time. I really appreciate just having that sense of nearness, without having to actively engage in conversation or something. With them it's like we get each other withouth having to talk too much, and even when we don't get each other it feels like that's 100% cool too. It's just over all laid back and nice!I don't think it's about *trying* to be awesome. I think it's about being you and finding the people that will love you for it. Don't underestimate yourself. As long as your intentions are good and you listen to other people and accept them, you've already met the requirements to be a decent person.

We are in the same class so we saw each other every day and had to talk because we had group projects and stuff. And eventually she realized that when she gave me a chance to be myself she really liked me, apparently. And then I started liking her when she finally let me be me without trying to change me :)

And getting to know people takes time! Just have patience :) it's not a race.Do you know why N makes us hate small talk? I don't understand the functions as wel as I'd like too, and I'd be really interested to know! :)Hmm, I don't know. I love conversations. More or less everykind of conversation except small talk. So i'm definitely ready to use it to get to know someone as long as I don't have to talk about the weather first.This fits the description of my INFJ partner too. If I want to try something new he'd be down for it, but mostly he's very uncomplicated and just wants to be in the moment. And I like that about him. I agree with you there. I (INFP) is not that stubborn. My partner (INFJ) though is stubborn like a mule. When he's upset he gets tunnel vision and can't see any other solutions until he's calmed down, and no matter what you say he can't take it in. The only thing you can do is try to stop him from making rash decisions until he's able to calm down and reevaluate the situation.The two people I am closest to are both INFJ and good god are they stubborn. And I lurked a little on the INFJ sub some time ago and they said they were pretty stubborn too.Yup this sounds like my INFJs (my dad is one too). They can be super stubborn and have tunnel vision, but as soon as they calm down they get a wider perspective and can think things through and come up with a good plan.I wrote it in another [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4vdcy8/is_it_ever_possible_to_talk_sense_into_an/d5xgh8d) earlier

Edit: I fucked up the formattingThat's not true at all. Seriously not. It might be true with an immature Fi user, but that goes for any type really. As long as someone's too immature they can't be reasoned with. 

Anyway, to reason with a Fi user is easy. Just talk to us. But don't say "You are wrong!", because then we'll get stubborn and our "not taking critisism well" trait shows up. Instead tell us what is it we are doing that you feel is wrong and why you feel that is wrong.  Like "I'd really prefer if you'd do things this way instead, because (insert reason)" or tell us how what we're doing makes you feel. Seriously it doesn't matter what we're doing or if we agree with you or not, but if you say how you feel we'll listen. We might not agree with you, but we will respect your feelings and if you tell us that you get upset by something we are doing we will really try to change or at least ask why and how it's hurting you, and then try to reach a middle ground, because we really don't want anyone to get hurt.I doubt that it has to do with her being INFP, I think it has to do with her being immature. INFPs aren't that stubborn. If someone tries to reason with us we will try to listen. We might need a few minutes to calm down, but we'll listen. Especially if you are telling us that what we are doing is hurting your feelings.Well yes, partly. But logic also works well. Like saying things that can't be denied. For example "it'll be much quicker this way because blablabla". I think the most important part is to give us a reason. *Why* do you want it do be done this or that way. Don't just tell me I'm wrong. Tell me *why*. 

Using fi should be a last resort. It'll often work, because we want to respect your feelings. But if you don't say why we are doing something wrong and instead just say it makes you sad, we'll still think you're an idiot. It's just that we want you to be a happy idiot, instead of a sad one, so we'll try to compromise anyway.Yeah. But I also think his mom's problem is that she's being immature, not that she's a fi user.&gt;I feel like people often see small talk as conversations without actual meaning, because they're so uncomfortable in silence.

This. So much this. I am comfortable with silence. I *need* the silence. I like people, but talking will make me tired, so I prefer to be silent and save my energy. I'll talk when I have something to say, otherwise I'll enjoy the silence.

That doesn't mean I can't make small talk. Of course I can, but I hate when it stays in that awkward "we're talking because I feel like the alternative is too uncomfortable". But if someone tells me about their line of work, and I'm genuinely interested in hearing more about it and we can talk about that, I'd say that it's not small talk anymore. It's just normal talking.
I really like when I meet someone else that's comfortable with silence. All you do is relax, give each other a smile and chill. And then I probably won't even mind if we start talking because I know that if we run out of topics it's okay to be silent for a while.INFP. When I withdraw from someone and then come back to them it's a sure sign I like them. Friends that are not understanding of my need to withdraw are soooo draining and I will probably have to let them go if they can't accept that I need space. The ones I keep coming back to are the ones that i value a lot!

So since your friends keep coming back to you it most likely means they appreciate you and trust you. They probably feel comfortable enough to let go for a little while, without having to worry about you not wanting to stay friends.

So don't feel under appreciated or worry about if you did something wrong. They like you and trust that your friendship is strong enough to survive a break from time to time.Interesting! Thanks for explaining!Yeah. Mine isn't stubborn all the time either. But if he's upset he'll be super stubborn until he calms down :)Hey, I thought I'd pitch in seeing as I'm also an INFP :)

I'm not the way your INFP is, at least not when it comes to bigger things. When it comes to events or plans that involve buying tickets, or booking train seats etc, I want to have a plan, as early as possible. Who is going to get the tickets, when are we leaving etc. 
Funnily enough my INFJ partner is much more like your INFP. For example last weekend we went to a friends birthday party and it included some planning because she doesn't live near us and we had to drive for several hours to get there. I had known since the middle of june that I wanted to go but I was waiting for him to decide because I didn't want to go alone. Two days before the party I ask him for the tenth time he said "yeah of course we'll go, i wanna go!" (every time I asked before that he always said "could be fun, but I don't know yet. Do we have to decide now?" And I'd always say "no, but soon. because we have to book train tickets or find people who want to go in the car with us. It's going to be too expensive otherwise"). Anyway, by then it was too expensive to get train tickets and instead he wrote on the fb event that we were going by car and that people should let us know if they wanted to tag along. That was One day before the event. And we knew that we would have to get people to go with us because the gas would be too expensive for just the two of us.
I love him but I was pretty stressed out by that. He'd had like a month to decide and I asked him at least two times a week. And we still ended up doing everything last minute. So I'm not like your INFP when it comes to things like that.

But when it comes to ordinary social things I'll be more like her. When I decide to meet with one of my friends it usually goes something like this:
We talk and say "hey it would be nice to meet. Are you free next week?" 
"Sure, second half of the week is better for me"
and then when that week starts we'll send a text or something and say "so, wednesday, thursday or friday?"  
And then "okay, so thursday it is. Afternoon-ish?"
And then we'll talk on thursday around noon and decide something along the lines of "pop by some time after four o'clock, I'll be home by then."When I'm learning something that I really want to learn, I'm very hands on and often pretty impatient. I like learning things from youtube because then I can skip to the parts I think are interesting and then just go ahead and try it myself immediately. I hate having to read in a book how to go about something. It takes too long and it's hard to find exactly what you're looking for. I've gotten better at being patient as I've gotten older though. I know that if I take my time and get a good overview of what to do, before doing it, I probably won't have to do it over and over before I succeed. But when I was younger I was all about trial and error.I get drained by any social situation, but especially when it involves meeting new people. I like it and get very energized and outgoing when it's all happening, but afterwards I get so incredibly tired. The other day I met two old friends and they brought two friends of theirs that I had never met before. I had *so* much fun. It was probably the most fun I've had in a few months to be honest. But the day after I felt like I hadn't slept in a week, because I was so tired. Thanks for making this post. I've thought about it for so long but I never felt like I could phrase it right. But you did. You phrased it perfectly.I think ENFJ is likely to let a charming goofyness shine through early. At least thats my experience. But I think all types can be goofy as long as they are comfortable :)So I did another test and it suggested I might be an [INFP, an INFJ, an ISFP or a ISFJ.](http://www.truity.com/personality-test/test-results/2875580)

I'm pretty sure I'm not an ISFJ. But I felt that the other three were all pretty accurate. I don't know if it the fact that I am an [hsp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_processing_sensitivity) might be why I find it hard to figure out my type? Do any of you have any knowledge/experience when it comes to figuring out your type when you're an hsp?

If any of you have any suggestions on how to better figure out my type, I'd be thankful! :)

Thanks for reading!I'm often hearing about what flaws people think other types have, but never which flaws they think their own type has. So what do you think is a flaw that your type often seem to have? Don't forget to say which type you are aswell :)

I'll start. I am an INFP and I think we have a tendency to overthink things, and that we can take things too personally.
&gt;What do you consider yourself in a religious sense:

Orthodox Christian (Specifically Russian Orthodox)

&gt;Are you Gnostic or Agnostic:

Agnostic.

&gt;What are the reasons for you being (Orthodox Christian):

This is not a simple answer but I suppose you can say I was convinced by various miracles, personal experience, rational arguments for God (like Aquinas arguments), and intuitive feelings for there to be a God. Why specifically Orthodox Christian? The Mysticism and theology behind it, I agree with.

&gt;Is religion important to you:

Incredibly so. When I was a atheist-nihilist I was incredibly depressed and suicidal, religion/spirituality has brought much in my life.

&gt;Have you ever changed your belief in your life: 

Many times. I was raised Atheist but converted to Buddhism then to Catholicism now Orthodox Christianity. I've had moments when I wanted to convert to Paganism, Hinduism, Islam but never went to strong with it.

&gt;Why did you change your belief, what led to you to it: 

I converted to Buddhism because I agreed with it's philosophy a ton and brought me strong purpose and happiness to my life, after a while I started finding personal trouble with Karma and reincarnation so I went searching for a different religion. With my deep spiritual experience in Buddhism I was more open to the idea of a God so I eventually went to Catholicism, for reasons listed above, then eventually Orthodox since I found I disagreed with Papal Supremacy.

 &gt;Have you ever argued for your religion or against:

All the time, even today I have. It's fun but incredibly draining.

&gt;If you do argue what arguments to you tend to stick too:

I typically do the first cause argument but recently I've found it more useful to understand what epistemological position someone is coming from. If they adhere to scientism/materialism then I find that it's pointless to argue a transcendent/immaterial position towards someone who's a materialist, I typically get them to start questioning scientism/materialism then I can somewhat proceed to argue why I believe what I believe. 

&gt;How do you feel about religion:

Religion in all its forms has done great things and terrible things, all humans are guilty of this, including Atheist. I detest religions that are inherently harmful like Scientology and Westboro Baptist and Wahhabist/Salafist Islam. But I don't say we should get rid of all religions, I think that's absurd. OP says "it's (religion) been used to justify killing and destroying and now its used to teach children that science is incorrect" I hear this all the time but honestly when we look at how many wars have been committed only 7% have been in the name of religion. As for teaching kids that science is wrong, I'm totally with you all the way. I detest Christian denominations that teach biblical literalism and creationism, Orthodox Christianity is compatible with Evolution and The Big Bang Theory, in fact our sister church (Roman Catholic Church) had a priest who brought forth the big bang theory. In short, religion is sometimes cool and sometimes bad just like humans.You see, Muhammad and Jesus were actual people. Muhammad it's pretty easy to show he existed since he ran his own fucking empire. With Jesus there's non christian sources that do show that he existed, I think the most famous of them is a Roman historian named Tacitus. Now as for the Divinity of Jesus or the validity of the Quran I suggest going to r/Christianity or r/Islam but I would probably be more polite cause you're not going to go far if you're just going to ridicule them or just use false equivalencies.  Samwise Gamgee - INFP(I haven't read the books yet so this I'm basing what I'm saying on the movie) Sam is no way a Extrovert and Frodo is no way a Intuitive. Frodo has a bad judgement and is often oblivious while Sam has a strong intuition, knowing that Golem was always bad and wouldn't change for example, and Frodo was putting his trust on Golem over his friend Sam which I could never see a INFP do. Sam is incredibly idealistic while Frodo is most of the time pretty cynical. Sam is really loyal to Frodo and you see his spirit break only when Frodo tells him to go home but still Sam was loyal to Frodo and came back. Sam motives just seem to help his friend Frodo and go back to the shire and marry the girl he loves, if that doesn't sound like an INFP then idk what is :)Tbh I can see how Sam can be a xSFJ though I have doubts about Frodo being an INFP. You say that he puts his idealization before his intuition concerning Gollum, maybe it's me personally speaking but in most cases I trust my intuition over my idealism when it comes to trusting people but that just might be me and most INFPs are the opposite. 

I felt as though Sam was an INFP because of his strong idealization that kept him going through the entire quest, whilst with Frodo he seemed to keep going, not because he was wanting to fulfill some type of fantasy/ideal/dream etc., but more of him doing it just because it was more of a job he was given. Though you do make a fair point that Sam is more of a creature of comfort.

As for your last part of saying that "of course he would propose to a girl after all that shit", before Frodo and Sam saved middle earth Sam would sometimes talk about the girl he loves and wanting to go back and propose to her. INFPs are often seen as "hopeless romantics" so I was maybe projecting a sense of hopeless romanticism as well as a romantic ideal, that would keep me going on this type of quest, onto Sam.INTJ or INTP? INFP Catholic. 
INFP, I got the same as you.Yeah, we came in 3rd overall! Woohoo! 
(We're just really not used to winning stuff.)
Same. 😊Rowling has identified herself as an INFJ, but her writing and social media presence pretty much scream INFP. I can see why many people type her INFP.
Still, she knows herself better than the rest of us do, so...🤷🏻‍♀️I'm terrible at describing it, but it's super heavy on the Fi (misfits rising up against the system and going against tradition and social norms to fight for what is right, etc) and Ne (very whimiscal humorous style w unexpected turns of phrase.) There's also some quotes on [this page](https://www.idrlabs.com/infp.php) that illustrate my point.

But she insists she's INFJ and she would know better than the rest of us.Same! I like seeing people navigate different situations, wondering what I would do in their place, and speculating about their motivations— even trying to type them![vs INFP...](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-crying-boy-with-a-gun-on-the-coast-76113280.html?pv=1&amp;stamp=2&amp;imageid=82A8619D-4F28-4AD8-A62F-D67C6389CE1A&amp;p=225492&amp;n=0&amp;orientation=0&amp;pn=1&amp;searchtype=0&amp;IsFromSearch=1&amp;srch=foo%3dbar%26st%3d0%26pn%3d1%26ps%3d100%26sortby%3d2%26resultview%3dsortbyPopular%26npgs%3d0%26qt%3dyoung%2520boy%2520crying%2520on%2520beach%26qt_raw%3dyoung%2520boy%2520crying%2520on%2520beach%26lic%3d3%26mr%3d0%26pr%3d0%26ot%3d0%26creative%3d%26ag%3d0%26hc%3d0%26pc%3d%26blackwhite%3d%26cutout%3d%26tbar%3d1%26et%3d0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3d0%26loc%3d0%26imgt%3d0%26dtfr%3d%26dtto%3d%26size%3d0xFF%26archive%3d1%26groupid%3d%26pseudoid%3d%26a%3d%26cdid%3d%26cdsrt%3d%26name%3d%26qn%3d%26apalib%3d%26apalic%3d%26lightbox%3d%26gname%3d%26gtype%3d%26xstx%3d0%26simid%3d%26saveQry%3d%26editorial%3d1%26nu%3d%26t%3d%26edoptin%3d%26customgeoip%3d%26cap%3d1%26cbstore%3d1%26vd%3d0%26lb%3d%26fi%3d2%26edrf%3d%26ispremium%3d1%26flip%3d0%26pl%3d)Yessss!I agree!
