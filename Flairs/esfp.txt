ESFP...IS literally your runner up. Why do I say this? Because ENFP and ESFPs are almost similar and I cannot tell which one I am. Half the time I am ENFP the other half I am ESFP...I just don't know what I am....I guess I am ENFP then :cI tend to read between the lines? Well I tend to have a hard time focusing reading line by line if that makes sense. So I would say between the lines If texting didn't exist my life would be a lot better rofl.....oh man..imagine a world without texting. I would enjoy it tbh!All I can think of when I look at my hand are like the lines and how they connect and if there are any patterns or not. I don't work out much BUT after a workout I feel so energized PHYSICALLY. When I do have dreams it is something that can physically happen. It is hardly something that is magical or fantasy related. Ok so for the most part when I am just dreaming about stuff in my sleep, I do not worry about them being happening like I want it. Like for example sometimes I have sexual dreams but do I worry if it will happen or not? No not really. I am a 21 year old male living in USA and am an Information Technology major. 

-I like to break rules that are pretty unreasonable 

-I do like to talk to people but i prefer smaller groups and I get tensed up if I have to do stuff like public speaking. I am very good at one on one communication. 

-When people just see me in general without talking to me, they think I am a very quiet person. Once they start talking to me, they think of me very differently

-I learn by doing things instead of reading and thinking

-When I have dreams, they are mainly of this world and of what can happen. Not something that is like where Yoda comes to kill me, this rarely happens to me. 

-I am not very creative

-I love video games

-I need my alone time, if I am out with people for too long I start doing crazy things. 

-I have an easy time making friends

-I tend to hide my negative emotions, BUT anger is something I cannot hold for the most part. My sadness is pretty hidden. The positive emotions are seen from me 99% of the time. 

-I do not really mark my calendar for dates of what will happen, I am not a long term planner

-When I am sad I prefer to be alone instead of being outside

-I am a huge flirt (very touchy). I always have been and always will be.  :D

-I do not like routine that is very strict. I want some freedom when I have a routine. 

-I ABSOLUTELY HATE TEXTING. This is especially true if I am trying to pursue someone. I prefer to talk to someone on the phone or see them in person. Seeing them in person is number one for me. 

-I get annoyed when someone corrects another person's grammar in an ONLINE VIDEO GAME. Like come on people, this is not a professional thing...as long as we understand what they are saying, why does it matter?!

-People come to me for advice but if I am trying to get with them as more than a friend I don't give them advice. My philosophy is this, if someone gets themselves in trouble, I let THEM handle it on their own. If it is not their fault such as an injury I am willing to help.

-I tend to be more lenient on kids when it comes to doing work but if they are at least 10 years old and they behave badly, that's when I bring the horn out. You are very closeI am actually an ESFPExtraverted feeling is more like showing your emotions as opposed to keeping it in or just saying itThis video will help you 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a1zR3xiKAEHa you sound just like me except I am a little confused about if I am ENFP or ESFP but more leaning towards ENFP. Anyways. You guys are just like the ESFPs for the most part. 

You guys love to live in the present moment except you guys are hard to get to know since yall are introverted. This is in some cases. 

Oh and a famous ISFP is Michael Jackson. Go figure!Lmao...and I thought I WAS SENSITIVE! :DI am an ENFP
I would like to be an ENTJ or an INTJENFP here and I like red moreLike here is my issue. When I see a not so attractive women or I see a random dude, it is sooo EASY for me to talk to them. But when I see an attractive girl for the first time...the first 30 seconds are me being super nervous and then I ease down...Nothing wrong with being nervous...? Nice joke you got there :c

Ladies hate it when they are being approached by a man who is nervous :cAh ok well here's the thing, we are both in our early 20s. Hopefully things are similar in this aspectI would die on the inside if I worked at your place....I am an ENFP.....this is daunting to meWell...urgh.....before I knew about MBTI I would be frustrated with introverts for not wanting to hang out with me enough....zzz....I understand that you guys need space, I do to but that much space??? Grr..... &gt;.&lt;I am an ENFP....and I am so sure that the people who have made fun of me were like ESTPs....

Now for hate....I would have to go with...ENTPs.... :c

I do not enjoy being hated but I am trying my best to not let it bother me anymore. When I see that someone is naturally grumpy, I let that negative energy out of my way Well let me tell you a little something about us ENFPs....we appear happy and we can hide our sadness for the most part. You sound just like me for the most part. Except for doing exceptional in academics. I hated high school so much. I got bullied if anything. Now that I am in college, more people love me. So glad I am out of high schoolI feel much better now to be honest. So like he left about 12 hours ago, I was devastated. But after my workout I felt a lot happier so I am fine now. I do feel lonely now though...then again I know I'll be fine in a week. This loneliness is what's killing me. If you still have low self esteem issues just start working out. I started working out today and wow...I felt so confident earlier today knowing that I did all that stuff in the gym today and it feels good to. Thank you for your response. I have actually figured out that I am indeed an ENFP. Here's the thing. ESFPs love to be out with people for the most part and are like one of the last people to be drained by parties. 

Here's my situation, I let people do the talking at parties. But when it is one on one situation, I do the talking for the most part unless of course the person is more extroverted than me. So like I am basically an ambivert you can say. I REALLY NEED MY ALONE TIME. So I have it figured out. Also when I listen to certain types of music, I get lost in thought. Have you heard of the genre Trance? That's typically what I listen to in order to relax. There are times I do get lot in the world when I am listening to this kind of music. An example of an artist I listen to is ATB. 

My MBTI is unknown. I am an ExFP. The 2nd letter is very confusing for me as to what I am. Thank you for this. It's pretty clear that I am an ESFP. Especially with point numbers 5, 17, 20, 29, 30How do you feel about being friends with an ESFP? Also dating an ESFP, how do you feel about this? I am just...sick of being called a nice guy overall &gt;.&lt;

It has gotten me nothing but pain...hope you understand why I am a little TOO blunt now21 Turning 22 in 5 monthsWell then...I am not a J for sure...and here's the thing. My P is significantly larger than my J. Not even borderline close. I am a messy person. 

But I definitely do have Fi. Why? Because I thought about my past. My past when I talked with people, it wasn't hard for me to relate to the situations. It wasn't awkward for me to talk to them about it. It does not matter who you are. Also I hide my sadness a lot. I just want to appear a very happy person. I do not like letting out negative energy unless it's anger. 

It's alright. We all make mistakes. No one is perfect. But yes, I looked at the cognitive functions of both the ESFP and ESFJs and well..the only time I use Si is when something REALLY good or REALLY bad happened. But I am very much more of a Se user. 

How do I know this? Thought about my past once again, I would be the first one to notice someone's phone ringing about 90% of the time. Also recently I was very confused with being an ENFP or ESFP but once I saw the cognitive functions, I definitely knew I was an ESFP. So I have 0 doubts. 

Maybe the way I sound is like an Fe but am I really? NahHello there. ESFP here. Fi is my auxillary function. So basically Fi is where you can relate to people's feelings in situations they are in and they have been in. People who have Fi as primary or auxillary have an easy time going into that emotional state that the person is in. 
Often times Fi users make decisions based on their feelings instead of logic. Fi are sensitive people. Understand this. YES THIS INCLUDES ME. But back to the point, Fi users tend to sugarcoat things to save feelings of another person when it's something negative they are thinking. Of course there are exceptions.  

Since Fi is your inferior function, you do not really use this function much. It is there but it is used occasionally. Now one question to you. When you are in an emotional situation, do you feel awkward or uncomfortable?I must know something though. When you guys do this, what should people do to ease the pain? 

Like for example. I am pretty blunt and like to tell the truth nowadays instead of sugarcoating things because in the past I have lost friends because of sugarcoating things. I dont understand how you would think that function stacks are bs. Really. I don't get it. 

ESFP here. Before I knew about my dominant functions, the Se and Fi applied to me in most of my life. I am not just saying this....I am saying it because it is true...like let me give you a few examples as to why I feel function dynamics are NOT BS. 

Often times when I am in a quiet area, I would be the first or one of the first people to hear something, feel something, or just sense something in general. That's how my Se just kicks in. It's just natural for me. 

As for my Fi, when people feel a certain way, especially if it's someone I care about...I can easily relate to their feelings. ESFP here. To me it all depends on the person. If it's like some attractive girl doing this to me, I like it. I am VERY ticklish. But if it's some dude or someone who I do not find attractive.....I get pissed off.

When it comes to winning or losing, it's about 50/50. 

While you believe what you posted was weird, it IS weird. But guess what? WEIRD IS AWESOME! If one isn't weird, then...they are most likely boring. You know...now that I really think about how I am in social settings, I tend to be very expressive when I have positive emotions. But when it's negative, I keep it to myself. Depending on where I am at. The only exception to this is anger.

But ya...I do sound more of an Fe user. ESFP here and scored 15http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/16Types/ESFP.cfmI won't lie. Lying requires too much remembering of things. And guess what? I forget things a lot. So lying does me no good. When people look at me, they think I am this quiet person who won't do anything. Once they start talking to me, they are surprised with what I am rofl. 

People think I am weird in a good way. ESFP here btw. I manipulate people when needed. I don't do this for fun now lol..don't get the wrong idea. For the most part I am blunt nowadays. ESFP here btwCertainly not a scholar. But let's be real here. I am blunt nowadays for a reason. I am tired of being called this nice guy. That doesn't happen anymore. 

You probably thinking that they call me a jerk. Well I don't get called that either. So I hope you understand why I am blunt nowadays...Sorry. Hard to tell a joke just from the text itself. Don't hate me pls :cThis type is known as A-S-S-H-O-L-EIt's just that when I start talking to them...boom they just seem to hate life. Like....it makes me die on the inside a little :c

If only I could read minds. Too bad I can't :cI know I'm crazy and I'm PROUD of it. Being NOT crazy is BORING. I have a low tolerance for bullshit. So my guess would be feeling types. Especially if they are Fi. HAAAAA Se is so true....so is Fi....y u offend me? :cWell I work at McDonalds and well what do you know? Most of us are ESxx. No doubt about it at all. Should this be surprising to you? Nope. S types are not open? Is that what you are saying? 

I agree with the others but S?? No. I'm a sensor and I'm an open person..Wow. Got 18 and I am an ESFP. Even though I have Fi as my auxillary I got 18? LOL. I am so bad at reading people I guess. I am going to guess that N types are going to score higher than S types. You are right, dealing with it is not hard for me. But man...labeling is something I just suck at and need to get better at so that things go better for me in the future. 

Just dealing with it doesn't cut it for me. I need and want to have both. So I got 

Independence
Aggression
ExhibitionismKeep calling people out on their bullshit. No seriously don't stop. When I started doing that people started respecting me a lot more....they don't take me as a pushover anymoreI got Woody Harrelson In my eyes reading emotions is a lot better than feeling it. I wish I had that instead of being able to feel emotions. Feels like I am cursed tbh. 

Able to read emotions is sooo much more helpful. Thanks for the long rant. No really. I needed to know why you guys are the way you are anyways. 

You are right, we do not like to talk about theories. Why do I feel this way? Because it is simply just boring to us. There are some "what ifs" I do like to talk about such as like "What if Yoda was real and he became a sith lord?"  

See where I'm coming from? 

Also I dumped some girl in the past all because she just talked about school...I bring about my vacations, what does she do? talk about school school school.....like...that pissed me off. 

Hope that opens your eyes as to how ESFPs like me usually are. I have been in love before and everytime I saw this certain girl at that time, my heart would just melt. It's not like "Oh my she's looking good, must **** her." It was more than that.

And this is RARE for me. This can possibly be an Fi thing. Like about 3 months ago everytime I would see this certain girl, I just can't help but smile. Remember. This is rare. 

I'm glad it's rare to. Shows that I don't fall in love easily. Reading people's emotions at the moment. Like for example, if you are talking to someone, are they bored or intrigued? Or are they hiding emotions? Like that's what I meanI thought people hated ESFPs if anything. I feel hated tbh. I swear. All my life I have been struggling to read people. Grr....I feel that having Se dom as a curse :cThanks :DHappy birthday my fellow ESFPI honestly feel that people just don't understand ESFPs like me :c

From my point of view INFPs are hard to understandESFP here. I hate people who like to put others down for FUN. I also hate it when people think they are all that when they are CLEARLY inferior in that certain area. I also hate people who love to talk about politics and religion. 

I love it when people are playful, especially females. Also like it when they are open minded. 

I just want people to understand me overall. Instead of being judgemental....I need my music....without it I cannot concentrate. ENFP or ESFPs like me. 

I do not mind deep conversations however, it better not be about politics or religionI honestly feel that the super religious people are more likely to be the N type rather than the S type.

Think about it. N types imagine things like the afterlife. So S types really do this? Not really. That's my problem. I make it look obvious :cThis here is why I do not want to be close friends with an INFP. Because they just do that. I do not like people who do that. If I know I pissed them off, I totally get it. 

Actually you know what? This is why I hate being close with people. Because they end up having to go away or they run away from me. :21 I honestly just hate myself a lot of times. What you said about ESFPs....ok....why are you stalking me lol? :D

Seriously. I do feel this way. A LOT. The main reason why I hate being a feeler type is because I'm too sensitive....why do I not have thick skin? What's wrong with me? Why am I such a baby? &gt;.&lt;Honestly I feel that what you said is absolutely inaccurate. Why do I feel this way? Because feelers are usually a lot more sensitive...and thinkers usually don't care about what other people think of them..

You kind of see where I'm coming from for the most part? This is how I feel. No. Why?You SHOULD be pissed at people for believing in that astrology crap. So just because I was born in February I am imaginative? An escapist? Like come on peoples. 

TheG3cko I am glad you don't believe in this crap. For those of you who do....please think about that logic. So being born in a certain time of the year means I am those things? LMAO. For me personally I grow closer to people with actions. And trust me, when a person is talking to me, they know whether Im interested or not. 

Also I tend to grow closer to people who I can relate to. If I feel like I cannot trust you or you give me negative vibes, I WILL find ways to AVOID that person. I do grow closer to people with deep conversations but does that happen a lot FROM deep conversations? Nope. For males it's ESTP. For females...im not so sureSame here. FeelsbadmanESTP but personable? LOLCertainly not ESFPs...well...specifically male ESFPs like me :cI got an enneagram of 7. 

http://www.enneagramcentral.com/OnlineTest/testc_c1.htmBecause often times people are confused with what type they are. It's like one or the other.

For example me, I was confused as to whether or not I was an ENFP or ESFP. 

Took a socionics test, said I was ISFP and I also got an Enneagram of 7. So I am surely an ESFP. I got an eneagram of 7Yaaaaaa not once have I had this thought even until now at 21. Definitely an N type.At first I was like "What the hell?" and then a few seconds later I'm like "meh, whatever" 30% I am just laughing right now.

Wait no I'm not...that's me cryingI get distracted by words hardly. Se dom here. 

But understand this, this is not a common thing for me. I can sometimes "appear" to be distracted when in reality I am just playing along with moving onto the next topic. This is rare for me. I am an Se user btw. Well then. Fi = my secondary. So that would explain why I daydream a lot. I dont think I have ever heard of ESTPs or ISTPs to be daydreamers. The Fi really plays in for me. Now that I think about it, I always had Fi especially as a kid. 

Maybe ESTPs or ISTPs are LEAST likely to daydream. I even think about the people in my life who are potentially ESTPs, they rarely get lost in their own world. ESFP here. I know you guys will be like "What, you an ESFP? WTF?!"

http://imgur.com/a/lpeAhI don't normally look happy in pictures lol

But when you talk to me it's a different story unless...you give me negative vibesWhats your type anyways? Also my vibes are naturally positive. Well...damn...you DO look like a feeler. Looks are so deceiving rofl. Also, you DO NOT have a boring face. Seriously nowWell...I am working on the complaining part tbh. However. When I am pissed, I let it out. Anger is something I don't hold in unless I am at work or at a place where I must hold it in. 

So many things to work on. Honestly if I could change one letter about myself, I wish I was a thinker and not a feeler. Hate that im so sensitive &gt;.&lt;Well you have me. The ambiverted ESFP. ESFP here and I want the truth as well. No BS. In fact I am one of those people that will call you out on your BS depending on the situation. Like if it's a public place, I will not call you out.

But if it's private, I will hit them hard. Fi user here and I believe that the morality is more gray than black and white. 

I mean let's be real here. Everyone is basically gray. Everyone has white and black inside them. No one has one. I mean sure sometimes the whiteness of some people may not be visible but it's down there deep somewhere. 
Authenticity is very important to me. I do not like to jump to conclusions until I know something is authentic. That's because from the descriptions of strengths and weaknesses we are very similar. The only difference is the intuition part. That's the only difference I see between usYou sound like this girl in my class...always trying to get away from me...

I guess INFPs for the most part don't like me lol..I told someone to go kill themselves by drinking bleach and that no one loves them and no one will ever want them because they are worthless. 

(I only said that to this person because he's notorious for being a dick)Are you in HS or college? Because most friends come in college. Trust me on thisWell. When it comes to movies I always look at ratings. The Godfather...that movie though...

So here's the deal, I am sending you off to Vegas. XDYou need to let her not run over you like this man. You need to man up. I know it's easier said than done but you need to really tell her that. 

She can't get upset at you for not wanting to do that. If you told her that you have homework, which is the truth, she would have understood for sure. 

So in other words, yes. What you did was wrong. A bit too idealisticLMAOYou sound like the most introverted person out thereI try to be like a thinker. I hate the feeling aspect. Seriously. What upsets me is this "emotional intelligence" has hardly ever favored me. Which is why I hate being a feeling type. Makes me wish I was an ESTP...This "emotional intelligence" has always led me to the friend zone and on top of that I got taken advantage of. 

So there's your answer. I HATE being a feeler. I wish you can take my F and I can take your T. &gt;.&lt;It's like I do someone a favor and they never repay me back. Instead it's the opposite. I get backstabbed. Like....I try to be cold hearted now because of things like this &gt;.&lt;So you are ok with gas prices going up by a lot? Ok got it....&gt;.&lt;"Time to use the train or the bus" 

You realize that not everyone lives in places like New York City right? Oh wait. You don't. You already think I am fat rofl. You don't even know what I look like. How the hell would you know if I was fat or not? So you are telling me, I should have to walk 6 miles to class and 6 miles back home 4 times a week? Ya. I doubt even YOU would do that. "Loving your enemies" 

That's very contradictory. How can you love someone that's your enemy??ESFP and I love sweet stuffHow the hell did you get in a relationship with him in the first place if he is THAT boring?"Ne and Se seem to be the middle ground for talkative-ness. Both Se and Ne doms can be very talkative, but can also be quiet and sit back and observe."

You just described me lol. When I am around some of my friends, I am so quiet BUT the other half I am the one talking lol...What?! Does she live under a rock?!

Ok but seriously though...you broke a friendship because of THAT? 

Ok I was about to say.....if that was true we would never get along lol....

Then again I realize that people are only getting stupider when it comes to street smarts. Books? Not so sureThe term is called ambivert. Guess what? I am one to. Shocking right? My type is known to be the most extroverted but is that the case for me? HELL NO. 

When I am around like alpha males, they are the ones doing the talking, me not so much. But when I around like introverts and others, I am the one doing the talking. 

So we are basically on the same pageIn my mind "Oh ya, you better feel bad because you KNOW I'm right." I sometimes have done this to the point where I make them feel worthless XDI can't help but laugh at this. ESFP here and I would have to say that about half the people I encounter in my classes are N types. 

I study IT btw. I HATE the programming aspect of it. The networks aspect where you put the cables, now that's what I like. People are saying you are ISFP? These guys know better than me. Maybe you are.

But really...an ISFP acts like this? :o

So the introverted version of me is like this sometimes? :o

I guess we learn something everyday.Let's see how this goes for me roflESFP 14/40

I dont know how I feel about this. I know I am not narcissistic because I can admit when I am wrong in things unlike some people in this world &gt;.&lt;

Then again sometimes I feel superior to some people. So mehhhHonestly the easiest people for me to talk to are often ESTP males. That is because I can actually relate to them in many ways.

Hardest for me are ENTPs.....and some introverts. Maybe INFPs....they just....don't like me....they think I'm obnoxious. I'm sure of it. 

If they think I'm obnoxious, they should see my friends XD

Also the types of people who I do not like are those who think they are always right even when they are clearly wrong AND those who give negative energy...basically ruining the vibe of the environment...bringing in that negative energy &gt;.&lt;I wouldn't say that it is common or rare for ISTPs in general. Maybe UNHEALTHY ISTPS it's common?

Here's the thing. There is an ISTP in my Chemistry class and we get along great. In class he only talks to me, 1 other guy, and 1 girl.

"Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard." 

Unfortunately I oppose this. I used to favor this but now it's a different story. I have to do what I must. Tired of people thinking I am this nice guy...you know? Don't get called this much anymore. Things are going a lot better for meDescribes me 100%...Congratulations you are my polar opposite. I must meet you in person 💩Hunter. I must slay them all.Who knows? Maybe some of the ENFJs are mistyped but are ESFJ? I know I'm not a j. My room is always messy and I tend to procrastinate 90% of the timeUnfortunately there just are no people in the ESFP subreddit. I have seen like maybe four other ESFPs in this subreddit though. It's nice to see another ESFP post. I feel left out tbh.....and I tend to post the most at night on weekdaysThe thing with me is I'm out during the day for the most part. Night time is when I'm home usually. Lol thanks. Tbh I feel hated in these forums often then again, that might be me being an unhealthy ESFP Thanks man but seriously some of the ENTPs and ENTJs really get to me. Sometimes I feel like NOT posting anything. They intimidate me verbally both online and irlThe problem with me is that I have low self esteem. So now you understand why I feel so hated?
Your fellow brethren ESFP coming in hot 😀

I can see people confusing their N and S if anything. I know I did. Because ENFP and ESFP are so SIMILAR externally. I'm more laid back tbh. My enneagram is 7 is well. But the issue I have is low self esteemEXFP. Leaning towards ENFP because you like to read about theory4.2 ESFP here

I'm surprised I'm average because some of my answers were on the extreme endENTPS maybe. As soon as I saw argument I instantly thought ENTPSe. You will think I'm writing in Chinese roflDo you like to read about abstract concepts? 

Are you more about the moment or the future? 

Is your room and workplace usually clean or messy? 

Do you naturally care about other's feelings? Are you oblivious that you hurt someone usually? Ya ISFP fits you more. Congrats you are the introverted version of meYou guys are the EASIEST to spot if anything. No one knows I am an ESFP.

I have a feeling that when people will find out I am an ESFP, they will be surprised because I come off as quiet sometimes. Especially the ladies.Well if I understand a hard concept from a class like chemistry, I get pumped up. Even more after I do well on an exam. This definitely describes ESFPs like me. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdih7kjmQJwWatch me be the only ESTP in that chat for a while. I'm calling itYour scores on these two dimensions follow:

Idealism: 3
Relativism: 4
I honestly feel that you are ISFP. You are right. My T and F are like borderline. That's the thing but I have been doing a lot of thinking about my past especially this past year and it looks like I am more logic than feeling. 

You can't really say that ESFPs and ESTPs are THAT different now can you? Both use Se as their primaryI find it funny that people believe in astrology.

Why believe in something that is based on the month and day you are born on?

So because someone is born in Febuary they are a Pisces or Aquarius? ENTx?My mindset is to help them out if they are struggling. That's if I am not in a rush. It's confusing to me tbh. I might be an ESTP tbh. My T and F preference is like borderline. It feels like I use Fi and Fe equally. Like it's weird. 

If it helps I do care about what others think of me. So is that more of an Fe thing? This was always the thing. What you said about Se doms describes me. It's funny. I feel like you are stalking me. Y u do dis? XD

I was always direct even before knowing about how Se doms talk. I always do emphasize things to especially in text. Shut up Nixon. Trump is THE BEST!When people say that feeling types cannot be logical, especially Fi or Fe doms, how does that make you feel? 

How do you react to that when people say that?

And what would you say the main difference between Fi/Te and Fe/Ti be?Here is how I doorslam people. I doorslam people one of two ways.

1st way, if I barely know you and I hate your guts, you WILL know it. I completely doorslam you right away. Like it's 100% apparent.

2nd way, if I know you for quite some time and you turned into a completely different person than what you were initially (an awesome person), then I will contact them less and less and evantually ghost them completely.                                                                                                                                       Well.....as an ISFP I would most likely end up in prison for sexual harassment. Ya I don't know about other ISFPs but that's just me. Ya you sound just like me. The only difference is that I do have low self-esteem and my enneagram is 6w7. Can't tell if you're trolling or...

But ya, I turn into one instantly since I don't take people's crap anymore
I hate being an ISFP. Especially as a male. Makes things harder especially in this society. Sure I make friends easily but I always get friendzoned. Meanwhile my ESTP friends almost never get stuck in the friend zone. Ya you're not wrong about the ISFP one. At least for me that is. I was a mid lane main for the most partISFP perfectionist? Eh I wouldn't really say that. I think we are like this under stress?I am the same as youYou sound just like me in this aspectINFP is a stupid type? LOL. People associate that with SF types if anything. Is this something Ni doms seem to do with like almost everything? They are so into what they are doing to the point that they are not around of their surroundings?All fi doms are narcissistic babies? Lol maybe that's only you. Never listen to anyone? Stop your trolling. You failed. Well OP being an ISFP isn't easy either. Fi dom just like you...I just hate that I am a male feeler. Why couldn't I have been a thinker?

I would have enjoyed being an ENTJ of all types. 2nd place comes INTJ. I like the functions I have but the order they are in? Hell no! Being a male feeler in today's society is hard. In fact I try to act like a thinker now. I hate that I feel things a lot. How are they real sticks in the mud? They actually get stuff done and think logically first instead of with their feelings first....

I do my best to think logically first but it just doesn't happen and it pisses me off. We are so self loathing especially male Fi doms because we get taken advantage of. Are not seen as a man. I am 22 right now btw. But ya. Can you seriously blame us for self loathing ourselves? 

The minute a man opens up about his feelings they are seen as feminine right up. i overthink things when i am just bothered by something. You know what feelings are? WHAT?! XDIt's weird how when people see my face they automatically detect Fi in me. They just don't know where in the stack. I am expressive though normally. ISFP who plays Reaper, Zarya, and Mercy if healer is needed. ISFP majoring in comp sci :PLol nice joke but on a serious note I'd keep my hair black :PI do enjoy my classes but the sucky part is when I try to start a project I have no idea where to start or what idea to come up with....I have had this issue since I was a kid....but once I am in the middle of the project I actually get stuff done fast.....it's dumb..Is that why I sometimes act kind of...Fe like at times? POLR function means the 7th function. So as an INFP your seventh function happens to be Se. While for me it's Ne. So basically you take any type's 3rd function and switch it to introvert or extrovert. 

I don't know if you guys would consider ISFPs to be one of them. Sure we use Fi first. Then again I am naturally social, especially to those I know. I don't have a hard time making friends either so there is that. You have an ISFP husband while you're an ENTJ? I wonder how that plays out...I become like this very controlling and cold guyPassive aggressive asf? Ya. I can't help it. That's just me. But force me to be actually aggressive, you can say good bye to your soul at that point. Is that why Te inferior can come off as scary? XDESTPs seem to be naturally aggressive as it is so they don't seem scary to me because it is so expected from them to be angry. Same deal for like Te doms. Role Ne sucks school wise. I remember that I always had a hard time coming up with an idea to do projects....I struggle with starting things but once I get to the middle ground, bam I keep on going. That's what I meant. MybJokes on you. I'm like close to the opposite of a ginger XDTBH I always thought those 2 would be the worst if not them then ISTP and ENFJ. 

The Fe conflict. IxTP would be like "Stop being so Fe" and ExFJ would be like "You need to stop being so cold and be more Fe"Angelina Jolie - ESTPTruth be told I am indifferent to things I don't care about. I don't see this world as black and white. There are some matters that I am very black and white about but usually it's a grey world to me. When I pause I sometimes tend to look somewhere else and then focus back to them and continue my sentence. Oh no....look what I have createdFi dom vs Role Fi. Hnnnng!Ts in general are meaner than Fs EXTERNALLY. 

But back to the point. I can assure you that most of these "INTPs" are mistyped. As usual. I don't understand why anyone would want to pretend to be an INTP unless it's for work purposes. 

Inferior Fe is extremely disturbing....or heck even Polr Fe. But anyways. I think that the true INTPs in the past would get lynched for not following societies rules or whatnot. When I ask this, I mean the Fi types who are primary or auxillarySo like...here's the thing. I used to lie to people to save their feelings when I am asked about something. I am pretty much blunt now. I used to be called a nice guy but that's no longer the case. 

But nowadays I am harsh at first but then I ease them down by saying "I am saying this for your own good, I would rather tell you the truth than lie to you. Because if I lie to you right now you find out, you will feel betrayed, so please don't be too upset with me. You will thank me later, believe me." 

Like the thing is people get along with me so easily for the most part. It takes me almost 0 effort to make new friends. Like seriously. It amazes me that people believe in that. Like think about it, just because someone is born in a certain time of the year, they act that way? Does that not sound ridiculous? Sure I have read some things about it but then I realized that it's all a COINCIDENCE. I highly doubt that all pisces are emotional....and they are intuitive??? Ya sure emotional sure but intuitive? Hell no. 

Like...come on now....people are usually the way they are because of their type which leads on to their 4 cognitive functions. This is for most cases assuming the person is not unhealthy or has a disorder. 

So tell me what you guys think. Like really think about it. Like is this the case? I feel that those with Fi are better at lying/manipulating than Fe users. Also do some types get a bit intimidated or weirded out by you?

ESFP here and tbh some of the ENTPs I've encountered intimidate me...not exactly physically but when I try to talk...they shut me down lol....

On the other hand when people see me talking to my friends, some of the introverts I know off get weirded out by me. I know these people are introverts by the way they just are even when they are around their friends. When I walk up to them to talk to them, they look very blank on the outside but on the inside they just...hate life? IDK LOL.

To you introverts out there especially, if you find us ESFPs intimidating, what makes us so intimidating?  In other words. Let's say they have never played chess and you put a Ti or an Ni dom against another dom, on average would you say that they have the advantage in chess?

Now I do understand that anyone can get good at chess. It's just that some people are naturally better at others in some things. 

Like me for example. I am just naturally good at games like Mortal KombatI am an Se dom and an Fi aux and I am HORRIBLE at reading people. Like...it is easy for me to deal with their feelings but reading people...that is something I need to and WANT to improve on. 


In most cases I have heard people say that they simply work out just to look better or to feel better or to get in shape. 

The above statement applies to me. 

While in some cases I have seen people say that they workout to focus their mind. 

Also, what is your dom/auxillary function? Maybe there is a correlation. Mine is Se and Fi. 

So what about you guys? Lots of people feel different things in different situations. I have this problem of caring about what other people think of me....like....grr...why must I be sensitive? Why must I care about what other people think?

I try my best not to care but it's just so hard...

Thinkers...I feel jealous of you guys in this aspect. I dont know how you guys do it. Like would you say that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th letter makes the biggest difference in personality types?

I feel that the biggest difference would be the 2nd letter while the 1st letter is the least difference. 

What do you guys think? Fi is my auxillary function. Often times I have a hard time expressing through words. This is ONLY the case for me in negative situations. Positive situations it's just too easy for me to express emotions. 

Anyone else have this problem? Especially if you are a strong Fi user?So like my type is known to be the most extroverted of the extroverts and known as the party animal.

Well...I break this stereotype because I am probably the most ambiverted ESFP you will meet. On top of that, ya parties are nice but....every weekend? I sometimes want to be home. 

So what stereotypes have you broken for your type? I notice that I tend to daydream. I was just wondering if this is like an intuition thing or not? I am aware that I am Se/Fi. Well. Since there is a thread for FFX, why not make one for the game I played a lot? 

Well this is what I THINK. 

Squall: ISTX
Zell: ESFP
Irvine: ExFP
Quistis: ENFX
Rinoa: ENFX
Selphie: ESFP
Seifer: ESTP
Cid: ENFJ?

What do you guys think? And I know Zell is an ESFP for sure. Because I can relate to him. Hence where I got my name from. Anyways, the only difference is that I am not as loud as Zell or extroverted as him. But everything else, yep. I am just like him personality wise. So I am aware that most Ps are more likely to misplace/lose their things than the Js.

In my case I tend to misplace my chapstick all the time rofl. Good thing that I do not misplace my car keys, wallet, or my phone. I am no expert into saying who is what personality type BUT I relate to Big Smoke the most.

Apart from where he is a traitor. I am just overall like him personality wise. Trying to have fun always, be silly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ9we6xDvWQ

Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay. 

Here's what I think. ESFP and ENFP are the most similar. Why do I feel this way? 

When you read the description of their strengths and weaknesses, they are SIMILAR for the most part. On top of that they are mostly enneagram 7s which correlates to their Ne and Se.

https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-95a6fa5f96600566bf720543cb558be3-c?convert_to_webp=trueMy life motto is this: "Learn to have fun. What's the point of having negative emotions? Life is too SHORT." 

The kinds of people that I would just not get along with are those who are constantly in a negative mood. Like an example would be this man who is in his 40s, always grumpy. Never smiles. Those kinds of people just annoy me and make me want to punch someone in the throat. 

I just want to see how different types view life. So what about you guys?It's just that I believe I have seen MANY ESFP women in campus but not a single ESFP man. I'm one of the more introverted ESFPs if you were wondering. My ESTP friend makes me look introverted lol.

But anyways how do they differ in behavior?So I have taken the socionics and cognitive functions test and both of them say I'm mostly ISFP. But I know I'm an ESFP because I feel good being with other people. I only like to be alone at night. Day time is a different story.

So what about you guys?When I ask this, I mean like which letter would you say you all have the most common? 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th letter? I would also like to know how your family sees you and is it accurate or inaccurate?

My entire family, well at least 90% of them are definitely extroverts. I can 100% say that. However for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th letter, there is NO way that majority of them are similar.

Now one thing for sure though, everyone in my family thinks I am an introvert but the truth is I'm not and my 2 brother in laws know this very well. Same for my friends. Everyone knows the real me except my family. I am extremely quiet when my family is present but once they are gone, BOOM. Time to take off the mask and be the real me. 

I can say for sure that most of my family are sensors but my sister is most likely an intuitive. 

I honestly don't know how I am a P since both my parents are Js. They always make a list of what to buy and are organized. Meanwhile me...I was a mess since I was a kid. Like lately I have noticed that I hide my emotions a lot from females but with other guys I'm a lot more open. I'm only considered an open book if they are like a close friend.

I wonder if this is an Fi thing or not? Their heads seem to be naturally in the clouds analyzing the hell out of almost everything?

Meanwhile this is me when I'm under stress. So like I mostly played offense. I have an ESTP friend that plays support which surprised me because of how he is.

Have you guys noticed a trend like this or no for certain types?Some people when they read my messages they thought I was ISTP but once they heard me talk that's when they realized I was ISFP. I wonder if this is a common thing or not where you type differently but the way one talks is another story. 

This happen to any of you or no?This ESTP friend of mine has had 4 girlfriends. 2 of his ex girlfriends called him ugly. A 4.5 out of 10 and he freaks out goes into depression mode and loses a bit of muscle and gains some fat. 

So then he tells me this "I am so tired of these fake b****es, I want someone genuine." Then I tell him this "Dude, your standards are stupidly high, maybe if you lowered them you would find someone genuine." His response: "I'm not going to lower my standards, I will get myself so built and do steroids that they will come to me and I will choose any chick I want."

So tell me. Is this an unhealthy ESTP or not? Oh and on top of that he encourages me to do steroids. Do I laugh or cry at him for trying to encourage me to do this?When someone does something wrong to you personally or something goes wrong I often go like "What did I do to deserve this?" or "Why me?" 

Like this is how I naturally process things. There is an ENTJ out there that I know off always seems to change his mind about how he feels about girls. Like he is like "Oh I like her" but the next moment he doesn't. Then he isn't even aware that he is rude or anything. Like...this confuses me.....

Are most of them not aware of what they are feeling? Honestly. I don't see any benefits. So what if I know what I'm feeling? So what if I know what my values are? Like....I'd rather be a Te dom instead of being this....Fi dom...people just...don't seem to take me seriously....like the way they take Te doms seriously. Ya...There are 4 types of drunks.

Who would have ever thought an ISFP would act like this?(sarcasm) XDExtraversion is usually a feminine trait? Can someone explain? [removed]I notice that for most of my life I don't have a hard time making friends even though I am an introvert. 

Obviously extroverts for the MOST part have an easier time doing this. Well let's start with me. I was naturally sociable for most of my life. Especially when I started college. Which sometimes makes me come off as an extrovert but am I really one? Nope. Can't tell if most ISFPs are sociable or not. On top of that my enneagram is 6w7. Don't know if that plays into it or not. 

I also tend to be passive aggressive sometimes without even trying...I don't know if that's common among ISFPs or not but I "accidentally" turn like that. 

Get triggered easily. Yep. I admit it. Hate that this is a thing with me but it has been my whole life. Wish I could change it fully. 

Not sure if this is type related or not but let's say you ask a passive aggressive to just spill everything out in an aggressive way, do they tend to be more scary than people who are naturally aggressive?I notice that when I tend to talk I tend to have a little pause in between what I'm going to say. Even if I know what I'll say, I have a pause in the middle from time to time. 
Calling!  I hate texting with a passion. I can't hold conversations well when I text.  What do you even say after an "lol"?I have a couple of ESTP friends, and they're all girls. They're a lot more intense than I am...and less friendly. They could easily tear me to shreds, but I doubt that's a type thing lol. I also talk a lot more. They thrive in competitive settings, and I thrive in group settings. I'm not really into arguments, while they seem to like that stuff. I'm more *this is what I believe and don't argue with me lalala im never wrong*. ~~I'm better.~~What even is "socially introverted"?

People just really don't want to be extroverts. Especially on the internet. "I don't like people, so I'm a socially introverted person" but how many people in the world *actually* like people? Is that a good indicator? Do you think I just love everyone? Lol nope. 

You see all these "introverts' making discord servers or creating a Dota(or whatever) team with people they just met online and I start to wonder whether these people are really introverted.&gt; I don't think this is something you can prevent, to be honest. 

I'm just worried that these things may be cries for help or something and I'm a bit worried. I know my friend likes her space, but I don't know how much of this is normal. 

I'll try your advice with my SO. It's mostly bothering me cuz I want snuggles. :) So am I *supposed to* do something when she's  spending so much time alone? Or am I being a better friend by respecting her space? &gt; The question you should ask yourself is: why do you see it as "pulling shit" and why are you trying to nip it in the bud?

It's pulling shit because it upsets me? Idk it's just how I talk.  I can respect and need for space, that's not what bothers me. It's just that I have a problem with needing space for such a long period of time. For my friend, I don't know if she's alright or if I'm doing my part, and in my relationship, of course it's gonna bother me if my SO is deciding to go no-contact for four months :(

I'll definitely have a conversation about, but it never hurts to get some outside opinions, you know? Like I never would've thought that group messages would bother my friend. Things like this really help! I don't like cutting people out of my life just because they do things that bother me. Always seemed lazy. If they're not toxic or boring,  then I want to hang with them. If I need to figure them out, then I have no problem putting in that effort. I was above average when it came to math,  but I excelled in literature and theater so I think thats where ESFPs would excel. Science is OK, but history was so difficult for me. It bored me to tears. I think the words people choose to use make a huge difference in how a type is perceived. INFPs are thoughtful, pensive, reflective, and highly introspective.  

When people use "sad" and "sensitive" it gives off a different impression to some people.  "Sensitive"  in this context does NOT mean easily offended or butthurt. It means "aware of others thoughts and feelings". "Sad" gives of the impression that they're always run by emotions and can't get themselves out of a funk. 

Fi and Ti are the most introspective functions. It's what they're all about. People try to differentiate the two by saying Ti is analytical, but the truth is, both Ji functions are analytical. Fi focuses on analyzing their own thoughts and feelings.  Fi-Ne-Si-Te is a stack that is about exploring themselves and finding inner stability and their purpose in a world they don't quite understand. Even that sounds kind of gloomy honestly lol. I really do think the melancholy vibe of INFPs is just built in. It's just how they come off to people. Who is "someone"? 

&gt;The average person is an extrovert who probably thinks that introverts are anti-social nerds. 

I don't think that's true at all. I've never thought someone was an antisocial need just because of their need for alone time and neither has a good percentage of the extroverts I know. The only thing I ever hear is how introverts *think* that I think that. 

Honestly if you only describe the "bad" , then yea, INFPs are the worst. If you only describe the bad of any type, then that type seems like the worst. 
&gt;I was on about most people but ok

I don't know what you're trying to say. 

Anyways since you are an INFP,  this will pass as low self esteem. I suggest you think twice about threads like these even if you're down on yourself. Imagine being an INFP and having to read things like this constantly. It's discouraging. 

Maybe word it differently? "I feel like INFP is the worst thing to be" or "Help me not to feel so down on my type" 
So how do you choose what information to accept and what to throw out? Did I say something that was "extra Te"  or something? We can only wait for "something"  to come along and disprove things? Then what happens in the meantime? 

At least in the gravity example "we all"  is a large number of people, way over the amount of people in any MBTI community. Everything just seems so easy to manipulate here. The amount of up votes seem to dictate what the truth ends up being. On the note of sources, what do you consider a valid source? Do surveys count? Specifically the ones on 16 personalities (they usually have well over 1000 participants). For a lot of those stereotypes, it seems to be an "experience vs experience"  thing, which is why I wonder about how much of MBTI is accurate. 

Person A knows a dumb ESFP, Person B knows a smart ESFP. No further conclusion can be made I think. The one that becomes "truth" would be the one that the general public says is the truth. You use MBTI to understand people, but you don't apply your newfound understanding in real life? 

People ask advice here all the time, which makes me think that they plan to use the advice given in real life. If I ask how to deal with an INFJ friend,  it's because I want to be able to deal with my INFJ friend. I'm not asking just to see some responses. I can't Infp 

Small, but all caps - I don't really care about tradition. I don't even know what that encompasses. 

- Whatever works I guess 

- I don't that much. Everyone cares a little bit, but I don't think I care more than the average person. I like doing things that rely on other's reactions, but I think of it as validation for my hard work. 

- I don't know. I practice pragmatism because that's what seems sensible. 

- Isn't this an inate preference? I didn't choose to not have an interest, I just don't. For the most part, I'm fine with theories and discussions,  I just don't base my entire life around it. There's a time and a place. This is really mean. Accounting is filled with XSTJs, and XNFPs who haven't realized how much they're gonna hate being an accountant. Oh no, it's okay, I was already thinking that I might have been a little too sensitive. Tons of people tend to say really inaccurate/hurtful things about the type and that has dulled my ability to take a joke. 

As for his type, He may very well be an ESFP, I really have no idea. I don't get Donald at all. Not even a little bit. Yeah, I've never really bought the whole calculated persona thing either. It just kind of seems like a cop out. "Ignore his obvious ridiculousness, he's really a *genius*!" 

Maybe it's my sensor self, but I'll believe it when I see it. And I think it's better to type people based on what we see instead of arguing about things that may or may not be there. If we keep talking about what he's like "in private" I don't see why someone couldn't just make up any type for him. He acts like that in public, but if you look further you'll see he's *actually* an ISFJ!"I wouldn't say I'm very similar to ESFJs despite some shared hobbies. Doubt itWhat's your point? yea it doesn't have anything to do with differences in communication lol

if everyone else loves talking to them and they're acting standoffish to only you, that just means they don't like you for whatever reason.Seems unnecessary. And horoscope-like. There's no reason to believe any of it right? I've been close friends with this INFP chick for more than a decade at this point, but I'm starting to wonder if I should be concerned about her lifestyle. We used to hang like every other week, but it's been four months since I last heard from her. I always ask what she's been up to in the group chat, but she never answers. 

This isn't the first time this has happened either. She goes through periods where she's friendly and ready to party, and then there are other times where she drops off the face of the earth. When she comes back she always acts like no time had passed at all, like she didn't ignore everyone for months. 

When I ask her what she's been doing since the last time I saw her, she always says that she didn't really do much...and I honestly believe her. Should I be more concerned? 

I know other INFPs(that I'm less close too) who do the same, but it's usually after someone pisses them off. They leave for a certain amount of time and when they come back they act like everything is fine. 

I'm mostly asking this now because my new SO is an INFP and they're already trying to pull this shit too and I want to nip it in the bud. As opposed to anything factual? Most people's opinion are only based on experiences, so there's almost never any academic studies or anything, yet people still believe it?. 

This isn't a call out post, but haven't most of the regulars here already made up their mind about how they feel about types? There is a regular on here who has been saying that introverts are miserable for months now based on a small sample size(the introverts in their friend group). Why keep perpetuating that when there is only a small amount of data?  

This sub has 13000 subscribers, which is a pretty immaterial amount compared to the earth's population. Not only that, this is reddit. It's not the real world.  Reddit skews highly towards certain people and certain, even within this subreddit. Sites like these are one of the worse places to understand diverse opinions and personalities. 

I've seen public opinion on topics change with no real proof added. A recent comment on the doorslam thing said that in their experience, other people attribute the doorslam to INFJs and the INFJs don't take pride in it,  but a couple of months ago that would be a different story. It makes sense for things to change since it's an online forum where people come and go, but if public opinion is that malleable then why trust it?  

Isn't everyone here just explaining things through their own personal biases and experiences? Like with the ENFPxINTJ and ENTPxINFJ fetish that is prevalent. I've heard people give good explanations on why these pairs are the best for those types, and I've heard other equally plausible explanations for duality pairings about how the pairing are mostly mistypes (as in the ISTJ/ISFJ only thinks that they're an INTJ/INFJ). 

How do you figure out whats true and what's false?  It all seems like people are basing truth on personal experiences or on a site's general bias. 

The party don't start til I walk in.At 16 you're still socially developmentally a baby. Wait what?Damn bro who hurt you?Every time I do it, it ends badly and hurts for a long time. 

I don't do it anymore. There are dozens of us! 

^Not^even...Out of curiosity how old are you? I used to have the same issue, but as I got older I learned to look at things with the same perceptive, analytical eye, but also to distance myself emotionally from outcomes. Not that I'm a robot or anything..I still care, but I'm not deeply invested in everyone and everything anymore- just the things important to me. Have you uhh, talked to a therapist yo. https://giphy.com/gifs/wine-megan-mullally-uYcuStWfBtHnWWhat the fuck is your post history? Bro that's not a type thing so much as a you let everyone walk all over you to be a crowd pleaser thing. Nah, I quite enjoy it. /r/ESFP is hilarious. It's pretty much "Help me, an IN _ _, get into ESFP girl's pants." It's died down recently but for a while a few months ago it really was just dating/relationship advice. What have I doneI think of all the types, we're the least likely to incite a huge war unless it's some Helen of Troy shit. Damn right 💁Huh, didn't even notice until you pointed that out. Idealism: 2.7

Relativism: 3.6

I'd consider my 2.7 in idealism to be "low idealism" because the questionnaire says the median is a 3.67(!), which is way higher. On the other hand, my 3.6 for subjectivism is decently higher than the median of 3.03, so I'd consider that high. 

Subjectivism it is. 35% starting and ending. 

Don't do memory-based tests while pulling all nighters folks. Not a fan of INTJs even though we're supposed to besties or some shit. Generally too navel-gazey for my taste. For me a lot of it is from information-gathering and pattern-recognition but on a more subconscious level. I like to observe things and sleep on them for a bit before making decisions based off the vibe/gut feel I form. For the record, this is called "flair" and this process works in all subreddits that have user-customizable flair. Example: Tell me about your most deeply shameful, guilt ridden, embarrassing secret that even friends you've known for years don't know. Right now, every detail. 

You're probably like, I don't even know who the fuck this guy is. Why is he asking these things?

Small talk does not necessarily have to be uninteresting, nor do "deep" topics necessarily have to be interesting. It's about feeling another person out and understanding their attitudes and value systems. 

Additionally, it depends on the context. If we're strangers at a conference for physics or something, sure let's talk about things that aren't surface level like how the food sucks. On the other hand, if we're at a networking dinner and you're trying to ask me what my biggest regret is in life or some other deep existential personal stuff, you can fuck right off. For me when in autopilot mode and when I'm not purposefully paying attention to one specific thing, anything and everything is taken as contextual information to build upon a mental map of relationships.  It's a constant observation and pattern-recognition/building behavior where people's actions, words, intonations, body language, etc. come together to help me flesh out my understanding of all these interconnections. Pretty accurate imoWait what, I'm really curious about your situation. Of all the types I've found we're usually among the best at playing well with others, so to speak. Wait, what are you asking exactly? If ESFPs get bored hanging out with someone and dick around doing other things on the side? Oh, yeah I definitely have that problem then. I'll wait until I have a moment to myself to send a proper response back but sometimes I get caught up in doing other things and never get to send that text. IMO the only people who actually post it on their profiles in more than a half-heartedly serious manner are the people who definitely don't understand the actual methodology of typology. You may find /r/socialskills useful for a question like this. 

But also, generally a good way to thread a conversation is to build on someone's comment with your perspective or experience so that they have more to go on. You can know a bunch about various topics but if you just rant and nerd out on something they don't connect with, it's pointless. 

"Dude I hate mushrooms. Could never stand them." 

"I used to be the same, but then a couple years back I tried this dope mushroom sauce on a steak at Buttfuck McGee's Steakhouse and now I love em." 

That being said, some people just.. don't really ask questions. It's not always your fault.  I'm pretty sure everybody and their mother will say Gryffindor goes with ESFP, but the Pottermore quiz placed me in Slytherin and Wampus, so there's an interesting data point for thought. Why is the ESFP confused? Yeah man beer is pretty much liquid bread anyway. I mean, kinda yes and kinda no. GuiltyThat actually does sound like a fun drinking game, in fairness. Slytherin here, and whatever that stupid badger cat thing is from the other school. Can I buy you a vowel?For me, Se dom isn't really an on or off thing so much as a strong preference that guides how I do things in my daily life. It's very much "eyes and ears open", "stop and smell the roses" etc. It's like being really observant all the time about things directly perceivable in front of you. 

It prioritizes information gathering and pattern recognition for decision-making, with greatest preference to more concrete and actionable information over abstract theories and hypotheticals. It's a bit like one of those string web things you see on detective shows where all the clues point to other clues and people. It's all a connected network, and knowing more about one thing informs you about other related things too. 

Example: I'd rather do a hands on lab demonstration for class instead of reading a dense textbook unpacking the probabilities and math behind some concept). Being able to toy around with everything right in front of me helps me build a mental map of how the various parts of this concept are connected to each other. 

When dealing with people I prefer talking in person the most because of the wealth of subtextual information you get in addition to just the words being exchanged, like body language, intonation, facial expressions, etc. It tells you a lot more about how someone feels towards you or any other topic being discussed, which you can use to inform your other decisions. ("This person feels ambivalent about me, but is closer to this friend and this friend. I'll keep this in mind when arranging a social gathering next week.")   Heh thanks man I try. It's a helluva drug. Bruh I have that same mug. To be fair I inherited it from my old roommate, but something something, law of universal gravitation and all that. I think that's just your brother.Out of all the descriptors you could have chosen for ESFPs, who as you know are Se dom aka pretty much built on paying attention and observing, "clueless" is just a baffling choice of phrasing to me. Please elaborate. I mean it's such a regular thing to the point of being memelike that INXX guys come to the ESFP subreddit to ask how to ask out ESFP girls or to repair damaged relationships with them. So I guess that's our meme? &gt;eye twitchAlso a helpful reminder​ though. Off the cuff 2 cents: I kinda don't think you're an Se dom simply because you've put so much thought and time into considering the abstract theory of functions, rather than telling us about concrete examples and experiences that make you think you're one or the other. Hope that helps? Yeah usually I wouldn't either, but assuming OP has the Fi and Te of their functions figured out correctly, Ne sounds a bit closer given the admittedly small pool of evidence we're working with. I remember someone asked people to expand on Se dom/aux earlier in this subreddit too, if it helps. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5wlvlu/a_question_for_domaux_se_users_from_an_infj/Didn't you have an ESFP flair a while back?I'm only here for the porn manYes&gt;A strawberry smoothie with extra protein. They’ll probably ask for some matcha powder in there as well. The result will be disgusting, but they’re trying to bulk, so they don’t really care.

Wait there's protein supplements you can add to drinks? Game fucking changer right here. There's a couple of us who post somewhat regularly but yeah there's not many around here as you'd probably expect. Hi frand!If I'm being very honest with myself, I get iced coffee even on cold days partly because it's delicious and partly because I don't trust myself enough to not burn my tongue/other body parts with slightly too hot coffee. Hi frand. There are dozens of us! Se dominance means that immediately observable external factors take the most precedence in ESFP mental processing, so a lot of implied or behind the scenes things like others' expectations (who aren't immediately present) often get forgotten or put on the mental back burner. Immature ESFPs exhibit this especially by simply avoiding responsibility or things that are unpleasant​ or not fun, aka only having fun in the moment, so they don't have to deal with problems in their face.Your first mistake was going to /r/INTJ for advice and expecting anything but self-aggrandizing vitriol. Like the others said, it's not really the type but the subreddit that I'm bashing. There's a weird self reinforcing air of superiority in there. Eh the Pottermore quiz put me in Wampus. Is this supposed to be a discussion or a passive aggrressive rant?Both. Shitting on intuitives and Se all in one swoop while refusing to listen to anyone is *definitely* how you get a productive conversation started. Nobody wants to have a discussion with a stubborn know it all. I honestly have no idea what you were going for. 

&gt;don't answer, rhetorical question

&gt;Besides "Settling down vs constantly changing"

&gt;Side Note: oh and please don't try to tell me about how "it's the person, not the type" ( I'm not an idiot)
(and yes some people here will really try to tell me that xd)

&gt;please tell me something i don't know&gt;My post is not a rant.

Dunno man it was pretty ranty, especially before the edit. 

&gt;why would I shit on myself

There's a lot of self hate around the MBTI forums. It's not out of the question.

To get back to the topic, as I understand it one of the main differences is that Se absorbs inputs at a more raw/face value level and adds it to their internal "library", where it's just one of many pieces of the puzzle. The filtering and processing of information happens later on when it needs to be recalled for use. Se prioritizes the immediacy of information and is more willing to change things up on a a minute to minute, day to day basis. 

On the other hand, Si pre-processes information as it comes, matching it up to their own internal preconceptions and frameworks. They take information and focus on their personal relationship to it. It's constant comparison to and building off of what they already know. Si prioritizes how new information relates to their old information- the tried and true. BruhWait what, your friend sounds weird. Skydiving as a new experience sounds very stereotypically ESFP...unless she's already done it a bunch of times?Apparently we're all faithless sluts, so..Awwww, thanks fam.Extroverted StarchinessBruhhhI enjoyed these two threads about it in the past.

Ghost town besides INs coming in every so often to ask how to get at someone. I like the top comment in that thread re: risk taking and danger seeking 

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/6yuni4/026_the_8_cognitive_functions_indepth_explanation/dmqexo4

" Your understanding of Se vs Si is very thorough. However I must make an amendment:

and “do extreme stunts with your motorcycle without caring about your physical safety” lifestyle, the only way I could describe it is hardcore

The common attribution of Se to physical risk-taking is generally incorrect. It is merely a stereotype that Se dom/aux people are drawn to extreme sports and physical sensations. Most Se users are not any more "hardcore" than, say, INTPs.

Donald Trump, for one, refuses to exercise and eats KFC all the time. :P

The best analogy I can make is that Se is like Apple's motion coprocessor: always operating in the background and uses very low power. This allows Se users to have an instantaneous, unconscious reaction to unexpected things - while other people must take up computational resources in order to react. This manifests itself in several ways:

 • awareness of objective sensory data. Se users notice things a long time before anyone else. I've never gotten a ticket or had an accident, and I speed like a mofo. ESTPs and ISTPs I know all notice things before others, whether it's money on the ground, or new paint, or a person very far away. 

 • automatic spatial reasoning. The constant "stimulus-&gt;reaction" loop make the Se user very directionally aware. Questions like "where are we", "how do we get somewhere", or "which way is east" should be directed at Se users. 

 • comfort with risk. Risk not necessarily (and usually not) physical. Se users feel more alive when there is actionable uncertainty: that is, risk you can mould to your liking. Se users will actively seek out this kind of risk. A lot of the wall-street types are Se users. ESTPs in particular, make excellent traders. (Trading is not investing. Investing is a game where the less you play, the more you win. xSTJs make the best investors by a long shot). A distinction I must make is that this is "actionable uncertainty" very different from "the unknown". When risk presents itself in a way such that there is no path to take, the Se user is forced to default to Ni prediction. This results in stress

 • physical mastery. Se makes it easier to learn a new physical task. Of course, this depends on the skill of the person (for example an INFP athlete is going to be better at learning a new sport than an ESTP stockbroker). However if two people are on equal footing, trying to learn an entirely unfamiliar task, the Se users are going to come out ahead "Someone else wrote the comment I quoted so I can't take credit, but yeah I like it a lot too. /r/ESFP is pretty much intuitives asking how to date ESFP girls they like. One of the lowest subscriber count subreddits type specific subreddits IIRC, and I'm sure only a fraction are actually of the type. WutBad botBecause shiny things are dopeHonestly your ESFP sounds pretty abrasive and trashy. Can't relate. Nah I feel you though. It depends a lot on the specific person so I'm also having a hard time coming up with a good "shit ESFPs say" line. *cries in personality test*Sounds like a fucking tool. The sub as a whole is very inactive and we don't usually talk too much about specific typings. Half the time it's "I'm a INxx guy talking to a ESFP girl...""Sir this is a ~~Wendy's~~ shitpost"Fitting that /r/ESFP's representative post is yet another Discord spam link
I had a similar issue where when I was in high school, my prom date basically ditched me and refused to dance with me for the night. In an attempt to make something out of it, I found a platonic friend who was at prom without a date, and thought I'd ask her to dance just as a means to have fun and dance with *someone*. She nervously shook her head no, and when she noticed I was close to her she *literally* ran away from me. Now, after having my own prom date reject me, it was very easy to take this in an extremely negative light, like I was some kind of ugly creepy freak. 

Later on, however, the platonic friend had a conversation about it with me and told me it was because she had never danced with a boy before, and to her religion/culture/herself it was a significant thing for her, therefore she didn't want her first dance to be something casual with a platonic friend. Her and I have remained friends for all the of years it's been since then!

The moral of this story is that people have their own reasons/dispositions for not wanting to engage with you, and you should never take things like this *too* personally (but always keep a wary eye out for it happening frequently, so you can see if there is something you're doing wrong). There are some people with who you could be the most charming, charismatic individual in the world, and they'd still feel uneasy or uncomfortable around you at first. Don't take it personally!

Also, what the boyfriend did was really immature. If she wanted you to leave her alone, she should have just made up an excuse about how busy she was, or literally asked you to please leave her alone. From the tone of the story, I wonder if she was in an abusive relationship where she knows her boyfriend would get very jealous with her speaking to another male?I've been taking ADHD medication (Adderall) since I was 18 years old, which has allowed me to take tremendous steps in developing my External Intuition, as well as more quickly honing my External Thinking. Both functions that are very uncommon for my type (Te is a tertiary function for ESFP, but I believe I've come to develop it much more rapidly than I would have without the meds). When the medication wears off though, I certainly recede back to my External Sensing mode of doing things. I find myself taking my medication a lot more than I need to, simply because I enjoy it so much more.Howdy! I take ADD medication (Adderall) which I have found drastically alters my train of thought, in a way that may reflect an Intuitive way of thinking, as opposed to a sensing way of thinking. So, in a sense (heh), I have experience with both! To best describe the differences:

With sensing daydreams, I find myself reliving or simulating experiences, without giving those experiences too much thought or analysis. Like, imagining myself flying around, having some kind of super power, embracing a lover, something like that. It's all about imagining how it'd feel, or what the experience would be like. "Feeling the wind whip against my skin as I jet through the air, watching the light glow and build around my hands right before I shoot laser beams out of them"

When on my meds, the daydreams take on less of a "how would it feel" aspect, and more of a "what would it cause". If I imagine myself having super powers, it's no longer "Blowing shit up by shooting lasers out of my hands feels awesome", but rather it's "What would I do with these powers? Would using them outright be the wisest move? How would people react when they saw I had them? What kinds of things could I potentially do, if I had these powers? Could I shoot lasers out of my hands to power some kind of generator, giving the world free energy?"

Just my two cents. It's certainly not so black and white, and there are themes from each daydream that spill into the other, but those are the general trends!*crickets*

Nah, but for real. I often imagine myself or another person experiencing certain things, reliving past moments or imagining what some other experience might feel like. I've noticed a shift away from this as I've gotten older (and as I've started taking ADHD meds), but certainly the bulk of my thoughts during down time has been occupied by imagining experiences. Certainly I think about issues/large choices I have to make, world views I hold, philosophical topics, or in moments about things I am passionate about, but by far my default "thought process" when I am not occupied by something is just to just relive and imagine physical, external experiences."You're too stupid to handle this. You'll mess up, you'll be lazy and not follow through. You'll disappoint everyone. You're overly emotional and too open with people, they will take advantage of you for it. You'll fail at this just like you do every time, and you'll just hate yourself for it even more than you do now."

At least those are the most common for me. Se is my dominant function, although admittedly I take ADD medication (Adderall) which appears to suppress Se in favor of Ne.I find that when I'm around an ISFP, and they're quiet/unresponsive, I mistake it for them being uninterested or uncomfortable around me- which it turn makes me feel bad or uncomfortable. However, I've learned to try to "match their energy", or calm myself down to the point where I'm talking just as frequently as they are, and that tends to work out pretty well. They're not the most fun friends I've had, but there is always a charm to them, as well as a plethora of interesting quirks that you discover only after spending lots of time with them. If I had to say my favorite trait about my ISFP friends is that they are NEVER bad company, and are one of the least likely to cause chaos/anger within my group of friends. It gives me a whole new layer of respect for their steady demeanor, and makes them seem very "cool and in control".Hi! I'm in a similar boat to you, where I have been taking a medication (Adderall, for ADD), which has strong impact on which MBTI Functions are present/absent in my day to day life. In this sense, when I first was typed, it reflected the person I was while on the medication- however, being under varying levels of influence of my meds leads to varying differences in how I think about things, so my behavior felt inconsistent. In addition, as you get older, you learn to develop other thinking types, so you can appear do things that seem totally contradictory.

My best advice: Go with what kind of things you did when you were young (For me ,everything I did up until I started taking my ADD medication *screamed* ESFP). That is your type- even if your behavior does not reflect it now. Your medicine, your life experience, and your surroundings will have such a high impact on your behavior that honestly MBTI will become a poor tool to gauge your personality overall. Or at the very least, you will have so many things influencing your personality that your base type will not strongly determine your behavior anymore.Eh, I've noticed ESTJ to be the more openly aggressive of the two. The ENTJ will just [smirk and roll their eyes](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/09/RTS1HO3/lead_large.jpg?1442507169) if you say something they strongly disagree with, while the ESTJ will get annoyed and frustrated with you. I definitely agree about the ESTJ being the most capable of being personable/fun in moments.One of my good friends is ISTJ. Certainly he is future oriented, but I would say his goals fall in line with ones that are already well established/determined to be good (Get a wife, work a good job, 2.5 kids in a white picket fenced house with a dog named spot), he is much less likely the type to question what *he personally* wants, or to really ponder/reflect heavily over future issues. To be fair, he comes from a very traditional Jewish background, so his upbringing could have a heavy influence over it too.1) ESFP. Everytime I've been tested it has come up strongly ESFP, however I have been taking ADHD medication for about 5 years now and have developed some very non-ESFP like behavior.

2) 24 years old

3) Father: ENxP. Mother: ESFJ. I have a brother who is a year older than me, and is INTP

4) I have an undergraduate in Computer Science as well as one in Information Science.

5) Have never been in a relationship

6) I want children, anywhere between 1-3. This honestly has to do with the size of the family I was raised in.

7) Yes, but not as much since most of the people on my dad's side of the family are alcoholics. I become an even more sociably/giddy person when drunk, with less social inhibition.

8) Adderall and Buproprion (Anti-depressant similar to Adderall), but I take them both legally. I believe the Adderall has had a serious impact on the MBTI function types I use on a day to day basis.

9) Pre Adderall: Spongebob, Family Guy, honestly things just associated with being a high-schooler at that time. Present day: I don't really watch TV anymore.

10) I used to be Christian, but am not anymore. This is probably the strongest argument as to why I consider myself a Feeler type- all of the logical evidence in the world was thrown at me showing the inconsistencies with my religion, but the one thing that convinced me to finally drop it was instead the day I felt it was no longer fair for Non-Christians to "burn in hell". Basically my sympathy  for others and hatred for a God who would damn those for being born into the wrong religion was my motivator, where as for my INTP brother, it was when our parents forced him to read the Bible more frequently and he was just blown away by the strangeness/inconsistencies of parts of it.

11) This isn't really a question, is it?A lot of what you described seems to describe a psychopath, as opposed to some MBTI profile. At the very least, with my other INTJ peers, they would have zero patience with people for sure, but in the same token they would very rarely have motivation to put on a face/be manipulative to someone. To be honest, they were consistently BAD at it when they tried too, because they struggled to emulate genuine emotion. My boss at my previous job was an INTJ professor who had been thrust into a business role when he was the head of his own small camera company. Business interactions where he had to deal with an unlikeable but necessary party involved him putting on a weak smile and not acting annoyed with them. They also did seem to genuinely enjoy the close friendships they had. It may just have been my friends/other INTJ peers in this case, as well as the fact that MBTI isn't super precise anyways...


Edit: This whole convo has reminded me of another thing my INTJ peers had in common: they were very expressionless. I distinctly remember getting this feel of "Wow, I can't get a read on this guy/gal" when meeting them, because their face betrayed little emotion. Only after knowing them a long time was I able to pick up on their mood just by looking at them.I've always thought it was defined as someone who lacks any trace of empathy for others. Not necessarily a crazed killer, but rather someone who finds zero intrinsic value in maintaining relationships with others, and only values people by the tangible, surface level benefits they offer them. My INTJ peers, while certainly being less expressive than others, did genuinely value good friendships and shared a level of emapthy with others. Particularly, I wouldn't think of any of them as saying "Friendships are overrated", unless they had become jaded  with a certain group recently.I guess tangible was a weird word- rather, I should say that the person derives some immediate benefit or explicitly understood benefit from the relationship (this person is a valuable connection to such and such group, that person can lend me their expertise on such and such topic!) As soon as the benefit from that person goes away, they have zero desire to interact with them again (not saying normal people don't do this, rather that a psychopath would exclusively do this) They have no instrinsic desire to be around people, they wouldn't ever start feeling lonely or sad if left to themselves for too long (although I wonder if that is necessarily true of psychopaths). I think the what I was trying to get at was my INTJ friends value their friendships very much, maybe even moreso than others I know, given how picky the INTJ can be in selecting friends. Could just be the ones I know, though!Honestly I wouldn't take my word for it and maybe go look at some material  for yourself if you're curious. Sociopath is someone who does have the ability to empathize, but is so misguided that they do terrible things while fully believing those things are "right and good". One fun tidbit I've heard about some psychopaths is that they don't instinctively cringe or grimace when they see someone else have something physically painful happen to them. Regardless it's a complicated diagnosis that even some active psychologists argue about so don't take my word on it!Well basically the whole "I only ever make friends as a means to an ends", and "friendships are overrated" thing was what made me think that, but I wonder if that is necessarily a trait psychopaths would have. At the very least it wasn't what I observed, but admittedly some of the friends could be argued borderline INFJ-INTJ.

And yes, sociopath is much worse to my understanding. Only benefit to them being that you can appeal to them on an empathy level, but you don't hear about as many high functioning sociopaths like you do the high functioning psychopathsI'll give it the old college try....


Se: Become a super-hero ninja with your enhanced physical awareness/reflexes

Si: World's best artist/craftsmen as you can visualise physical phenomena better than anyone else

Fe: Conman/Ultimate powers of persuasion/manipulating people, climb your way to the top of the political ladder

Fi: Ability to convince people you understand how they feel better than anyone else, and establish trust between the most unlikely people. Become a superhero diplomat and end wars between nations

Ne: Become wealthiest person in the world by always predicting/creating the next big thing

Ni: Invent super death laser. Take over the world.

Te: Become rich on the stock market, or through other calculatable business ventures

Ti: I'll get back to this when I learn how the fuck Ti works
I think Myers Briggs attracts INTPs moreso than other types, it breaks down people's personalities into a more concrete and observable fashion, which appeals to both their dominant Ti and their tertiary Si (being able to relate MBTI to their real world observations). Finally, their inferior Fe might cause some INTPs to seek MBTI as a means to better understand people due to their lack of social intuition.It's interesting because I was actually just thinking about this myself last week, and it seems we came to a lot of the same conclusions. I just have a few things to add-

Introverted Sensing: I notice this causes some Si doms to be drawn to "Grindy" types of games, like Runescape, Diablo, Path of Exile, etc. that reward a meticulous attention to detail, but don't necessarily change in scope that often

Introverted Intuition: I think these types, while not necessarily preferring, can be very successful at competitive strategy games where possibilities and strategy are so complex that the game is not "solvable", nor can a competitor get away with using just an explicit introverted thinking approach to formulate strategies. Think games like Dota, League of Legends, Chess is even a good example of this. Almost all of the top professional players are ENTJ or INTJ, the combination of Te/Ni suits the game perfectly.

When I was thinking about this, I also went ahead and imagined what game each type would probably like, and came up with this list:

ESFP/ISFP: Legend of Zelda games. Beautiful, breathtaking games with epic plots/story-telling.

ISTJ/ESTJ: Diablo, Runescape (think grindy, but with the ability to relate and measure your accomplishments to other people)

ESFJ/ISFJ: Drawn to team games with high cooperation like Overwatch, Dota, World of Warcraft, etc. Prefer games that they can get into the swing of and know what to expect.

ENTJ/INTJ: Dota, League of Legends, Counter Strike, particularly games with large competitive scenes.

ENFP/INFP: Skyrim, any Bethesda game really. Open ended adventure games that provide you the ability to influence your will onto the world, or makes choices that feel like they are "your" choices, not predefined options provided by the game.

ISTP/ESTP: Super Smash Brothers, Binding of Isaac, Call of Duty, high action games with some layer of mechanical mastery. These are the types of people you see trying to set speed run records for old retro games.

INTP/ENTP: Minecraft, Factorio, open ended games that reward clever, inventive thinking

INFJ/ENFJ: Probably the least interested in video games to be honest. I'm a bit at a loss with this one because I feel that Fe and Ni are both traits that aren't naturally drawn to games, but the ESFJ/ISFJ and the INTJ/ENTJ can still maintain their interests because of their Si or Te.Bit of a lengthy read, not sure exactly what parts you were interested in, but here it is:

ENFP, I had a near death experience about a year ago where someone lost control of their car and drove straight into the small table a friend and I were sitting at outside a smoothie place. Completely flipped the table over, and pinned the table and us between the car and the brick building. My friend and I miraculously got off with just a few cuts/bruises, but to describe how it went:

In the moment before it happened, I recall being very tired sluggish. I remember seeing the car, and then finally registering what was about to happen when it was ~3 seconds away from me. For some reason I just felt incredibly lethargic and thought something like "Well, I guess that car's about to crash into me. Can't be bothered to move, so be it".

Once the car finished crashing and I realized I was still in one piece, I climbed out the wreckage, and remember thinking "I don't want to talk to people right now. I need to get away from here NOW before the cops show up, I don't want to sit around and answer questions". I remember feeling most annoyed not at the old lady who had just nearly taken my life, but at the soccer mom who was shouting "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR" to the old lady, as well as her two 6-8 year old kids who were letting out the most ear piercing shrieking I'd heard in a while (they stopped when my friend and I climbed out unharmed, thankfully). The only words I said to anyone were "No one is hurt" to the first person who walked out of the smoothie restaurant nearby me, and also "You ok? Let's get out of here. I don't want to stick around and answer questions for the police" to the friend who got trapped on the other side of the table with me.

My friend and I went for a short walk in an attempt to basically flee the scene. She was beginning to get a little shaken up about what had just happened, but I was still strangely calm. We decided it'd be best just to go to our respective houses and process things, so we went our separate ways and I drove home.

About 15 minutes after getting home, I suddenly felt an intense anger take over me. I was furious, LIVID, more so than I had been in a while. Not at the lady, not at the screaming soccer mom, but at the situation itself, and at myself. Why didn't I move?! What was wrong with me?! When I needed my fight or flight to kick in the most, it failed me and I just lazily accepted my death. I admittedly had been struggling with some depression and had having the beginnings of some suicidal thoughts, and began to panic thinking that perhaps I was actually more serious about wanting to die than I'd anticipated.

The other thing I was very angry about was how little I could have done to anticipate or prevent that. What, am I supposed to not sit an at outdoor table while having a smoothie with a friend? All the hard work, all the paranoia and effort I'd put into playing things safe throughout my life, and it was all about to have been moot point because of some freak accident. It felt incredibly wrong, like I suddenly lost a level of trust and faith in life's ability to be some degree of fair and predictable.

As for how I feel about it now? Honestly, not much different. I didn't have one of those "what am I doing with my life" moments, or one of those "wow, I am worrying about the small things too much, life is too short" moments (although I *have* already had one of those in the past). Overall I'd say my view on day to day life really hasn't changed much at all from the event, rather it just had a powerful effect on me for that given day.I didn't meant to imply certain types can only like a type of game, but rather that those games highlight the things those types like the most out of a game. Realistically many video games incorporate features that appeal to almost all of the 8 functions, which means people can enjoy a wide variety of genres. To give Skyrim, as an example of a game that can appeal to just about anyone, and how someone might enjoy it differently:

---

**Se**: Beautiful Aesthetics, tight gameplay

**Si**: Rewards meticulous detail to maximizing the gold/weight ratio of items you loot in dungeons, as well as grinding your smithing/enchanting to 100 for powerful gear

**Fe**: Many of the quests involve helping or unifying a group of people. In the main quest line, you can get the two warring factions (Stormcloaks/Imperials) to form a temporary truce to deal with the dragons, you lead the peace talks and everything.

**Fi**: The game is open ended, and your actions feel like YOUR decisions. You want to help that guy? You help him. You want to kill him? You can do that too! I DO get to the cloud district very often, Nazeem!

**Ne**: Incredible modding potential, fantastically rich lore, as well as diverse spell based game play which allows you to test a number of approaches (Charm a bandit with an illusion spell and get him to kill his friends for you!)

**Ni**: Modding allows someone to cater the game to their desired style of play, as well as the breadth of content allowing someone to limit the scope of their play to what they prefer.

**Te**: Game has increased difficulty settings, level caps that can be reached, and unique spells/goals that can be achieved. Lots of fun achievement candy for Te to work at.

**Ti**: Plenty of min-maxing, coming up with spell combinations/strategies, explicit mechanics a player can go through to make their decisions.

---

Now, once we see that anyone can like Skyrim, I will describe to you some of the different things my friends have said about their experience with Skyrim, which should highlight how the different types can still get different very things out of the same game.

**ESFP:** "Yeah, I played that for a bit. The game was beautiful, but honestly I got kind of lost after a while and forgot what I was supposed to be doing, so I stopped playing."

**ISTP/ESTP:** Like everyone of them was a kleptomaniac Khajit who just snuck around sniping people with bows. Or they'd be Argonian and name themselves Reptaur, something like that. I remember the first time I got my ESTP friend to play Oblivion, he sucker punched the very first non hostile NPC he ran into in the starting jail cell and got himself killed, all while giggling to himself like a schoolgirl.

**ENFP/INFP:** Picked things not primarily for their game play effectiveness, but how cool they thought it was, or how much they liked it. One guy played a "Tank Mage" who just defiantly stood there wearing heavy armor and shooting destruction magic, because having shiny armor and shinier spells "looked badass".

**ENTJ:** "Yeah, I beat that game. What type of character did you play? I used destruction magic, it was awesome."

**INTP:** "Hmm? Oh yeah, last I remembered I just tried to find the best ways to get all of my characters levels to level 100. I may or may not have abused a few glitches to get there..."

**ENTP:** He downloaded a mod to make his character some crazy race from an anime I've never heard of (this is his first time playing Skyrim, by the way), he then took 3 hours to finish the starting quest because he got overencumbered picking up every item he saw and had to slowly walk the entire way to the next town. Sold his stuff, realized he was getting bored, and left to play Pokemon.

**ISTJ:** "Yeah man, the secret to beating Skyrim is just getting your smithing and enchanting to 100, and making awesome armor. I did that and pretty much blew through the rest of the game, I was dealing crazy damage."

So basically my point was that the different types do enjoy different, specific aspects of games moreso than the others. And that while many genres embody those aspects, certain games are known for highlighting them more than others. That was my attempt with listing games/genres, to pick the ones that presented the combination of their dominant/auxillary aspects more than other games.

As for my lack of understanding with INFJ/ESFJs, it's honestly because I don't have many close friends who are of that type, which means the only thing I have to go off of is my assumption of how the types would translate into game preferences.What do you mean when you say loop? Like flip? I've had two moments in my life where I felt a flip across one set of traits (Ne/Si to Se/Ni, and then Fi/Te to Ti/Fe) but I don't know if its something that MBTI considers valid. They also weren't permanent, I eventually found my way back to the old Ne/Fi/Te/Si stack of ENFP. To give a quick overview of the examples:

1) I don't know how common this is, but I have this weird phenomena that when I exercise, my body completely shifts its way of thinking and basically goes from hyper racing thoughts to complete, calm silence. The best way to describe it is this: Have you ever heard a noise in the distance, and then you completely silence your thoughts in order to focus on listening to it? Imagine that mental silence suddenly being your default, and that the only thing that caused you to have any inner mental dialog was some specific, external stimuli prompting you to do so. 

That is how I'd describe myself after exercising, and when I started playing sports in middle school, my Ne took to the sidelines (harhar) for my Se. It's not that I'd never get to experience my Ne again, it was just that I was so often in that "exercise calm", that it started to feel more natural to me than the racy Ne style of thinking did. Once I stopped doing sports after high school, and started taking Adderall, the whole Ne/Si dynamic came rushing back with a vengeance.


2) There was a point in my life where I became really resentful of my strong emotions, and basically suppressed the ever loving shit out of my Introverted Feeling, while also beginning to take Adderall at the same time. I'd say that during those years, my default way of thinking about things was a Ti/Fe dynamic, as opposed to a Fi/Te. 

My ability to empathize with others was almost entirely gone, and I no longer felt really uncomfortable if I witnessed something morally objectionable (I willingly told myself to just ignore it so I wouldn't have to stress over it, something I'd be MUCH too proud to have done earlier). On the other hand, I DID find myself stopping people in conversation to clarify on a point they had just made, if I felt like I didn't understand some trivial detail about it, while prior I'd just tell myself it wasn't that important and nod my head. 

Secondly, I found myself becoming really interested in philosophy, because I no longer had an internal compass for what was "right or wrong", rather I felt like I had to "solve" for what was right or wrong, similar to how a mathematician would write a proof. Finally, I began to have some issues professionally/personally, because I was unknowingly acting inappropriate or inconsiderate to other people. I found myself worrying that these slights would jeapordize my job/relationships, so I began to act nervous/keep a close eye on the body language of the people around me to make sure they were happy with what I was doing. I found myself getting nervous if there was even a lapse in conversation, and I'd start trying to plan conversations in my head ahead of time to see what types of things they'd like to talk about. All of this, ALL of this being things I'd NEVER normally consider, because I'd just talk about what I felt like talking about or what was interesting.

I've been taking some Anti-Depressants since then, and I feel like I have begun to drift back to my Fi/Te dynamic of old. So, if that's what you meant by looping, I believe I've experienced something like that before.Sorry, I ain't trying to box anyone. It's funny you bring up Skyrim because I just [left another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5dzia6/model_for_gaming_preference_using_the_jungian/da8pma3/) that goes into great detail about how technically, ANYONE can love Skyrim, but they'd probably love it for different reasons.

Admittedly I don't have any close INFJ/ENFJ friends (at least none that I know who play games!), so I haven't had any real life experience talking to one and getting their view on why they like the games they play.I know everyone is already telling you, but seriously, learning cognitive functions will give you the answer you seek. According to Myers Briggs, INTJ and INTP are actually SUPER different types, so it should be a lot easier for you to decide between INTJ and INTP than say, INTJ or ENTJ.

If you want a short way to think about it, ask yourself, which sounds more like you?

INTP:
Logical, systematic thinker, but bad sense of social intuition/knowing how to act around others. Get bored doing the same thing for too long, and like to imagine different possibilities/"what ifs" about things you are interested in. You  can enjoy getting into the details/gory specifics of something. 

VERSUS:

INTJ:
You often see the bigger picture where others don't, but admittedly you can have trouble explaining your hunches, or convincing others to see things the way you do. Sharp thinker, efficient worker and good problem solver, but you are less interested in knowledge that you can't see as being useful in some regard. Also, may be slightly less aware/keen to your physical surroundings than some other people.I think people are largely shaped by the environment they grow up, and the people who influence them, so things like culture, education, and family can have a larger effect on someone's likelihood to be a climate denier than their personality type.

That being said, there are some types that would be more likely to look at the scientific data in an objective way, while there would be others who would be more prone to their own interpretation of things. However, I don't believe it'd be based off "Sensing versus Intuition". Rather, I think someone who is utilizes "Introverted Thinking" would be more immune to the environment they grew up in, and just look at the data regardless, someone who utilized Extraverted Feeling may be biased in agreeing with what a majority of people around them agree with, someone who uses Introverted Feeling may be biased in sticking with their original view point as a matter of pride, while someone who uses Introverted Sensing or Introverted Intuition would be more likely to stick with their own interpretation of things, regardless of the people around them or the technical evidence.

A little anecdotal example- I grew up in a very religious family. My brother, an ISTP, was told to read the Bible. After doing so, he lost his faith, despite that basically everyone he knew and loved was a Christian, because he couldn't get over the strange logic/inconsistencies of what he was reading. So, he is a sensing type, but he stuck to his guns and respected the logic of the situation far more than my Intuitive father and I ever did.

There was a great post about why some climate deniers have their views on reddit the other day, it basically boiled down to "The government was strictly enforcing environmental laws on their small businesses, but letting large companies slide with their environmental violations, which gave them the impression that it wasn't REALLY as big of an issue as the government made it out to be and they were just looking to make easy tax money (similar to how a police department may over zealously give out speeding tickets to raise money for the city). Welp, according to MBTI, not much. They don't have any of the same functions in their functional stack, so there isn't any common ground in that regard.

Doesn't mean they cant be friends. My brother is an ISTP, he has a decent number of INFP friends. If I had to describe the reason they get along the most, it would be because my brother is socially a very patient person (given that he does not have good natural social intuition, so he takes a really cautious/careful approach when socializing with people), as well as being a very good listener (his Introverted Thinking allows him to digest information quickly). This means that if the INFP wants to rant about something, he can keep up with it easily, while it also means if the INFP gets upset about something, it won't get him upset nearly as much as it might upset someone else, so he is able to be more patient with them than other people.The more I learn about cognitive functions, the less confident I get in my typing. I am not sure whether my behavior that seems to reflect one type can just be explained from the lense of another, or if instead the "functional stack" of Myers Briggs is not as concrete as one might think, and that people utilize all 8 functions so commonly that MBTI no longer becomes a good tool to gauge someone's personality (certainly psychologists favor using Big Five tests over MBTI).

I'd love to chat with someone about the reasons why I or they think we embody this or that function- at this point I feel like I've had a stage in my life where I favored each one of the cognitive functions, save Introverted Thinking. My gut feeling is that the functional stack of someone is not as set in stone as MBTI would suggest. I DO, however, still believe that functions do compete with each other to be expressed in your personality- i.e.,  in one moment you cannot be strongly utilizing Introverted Feeling AND Extroverted Feeling.Me thinks the ENTJs or the ESTJs would win. At the very least those are the types that end up being military leaders/strategists.

ENFPs would come up with a bunch of cool ideas for the war/their country, but after a day of working on it they'd get frustrated and bored and not follow through.It's an energetic, excitable, and optimistic one. There's this universal belief that if you keep looking hard enough, you'll always be able to find something better/more exciting.

That being said, it does come with its cons, which you eventually learn to adapt to. Often times you can get excited and dive right into something without *really* knowing if it was a good idea or not, you just wanted it to be one so bad that did it anyways. 

Also, it's easy to get bored doing the same thing. Since you are so in your head with how you interact with things, you can't enjoy an experience for its own sake, it feels like it has to have meaning/potential to you. My dad and I are both ENFPs, and we have NEVER been able to maintain a workout routine if it didn't involve getting better at some competitive sport. We had to see some new purpose/possibility with the work outs (becoming better at the sport), instead of just doing it for its own sake, or because it felt good.The best explanation I have heard is this: Have you ever heard a noise in the distance, and temporarily hushed your thoughts to focus listening to it? Take that, but flip it- to where that mental silence and focus to senses is your default, and it instead takes mental effort to think about/consider something. Your day to day actions feel less like intentional actions, and more like reactions to your environment. In addition, it is less often than others that you fixate on one thought for long, rather you are constantly reacting to what's in front of you. Mind you, the examples I am discussing are not "I had a cool idea and wanted to suggest it", they were objectively the better solution to the problem. At this point the examples I am giving were proven correct post-fact, as well as silently agreed upon between all my co-workers. My primary concern is that my bosses decide they don't want to hear it before I've even opened my mouth, as well as getting angry with me whenever I present evidence to disprove the fact that I was "lazy or incompetent" in my work.

I review, refine, and consider every angle of what I am about to present rigorously before sharing it with my boss. Things like budget, revenue, department mission are the very things I use to form my arguments, I never discuss the ideas on "principle", but rather based on its objective, tangible benefits.

I guess the crux of the issue is that I don't feel like I can ever be the one to initiate these conversations- if my bosses asks for my input, they are incredibly open to it, but when I defend myself from claims of being lazy/incompetent, or approach them with my suggestion out of the blue, they become angry with me. So I feel trapped, with absolutely zero way to defend myself when I am falsely blamed for work problems, as well as having no way to implement low risk, low cost, high payoff, high reward improvements. Admittedly both of these bosses' were older gentlemen, perhaps their strictness to their way of doing things was due to their age rather than their personality type.For sure, I suppose what I was trying to get at was knowing A) The thought process/motivations of my bosses doing this (which you've done a brilliant job explaining, I think the whole idea of "hyperfocusing, I feel really confident in this let's just get it done" describes it perfectly) and B) Wanting to know if there were any better ways than using straight forward discussion/logical analyses to present my points. 

I do like the idea that pragmatic, result driven arguments can appeal to Te, that has been my approach thus far, but it's not as realistic to use Te to explain to your boss that your performance wasn't shit, the project plan was. The very process of reflecting and understanding why something went wrong is much more a Ti thing than it is a Te thing.

My overall guess of why my bosses are this way is because to them, sticking to their own guns has been their best winning strategy thus far- even if they are occasionally wrong, is more often than not the correct choice for them, and it has got them to where they are now.I wouldn't at all pretend that I'm smarter than my bosses from the perspective of running a business/understanding the industry, rather I just have more specific knowledge about my field of specialty, as well as being a "fresh pair of eyes" on the way they do things (they were both small companies, it is very common for a new hire to have insight on some operational flaws that veteran workers have just grown accustomed to/assumed were the way other companies did things). ESPECIALLY with software development, the working practices in this field are evolving so quickly that much of the "industry" standard techniques used today didn't even exist in concept, let alone practice only a few years ago.

Not totally opposed to the idea of my own company, but I am not foolish enough to think I have the experience to make it happen yet- for now I am trying to accrue valuable industry experience by tackling tough projects under the guidance of senior software engineers. This is actual the career path many owners of large software companies take- get industry experience early, use it to start your own company later.At my previous job, this is what I did. I had a hilarious afternoon where I spent 2 hours sitting next to my boss as he tried to implement his idea that "he was sure would work, just scoot over and let me write it". After 2 hours of writing a bunch of broken stuff, he says ok you pick it up from here, he leaves and I silently delete it all/add my own code, get it working in like 5 minutes. 

There was a part of me that just wanted to be like DUDE YOU ARE THE CEO YOUR TIME IS FREAKING GOLD, LET ME SAVE YOU YOUR PRECIOUS TIME PLEASE SO YOU ARE NOT STUCK PLODDING AWAY AT THIS GRUNT WORK WITH ME, but I was too cowardly and just let him do his thing. 

Admittedly he confessed later that he liked working in the lab with me, because all of his other work involved being a talking head at this/that convention or making these big cooperate decisions, and that he kind of missed lab work, so I guess it wasn't all bad.That's interesting that you brought that up, as this has been a piece of advice I've recently received from a lot of other people who knew what type of job I was trying to work. Yes, I have been making an effort to one of the first to arrive and last to leave, but I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks so perhaps it's not been long enough to have an impact.Is it really difficult for someone to waver between being an Extroverted Sensing Dominant, and an Extroverted Intuition dominant? The auxiliary and tertiary functions would be the same, and given it's inferior roll, you wouldn't really even notice the shift between Si and Ni inferior.

Anecdotally, I know I switch into a mode of thinking that is incredibly Se dominant whenever I have exercised for an extended period of time. I lose the desire or attention span to pay something too much thought, and find myself just kind of experiencing my surroundings, only ever consciously thinking about something as a direct reaction to something that happens around me. 

So while obviously this does not mean I am literally switching between being "ESFP and ENFP" in those moments, it still can be seen as effectively acting like one or the other given different circumstances.I mean the switch to Se during exercise is not a conscious choice, it's rather some kind of automatic response. It's actually so bad for me that I don't let myself work out in the mornings, because I'll be too zoned out for the first few hours at work. It's not that I am physically tired, if anything I feel more awake than I did before. I just become hyper aware of my surroundings, while feeling very little desire to think about things in depth. Kind of a zen like calm, but it's not very good for an open ended work environment where I have to do creative problem solving. I suppose anyone who's had an intense "workout high" can relate to what I'm describing.

I remember in high school, I was playing sports year round, so I was working out so frequently I was honestly in the "Se mode" of thinking more than I was the Ne. My parents used to think that "exercise was good for my ADHD, because it calmed me so much, we're glad you're doing so many sports". It was kind of funny because the transition back to being an Ne dom in college felt awkward at first, I had to relearn how to tame my hyperactivity when it came to talking/thinking about things.My observations have been that someone's "functional stack" is not consistent throughout their life, or at the very least, there is so much potential for someone to utilize any of the 8 at any given moment, that "typing" someone is often not a useful tool for predicting their behavior.

That being said, I have found the "mutual exclusivity" of the functions to be very accurate. Both the inverse relationship between exercising an introverted/extroverted version of a type of thinking, as well as the opposing functions (Ne and Si, Ni and Se, etc.) Ask yourself, in the moments you've really wanted to make the people around you happy, how focused were you on your own feelings? Or ask yourself, in the moments you were really driven to get something accomplished, how much did you care to reflect on the details that weren't immediately relevant?

So, in a sense, in any one given moment, someone could absolutely have a functional stack that fits one of the types. However, the consistency of that stack doesn't seem to be enough to warrant typing them.Currently taking meds for Depression and ADHD, my father is ENFP and is also on Anti-Depressants, my dad's entire family is caked with depressive disorders/substance addictions. Just our anecdotal experience of course. While being an Ne dominant does give me an optimistic view of things by default, it also can lead me to very "trapped" if I feel like I am not able to take my life in a new and exciting direction. Basically having some equivalent of a "mid-life crisis" quite frequently.

Would also argue that auxiliary Fi can be a REAL bitch. The birth of my depressive disorder was due to feeling like my emotions were allowing people to take advantage of me, so in response I came to resent them and shut out my ability to empathize with others for a number of years. 

I wanted to look at your link to read some of the sources associated with the conclusions reached, but it says the link is broken.I wouldn't be surprised if some dominant functions had higher correlations with certain conditions. Si with OCD or Autism spectrum disorders, Ne with Manic disorders, Fi doms with some form of Narcissistic disorders, Se with ADHD, mayyyyybe Te with Socio/Psychopathic disorders (I could be way off the mark with this one though). Ti with Social Anxiety.

Just guessing though, I'd love to see some actual data on the subject.Really?! Having auxillary Fi feels like hell at times, I can't imagine it being the foremost part of my personality. My lack of emotional self control is probably the thing I dislike about myself the most.

ENFJ/INFJ all embody the traits I wish I had. INTP/ENTP seems like a winning recipe to reliably find some hobby/job that excites you. I thought that about Adderall when I started taking it. It's been six years since then. I guess I don't feel so bad about taking it now that I've been on it for six years, yet I haven't ever needed to increase dosage, and I'm still able to be functional if I take a day or two off of it.I suppose I'd prefer INFJ to the ENFJ, it's really the combination of Fe and Ni that appeals to me, basically the whole idea of having vision and a desire to figure out the meaning of things, from the perspective of making things better for everyone.Yup! I had myself as ENFP prior to that, and to be honest I had been pretty unsure, the more I read about the different Jungian functions, the less confident I felt. When I settled at ESFP, it was because during my middle school-high school years, my behavior was really reflective of an Se dom. However, there was still a discrepancy where I had mainly Ne dominant behavior in my early childhood, as well as college and beyond. Something I've realized (which I think may have to do with a some kind sensory disorder I have), is that the "workout high" I get from exercising both A) calms my mind so much that I completely lose both the motivation and attention span to pay something more than a brief moment of thought, and that B) this state lasts for....I don't know, 2-3 hours after a workout? So, given that I was involved with sports all year around and working out pretty much every day, the Se state kind of became my "norm". Or at the very least, I spent so much time like this, that I began to default to that more "laid back, sensory" attitude (similar to how someone who smokes a lot of pot maintains their laid back attitude even when they're sober, spending a lot of time in a certain mental state kind of trains your brain to think that way). Once I stopped doing competitive sports, I noticed the racing thoughts/hyper attitude I had in my early childhood began to come back. 

Another thing that had me on the fence about it, was how criminally unaware I was of my appearance. I'd go to class with my shirt inside out, with my all of my shirt buttons one hole too high. I also noticed that in my free time I was a latch key kid- while I enjoyed sports, I didn't seem to intrinsically value physical activity. When left on my own, I just stayed inside playing video games all day, and spent my time doing things like making my own video games/writing stories. When I read how Se was prone to like being constantly active/partying, I knew neither of these things described me either, so I reevaluated my reasoning for believing I was ESFP.

To be honest, at the end of everything my belief in a "set functional stack" or "set personality" is kind of fading. I see a lot of truth in the distinction of the 8 different Jungian functions, and how they can "compete" to be expressed in someone's personality (more of one = less of another), but I am not so convinced that people maintain the same functional stack throughout their entire lives, hell, not even day to day  I guess I wasn't clear, but after exercise, I couldn't engage my Ne even if I wanted to. Or, at the very least, it became incredibly difficult to do so. On the other hand, I could just sit and take in my surroundings without even thinking about it. The best way I can describe the sensation is this: Ever heard a soft noise, and tried to quiet your thoughts so you could hear it more clearly? That it was it felt like, but with it being the default, and conscious thought taking effort/motivation.

It's like the mental "Default" my brain chooses to go to in those moments switches completely. What I'm trying to get at is the biological context surrounding my brain (lots of endorphins released, sensory overload, etc.) changed what functions came easiest to me, or which ones I utilized without really attempting to utilize them one way or the other. Kind of similar to developing a limp without releasing it, because your sprain one of your ankles. At some point your brain subconsciously decides "This is currently easier/better than the way I usually do it", and makes you do it unthinkingly.I used to have this dilemma, but one thing that helped me realize the distinction was that my sympathy for others wasn't necessarily tied to someone's outward emotions, but rather how I perceived their emotions should be. So, on one hand, I would do something like give the kid who came from a poor family some of my lunch everyday at school, even though she would act ungrateful/annoyed with the quality of what I brought her. On the other hand, if someone was upset about an issue I couldn't relate to or didn't understand- like the social stress of being a homosexual, I could be insensitive, even if they were very visibly distressed about it.

Not saying I didn't have a shred of Fe, in fact I had a number of high school dilemmas where I was torn between doing what felt right, and doing what would make everyone feel happy. Regardless, this has helped me understand how some things I did could be motivated by Fi, even if they appear to be Fe behavior.Ah, I suppose I've just a had a lot of bad episodes where my emotions have caused me to do some bad and embarrassing things (as well as resenting my ENFP dad for being really overemotional and hard to deal with at times). I guess if you had good control over your emotions (or that they were just generally positive, and very infrequently negative), then it would feel quite invigorating to be engrossed in them all the time. To me, my emotions more often feel like a hindrance than a good motivator. It can also feel really easy to take criticism personally, because as an Fi user, part of your self-identity comes from your emotions/motivations, so to admit that your emotions are misguided is like admitting that at your core, you are incorrect, and you begin to lose trust in your ability to correctly judge a situation. Your Fi must be a lot more bitchin than mine, is what I'm getting at.Some behaviors associated with each trait, and with the Fe/Ti 

**Ti/Fe user:**
Will ask someone to clarify a detail in conversation, even if that detail wasn't all that important in the scheme of things. Think of like:

"So, I was driving downtown one day, until I saw my ex eating outside. I quickly ran over to them and sucker punched them right in the face!"

"Wait, but you said you were driving. So you like, stopped at the side of the road, and got out of your car, or what?"

In general, they can be willing to accept or contextualize morally objectionable things as a result of human nature/etc., but they will feel uneasy if they encounter something that they can't understand/contextualize relative to the rest of their understanding of the world. Quantum mechanics can be a reaaaaal mindfuck for these types.

Will probably be a lot more interested in philosophy, because without an Fi internal compass, they may at times feel the need to "solve for", or "deduce" what is morally right or wrong.

Generally get along with others better (unless they have inferior Fe), but at times can be susceptible to "group think" or "doing the wrong thing that makes everyone happy". They may be the ones to point and laugh along with their friends at someone else's expense, because they don't want to upset them by disagreeing with them.

**Te/Fi User**

Will quickly become bored with information if they can't see some tangible use for it now, or in the future. If the details aren't important, they don't want to hear them. Doesn't mean they can't mull over/be interested in complex topics, but it really only maintains their interest as long as they can attach it to some beneficial potential use.

They are the type to go for the quick and efficient solution, as opposed to their Ti brethren who may go for the slow, guaranteed solution. 

Will feel uncomfortable with something based on the principle alone, even if the actual consequence/outcome is fine. "Hey, did you just take the last slice of pizza when I hadn't eaten any yet? I mean, I wasn't actually going to have it, so the slice is yours, but it upsets me that you were willing to take it regardless."

More likely to stick up for someone who is being mistreated, although they may cause conflict within the group to accomplish this. 

Fi in general (unless it is inferior Fi) is more prone to empathize with things like small children, animals, or poor/homeless people. They also can be less open to taking criticism by default (but this doesn't mean they cannot learn to mature and overcome this) There's been a lot of consensus within the psychology community that the "personality stack" of someone is not nearly as concrete as we think. However, the idea of segregating "jungian functions" as 8 separate ways of thinking that compete with each other to be expressed does hold a lot of truth. What I'm getting at is that you may have a lot of great examples of you using all 8 different jungian functions, but if you really want to settle on a type, you will need to ask yourself which you use more often, or which you are more naturally prone to use (even if you are GREAT at using many of them).I feel like you are correct when it comes to problem solving matters, but I believe it can be the opposite when approaching moral or social issues. Te/Fi is more likely to argue a social issue based on principle, while Ti/Fe is more likely to argue an issue based on consequence. 

A group of friends buy a pizza, and before you have had your first slice, the person next to you, who has had four slices already, takes the last one. As it turns out, you're allergic to gluten and couldn't have had the pizza anyway, but your friend didn't know that.

Fi/Te is mad that the friend was inconsiderate to take the pizza in the first place, without saving some for them.

Fe/Ti laughs, but notices they weren't going to eat the slice anyways, and just moves on with the rest of the night.1. ENFP
2. I've yet to take the test for enneagram, I'm on a prescription meds that alter my personality, so I'm worried as to what effect those will have.
3. [Extra credits did an episode on using MBTI to design characters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKnNO5pxRGQ), and the whole concept of "competing traits" in personality really resonated with my own observations.
4. Dad is ENFP. Mom is ESFJ. They are now divorced, if you're curious how that worked for them.
5. ISTJ, with another close ISFJ friend.
6. I'm pretty open, but I find that I'm attracted to someone who is really passionate and driven about something, so I guess INTJ, INFJ, or ENFJ?
7. I don't have super strong political opinions (I usually retreat to "I don't know enough about this subject to be qualified to have an opinion on it") I guess I catch myself using the functions not native to the ENFP (Ti, Fe, Ni, Se, etc.) so often that I don't find "ENFP" to be too useful of a way to predict my behavior. Then again I'm taking those prescription meds like mentioned, so that could just be due to those.In general, yes, it's just knowing what order you have them in, but according to MBTI there are many rules about what the stack can "be". As in, each function must be the opposite of the introversion/extroversion of the functions surrounding it (your first and second functions can't be both extroverted, for example). In addition, the 1st and 4th functions must be opposite (Fe/Ti, Ni/Se, etc.), as well as the 2nd and 3rd functions being opposites.
Finally, the idea behind functions are that the first is most forefront part of your personality, the 2nd and 3rd are pretty accessible to you, and the 4th is something that you don't practice much, because it directly competes with your dominant function (you'd have to use LESS of your dominant function in order to use your inferior, 4th function more). So, for example, if you had Extroverted Thinking as your dominant function, people may describe as you insensitive, or out of touch with the moral implications of your actions. If you were an introverted intuitive dominant, people might describe you as "too in your head", and kind of clumsy/unaware of your surroundings  (due to Ni competing with Se).

It's also worth looking into how a certain type's functions combine to make a certain type of personality. ISTP, for example, prefers things that can be logically understood/broken down, yet that can be tangibly experienced. This combination of Introverted Thinking and Extroverted Sensing can lead them to be really into certain hands on hobbyist projects, video games, etc. INTJ combines their visionary Ni and Te to be super clever problem solvers, who are able to find solutions to problems normally seen as way too information dense or complicated to be tackled. That being said, their lack of Si and Ti also can make it difficult for them to explain their reasoning to someone else, or for someone else to be able to convince them of something by logical argument alone.My cousin is ENTJ, he also looks like a super model so he gets a LOT of attention from women.

That being said he was raised in a pretty religious family, so while he could have easily gone from woman to woman, he did not. Sure he can be kind of flirty at times, I've seen some of his past girlfriends get jealous with him, but he's never actually cheated on any of his girlfriends, hell, he doesn't even sleep around that much, if even at all, for what I know. It's all moot point now though, he just got engaged.My favorite discussions are ones where people discuss some real life behavior, and try to frame it within the scope of MBTI. Like, so and so does these types of things, do you think they are this or that personality? Or, I am this personality, but do this thing that is very different from it, what might be the reason? I feel like at times, MBTI discussions try to avoid making any hard statements about specific types of behavior being tied into specific personality types or functions, and in the end it just feels like "We're trying to keep things as vague and detached as possible, so we don't allow certain observations to disprove our model of thinking". It reminds me how astrological readings make it a point to be vague, lest they be seen as inaccurate. Basically, I want to be able to use MBTI to notice real patterns in people, and have some real, tangible insight on how to understand someone else, so I am very fond of topics on here that help that.ENFP: Something that shows they were thinking about me when they got it, or something really fun/offbeat. 

When someone gets me something that they maybe heard me mentioning I liked once, but I haven't really made it a point to bring it up. Or a type of gift that isn't "safe", but shows they think I would be the kind of person to like this- like a book on a kind of complex, nuanced topic that they think I'd enjoy, or a gizmo/software/game that might be a little weird or complex, but they think I'd be the type of person to like it. Honestly, they don't even have to be correct about the "me liking it" part, just to see that they put the thought into the gift feels really good in itself.

Don't get me wrong though, it's not like I act disappointed or whatever when someone gets me a thoughtless gift, I am still happy with my friends who just handle me a crumpled up $20 bill and say "Happy birthday, sorry I didn't get you a card". Also love gifts that involve doing something fun with friends.You just reminded me I need to get an ugly Christmas sweater for an upcoming Christmas party, thank you. Will be happy to take any suggestions you may haveTo be honest, advice from a J would not probably be your best bet, as they are the individuals who are more naturally motivated, and thus wouldn't have to learn special behaviors/techniques to be conscientious. You'd want to be asking other perceiving types who have learned to overcome their lack of conscientiousness.

A technique I like to use is to set alarms for everything I need to remember. Am I supposed to pick up some groceries today? Set an alarm to go off ~15 minutes before it'd (probably) be convenient for me to go out and grab some. This helps in particular because I am the last kind of person to actually remember, it'd never pop up in my head unless something specifically made me think about it again.

Also, sticky notes/paper. Even if I am never going to read the note afterwords, writing down what I'm working on/trying to solve helps keep me on task.Yeah, the way I see it, both Ni and Te kind of serve as "magic subconscious" functions that don't really let the user consciously perceive how you came to your conclusion, so in a sense you are just as much in the dark as to *why* you believe something as the person you're speaking with, since all you get to consciously experience is thinking about the problem, and suddenly having a solution magically appear in your head (where as with Ti and Si, it is much more connected to simple, real world facts and/or slow, intentional thoughts).

At the very least, I've witnessed a number of times where an INTJ had some idea, people disagreed with them, and instead of explaining their idea the INTJ just got frustrated that people didn't see it their way. INTJ often ended up being right, it was just kind of crazy to see how they were so unable to vocalize the reasoning behind their thoughts.Wouldn't describe myself as being frozen with indecision, rather that I can be emotionally inconsistent. In any given moment, I can feel incredibly confident in my decision on something. Rather, it just feels like my emotions can strongly bias my decisions one way or another, as well as my impatience for details causing me to make shallow and thoughtless decisions, both of these leaving room for me to change my mind later on.

As for sexuality, I've definitely been open to the idea of being something besides heterosexual, but I just haven't had any desire to be. I guess having Ne+Fi would just allow someone to be more open to that kind of thing were it their natural inclination? IDKI actually find ENTJs and I get along pretty well, we can connect over topics about enterprise or generally anything Te related. Obviously there is some conflict if they are particularly insensitive to someone, but we both seem to have ambition, big picture thinking, and a desire to keep conversations pragmatic and realistic, as opposed to delving into unimportant details. I've had a few ENTJ peers compliment me on how they appreciate that I can be "no-bullshit", or "open and candid" with things.

Then again I guess part of it is that my peers and I have learned how to act around each other. I avoid getting preachy/dramatic about things, and they avoid touchy subjects that they might upset someone over.I work in software, and my last two bosses (one INTJ, one ENTJ) have had something in common. Whenever they ask me to do a task, but have very unreasonable expectations of me, it feels impossible to explain this fact to them, no matter how air-tight/polite/convincing my points are. Instead, they get annoyed and more angry, acting like "I don't care what you have to say, just get it done!"

Now normally I am willing to just follow my bosses' orders, because they are the ones who pay me, but there are times their decisions cause us to fall behind, and they assume instead I was incompetent/lazy in my work. At this point I try my best to explain why things are taking so long, but they even get more mad when I do this and tell me "I don't want to hear it just get the damn thing done".

My *theory* as to why this is the case is because their Introverted Intuition leads their decision making (which is not a function that is able to be influenced by direct reasoning), their Extroverted Thinking is not receptive to my overly analytical explanations, and their tertiary/inferior Fi makes them somewhat prideful, meaning they are not happy when they realize they have made a mistake. The ONLY success I have ever had on this front is when I somehow present the information that led me to view their decision as incorrect, without ever suggesting I actually think their decision is wrong, or that I want to do something differently. Basically, let them think the idea was their own, but this can at times be hard to do, especially when defending yourself against claims of incompetence. 

I've found that these people can be incredibly open-minded/intelligent about non-work related topics, and are great conversationalists when discussing random things at the water cooler. They are incredibly successful and devoted to their companies too, so I feel like if anything they should be very interested to receive suggestions.

Just as a reminder, this is not a case of me making an argument, and them disagreeing. This is a case of me presenting them with a fact that shows their expectations of me were incorrect, and them just getting angrier and cutting me off when I do. Not trying to make this a "how do you know you were right, maybe they were right" discussion.
It is impossible for an interesting and empathetic person to be an estp. *Has* to be an intuitiveWhy?Getting colderWhat do you think of archer as an ESFP? (I agree with  Estp, just wondering what you think)Why?I agree. I saw this http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/141165429676/archer-sterling-archer-esfp and it made me wonder a littleWhat does that mean? "If I were ESFJ I would be confident the way I was no matter what, but I don't see ESFJs doing that often"Very interesting! Is there anywhere I can read other historical and fictional typings for those two in socionics?What's that have to do with what I said? Are you saying it's resentment that drives this tendency in people?No, he didn't lolCould you elaborate on makes you say he's an esfp? I've never heard that beforeThat was really convincing. Thanks for sharing that insight.Don't see how anyone can say someone that relentlessly and overwhelmingly loud is an introvert. I think ESFP, clear se-dom.   I  also see more te than niHe's not reserved as an individual. He's very outspoken and constantly works to bring his work to fruition.  Passion isn't necessarily fi.  You should make it. Could be a good discussionI would say istp isfp are definitely not as thrill seeking. They generally have a greater attachment to their comfort zoneIn my case I look for something to do every free chance I get. People have fears and can't get beyond them just to appease your subjective view of honesty. That kinda stuff can be deep seated in peoples personalities.

Also, are you gay?It doesn't matter-- I was just wondering if it were a typo, since you said he.  I am too. Also, it's not like I just asked that, and didn't answer your question.  So need to feel weird about anythingIntp = texhnolyze

What do you notice when you spend time with estps?How do you relate to the others I listed, if you're familiar with them?

Why?I know right? That's exactly the response I was looking for Oudynfury :)YesI meant both. Some people rp with in a methodical way, some rp with a template an proceed organically.  For the lulzTHE guy? Roman???I haven't seen a big difference, as a gay guy. Whenever articles mention sex it has no real basis beyond stereotyped gender behaviors.I would say that's too nuanced in reality to be legitimate.  I think of you say men are socialized to be stoic, that does not necessarily lead to them being socialized to be objective thinkers. 
Being socialized to not display pain, does not immediately disqualify other displays of emotion and subjective reasoning.
So I don't know if I would say it effects them? There are even other aspects of fe that are not considered bad traits for males. Even like being overbearing,  and vocal in enforcing roles for others-- men are generally culturally entitled to act that way.How is that aux fi? (Not disagreeing, just want to know)Mr peanut butterI think he's intp.
I think Neo does not have his own value system. He considers the Oracle, Morpheus and the identity/expectations projected up on him in general.   Not only has the world as he knew it been proven to be a lie;  been proven to be a stark, cold, Armageddon.. the remaining amount of hope and divinity lies solely within him. 

Does neo navigate all of this objectively or subjectively?

I personally see more fe in how neo navigates this. He considers and analyzes what morpheus and such have to say.  He's a sponge. I wouldn't say, he ever replies to anyone saying he's the one with a deeply considered or felt identity that opposes them. It's always, in not the one because it's not possible etc
He doesn't 'i am not the one, I am instead This' 
It's detached in a way fi by nature cannot be?

Look at his conversations with the architect. How the architect challenges the concepts and predestination.  I think that's perhaps the most fi reaction neo has to anything. 
Until the last film, neo hardly stands up for anything. 

You know, I could moreso see agent Smith as an infp (although I don't think he is) I think you're also neglecting the fact it's Keanu reeves. He emotes that way in every role, more or less.  Are you saying all infps emote the same way as keanu reeves? 

From my perspective,  you're looking too much at perceived behavior as it relates to personality descriptions and not observed use of cognitive functions. With neo, I see a huge disconectedness from his emotions. I see more fe universalism, valuing the whole over the individual (except trinity).  There's no resistance from Neo to anything Morpheus says. Morpheus is essentially declaring Neos destiny, and he never recoils from someone taking such a liberty.

Whereas you look at Smith, who reacts with a world destroying vitrol at the thought of being controlled, predestined.  Much more fi (although lower stack)well I was  originally responding to someone saying 'he's definitely an Fi-Ne' user, and you then responded to me, as if I was saying he's the best example of an INTP. I think that's the miscommunication between us.

If you don't think he's representative of any particular type,  as the original topic claimed, that's fine, cause I was responding to someone saying he's an INFP.   I'm mostly saying he's not an fi dominant. There were other aspects of that person's response, like saying his hacking was an expression of fi, that I disagreed with, and that wasn't picked up in your responses. I don't think they said anything to disprove he's ti-dominant.

And  I'm saying it's indicative of low fe, if anything, because the way the reacts to everything is not in line with a fi-dominant.  His development as character is very detached, analytical growth into an Jesus allegory.  A development of low stack fe rather than dominant fi.
And he's contrasted against low stack fi Agent Smith.

Also, anecdotally,  I've met lots of people like neo. Heavily introverted and detached. It's not at all rare expression in  ti-dominants.


  I like thisNo, they are different. Much improved, actuallyI don't think he was staggeringly ignorant. He bit off more than he could chew but had competently handled himself for a long time. Learning local fauna, survival skills and navigation.  

I've seen this reaction from people and I wonder how much of that comes from differing types. I did not relate to him but he is someone I could've gotten a long with. Also, when I watched the movie, I wasn't really reacting to it. How he treated his family, how he made increasingly ill advised treks. I did not feel the need to really judge.


But yes I would say isfp over istp and infp.
He seemed more considered with a philosophy of immediacy. Curiously, when you're in the wild like that, alone, you can't really stay in your head too much. It's all immediate, transitory feelings. Are you charismatic and have lots of sex or do you have really intens silly arguments that alienate you from others? If you answered yes to the former, you're on my team Oh yeah?What's that supposed to mean?How much did you smoke? Any other thoughts you're having?No real reason, but may I ask how old you and your brother are and what country you're from?CoolWow, how did you manage that?Why do you see Harley as an ESTP?He means she has fi (esfp) instead of fe (estp) in her function stack; he's not saying she's fi-domHow's that a culture shock? The esfp wasnt about growth?Circular commentYay mr peanutbutterI would be offended (well more like vaguely annoyed) by homer Simpson as esfpI would say homer is inarguably far more stupid. But, I didn't say anything about intelligence and that's not where my problem lies. Homer is selfish, rude, ungrateful, violent, and many other negative things.   Peanutbutter is well liked, very sweet. and wants the best for everyone around him.     Lots of positive qualities.I think people can parody their opposites wellWhich characters in attack on titan so would you consider se-doms?Why do you think max is infpHow old are you?How is that something intjs would do? That's generally what intps do.   He seems clearly intp.
But it's cool you can relate to him.Yes, I've noticed that! I'm ennegram 9 and there's very little out thereThere's a circle jerk around all the NTs especially Entp and intj. Frankly, I feel that's inarguable. Regardless of any negative stereotypes, intps are perceived as intelligent which is clearly a major criterion for judgment in mbti culture. Being perceived as intelligent and clever by default as opposed to sensors having to justify themselves in a sense. There are far, far more casually negative things said about sensors especially SFs than any intuitive type and that can't really be contestedI really don't think that's true. Reddit is pretty diverse. I post in a lot of sports oriented subs; read abut outdoors, survival, cycling, photography etc: stereotypically intuitives wouldn't be the majority there. Non-surface and galloping are also somewhat snide terms to use in this context where the depth and intellect of sensors is being challenged, hehI see, all goodDeus ex 2 invisible war:

Thanks, I appreciate that. I try to do something that I wasn't able to do the year before. Whether that's something physical, hanging out with friend or partner who became closer--things along those linesThe character himself?Thanks!I don't identify with him. He's not very curious about events or people. I don't understand the character that well. Do you?Thank you! 


I make friends with people pretty easily. I'm pretty open, warm and get along with mostly everyone on a surface level.   Making more enduring, sincere friendships with people isn't so easy, but that's how it goes for everyone I imagine.

I look for honesty and humor for most part.  I like all kinds of people, so I seek out all kinds of people. Is there a character you do identify withI just came from a date with one, haha. I like him quite a lot, but I like the type in general. I like their curiosity, desire to figure out the underlying logic and specifics of stuff and enthusiasm for learning in general. It's so Charming.


 I'm assuming you mean your brother is esfp, what don't you like about him?Do me! Let's do it. I'm open to being something differentDon't listen to him, he's being a weird ass dork.

I'm in decent shape, and that goes a long ways for attractiveness for most people. And I think I'm pretty attractive but I wouldn't say I'm attracted to myself. I'm attracted to beefy, chubbier guys.  I only say that cause you said wondered what I found really attractiveYes, I do. And, sure, no problem,whateverNo problemHeh!Halloween 8 years ago must've been litHeh, so was I!It's not that seriousThere are no esfp memes, but they would probably be pretty happyNo, your description was more te than ti: "the proved way is the best way" for example.

You clearly want to be an entp, so, whatever.Didn't you use to have an esfp flair?I see, pretty interesting. I notice when people are sensors they flip around a lot less. In my life I've gotten only istp, estp, infp and esfp. They are all similar in the functions, except infp. So my whole life it's been similar functions in different order. I see intuitives jumping around a lot more and wonder how much of that is just over intellectualizing and being stuck in their heads. 

I also think some of it is them not wanting to identify as sensors ever. So someone will say am I enfp or enfj which are completely different cause they don't want to be esfp or whateverRick is an isfpEvery one uses their five senses, though. That's underwhelming and stupid to regard se has heightened senses. I think it's obviously more nuanced than that but the language and culture of mbti largely doesn't gel with the values/lifestyles sensors leads.   Also are you sure you're even a see user and not an ISTJ?  What's your point lolHow so?No, it's more than he just made a statement and not a topic or queryYou didn't say anything that indicated to isfp. Not sure why you even asked lolI got a score 42Why don't you like pukwudgie5? My record is 8Why is wukong an enfp?How do you get fi from Hamilton's interviews?Are you an istp?I think this community revolves are discussing intuitives and it's really tedious. 
Every post that goes into theory is oriented toward high stack intuition

I think the ages of people here may also be a bit of a problem cause there's a certain level of life experience necessary to have a more objective view of people (especially ones you don't like). You see this a lot when the only example has of a type is a parent or classmate they clash with

I don't really see him as inauthentic. What would an authentic tebow look like?  
He's pretty hard worker but was never talented especially as a qb. He could've had a longer  career if he just became a receiver (many people change positions  when going pro). Maybe that says something about him.  I feel like a ne-dom would be more open to differing possibilities as far as what role they played as long it kept them in the nfl.

That's a broad question, what did you feel you didn't 'get'and then I could elaborate? :)The book prioritizes the ebb and flow of consciousness over narrative. It's point that flow and the  aspect humanity and alienation
it thusly represents

It's also important to take into context of the book.  
When you read that book, you might get a sense of that type of person, why you don't like them, how you are not them.
 But that sort of self-consciousness and neurosis was just being explored

This along with Sartres public/literary persona, political climate of the world, etc. It all factors into him writing a book about an individual rather than a structurally coherent thing to be received well be literary establishment at the time. Why do you think that?I was interested in your personal assessment, I know how the majority of people feel about him. But it's all goodesfp- Running, cycling,  hiking, yoga and bodyweight exercisesAre you male or female?The isfj sounds really hotYou're an esfj now?

Your writing style seems familiarHow does he lack se? Isn't he big into working out and has had very intense live performances with accompanying stage design for 20 years? In addition to always having a distinct aesthetic for himself. Seems way more isfp than infpThey aren't stereotypes, next time don't respond with needless condescension. 



Disagree with your statement about closer and Michael Jacksons lyrics. How familiar are you with their respective song writing processes? Jackson by all accounts was very, very observant and cognizant of the emotional impact of of his delivery along with the accompanying instrumentation. Breaking them down, re-recording snippets. Also, he didn't write all his lyrics, in any case. You don't know what the personality and tendencies are of the original song writer. For instance one of Jackson's first hits was written years before he recorded by a song writer many years his senior writing about his girlfriend. JacKson hadn't even left the Jackson 5 when it was written. But maybe you'd hear the lyrics and think a'that was written with xx and polar xx' which is actually meaningless cause there are so many other factors at play here most importantly being that Jackson didn't even write it .


 He also existed within an entirely different context  with different aspirations, expectations and tools as an artist.

You can't make a meaningful comparison. Your argument that reznor isn't an isfp can't be communicated through such flawed reasoning.No, it doesn't support your argument. Everything you said about Jackson's lyrics was invalid because they don't have an equivalent role in his music. And it shows a greater lack of understanding of the music process in general which makes me doubt your handle on reznor


Essentially, you've said nothing to support reznor being an infp and that's why the majorgity of your post was referencing my comments on se instead of defending/elaborating on Jackson: because you didn't know what you  were talking about.  What you've said was just as shallow as what I said originally, and you don't seem to get that.

Future oriented and conceptual are very subjective terms that you aren't defining in relation to reznor (or Jackson). 
I would say his lyrics are pretty direct and concrete as are his creative methods in general. For example, in his music, he doesn't like to include production techniques that cannot be replicated live.  It has always been very important to him.  In fact a tendency of his lyricism since White Teeth has been that he's been   very direct  with greater pop sensibility of his songs. The lyrics are unambiguously about substance abuse, burned out, depression. He sought out musicians like Aaron North specifically for the raw energy the brought to the live and studio performances.  All these lead me to think se over neI agreeEsfp 9w8I agree. It makes perfect sense to meWhat?Yeah, that's trueWhat are they like?That isn't really possible. If there are many times more enfp than esfp there cannot be just as many mistypes.  
I do agree though that people don't question sensors. And these people talking about rarity are always other intuitives who are very certain they are not sensors despite these same statistics indicating they aren't intuitive.
 I think this kind of talk is in some way a way of validating identity, especially when they are teenagers/early 20s


By recognising that others are pretending to be a type, they assure themselves they are sober minded enough to determine they are not pretending to be an intuitive for similar ego driven reasonsNo, it's not delusion. 
I know you're not an esfp, but are you an isfp?   Why are you an infp and not an isfp when infp is an especially rare type according to these statistics?

It's easy to say you want to be an esfp when it's the near total opposite of you and you've  equated it with popularity, warmth and self actualization.

But do you want to be an isfp?  The significantly more likely thing, but that's not as esteemed as infp?Chill outMe (youngest): esfp

How so?I seeWhy?Betty Draper for meI was literally asking how you would react if your type had unflattering reputations and descriptions.  If it would turn you away. I wasn't really proposing anything beyond that scenario. You can answer my question while it still being true that there are numerous other reasons for sensors not attracted to this stuff.  But I don't think this came through well, given how people are responding to threadDid you actually read my post? I said ESFX  not ESFPI think you could elaborate on how those particular things feel? I asked a question, and that would be an interesting way of answering it.There's nothing wrong with it and that's not an easy going life at all lol. Especially if there's more one kidYes, that means I'm not talking about just efsp. So why would you say that? It was clearly just a joke to indicate 'would you like to be a type with x negative association'? It really isn't that difficult to figure that out.This is so sad. Are you light from death note? I'm the same way It doesn't really matterThat's not ironic.  And it's not badly named, it's the most ubiquitous term for this kinda thing. That's why it's named this.  It's more about how search terms function and  the context.  You just wanted to say all of that, lolI notice a tendency with people when it comes to rappers  for them to react really negatively to them being considered an intuitive type, especially an nt. 

I think because of  age/life experiences people have trouble accepting that others leading what they consider more materialistic lifestyles and producing 'shallow'  stuff are NT which (despite what anyone claims) are considered inherently smart.  
After all, her music is just one part of her life and she has her reasons for doing what she does, like anyone, which can't be summed up by simply being stupid.



I don't really see her as a se dom for what it's worth and this is also a tendency of people, to call whoever they don't like an esfx.

 'Everyone who is flamboyant and stupid by my standards is an esfp. The slightly smarter ones are   estp'Don't mind him, he made an account just to say this.

So that right there rules out a lot of topics:  DAE loneliness, alienation, etc


A lot of the problems I have, I don't see the need in framing or approaching them from the perspective of typology.   And, I don't feel  especially like I need the affirmation of  my strengths from people with the same type. I really don't need any of this stuff at all. I get on very well without it.

This again rules out a lot of threads. Cause we don't have a reason 'to be' esfp. Or to relate thoughts and experiences through that archetype.   I am not sad about that, im just pointing it out.

Basically, all the reasons that would lead to someone over identifying and immersing themselves into this stuff I feel i fundamentally lack.  And perhaps it's not just me, but all of us?


Alienation, confusion, a desire to authenticate ones self perception all draw people into this stuff,  and in a sense they perform their type. Especially inxx and entp


There just isn't a reason to do anything. I don't think that's a problem. We aren't really encapsulated by this stuff. The bulk of writing isn't about us. There's no reason to be here


 Mbti culture is for and is  centered around intuitives. And you're not gonna change it.  I think (how many times am I gonna say that) you're better off just being visible, in general.  If that's what you want to do. I like seeing other esfp postPeter: entp

Rocket:  estj

Drax: esfp

Gamora: istp

Groot: isfj


Bug: estp

Adam warlock: infj

Jack flag: estp

Mantis: enfjIs that what  lelianna is?This is a very good point. I think for some reason 'abstract, theoretical conversation' is considered a big but comfy enough blanket that people consider it good and indicative of depth. 
Eventhough it doesn't really mean anything in particular.

But the language you'd describe  naturally sounds boring in a very specific way that implies lack of depth. 

What you said about the 'depth' of infp topics generally being something very related to themselves is interesting. Perhaps that's part of issue? Not elaborating on what depth means, or how people steer deep conversations. As opposed to just treating it fundamentally, uniformly yet vaguely awesome?Can you explain varric, Bull and morrigan?Why you think varric is esfp interest me the most. I've only seen him described as entp. I'm not disagreeing, just very curious to your impressionsThat's awesome.   Can you give a similar answers for Alistair?

Whatdo you think leads people to believe varric is entp?  

You don't like partying and hanging out?Hello :)

And I see Circle jerk topic I'm  e9 esfp and that's a pretty common ennegram for them yes Could you please phrase your question in different way? I don't understand what you're asking I think that also shows that jumping out of a plane for her isn't a big deal for her,  not a fear. So in a sense its not about ' the moment' at all for you as fear itself is an a concept.  You are working through a emotional process,  its a narrative. 

  
Whereas for her,  seeing a new place from an entirely unique, potentially  once in a lifetime   perspective, is more sincerely  about the moment  You probably aren't even an infj 'we dream in narrative, daydream in narrative, remember, anticipate, hope, despair, believe, doubt, plan, revise, criticise, construct, gossip, learn hate and love by narrative.’-Barbara Hardy 

I think everyone lives out their lives in a narrative.   But moreso some people have a preference for words and concepts before lived,  fleeting experiences esfpHe's talking about a show, not the concept of jack of all trades master of noneWhy that over enfj?   Impossible to tell with all that shitposting. Don't know why you'd even askWhat do you mean 'no true depressed person'. That's a bit stupid and tactless , don't you think?The Catholic church has a confessional, but in Scripture it emphasises honest conversation. Confession is to unencumber ourselves and deal with a problem in reality.

You don't  necessarily know your client more by being told a very intimate thing like that. It's just out of context. It's honest, he trusts you,  but it's still fearful, you know?  If he told his wife that, it would have impact and meaning that scares him in some sense.  He shares it cause he knows you are not apart of his real life.

So I wouldn't say we can get to know people better online than in person. We can get to know them, but that detachment creates another facade just as misleading as the masks people wear in realityThey didn't mention NJs?Why are you more likely to clash with another se user?A healthy esfp looks at the thighs and *then* the butt. That's how you get the full pictureThe rarity is overstated.  But, actually,  you would be pretty rare as a female estp,  too.  

I'd look more into entj!IsfpwhyenfpYou're welcome, buddy.  Aside from that center of attention thing, he overall seems more open and in need of attention than.  I think he comes off as an introvert cause he's depressedThis is so misguided and sad. Also you're an istj not an intpWhy intj and infj?IstpIstpIstp probably I had that, for awhile.  It's still there,  but not really.   I don't know if it's meaningful to say you have one more intensely than the other. What's fi about that?Bad botdefinitely not entpHe's an xxsp not infpYou can be lazy in one sense and proactive in others. Its not an absolute thingNot necessarily, and he said ideas and ambitions.    Everyone has things they don't pursue for some reason.   For instance, I want to run up mountain with 3000ft  trail, but I'm kinda too lazy to do it.  Is any part of that stereotypically an xntp thing?    He didn't elaborate on what ideas and ambitions were so you don't necessarily have to to assume they are brain storm-y ideas over practical or physical ones
Why no picture examples for se-doms?i think iroh esfp and zaheer infj
how old is he and how old are youYou're an estp now?I think you can talk and associate with people for reasons other than being understood by them on a deep level. And you can also recognize why people talk to you. Your friendships with people can be fulfilling in unique ways and aren't necessarily lacking because you are not intimate in the way you (op) subjectively define intimacyDistractions from what?How do you relate to Todd? I relate  to mr pbHow old are youLet's form a support groupit sounds like you want to be told youre an infpIf it's no big deal then stop talking about it all the time?  You clearly give a fuckDo you have any  bitches? That's the key differenceNoSo tired of these YouTuber streamer posts who caresI don't want to add it upI think it depends  on the game and your role. Also the dynamics within the team and clan.  Competitive gaming requires communication,  reflex, prediction and map awareness.  I wouldn't say istp is definitively the best.  For instance my old clan leader was an enfjYou're an estp now?Why do you think you are?Not sure why you'd post this here,  but you sound pretty young and will probably  move more toward the  right as you get olderI think he's too  vocal and volatile to be isfp.   He's not much of a loner... Not like Bruce Wayne tier loner. 

I say  esfp. Volatile,  and not really ideological. He's a big contrast against Bruce in a way that he seeks out relationships,  a real life,  and more openly cares about people close to him. I also see him more as esfp  than xstp  cause he tries to get along with Bruce (and people  in general) to an extent that inconveniences him (people pleasing)


Bruce  intj Terry esfpIn dungeons and dragons  alignments are defined differently. They aren't  using evil,  neutral,  and good in a literal sense.This applies to many types, but as an example: I have been looking into ESTP-INTJ and am finding so many negative things from the intj side.  I saw one person saying that they cannot imagine a more incompatible relationship, even when they had interests in common. 

But, since these two types have two functions in common, should they be so incompatible? The type that has totally opposite functions of estp is the istj, which perhaps is what many intjs truly are.

And wouldn't that one then be the most strenuous kind of association?
  So, I wondered, how much of what I've read over the years, has really been from istjs mistyping themselves and cultivating this really negative image for intj-estp?

 I also wondered also about a more positive version of this:  the huge enfp-intj circle jerk I often see. 

How many of these people are really esfp-istj?  

Mom type and partyboy. I don't understand why? When I look at the functions of these two, they are interesting combination that would lead to complete people. And I've seen many smart, intriguing people of these types. Yet nearly everything I've read of these types is so negative.
An example of this is Cersei: if someone says she is ENTJ, the response is generally 'no, she thinks she is, but is not smart enough'. I am not saying she is an ENTJ just that it's like she's qualified as ESFJ by a paucity of attributes, rather than strengths and this is something I see in general for this type and ESFP.  
I cannot think of one really awesome and intelligent ESFP character (I welcome hearing of one)

Interestingly enough ENFJ and ENFP are really positively written. I have one friend who seems like ESFJ,but cannot find writing online that he would find relatable than ENFJ cause of the huge contrast in how differently those two are written of.
What sort of your characters do you play and what's your personality type?

In pnp games and rpgs such as fallout,,Dragon age, etc, that you craft a backstory and further individuate your characters.
If you play characters similar to yourself, or fairly different, why do you think that is?

As an example, I have noticed I've gravitated to te-heavy characters. In Dragon age: origins I played an noble dwarf who was pretty decisive and short (heh heh). In that game, you are grey warden which is an ancient military order with extra-legal powers. I saw him as taking that to an extreme. There is one part where a demon possess a childs cat and forces you to play puzzle in order to relinquish the boy who he has under a spell.

My character refuses, charges and kills the demon and it's familiars. Never compromising and generally choosing the most dispassionate and efficient solution. There are many other instances, where instead of compromising with a demon or anything, he'll take a hardline approach.
Furthermore, he's pretty focused on the end goal (killing the main demon plaguing the world). I pass up on many side quests, and do everything to be prepared for that final battle, even becoming allies with some dubious characters because they bolster the war effort immensely.

I would say he's more of ESTJ.
Very thorough, Commanding identifying strongly with identity as warden.  I think more STJ than NTJ cause there's some ne in the way I played him.

I'm not sure why I gravitate to these characters. Very different from me.
What about you?Sometimes it seems everything is just n
Intuitives writing really positively about each other.  The most intriguing posts seem to be about intuitives. Insightful,, technical posts about functions, are about high-stack intuition. Posts about relationships are often about intuitives interested in or dating each other..
 just goes on and on.  

How do sensors feel about it? 
I personally get a little bored. Every time I see my type,  'this girl at work annoys me so  much with how she.. ' or something or the other follows. Not the really  anything insightful or positive. There's just so little content, when I really think of itSame as title Tonight I'm at home watching movies (blade runner),and texting people. Tomorrow I'll go to a beer festival and later on a sex party.
I would say that goes along well with the prevailing perceptionsHave you ghosted on someone? What are your thoughts on ghosting as way of ending a relationship (at any stage) or friendship? And, what is your typeBy best i mean most informative, least passively insulting and boring. Something that would not put a person off. ThanksSomething I've noticed over time. For example, people  will say something like 'why do people think being an intj is so great? It's just how I am. It's not something I want'. 

Furthermore, they seem to confirm to themselves that they are truly inxj because they don't want to be it, necessarily. 


Well, how does that work? They are consistently  amongst the most ubiquitous, positively described profiles and also the ones most gatekept.  Clearly there's like some odd aspirational thing going on here. You can only gatekeep something you and others want to be apart of, in this case a particular personality type. 



What do you think?I've been in relationship with intp for a few years.  One big thing I've noticed,  both on how we are as individuals, and is that intp  are  bad at maintenance of a relationship in terms of affection and attention. Esfp are comfortable in relationships that are not defined in traditional ways, very loose, and are not demanding.   These two things fit together in a fun wayYeah,  that is gonna be an issue. 


He once said that his default was being alone and that any emotional connection/relationship was a bonus and not a goal.  And he sorta lashed out that people would wonder what's wrong him with for being like that -- in his perspective there is nothing wrong,  the opposite sort of person is wrong.  Is that is something you can relate to? 

 People do not like hearing something like that said to them by someone they are invested in. 

 I'm not saying you're wrong for thinking that, but that to recognize where that idea comes from and how it relates to the  'guilt' you experience and the obvious disparity and how you two express affection. 
 At your core do you really feel guilty?or are you annoyed at the societal expectations?

Or do you feel guilty because you like them and are finding it difficult to provide the warmth that you actually want to give?  

But I think those are questions that come up later in a relationship.  And of feeler types,  esfp  are the least likely to want to  change you, or confront you with it early on in an relationship. It's supposed to one of the most accepting and unconditionally affectionate types. That is good for an intp I think cause  while you  see and like how esfp is nice to everyone, and warm up to them through that, they'll get to experience your more private and individualized affection in themStopped reading at lobsterHow is Jim Gordon esfpStratosphere of intuitiveness is such an r/mbti thing to sayIt's dead because esfp don't circlejerk and gatekeep each other like the other types do in their reddits all day (especially infjs).Why did you just call me an asshole for making a joke? No one seemed insulted. What type are you?Ive noticed that tooI remember you ghoul from a different community than the one you're probably talking about, but if you keep getting that energy wherever you go--even though mbti discords are super toxic - - I think it says something. I do recall them harassing you, but it was more back and forth between you and a particular member. Hank is estj not istjHow is he introvertedSometimesDon't feel insecure about sincerely enjoying something you value and thinks adds something to your life.Why do you think that?Try not to be so verbose and preachy.Esfp would be better at reading people than enfp. Se-fi can appear like fe. It's more engaged than ne.Now kissWhat sfj behavior did you revert to?I think it follows a pattern because the age of the group of people who make posts (here and on forums in the past)are generally teenagers and people in their 20s.  So there is a focus on a negative, oppressive dynamic with one's parents.  This dynamic, of being controlled and not being understood, seems to be interpreted as sensors controlling intuitive. 

These parents are generally assumed to be  sjs.

Mom xsfj and dad xstj

This also reinforces that you *must* be an intuitive cause of how much you clash with parents. 



Additionally, in life we define what we are not through just what value but what we deem incompatible. 

This seems  to apply to how people act in personality typing settings. 
For example you'll see someone who thinks they are intj making posts inquiring about enfp. Because that is most compatible type for them.  And they'll be more insulting about esfp, one because they are sensor and on some level they are anxious: if i like them maybe I'm not actually an xnxx

So by being so bothered, irreconcilably bothered by xsxx particularly xsxj  types someone is reinforcing to themselves that they are an xnxx type. After all sensors would get along better with others, so you're not a sensorYou're a very interesting posterWhat's funny about that? Just was saying that what you've been writing in the thread is interesting and informativeHow is cap infjI want to give you 1k to give to your landlordWhich one?What does that mean?How long have you been a Taoist?Why is it a hard question?How old are you?I don't understand?Are you Wiccan?All of the intuitive profiles have a higher word count and more positive descriptions than the equivalent sensor type. Istj Vs intj is one of the more obvious ones, so I'm not surprised to see someone say they resonated more with the intj one.Such as?Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I'm interested in hearing all that resonated with you.I see. It seems your main thing is that you see yourself as non traditional very conscious and skeptical person. I wouldn't really say that's where the distinction lies between these two.  But ultimately you're the final judge of what you're type is.There can be no 'misinformation' if there are no definitive facts. 
It is a pseudoscience and  people mistyping comes from a lack of concrete data and the inability to form on consensus a  which materials/frameworks to even prioritize.  Whether that be jung or something else

It's also, as you can in this thread, how people overstate qualities to be very bad. Like toxic, virulent. For instance gossip seems to be common thing people associate with and dislike in esfj. They are treating it as an objectively bad quality. 


But these same people don't understand that other people similarly can draw a line at flakiness, conceitedness, secretivensss,  vulgarity or whatever (qualities associated wish various intuitives) and totally trash  into someone because  of that.  You see people complaining about esxj being judgmental but people don't recognize that it's same process they are employing.  They just feel justified, just as the esxj. 

It is just a matter of perspective.Seems like they all have the same  thousand yard stareFreudI think that's the lead character of 'monster'  Kenzo TenmaI'm enjoying theseWhereThis doesn't make a lot of sense
So the two people I hang out with most right now are an INFP and an ISTP haha

I adore the INFP but I feel like I'm constantly having to motivate her to get out of the house and get her work done and sometimes it isn't worth it because she resists so much :/ I don't feel like my ISTP friend supervises me, that sounds more like my ESTJ friend ;)Try being an ESFP with anxiety :p What a wonderful thought :p

Now I really want an ISTP's perspective...ESFP who got ENFJ!

Hard to answer because I can be into any type. Last guy I was into was an INFP, next was an ESTJ  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Interesting! I don't know any INTJs but now I'm a bit curiousExTJ: was right all along, as usual

ExTJ: *sips Te*Don't let your type hold you back, man. You're not a slave to itYeah, explore by all means :)

But are you sure you're INFP? I'm getting more of a T vibe from youHappy early birthday haha

But I agree, it's super good to develop your inferior functions. Just become as well-rounded as possible. Just don't try to deny what you are, you know? Like I don't think I'd ever agree that one function is inherently better than another. It just depends what you're using it for. So I just generally try to put myself in places where I can thrive being ESFP and not having to fake other types or something. So far, it's working mildly okay hahaRight back at you ;)You sound like you're probably INTP. I don't think intelligence is dependent on your type, but maybe I'm just bitter because people say all ESFPs are morons. My INTP sister is really artsy as well. I think you'll always have things you relate to in your type and things you don't. And you write pretty precisely and with a lot of forethought and I think that's often an INTP thingI wish there were more of us too! I relate much better to ESFPs in real life than online though. But probably because every online space has its own culture and rules etc etcI want to know the answer to this too! We women ESFPs are much easier to spot. I knew only one guy I'm 100% sure was an ESFP too. I was so drawn to him because he and I talked on the same frequency. He was very life of the party but down to earth and we both loved certain nerdy things in the same sort of superficial way. Actually, we are probably a lot alike but he was more extreme than me. I never met anyone who talked too much until I met him haha Unfortunately he was the flightiest person imaginable and I only ever run into him at parties. I don't know if he's typical of ESFP guys thoughYeah, what's with this bias? ESTJs can be really fun. They're social and  like to make stuff happenJust for fun and my own curiosity :)Yeah, definitely. There's always more to a person than just their MBTI type. I just made this because when I asked people to answer this in real life, it seemed like sometimes their answers would match others of the same type. I wanted to see if this would be supported on a larger scale. 

I think it's fun to look at how people see themselves too. If you ask someone what they're good at then they might give you a totally different answer than those who know them well. So can these things really be objective? Does it matter? I don't think so, so all we have is opinions. That's why I just want people to interpret the questions however they want and answer in their own opinionExactly! So many people who see themselves above average. But that's great. We should have good self-esteem. My theory is that our society (and Reddit's culture even more so) greatly value intelligence so not many people are going to see themselves as not measuring up.I'm not an expert at dealing with quantitative data, but I'll give it a shot. You guys should get to see the results. Right now I have 164 responses but I might wait till there are a few more and I have a bit more timeIs 6 low? It's by definition above averageHaha close, 8 is the most common rating, so maybe they only see themselves as the second smartest person they know. Ss are much more critical of their intelligence, but for everyone so far there's 6 10s for intelligence but no 2s at all. That probably tells you something. The attractiveness ratings are more evenly distributed.

I'll try to put together the results of the data later this week, if you guys are interested. It's a good distraction from my thesis...

Also I'm thinking now that I should have asked for age as well, because now I don't think I'm as smart as I thought I was five years ago, but I do think I'm better looking. Could have been interestingBrainwashed? Really?

I think a lot of it is that beauty is both culturally defined and subjective. I think all of us are influenced by the way our society defines beauty, especially when we were growing up and being socialized. But Megan Fox is definitely above average. I can't imagine what a 9 would look like if she were considered a 5Ah I see. Just out of curiosity, is that how you'd define intelligence: being able to comprehend everything and not suffering from intellectual defeatism?That'd be really helpful :) What do you consider a large enough sample? It definitely does differ a lot. I'm American but live in Scandinavia and people here are much better looking than where I'm from. Part of it is also that you get used to certain looks. I'm not that into blonde guys anymore because there's just so many of them.

I like your intelligence definition though. But actually intelligence isn't something I'd put on a 1-10 scale which is part of why I find it fun to try to get others to do it. I don't really think you can put looks on the scale eitherHaha sounds like turning ISTP was the right move for you then. I would have no problem with ESTJs being the other half of my "golden pair". I super admire them 

But it's a super dumb phrase though that's probably only used because INFJs are "special" and INTPs are everywhere on the internet...What was catastrophic with the FP girls? And I want to say that people are more than their type, but somehow I always feel the same about INTP guys - they're nice to talk to (and for some reason they love me????) but real attraction is never there on my sideHell no. I'm sure INTJs are cool people, but it just sounds so boring. And I could live without the rest, but I'd never want to give up extroversion. If I were you, I'd just read the descriptions on lots of sites and see what fits you. They're often biased too thoughEasy-going and approachable mostly, but it's pretty dependent on my moodsThis is just my impression, but the way you write feels wayyy more T than ENFP. And we always have things that don't match up, like my type is supposed to be really flighty and disloyal and I'm only kind of flighty and disloyal hahaInteresting! I had the opposite experience. When I skipped questions I only got like 38% ESFP, and when I didn't skip I got 74%.I'm ESFP and I don't think I necessarily "fit in" with American society either. So I moved out of the country and now I live somewhere else I don't fit in haha 

I think what's happening to you is a lack of confidence in yourself. Life's easier if you naturally have the traits that your culture values, but even if you have some of them, you probably won't have all of them. So you can't live in a way that this is how you measure your worth. I honestly think that in time, if you surround yourself with people who value you and appreciate you, you'll come to terms with it and won't feel bad about not being a type that's more bubblyYeah, i can see why it seems strange for an ESFP. If you're curious, I just had a very conservative upbringing and social anxiety for a lot of my life. I've dealt with both now and my social life is pretty easy. It's actually really easy. Sometimes I worry that I'm unconsciously manipulating people hahaI started saying "bro" and "yo" ironically and now I can't stop....Society might fall apart and I can't really see much getting done, but it would be so much fun :DI would guess Js, and SJs in particular. But then you'd have those who would judge the morality of what you're eating, and those might be Fi usersExactly. And this is not to mention that he seems to have some kind of developmental disorder that makes understanding social situations difficult, which could probably make typing much more difficult tooOops, you're definitely right about that. I'm mixing up my functionsReally? I feel like ENTPs are everywhere. But I've also been watching a lot of Bojack Horseman lately.

I feel like ESFPs are rarely anything but stereotypical dumb comic relief and never ever get leading roles, so that would be my answer. But maybe it's just easiest to see biases against our own typeYeah, this feels right. I definitely think of the consequences of the things I do, but it's a matter of pros and cons. Doing impulsive things makes my life way better than the consequences make my life worse, you know? And obviously we have limits (and as you said we know how to charm :D)It is just people's experiences! I get frustrated with this "what is truth" thing in other contexts too, not just mbti. But I think what it is is that we're using mbti to understand ourselves and other people, so it can really just be a tool. It doesn't have to be true. Like, I might go to the INTP sub because I'm having trouble understanding a particular INTP I know, but I know I'm not really going to get answers about this specific person. But it's valuable to me to hear other opinions and try to understand this INTP in order to fit the person I know into some kind of framework or put them somewhere it makes sense to me. That's all I need mbti for, even if the information I get isn't accurate to my situation at all. I can completely disregard it, but it helps me focus my thoughts or somethingI don't get this N/S distinction. I have an equal number of N and S friends, and I'm even dating an N now. There isn't really any consistency in who I get along with, except maybe that I always seem to find INFPsMother INFJ
Father ENTP
Brother ESTP
Sister ENFP
Sister INTP
Me ESFP

Have there been any studies done on genetic links? I haven't seen much of a correlationI get a really strong sentimental feeling, but then that goes away and I feel super grateful for having had other experiences. I like change, but I also like remembering. (Assuming your question was for Se users......)Get yourself a new hobby, bro. Find something else to obsess over It's probably because of the Intuitive bias. If you just read the descriptions of N vs S, then I think almost everyone would type as an NYeah I'm annoyed by all the stereotypes too. Would love to see a smart and sympathetic ESFP protagonist somedayWhy do you want to meet one?Don't you think that maybe you not being able to get along with or see value in half the population means that you're more likely the one with the problem here? Well, he is a poopy head ;)I can't speak for other sensors, but I like knowing about society and tradition because I like being able to frame my experiences with something. It's really important to me to have a context for everything in order for me to understand it, otherwise it's just stuff floating around in a void. It's not really about always doing the thing that society says is correct - far from it. It's about knowing what that is so I can choose how I behave. Like how an artist has to know the rules of painting before they can break them. But I honestly don't think it's much of an ESFP thing to love traditions and rules. It kind of feels like you've generalized a lot here.

And I like theoretical discussions. I studied useless things in college because they were interesting to me at the time, and I'm pretty shortsighted haha. And I talk about theoretical things with my other sensor friends too. It's just easier for us to ground it in something practical because that's how our minds work. I really feel like you need to meet more sensors. We aren't airheaded rule-followers.Yeah that's difficult with your sister. Is she very young? Or she might just care about things in a different way than you. I know that I like to ground my theoretical discussions in things that are relevant to me or that I have some experience with (that might be my Fi...?). Maybe that's how it'd work with her?

Like in my case, I'm really interested in culture and religion, and a lot of that probably has to do with me being raised religious and living in a lot of different places. And I totally agree with what you say about using those kinds of conversations to bond with people. My ISTJ bf even said he was really attracted to me at first because we can have these intellectual conversations with each other that he doesn't have with most people. But I think the key thing is how we talk about them. He and I are very in sync in our thinking and the way we express ourselves. I can't really explain how that's different from the way I talk to Ns though. I've been trying to figure it out actually, but it's just like we express things differently because we process them differently? I can think about it some more and get back to you if you want haha

But that said, I do have some S friends who I never talk to about theoretical things, usually introverts. Maybe they just keep it to themselves; I'm not sure2 or 3. Almost everyone is interesting in some way

And I feel like a lot of the evil in the world comes from the fact that people have needs that don't get met. I have a lot of sympathy with people who are suffering and doing what they can to deal with that. On the other hand, there's comes a point where we have to be responsible for our actions and can't blame circumstances anymore. So yeah, 2 or 3The Tumblr mbti community is great. The best posts are stuff like "the MBTI types as bread" Isn't everyone in the intj sub just mistyped istjs anyway? Hilarious stuffThe Room is hilarious and I'm ESFP. I like watching things I can make fun of. I think taste in films is very subjectiveOf course S types can do this. If someone can't imagine things from another perspective then they probably don't have a brain at all
ESFP:

I am a good driver.

I mildly enjoy driving.

I do not daydream while driving, and am VERY aware of the drivers around me. In fact, I hate being in the front seat of the car, it sketches me out. 

I only get road rage when someone is riding my ass while i'm in the right lane, or when people are just bad drivers in general. 

I've been pulled over four times (age 24) and have talked my way out of every single one. *knocks on wood*As an ESFP reading this, it all makes sense. I can totally relate. pretty accurate for esfp probably us ESFP's. We sometimes have a tough time letting stuff goENTJhttp://imgur.com/vIXCMvYI'm an ESFP and I love flirting with ISFJ and ENFP girls. Also ISTP girls intrigue mehahah woopsawesome description dude. totally describes how I am BardI'd also be playing with the dog, but I'd make sure the girl I think is cute is watching meI lived in a house with an INTJ, INFP, ISTJ, ESTJ, ESTP, ESTJ, INTP, and INFJ. While many of you introverted types think you'd want to cut yourself off from the rest of the party, this is what I commonly observed of each type at a large college party:

Keep in mind this is how they acted after several drinks.

The INTJ would normally find a girl to play beer pong with for a few games and then would come up with some reason for them to go off somewhere privately. 

The INTP would bounce around talking to people and would normally end up getting into a deep conversation with a small group of people about science or philosophy or something like that.

The INFP kinda floated around having deep conversations about philosophy with anyone that seemed interesting. 

The INFJ usually retired early and wouldn't tend to stick around throughout the night. 

The ISTJ was usually competitive at any drinking game he was playing and would only play drinking games. He also kept himself super involved with knowing who was coming in and out and making sure doors were closed and people weren't being loud outside.Intuitive Thinking. Us ESFPs are way too in the moment I have a few close ESTP friends who were lax players in HS and college. Whether it was a party in high school, or the bars in college, it definitely was a very intense experience with you all. 

Most of the time at the bars, the plan with the ESTP was to leave the bar together when wanting to go the next one. As Se doms, we would explore the bar to meet girls and have conversations. However with the ESTP, if I couldn't find him after a while spent at the bar, I would either call him or text him with no response until the next morning... he had met a girl and took her to either his place or her place ESFP:

I have no favorite... I love them all, but the ISTP is tough to get along with. Close friends with an INFP, INFJ, INTJ, INTP, ESTJ, and ENTJhaha. I don't even want to begin talking about how everything becomes so personal to me. ESFP's can all be identified as HSPESFP: ADHDAs an ESFP: I think a dead giveaway for me would be how vocal I can be about my surroundings or experiences with people, it explains my Se Fi combo. For people that know a lot about the MBTI, I think they would be able to type me out immediately. 

As for other types, I can't think of a dead giveaway for an EXACT type besides mapping out someone being an E/I or a T/F. The other parts are bit more tricky until you truly spend time with a person. 

You could label a co-worker an ISTJ because of his work ethic and ability to stay tenacious throughout the day, but he very well may be an ENFP who prioritizes differently than othersMe: ESFP

Dad: ENTJ

Mom: ESTJ

Sister: ENTJ

Brother: INTJbro you and your girlfriend have a super awesome mbti combohahahah I love thisI liked learning about ISTP's. I don't give a fuck about INTJ's cause their pretentious attitude on reddit already explains enough about them. I lie sometimes due to my Te Sometimes I feel the same way. I'd love a day in the life of an ESTP or ENTJI'm pretty ambiverted as well. I used to consider myself a party animal. Most stereotypes are pretty accurate for me tho haAny ISFJ girl does it for meI agree with you on the Se descriptionI am great with keeping any debt paid or having my credit cards paid off... however, I tend to spend money frequently when it could be savedI'm not at all 100% certain. Sometimes I see myself as an ISFP or ENFP. But in the end, all signs of the way I act point to ESFPI would talk to JFK. Everything about him seems so interesting especially since he was a bit of a player. I probably would be talking to him at a bar over a few beers about how he became so successful. Hey! I'm an ESFP and one of my closest friends is an INFP. I definitely can relate to how you feel about us. When I go out to the bars with my ENFP friend, him and I have different strengths with different groups of people we meet. I definitely will be the 'crowd' performer/conversation starter with most of the people we meet. However, my ENFP friend becomes the most outgoing when the conversation turns to something he knows a lot about and loves talking about. It definitely is true that we love tons of attention in any type of relationship, but I've learned that a lot of us 'crave' it at different levels. As far as chasing goes, I work in sales and am constantly chasing clients and potential prospects; I would rather be chased by a romantic partner. It's kind of tough tho because we lose interest so quicklyI sometimes judge whether there is a solid connection too early which might make me lose interest. I also really value communication and if it isn't there that also makes me lose interestSomeone explain the ESFP mannerism plshaha the ESFP 'surprising characteristic' is pretty true for meI would gladly enjoy thisESFP-&gt; Funor Jovial I was really good at waiting till the last minute for almost everything in college. One time tho, I had a super challenging finance test and the class was already known as a weed out class in the business school. The day before the test I did some day drinking and banked on the fact that I could just take adderall that night and cram. That night when I took adderall I began to study and realized that there was so much to learn that I was completely fucked. I showed up to the test the next morning and could not complete anything. I ended up failing the class and had to retake it  the next semester. 

Fucking repressed Ni.Almost every weekend. As the student body pres I thought it was necessary to be at all parties. Some girl snitched on me to the school tho for consuming alcohol underage and I got into some bullshit trouble http://imgur.com/a/itvf9

http://imgur.com/a/3citlb-e-a-utifulhahah nice onevery attractive INFP if I do say so myselfI'm thinking he is an INTJ and she is an ESFP. Any thoughts?Title says it all. I am an ESFP. My roommate told me two weeks ago that his dad had stage four pancreatic cancer. Yesterday, he opened up to our group of friends about it after someone posted something about Alex from Jeopardy. When he talked to me about it he didn't really have much to say at all. I can tell that something seems off with him but I'm not sure how to support him with something like this.. him being almost the exact opposite of me and all. Any tips would be appreciated! 
yepThanks guy! The first bit I came up with, the second is a notion I picked up in the spooky early chapters of Psychological Types that no one ever reads.

I don't have any more of these but I guess I could try one for a Beta quadra type, to cover all the functions. Because it's pretty technical, making one for each type would be a lot of copy/pasting.

I did it for the ISTJ cause, like I said, they + Si are super misunderstood, and /u/ExplicitInformant wanted me to do ISTJ stuff. I also used the "her" pronoun to further separate the type from people's preconceived notions, even though my friend-prototype is a dude. I thought that was pretty clever c:I'm working through chapters II and V of PT currently, and I have actually noticed that in some places Jung connects abstraction to introversion and concretion to extroversion, and in other places high-order functions are abstract and low-order ones are concrete. Maybe it's a translations thing?

More to the point, though, I mean that the process of modifying the perception is passive, not Si as a whole. I'm trying to condense this point:

&gt; Above all, his development estranges him from the reality of the object, handing him over to his subjective perceptions, which orientate his consciousness in accordance with an archaic reality, although his deficiency in comparative judgment keeps him wholly unaware of this fact.

...but I guess I'm coming at it from a more "your dominant is the water you swim in" angle.Could be. I also haven't checked my revised print copy for the same discrepancies, maybe Jung fixed them. I don't have it with me so I'll make a note to self to check later.On the sidebar, "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:" -&gt; "edit"

People work in mysterious ways. Can you link the post?

EDIT: Nvm I see itc'est effrayant! tiens-moi, rubis!Now you mention it, I definitely see where you're coming from. I left it relatively open by using the qualifiers "often" and "among other things", but I guess I could've found some more examples, but that's the first one that came to mind (given the ISTJs that I know personally).

I think that I felt most comfortable writing a terribly technical description (I would not feel good about any general profile I come up with), and I ended up with a minimum of traits, good or bad. I'm just realizing, though, that Si dominance might encompass more than what I have here, since after all it wouldn't be very complex in myself o.O Possibly it's the same for Jung, who is the numero uno noumenon for my bullcrap. It's a bit ironic, though, that I'm actually super fascinated by Si (I think I've written more about it than any other function). What I think it is, and what I did *soooorta* emphasize and glorify here, is the artistic/aesthetic aspect (while also downplaying the "refers to the past" angle, which I actually thought was a great bummer previously). Something I've thought, and a recent update on Nardi's work agrees with me, is that ISJs are much more creative than they're given credit for, and that even they may realize. Welp.

About Si being beyond the senses, that would be a pretty big reevaluation of my understanding (apart from my current understanding that it involves the whole of the unconscious)... It's my personal opinion that the essence of Si, and Ni for that matter, gets awfully muddled and mixed up with, among other things, the thinking function and inferior Ne/Se. Intuition, for example, I think is nothing more that hunches, or attempts to read into something. None of that nonsense about prophecies, or instinctively seeing patterns.

In my defense, woe is the ENTP who reads an ENTP description if I ever write one! I would wreck their shit without mercy or pity D:&lt;

In conclusion I'm not the guy for an impressive description, but I assure you that's for any type, not just ISTJs. If I tried, though, you'd be up there.. relatively speaking. I'll think about things to change/add!

EDIT: I edited. One bit has a footnote and one is hidden.&gt; There is a kind of artistic and personal flair to Si that I appreciate more now that I look for it. Like not everyone is incredibly obsessed with different forms of lighting? Seriously?

I think the aesthetic quality of Si might be especially noticeable if you take a gander over to Eastern culture. I mentioned Studio Ghibli; the connection occurred to me when I noticed that the weird-ass doodles of my ISTJ friend that I take so much delight it are very, very similar in character to *Spirited Away*, which I saw part of once and it weirded me the fuck out. I swear no one can just come up with that shit, there must've been a load of ISJs on the team who just went fucking ham.

Furthermore there's the whole of anime, which is way more representational than the more true-to-life/extroverted cartoons we have here in the West. Overall, I think this, among other things (tbh I know jack shit about Asia ^^I'm ^^not ^^a ^^fucking ^^weaboo ), points to a more Si-heavy, or simply introverted, society. I seem to remember stats saying places like Singapore and Japan were around 30% ISJ... I can't seem to find them, though.

&gt; But this is part of where I want to describe sensing as not senses but as what is: real; present; existing; actual

IMO I think the latter follows causally from the sense-perception angle.

&gt; intuition as what is: unreal or not yet real; absent; possible; potential.

Mini-rant, I know an ENTP who does -all- the sports, because Ne is concerned mainly with novelty rather than potential, for [insert reasons here]. It's little things, but I love to really nail shit down, distill it, and be able to explain the process step-by-step. Where I can substitute "has to do with" with "does this this and this", I will.

&gt; For instance, when I get a sense for how a report is written and how people use the language, there is some part of me that is sensing word structure and subtle rules of grammar that I couldn't begin to tell you in words or even notice myself noticing. When I learned to spell at a decently young age, part of that was from a very basic sense of phonetics, and how sounds were connecting together with typical patterns of letters, even though the patterns weren't always consistent. You can get a sense for whether something is formal or informal when you read it, and some of that is from an internal model of what formal and informal speech looks and sounds like. How much of those can fit into senses and/or is there anywhere else they'd fit into the MBTI?

This is really interesting, but I'm not sure how to implement it. The phonetic part might apply directly to our introverted sensing, but how much might be intuition, or thinking? and How much might not be related to type :?

&gt; And certainly some of it is my own sensitivities, because I can't think of how you describe Ne, and its imaginative, possibility-envisioning, divergent nature without making it sound complimentary, which could just be my own hang-ups about my inferior.

I tried! I said, "[the hunches] may be varied in their plausibility", which basically means they're 70% stupid.Wow, in my current state of exhaustion, I gotta say that was an adventure and a half.

&gt; I think I know what you're getting at though. Just like any introverted function, there is a principled nature to Si, that allows it to impact others at a fundamental level.

Yasss! And beyond the aspect of coincidence, to my chagrin I totes left out anything to do with the collective unconscious, as it takes a while to explain on its own.

I would say, though, that the principled/abstract nature is a huge thing I've been exploring, although the impact on others seems unintentional. However, based on what I've learned about the archetypes of the collective unconscious, I can see it as a thing.

&gt; Perhaps even the perception of emotion (as distinct from the judgement given by feeling)?

Yes! Jung is actually very clear about this, sensation is an important component of emotion (or "affect" as he calls it).

&gt; For Si to be able to launch Ne into different directions, Si has to provide a foundation of what is real. If that is not necessary for Ne, then it is not balanced that Ne both draws on sensed reality and also abstracts principles and, furthermore, innovates on those abstracted principles. That's a lot more than what Si gets described as doing. And yet Ni is not described as similarly handicapped for being introverted, so there isn't symmetry.

Intuition *does* draw from sensation insofar as it needs to be made aware of a thing, and it is definitely sensation that does that job. Every function is active to a minimum extent at a given time, Jung terms them "basic psychological functions". However, I think you might actually have the inferior-N-inferiority thing goin' on ;) As I understand it, Ne doesn't deal in abstract principles so much as simple what-ifs, and always the focus is on objects. I call them simple because the emphasis is on multiplicity rather than thoroughness, even for Ne doms. And Ne doesn't innovate, it perceives; it's only innovation if they go on to actualize an idea, which because of the nature of Ne, they rarely do.

The theoretical thing is also pushed too much IMO. ENFPs would rather explore the world, and life, and their feelings. Even an ENTP I know is more focused on sports and music, although she likes to muck around in human philosophy. Jung's description of the Ne type reads as an amoral novelty-whore for whom nothing is sacred. It's an exaggeration, but..

All in all, I think sensation is truly, literally sensation, and intuition is hunches that don't really bleed over to the world of ideas and concepts except superficially, which are reserved for the judging functions.

And about finding Si fascinating, it seems clear to me that it doesn't lack depth. Imagine how we feel about the depths of the ocean or the vastness of space; totally huge and unknown. But our brains and minds are soooooo complex, it's as though we're each holding one such universe within us, in our unconscious, and Si is a function that gives us a glimpse into that deep dark abyss. When my ISTJbro doodles his precious heart out I'm like "o shit waddup it's the product of his ENTIRE PSYCHIC EXPERIENCE rather than a reproduction of this reality bs". ISN'T THAT COOL???Aw sweet the shoutout I've always been waiting for. I knew my rise to fame would come eventually. Stay classy /r/mtbi!NJENFP or ENTP for sure. The unfiltered, un spell-checked ;) stream of consciousness screams P-dom and Ne-dom.

What you said about fairness and homosexuality can speak more about Ti morals than Fi morals, and the fact that you're willing to share your values might say Fe over Fi. The fact that you personally see some intellectual fields as useless and some as amazing is also more Ti, I think.

I have very specific ideas about Fe/Fi and I don't want others to mislead you (no offense), so this is how I'd differentiate them:

Fe uses your feelings as a means of relating to the outside world, so like openly sharing and expressing sentiments, and your feelings are kinda always in response to a situation.

Fi shies away from the outside world and would rather keep feelings private and personal, and your feelings are more like deeply held values that you'll think about when no one's around.

As an ENTP with Fe you'd have more repressed feeling in general, so keep that in mind.I haven't really read about how "the grip" is defined by modern typologists but as I understand the theory, is would be a response to an initial rejection of the inferior. Basically when one favours their top functions too heavily, temporarily over-suppressing the bottom ones, and then they come back with a vengeance and fuck over consciousness.

It follows, then, that the grip should be episodic rather than prolonged, although again I'm not sure it that's canon. It's like the kids who kept getting detentions egging their principal's house, only lasts a night.

So I guess from my understanding, the best way to deal with the grip would be to pre-emptively take your foot off of your inferior's head. &gt; I have a few sport interests, save horse riding. I like that becuase I get to feel "as one" with the horse. There is no future, there is no past, there is just that moment, the horse and yourself in the arena, and win or lose, you know you did everything in the bounds of reason to win.

That's super interesting, and I would tentatively say that it's the most literal example of "feeling-into" that I've seen, which is a Jungian idea I've never completely understood. It's a trait of Fe.

"There is no future, there is no past" has to do with extroversion, which focuses on the present moment, since we have memory and timelines but the world inherently does not. Whether it's Se or Ne I'm not totally sure, but I would venture Ne.

&gt; I just think theories should at least have some connection to me to be of use.

Sounds Ti.

&gt; All in all, my favorite sports include precision and strategy and a "timeless" feeling.

What do you mean exactly by "timeless"?Well the whole point is to restore balance to the force. It functions as an aggressive reset when there's too much yang and not enough yin.

I think it can depend on a person's situation, for example when we're stressed we tend to stick to our top functions as those are our best tools, but that can trigger a "grip" episode. In terms of nature and nurture there's probably a million and one factors that might play into the frequency of grips, but I assume a big or over-arching one is stress.Okay, so that's extroversion again. I asked because "timeless" can mean the present moment, or it can mean all of eternity to put it in a fancy way.

On second thought then, I would say your perceiving functions are more likely Se/Ni. I think I agree with some of the others on ISTP.Are they being sourpusses? :/

Actually tho, what problems have you had with the ISTP typing?Ok. After examining your post a bit more I think I'll definitely go for ENTP&gt;ENFP.Have you considered ESTJ? It might seems unexpected but although you seem to scream Te dom to me, stuff like this:

&gt; Although I appear goofy, friendly, eccentric, and energetic to my friends (I was voted class clown multiple times)

&gt; My friends almost always type me as an ENFP

&gt; When I'm with adults and strangers, I repress my zaniness, humor, and confidence

...I've found to be pretty typical of ESTJs, as they can easily have a pronounced playful NFP side. ESTJ as a type is so misunderstood that as soon as people see a trace of Ne, which there often is, the "middle manager/authoritarian" stereotype causes ESTJ to be immediately ruled out.

That, and in general I get more Ne vibes than Ni, and there's hardly any trace of Se from what I can gather.

EDIT: Paging /u/FuccFas, /u/petrakayI was a theatre kid through and through, and I definitely think it's related to my type. It was such a great outlet to just let Ne and Fe run wild for several years, I think it really helped me grow as a person.

When I graduated HS and I had no time to pursue theatre anymore, I did actually get a bit depressed because I felt like I'd lost a big part of my identity. I just did the smart thing and started being myself sans gimmicks and it's been working out pretty well for me, I suppose.&gt; The reason why I agree so much with having Se-Ni is that I have strong internal visions of how things could be in the future

This one's finicky, since Si has a similar relationship with time to Ni. The difference, I think, would simply be that Si has a greater sense of how concrete situations will end up and Ni observes some larger course of events. Si's "intuition" is more recognizably based on past experience ("history repeats itself") since it has a greater attachment to tangible reality, but really they both use the same data in the unconscious to synthesize their perceptions.

&gt; I try to streamline the physical process of getting it done so that I can fulfill that vision as quickly as possible.

That could be TeSe or Te with Si as a supporting process. Depends on the minutiae.

The rest of your points definitely muddy the waters, I think... I could make rationalizations either which way, but I think you'd be best suited talking to some ETJs. They'll get here eventually.Question 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, looooots of Fi. Lots.

Question 3, 4, 8, Ne.

Question 2, 9, 10, Si.

And there's enough baby Te mixed in there. INFP!

Thanks for offering so much information! Makes it much easier :)&gt; I despise people that [...]

That's a feeling evaluation.That's not the same thing. To despise something is definitely emotionally charged.

I don't actually have a point, I'm just enjoying the irony of your justification for being a thinker starting with a feeling judgement. It doesn't even say anything about your type anyway.

However, I don't believe that you can spend two years studying this and turn away from function theory on the grounds that you relate to too many :p I mean, for one thing everyone has all four functions, it's the order and preference that matters... And if you actually put in the effort to understand them, you'll see that half of them are diametrically opposite to the others! Read Jung or something instead of crappy descriptions."I feel like that's a bad idea" doesn't mean you dislike the idea, it means you think it's faulty (unless you mean it's a morally bad idea, which you don't mean that). "Despise" is is a term of extreme dislike. Feeling evaluations are like/dislike.

Anyways I'm not being serious, I just thought it was funny.I might be sold on ISTP Jung.Thanks for the recommendation! I had the good fortune of picking up a similar book, "A Primer to Jungian Psychology" at a used bookstore, and like you said it is reeaaaly helpful to get a broader view of his psychology. If you're interested I tried summarizing the relevant parts... [somewhere around here...](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4in33j/a_summary_of_jungs_schema_of_personality/)Really? I think in terms of emotionality they are very similar. Fassbender is a bit freer with his hands (albeit in an awkward manner) but he's a younger man. They both have that [brief subtle lilt in the voice + intentful eye contact] pattern that speaks to baby Fe. Jung's average tone of voice is perhaps quicker and *sliiightly* more emotive, but he is 1) being asked to explain his theory rather than come up with stuff on the spot and 2) much older, therefore probably is more in touch with his Fe.

They appear to both be scowling heavily to me, and Jung as well as Fassbender often looks down away from the camera/person (they're doing the exact same thing for a good stretch at around 2:10).If I had the means of making a play-by-play counter argument I would, but I am banished to my phone :(

Fassbender at least is definitely a rational type (he and his gesticulating are extraordinarily rigid!) and most likely an introvert. Idk bout you but I def see inferior Fe.

Lol I really wish I could make a full analysis right now... For now, try comparing these guys with the ISFJs or any other video of your choosing in which you know the persons type. They're so similar in comparison to people of other types! I also feel in touch with my Fe but it's nowhere near as strong or consistent as an FJ. Ya ain't done growing yet Frantically trying out new principles in order to understand and integrate the broken reality, until someone tells me it's just how it is and I need to stop.Sounds about right! INTP is deductive. He perceives a world full of possibilities (Ne) and has to rule them out with Ti until only plausible ones are left. "stupid, stupid, really stupid... This one works."

ISTP is tactical. He sees the environment for what it is (Se) and has to use Ti to navigate the smartest course through it. "This is what's up. I need to do this, then this, and then this." 

INTP Ti is destructive/reductive.  ISTP Ti is creative. Of course S as senses and N as the more or less colloquial intuition is accessible to everyone. Everyone has each function, only the focus is different! Jung calls them basic psychological functions. And furthermore they shouldn't necessarily need elaborate definitions, since they were derived with consideration to what is called the lexical hypothesis. The most important personality traits or concepts naturally become part of language, so they're already loaded words and everyone has at least a sense of what they mean right away. Read Jung's description of the introverted feeling type lol. It's anything but cuddly Thank you for giving me something to do! :)

&gt; You can attribute any trait to any function.

You're actually not wrong there. People can contrive any functional justification for behaviour. The thing is typology is not behavioural and therefore non-falsifiable (it could be one day, though!). However, to write it off for this reason would be totally limiting. There are plenty of invisible things we entertain, like the consciousness of other people and places we cannot presently see.

&gt; Fi: Feels strongly that something is right or wrong.

That's what feeling in general does. Fi is more individual values, Fe is more collective values.

&gt; What about Ne? "Sees many possibilities"... Ni "sees many possibilities, but comes to one conclusion"

Ni intuits the essential part of something. Just the one.

&gt; "Fi feels emotions inward!"

That doesn't even make sense, really. Intensively would be the appropriate word. But yeah, all feelings are subjective.

&gt; "Fe feels the emotions of others!"

That's just wrong, and also empathy. Where are you getting your info?

&gt; Apparently my dominant function is Ti and I do just that. How can one live by not acknowledging facts?

Te focuses on the facts and gives the greatest credit to them. Ti considers the facts but the internal logical framework wins over if there's a conflict.

&gt; "Si pays attention to detail"

&gt; So does Se. Apparently, Se picks up details, feeds it to Ni, and Ni comes to a conclusion. This sounds like basic human reasoning.

They're both sensing. Also the stuff about Se and Ni is wrong IMO, Se and Ni operate almost completely independently (Ni only uses Se to the extent that it needs to know that something is there, then it perceives the person's own unconscious reaction/interpretation of the "essence"). Ni doesn't come to conclusions because it's not a judging function, it just sees things.

If any of it sounds like basic reasoning it's because they're basic psychological functions, literally abstract concepts that divide up our conscious experience.

&gt; [everything about Si]

Si is sensation, where the focus is on the psychological reaction to the sensation. Details comes from it being sensing. Past-oriented comes from all the memories the sensation evokes. Bodily functions comes from the strong mind-body connection, because remember Si focuses on the psychological reaction to a stimulus.

&gt; Why can't you focus on the future and the past at the same time? Why are Ni and Si considered opposites?

They do... it's a misconception that one goes in the past and the other the future. Ni also uses past experiences to generate its "essence" perceptions but because they're related to the object indirectly rather than directly, people gloss over that. It's all in Jung.

&gt; I've read contradictory descriptions about each function. The role of these functions seem purely subjective and debatable

That's very true. There's a lot of cancer around. I would recommend reading Jung or Myers, cause that's like... The OG stuff, before the dozens of successors came in and fucked around. It at least gives you a good idea of where all the different opinions originate.

&gt; Anyone can assess their personality and mold themselves to fit virtually ANY type!

Never in a million years would I relate to an ESFP description.

&gt; [All the stuff about mistyping]

Those are very good examples and they tell us that analyses based on stereotypes and surface behaviour should be avoided. You list a bunch of different motivations for actions that would point to different types... that would be a good place to go. 

&gt; I can see the four letter type code as legitimate. People are generally more S than N, or vice versa. F vs. T, eh, not as defined, but still kind of there. I vs. E, more clear. But the cognitive functions? not really.

The four letter code was specifically designed to designate a stack of psychological functions. [Read Myers](https://www.cpp.com/pdfs/7270.pdf), fuck Kiersey.Do you have enough extroverted judging or whatHere are some observations I've made, plus research into [Socionics VI](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/list.php/category/60-Visual-Identification) and [Cognitive Type](http://cognitivetype.com/).

1. Rational/Irrational

Since mirror pairs (ex INTP and ENTP) share the same functions it can be really hard to distinguish based on the relative strength/use of those functions, or the introvert/extrovert dichotomy. What I find to be a really telling alternative is observing whether the person has a dominant judging or perceiving attitude/function.

The keyword for rational types is "calculation". Almost every movement they make has a flavour of premeditation. Their posture is rigid and their gestures are cool and controlled, with their hands and fingers usually maintaining the same stiff shape throughout.

Irrational types are loose and fluid in how they hold themselves. They may sway more, and their whole body is sort of oriented by their eyes; when they turn to look at something, their shoulders follow slightly. Their gestures are more organic and their fingers might move independently of one another.

[Rational on the left, irrational on the right.](https://youtu.be/8tf5FFAXbDI?t=1m17s)

2. Expressiveness

A misconception is that any "targeted" expressions point to Fe. The thing is, Fe vs. Fi expressiveness only applies when the person is actually tapping into their feelings and values.

When this is the case, Fi will be ice from the mouth up, completely motionless, and their hands will most likely remain at their sides. Their voice is flat and unmodulated. You get the impression that they're voicing their values only grudgingly; these things don't normally see the light of day. 
The exception is when Fi users are feeling strong positive emotions. They will emote uncontrollably, but as feelings/values are not emotions, it's not really a violation of the trend.

Fe will focus wholly on communicating the feeling, they're trying to get the other person to share in them or at least recognize them. Hand gestures erupt outwards from the breast and there's a lot of eyebrow work and widened eyes going on.

The other time you'll see Fi types be expressive, and this is where people trip up, is actually when they're Te'ing. Both Je functions are heavily into communication, because for them effort should be made to be on the same page as other people. TJs especially will make use of a lot of gestures and even facial expressions, but only when trying to communicate thoughts and ideas. Again, when values are involves, they freeze up.

EDIT: The rest of the time, when there are no feelings or ideas involved ie. when people are small-talking, it can be very hard to tell apart. Fe is always watching for how its words will land, and they might incorporate little bouts of facial expression just to connect to the other person. Te backed by Fi can always be polite and agreeable. It's all very low-key. Ask them about their values and you'll get a better tell.

I recommend looking into those links I put at the top, there's a loooooot more where this came from.I'm sure, why?Nah? He starts out with a swift clap, a curt sweeping gesture, and then he's stock still rigid until he goes to get the gun, which he does rigidly.. The guy on the right is constantly swaying and he's way more fluid an in-motion in general. His gestures are all over the place.Rational means a judging (rational) function first and irrational means a perceiving (irrational) function first.The components of MB type are abstractions of mental processes, which themselves are dependent on a huge amount of potential biochemical interactions (in terms of genetics, probably hundreds of ~~b~~millions of DNA base-pairs; thousands of genes, not 4). I don't think a reliable pattern of heritability will ever be found.&gt; a judging (rational) function firstFe means your feelings are heavily oriented by other people and society, among other external things. You prefer truth to catering because your thinking suppresses your feeling. Why not?This is a perfect analogy! ^ 5 man It's arbitrary socionics bullstuff.Yep. I'm still waiting for someone to give me a reason why Model A is structured the way it is (among other things) Are they changing or are they growing? I think the idea of a static personality is an introverted perspective and an ever-changing one is extroverted. They're both wrong, because we have elements of both. As an nfj their functions are completely alien to yours, which makes things difficult. However, we grow through adversity. Keep trying and learning about one another, and hope that they learn about you. 

How old are you and your sisters? It took me a while to get along with mine, although our types are arguably more compatible. 

Finally, look into eneagram, since I think it deals more in emotional rather than cognitive life and I think that is more important in relationships. On Se, my pet theory is that there are a lot of SP 8s in Russia, and those characteristics are unjustly taken as Se. As a stereotypical polite Canadian in a stereotypically polite Canadian society, who struggles to wrap his head around even the idea of an 8, I know very few SPs who play with power, but ALL of them have a good sense of aesthetics. So, Jung's Se it is.#fuckkierseyPreach it brother/sister!You are my hero The last part confuses me, since I don't recall introversion/extraversion ever being referred to as energy conserving or expending attitudes. It doesn't jive with Jung's analogies to thermodynamics, where he claims the psyche is a closed system. Instead, as I understand it, libido flows towards (I assume) a sort of non-literal subject and object.. As in, for extraversion, energy is delivered not to the actual object (how would that work?), but to the perception of the object, which still isn't the same as the psychological reaction to the stimulus (which is the domain of introversion). Am I making sense? I'm pretty sure you're a TJ I know that for one thing, the main antithesis of abstraction is not empathy but concretism (tied to extraversion) which mixes thoughts, feelings, and perceptions with other worldly things. Concrete means "grown together".

I think Jung's "empathy" may be one of many vestiges of his early formulation, where introversion and thinking were always tied together and extraversion and feeling were always tied together? He does make explicit reference to "subjective feelings", which would imply the feeling function. That one episode where you argued that ENTPs could be manipulative if they wanted to. *Technically* it's true but practically no, nunh-unh. Manipulation is much more Te. Also your writing in general does not remind me of ENTPs but TJs, sure. It's just like, my opinion man. You could be an ENTJ. He doesn't really live in the present, he's always thinking about immortality. He seems to repress sensation in favour of intuition. He's not a realist. I'll grudgingly give this one to the ENTPs. Then again, he's a dick so it fits, we can all go home. Jung's abstraction and concretism meant something very specific when he applied them to introversion and extroversion. Read up. Also, the quotes bits on E/I come from the chapter where Jung describes a purely theoretical person whose consciousness is only introverted or extroverted, in order to explain the concepts. In practice people are introverted or extroverted through specific functions, something he explicitly states in a 1931(?) paper that I can't quote because I'm on my phone.I know INTPs have one of the highest rates of substance abuse, not sure about ENTPs. Low-order sensing may be a greater culprit than high-order sensing.Nice post overall! I see some things I really love but also some stuff I disagree with.

In your function definitions, I would reallocate some keywords. For thinking, relationships between objects could be easily ascribed to some perceiving functions, I think an alternative may be 'relationships between concepts". Thinking is the function that uses learnt intellectual principles, definitions, concepts etc. Processes is also quite vague.

For intuition, concepts would fall squarely under thinking and as for models, it depends on the connotation. Consciously derived models would again be thinking, while organic or experiential unconscious ones would be introverted perception.

For sensing it may be a minor nitpick (bear with me, I'm a Ti dom), but I think of things like "how can I effect this object?" and vice versa as *resulting from* a preference for sensation. The function by itself merely perceives through the senses, just as intuition merely perceives through hunches. Whether they like theories or action is only loosely related. This is why ENTPs can be sporty and ISTPs can be philosophers (both personal examples).

I *adore* your part on introversion/extraversion, I understand what you mea
n and it's very in-depth and insightful. Something about the perceiving function-attitudes still doesn't sit well with me though.

I think the descriptions for paired functions are a tad redundant, since you don't describe them as intertwining or cooperation in any way and (important) I would tell you you were wrong if you did c:

Finally, I lend zero support to the "we all use all 8 functions" angle, for reasons I outline [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/49qsiv/a_short_analysis_of_four_function_and_eight/), but I've had this debate too many times to count :(

Nice work!People think ex. Ti and Te are mutually exclusive but they're dumb because the have a ton of overlap, which is why function tests don't really work.&gt; except Fi. I never see Fi in me

high five mate join the Ti club ^ 5

About your dog treats monologue, I wouldn't be so quick to listen to all the Ne criers. Some might describe it as the Ni "red thread". Especially without controls, it's very much up to interpretation.

(I might be a bit biased because I was one of the ones who typed you as ISTP.)

As you're having so muchachos trouble finding your type, I'm not sure what resources to offer you. Reading Jung is always good shit but especially with the old editions/translations, it can take a few long, arduous readings to really understand.

Here's something on S and N I'm making up on the spot. SeNi uses the senses to explore the outside world, and hunches to explore one's inner world... the outside world is viewed pretty directly which can lend the SP a kind of cynicism or devil-may-care vibe, although it can be compensated by a kind of longing for romanticism and meaning. Intuition is used almost meditatively. Hunches can have an especially weird character, in a solemn, sometimes mythological way instead of a zany one. ISTPs still often develop an odd/absurd sense of humour but it's markedly different from NP humour. Honestly it's weirder (but I'm an NP so there's that).

NeSi uses hunches to explore the outer world and the senses to explore the inner world. Everything is full of questions, everything is open to change and interpretation. If someone says something improbable (like they're bullshitting you), the first reaction is not "cut it out, that's obviously stupid and not true :/", but "wait but what if they really- ". Meanwhile the senses are used almost meditatively. Often this comes up in the way NPs interact with substances, food, art... even sports have some "deeper" quality to them. It's curious that neither Ne nor Si are interested in viewing the world for what it is; that gives them the daydreamy, cloudlike quality.

What do you think of that?Yes all of them. Extensivity/intensivity is similar, but might apply more to the judging functions. In each case the core process (logical, sentimental, sensory, inferential) is the same, which makes differentiating the i/e a matter of nuance.Relating everything to the same core pattern or idea. In Jungian terms, an "archetype" that comes from the unconscious.I wonder what he would've said about the opposite function but the same attitude? As an ITP, I feel like I understand ETJs pretty well, although I did grow up with two in the family. Something about FPs, on the other hand, is super unsettling (but I grew up with three of those :/ ).What made you settle on INTP? I remember you oscillating between E and I for a considerable length of time.That may be the case. I'm a bit of a pedant. I will say, though, that "concept of a dog" still strikes me as very much on the intellectual side of things. I think of taxonomy, biology, etc. "Ideal" or "form", words that Plato used like you mention, seem more organic and intuitive to me. I don't know where the majority of people stand on this but I've seen it be a source of confusion (for example, people taking iNtuition to be a theoretical, intellectual function).On the flip side it's almost impossible to put that understanding into practice unless you've already seen it manifest in real people. You'd be flying blind.I had friends who made fun of my little obsession and even refused to take the tests properly, although they eventually quit their bullshit and even took a bit of interest in it. A lot of people were okay with it though, and I tried to give them short tests like [this](http://www.25quiz.com/) or [this](http://similarminds.com/jung_word_pair.html). Don't take their results as law, though, they can sometimes be off. However, when someone seems to fit very very well with their type description, you can start using them as a prototype for recognising and learning about the relevant functions.Repressed elements still show themselves, but in a very uncontrolled way. Say you're trying to hold a baloon underwater, one lapse of attention and it shoots up.It's dat T!A few misleading things in this post... 

Ne is not only concerned with abstract ideas. It's after novelty in general. Whereas Se is after "the highest pitch of actuality", or the most intense sensation in one way or another, Ne "sensations" (I use this word because ENPs will often talk about sensations) are not sensations per se but the excitement of new possibilities, ideas, experiences, whatever. That's why my ENTP friend can do *all the sports* (and chamber music, human philosophy, memes, too much shit basically) without it being Se. Therefore Ne is also attracted to the physical things that could offer the most novel experiences.

Edit to add: Se users see possibilities in the sense that they look for what could *possibly* offer them the most compelling sensation, the top tier of real experience, but Ne sees and chases possibilities for their own sake.

Si does not intrinsically make the person interested in the past, especially if it's repressed. 

The quote does apply to Ji doms, because they avoid making judgements based on the necessity of outside circumstances. Unless they find something subjectively compelling, they skip to Pe. 

/u/vixen_lucina TiFe wants to feel correctly and think independently. 

FiTe wants to think correctly and feel independently. 

A common misconception is that Fi is your own feelings and Fe is the feelings of others. Both are about your subjective feelings, but with Fi your feelings are conditioned mainly by your individual experience and with Fe they are mainly conditioned by circumstances in the outside world. For example, Fe might genuinely feel that they should be sorry for a stanger's loss, because it's pretty standard to say that in our society, even though an Fi user might grapple with this because they know they have difficulty empathizing with someone they have never really met.

Another misconception is that feelings and emotions are the same thing. Everyone has emotions, feelings are subjective value judgements. Btw here's a couple more things on Ne and Se I wrote. What do you think of this? https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4qw4hs/isfp_or_infp/d4wik75 Thank you for the comment! Looking back on my stuff, I see that I do mention the aspects of reality thing but you're right that I don't really explain the {function as process + orientation} vs {function as data muncher} part. That said, my article was more of an analysis of 8 function models in general rather than of socionics specifically. 

This reminds me, though, I was planning on rehashing my article and making it more comprehensive as part  of my continued crusade. For the fatherland! FYI the newer revised translation of PT  is a significantly easier read. I think you'd enjoy a copy Mr. McQuoterson Hum. No, that's the one, but all of the transcripts online are the original baynes translation afaik. I thought these quotes were from that. &lt;33 The dominant function is a very important and decisive part of the personality. It comes with a kind of principle or way of life the individual abides by.


For ESTPs, this is a "reality principle". They are always on the lookout for the most compelling experiences and sensations, whether that is adventure, food, conflict, art, etc. Their actions are mainly governed by what will bring them "the highest pitch of actuality". 

For ISTPs, it's essentially a logical principle. Their actions are mainly based on logical conclusions, ones that make sense to then personally. They tend to go about life in a more tactical, thought-out way. They're actually very quick to care very little for things and just say "fuck it", but this is in itself a logical conclusion that the thing isn't worth bothering about. 

Another fun angle: the difference between a dominant perceiving function (ESTP) and a dominant judging function (ISTP) is actually visible in the physiology. Look at interviews with ESTPs (like John Krasinski) and ISTPs (like Micheal Fassbender) and watch how the former has very fluid, loose movements and gestures, while the latter is rigid and seems calculated in his movements. Basically. There's still a bit of one in the other type, since again they share the same functions, but it's another angle to look at and see what dominates. NiFe wants to get out of the cellar?DONT DO IT DONT FUCKING DO ITdont get a tattoo with your mbti type please, for so many reasonsare you ENFP?Maybe more ENFJ. Am I warm?ESFJ? Idk I've been drinking and mostly I don't want you to get the tattoo.I think young kids are a toss-up of functions, aka they haven't differentiated into a clear type, but they are still destined to be one. I think you can get a sense of their embryonic dominant function, like "this hermione granger ass kid is totally an ETJ" and "this piece of shit is Ti dom 100%".

There is a test you can take for a child that tries to do exactly that [here](http://personalitypage.com/html/pqk_indicate.html).

/u/ThisWontDo has a lot of experience with kids and mbti.

EDIT: Is your flair a jokeStop being human.&gt; Can't say I know many ESTJs in real life because I probably naturally avoid them as soon as I encounter them.

Or you mistype all the perfectly fine ESTJs as more "agreeable" types?

Just wanted to say that like literally every one of these has shat on ESTJs. Guys :(Evidently you don't have high Ti because you value test results over the consistency of the idea. It's not a criticism; in fact it has the benefit of making you a bit more scientific. However, within the theory... it's completely expected.&gt; People can ~~change~~ grow.

FTFY

Also, in what ways do you Fi in yourself? Ti? "I'm extremely high opinionated and I hate being told what to do or think" speaks equally if not moreso to Ti.Do you think that mistypes do not exist? Are you aware that part of the official assessment is reading about types and overriding the test results if necessary? Then why are you telling Lucina that she has to be an INFP? 

And do you actually expect me to read everything you post everywhere? Stay consistent, don't pull weak arguments out of your butt whenever it's convenient in order to mess with a community that is totally fed up at you for it.This is the original Jungian definition, which isn't too widely accepted, so take from it what you will.

Intuition is perception by means of the unconscious. This means that when a person intuits, the object they're perceiving undergoes a bunch of murky unconscious extrapolations and inferences. The end result is a hunch, which offers info that isn't directly present in reality, and which may or may not be correct.

When intuition is introverted, the focus shifts away from possibilities in the outside world and instead is on what things the object awakens in the person's psyche. Some of these things are what Jung calls "archetypes" (derived from Greek; means, "pattern preceding form"). These archetypes are patterns and ideas that we inherit from our ancestors and hold within us (dormant) from birth, like instincts.

An Ni user is presented with an object and instead of perceiving the physical qualities, they perceive the "pattern preceding form", which we often call Ni's ability to perceive the *essence* of a thing. 

However, where Jung and this community often differ is that people think that Ni is a function that condenses information, like some descriptions from this thread..

&gt; Ni does the opposite by condensing data together and forming general patterns and concepts about the data, working from many to one.

&gt; Ni is a more collective version of this. It works through these abstractions more slowly, and sort of boils down these abstractions to their principles/ into more collectives. The judging function also works as a filter for what gets put into the collective.

This is more true of Ti in general. What Jung thought was that the "essence" that Ni perceives is drawn out of the collective unconscious, which again you can think of as a collection of psychological instincts, or instinctual ideas/patterns/reactions.Exactly. I'd just shy at the use of the word "thought" because descriptions of intuition are so conflated with thinking as it is.

MBTI should really be viewed through the greater lens of Jungian psychology, but unfortunately that knowledge is a bit rare.They're pretty gross imo. Colour scheme I use is blue for NT, green for ST, gold for NF and red for SF.who would I be without jargon thoI'm having trouble thinking of any!

Hiccup from the HTTYD movies.

I'm INTP.Because I hate the flair colour *for INTP (and most of the others as well)No they're all gross puke colours (unless they changed it and my cache hasn't refreshed). Do you have CSS on and everything?I think "function strength" is often used interchangeably with "skill at function-related activities", such as good social skills being a sign of "strong Fe".

I guess this post would define "function strength" as the amount of focus/interest (libido), experience and vitality/willpower invested in the process. I find Socionics "dimensionality" to be an similar and interesting concept, but like most things Socionics, it's much too rigid.Ooh good question. I really dislike the "axes" stuff when it describes functions working in tandem (ex. "Ni condenses many Se perceptions"). I definitely think that in general, you can't use both opposites simultaneously, although I think there may be situations where they do not conflict.

I've thought about photography in this way: I can learn all the techniques and apply them with T. As I'm walking around I'll get hunches about "hey I wonder if this shot from this angle looks cool", which I can safely peg as N(e). I take the photo and basically decide whether it sits well with me with S+F. It's an activity that fires all cylinders for me, although you could still say no opposing functions are being used at once

I think you *can* use Ti to do "Fe stuff", for example navigating a social encounter purely through stuff you read about body language etc., but it will probably be much less effective than straight up empathy and "feeling-into". That said, "cognitive empathy" is a thing and is basically using T in a typically F scenario. The kicker is that you can not really use them at the same time, because the governing principles are totally different and your logic and feelings will probably not agree.Yeah iirc he's quite different in the books, along with everything else There is an analogy to the attitudes of the stages of life. It goes: alphas as "childlike", betas as "youthful", gammas as "mature", and deltas as "senior".Not as a dominant function. Dom Ne is never satisfied.Not if they're planned in advance. Ne hunches appear more or less out of nowhere.Introversion/extroversion describes the direction of interest and focus, whether it's outwards towards the outside world, or inwards towards the individual.

So for example, Te is thinking that is related to the outside world. It bases itself on externally given facts and data, and makes decisions that are applicable to external situations. Meanwhile, Ti is thinking related to the self and subjective ideas. It has a tendency to twist external facts in order to fit an internal framework.

It is VERY important to note that introversion/extroversion is a *typical* attitude, which means that it holds true *most* of the time. Therefore the introverted and extroverted iterations of functions are not mutually exclusive. Te can still consult mental models, and Ti can still consider facts, but the ultimate deciding factor is always the outside world or the inner world respectively. (Another thing to note, in the case of thinking: Ti is not "formal logic" and Te is not "facts". They are both logical processes, that's the definition of Thinking. E/I designates the data and criteria they *prefer* to use.)I re-read old convos to the point where I have to delete them to forcefully stop myself. I don't relate to changing the details/creating hypotheticals, though, maybe because it doesn't jive with my deterministic worldview. I just analyse.

I'm INTP.Sensation is more or less just normal perception. It sees what is there instead of what might be, the "fonction du reél". It does have a strong sensory component; ESPs tend to be hedonists at worst and aesthetes at best. Personally I just disagree with your definitions. These are my minimal definitions:

Ne is the perception of possibilities in the outside world, by means of unconscious processes.

Ni is the perception of unconscious contents.

According to Jung, Ni is considered the "future" function because of its access to tried-and-true hereditary instincts.

&gt; Its prophetic foresight is explained by its relation to the archetypes, which represent the laws governing the course of all experiencable things. I believe the commonly quoted general trend for functions becoming competent is the dominant from childhood, the auxiliary during teens, the tertiary during early adulthood and the inferior in middle age. Obviously there's plenty of wiggle room, and outstanding circumstances can change things. Yet from the beginning, he clearly thought himself to be an introverted thinker. His initial version of his typology even tied introversion with thinking, and extroversion with feeling, which was of course based on himself and his own major inner conflict. Whenever he was asked about his type, he always mentioned thinking before intuition and gave it the greater emphasis. 

Him having Ni, which seems debatable (people say "clearly" but I'd really like to hear some actual arguments) would then point to ISTP before either introverted intuitive type since he is most clearly an introverted thinking type (he did anyways consider himself an empiricist, especially in his youth, and he was quite a physical man...) 

And I really question anything that rigidly claims that he said the function stack was iiee or vice versa, that's really just putting words in his mouth as far as I can tell. Jung was always terribly vague about the middle attitudes. I take it as evidence for the "alternating"  function stack that it's the only thing that MBTI and Socionics really agree on, and they came to the conclusion separately based on observation, and it is quite undeniable in observation. Remember, Jung was an empiricist, he would've wanted us to align ourselves with the facts. 

Anyway I think he could be INTP or ISTP. It depends on whether it's *truly* necessary that he have Ni, which I haven't really seen a reason for. If you could provide some material that would be neat!Sure, although I'd call it Ne compensation. Si is after stability but its counterpart, Ne, is after novelty. If a high Si type strives for novelty it's because they've developed a connection with their Ne.Leslie Knope is incredibly Te dom?She is 100% political ambition and organization, she's a total ESTJ caricature. Where do you see ENFJ?If anything that sounds Si. Se is more externally-focused, Si is more body focused. It doesn't necessarily rule out either though.&gt; Almost every human being likes new things.

What about my Si dom friends who literally said, only semi-jokingly, "I don't like it because it's new"? EDIT: Ok I see you said "almost". My main point at the bottom still stands though.

&gt; Yes Se users are active people, but generally that would make every athlete an Se user by that logic and that just doesn't make any logical sense that they'd all have Se.

All cats have tails. Dogs have tails. Therefore all dogs are cats?

&gt; there's this cognitive bias in which it makes the individual believe that they just psychicly know everything.

And I guess this happens with the same frequency in everyone?

&gt; Nobody likes change for the worse.

Yet some people think all change is for the worse, and some do not.

In conclusion there are things that are kinda-sorta true about what you've said but I want to point out that individual differences exist, and MBTI tries to describe them and *typify* them. Typical similarities and differences are the whole point of types. Besides, the things you mentioned aren't really shallow stereotypes or anything, they're pretty closely linked to function definitions.Listen to your heart! Listen to the rain! Listen to the voices in your brain :)

EDIT: Nobody really liked this article I wrote but [I'll still link it](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4s3v5y/on_growth/)My first argument gave an example of someone who doesn't conform to your claim that everyone likes new things. Yeah it's just one person, but it's to demonstrate that there *are* differences in people's attitudes, since most of your points were more or less "everyone does this or that".

My second was to point out the invalidity of your logic. I made an analogy to what you said.

My third was a rhetorical question to again illustrate that there are differences between people.

Same for the fourth.

And then I wrapped it up by making the points that A) individual differences exist and B) MBTI tries to typify them.This. Introversion isn't just "subjective", it's characterized by a negative relation to the outside world, although compensated by a positive relation to inner life. The opposite is true for extroverts. Of course, these statements vary based on the level of personal growth of the individual.I have a decent number of problems with this. (Also, disclaimer, I'm an INTP, so I don't have strong Se and I'm working on a mostly theoretical level like OP.)

You would prefer to do away with defining sensation as actual sense-perception in favour of sensation as "action", or "knowing how and when to act", as well as "knowing how to handle confrontation and conflict", because you think the former is a disservice to SPs. I would argue that your definition is a greater disservice! Although it's more romanticized, it involves more behaviorism and stereotypes and is more limiting for the SP.

I'm going to assume that your definition is at least partially borrowed from Socionics, where Viktor Gulenko calls it "force sensing". The sensuous aspect is all but removed and it's replaced with a know-how about conflict. My pet theory on this is that Russia, where Socionics is studied, has an inordinate amount of SP enneagram 8s, who are of course the most typically confrontational type. I think America also has a large amount of SP 8s. However, this description of "force sensing" doesn't line up AT ALL with my experience as a born-and-raised Canadian.

The idea of an 8 is so counter to my local culture that I would guess it doesn't allow for the development of one, and I honestly can't think of any hard 8s. Maybe a couple 8 wings. I know ISFP 2s and 9s, ISTP 5s and 9s, ESTP 3s, ESFP 7s, but no core 8s afaik. Hardly any of them conform to this description of Se, and those that do I'd peg as the aforementioned 8 wings. However, ALL of them share an advanced appreciation of aesthetics. So, in my experience, the true defining principle of Se *does* lie with sense-perception, and not with action.

The reason I think your definition is actually the more detrimental one is that you now say "s/he prefers action to thought", instead of the old "s/he perceives the world how it really is". I know SP philosophers, psychologists, and mathematicians, alongside the athletes and adventurers. Your definition would drive them further away from those fields, instead of just describing the flavour of their perspectives within those fields.

I think that the reason people think Se is depreciated in the community is because of how ill-defined and fetishized the intuitive functions are. They're described as creative, mental, cerebral, etc.. Many of those buzzwords actually belong to other functions, in particular Thinking. Intuitive perception, according to the woman who came up with it (Maria Moltzer), is actually the most ancient and primal; in certain ways, the most animistic. This is because intuition is perception by means of the unconscious, and animals are mostly or fully unconscious in comparison to us. They live in line with their instincts, and even in humans intuitive perceptions are mixed with all sorts of instincts (archetypes), because those reside in the unconscious. Sensation, with its ability to perceive more objectively, is actually the function that is closer to rational, scientific thought!

(**TL;DR**) In conclusion, I don't like the Socionics-esque definition of Se because I think it is mixed up with E8 too much and does not line up with my personal experience. Also, I think it is more limiting than the Jungian definition. I think the impetus to come up with more romanticized descriptions for sensation comes from glorified and fetishized descriptions of intuition. A better thing to do would be to cut intuition down to size.One hypothesis is that the pressures and challenges of everyday life force us to specialize into one or another function, in order to have the psychological skills necessary to overcome them. Which function(s) we naturally tend towards is decided by a genetic/inborn disposition.There's still a bit of telephone and odd quote choices going on imo. Jung's Se and Si in a really small nutshell:

Se is sense perception that focuses on the real qualities of the object.

Si is sense perception that focuses on the psychological reaction to the object.There are many different opinions on this. Here's a rundown:

Socionics is strongly is favour of "duality", which is where all four letters are reversed (ex. INTP and ESFJ). The idea is that while these personalities are opposites on the surface, their cognitive functions compensate each other like Yin and Yang. It takes a pretty healthy and open-minded person to not be totally annoyed by their opposite type, though.

Kiersey thought that opposites were good but the S/N divide was too much, so he thought the best pair was where all but the S/N is flipped (ex. INTP to ENFJ). It's an assymetrical clusterfuck function-wise, because Kiersey didn't believe in functions. I also fucking hate Kiersey.

PersonalityPage.com says that the best pairings are where the dominant function is the same but its attitude is flipped (ex. INTP or ISTP to ENTJ or ESTJ). As far as I can tell this is a middle ground between compensation and common worldviews.

Some old YouTuber, DaveSuperPowers, thought that the best pair was where only the first letter is flipped (ex. INTP to ENTP) because it would help develop each other's auxiliaries, which is admittedly pretty important.

Jung was more or less in line with Socionics' duality, although his whole typology was less rigid. He thought introverts could compensate extroverts, and opposite functional types would be attracted to each other (ex. thinking types and feeling types, sensation types and intuitive types).You probably know some perfectly fine ESTJs that you've likely mistyped, probably as ENFPs or other EJs.Si is perception that focuses on the psychological reaction to the stimulus. By contrast, Se focuses on the real qualities of the stimulus. 

So, Si will synthesize new sensations with personal experiences and complexes, as well as mythological imagery and themes that exist in the collective unconscious. It modifies the perception of the object, which is apparent when an hard Si type reproduces an object in artwork. 

Si is essentially idiosyncratic; this can manifest as being particular about food or aesthetics, and unusual, impressionistic artwork (think studio ghibli / most anime).

Si is also homeostatic. As an introverted function it tries to "assert the dominance of subject over object". Si does not like being compelled to react to a stimulus in the proportionate, "appropriate" way, instead they navigate the concrete world at their own pace and by their own rules. The 1-wing doesn't even let me have the thoughts. The ENTP stereotypes are awwwful! I really don't know why people are so quick to fellate that type. 

Then there's a self-perpetuating cycle of other types, in particular ESxJs with the tertiary Ne, mistype as ENTPs, giving the online population traits and stereotypes that they should not have, causing more people to mistype as them. So, it's quite likely you'd be an ESFJ or ESTJ, especially since you think you're Fe or Te dominant. I don't. I think the concept is pretty stupid and based around behaviorism. For example, people see ExFPs being bubbly and social, and think Fe, when their feelings are nonetheless conditioned from within, not without.

For myself and Ni, the only hint of it I can think of is the time I was working on a very Jungian tattoo design, coming up with the symbols via "creative fantasy" as he calls it. I found an extremely similar design online afterwards. So, archetypes, I guess.Yes.Here are some practical somatic tip-offs:

Have you heard of the NLP thing with the eye directions and brain functions? I've observed some correlations to type. Everyone can display these but I think there's a definite change in frequency depending on type. 

Looking up and to the right is supposed to help access the deep reasoning centres of the brain, aiding fabrication and creative thought. TPs will do this often, even to the point of displaying what I call the "Ti freeze", wherein the person briefly exits out of the conversation, eyes up right, mouth hanging open, hands frozen in place. 

Looking down right accesses the feeling centre, which seems to be fairly typical of FPs. It might be a bit less obvious and silly looking than the Ti freeze, as the latter usually occurs in the middle of conversation. 

Pretty much all Fi types have static eyes. They can emote with smiles, gestures, and tone of voice, but their brow area remains almost motionless. On the other hand, most Fe types use their brow as a tool for emoting and communicating sentiments. They raise, widen and furrow frequently, and with a tone of intent. Fi types only do these things when actually experiencing the corresponding emotion. Another exception, I think, is TJs with underdeveloped Fi who also use this kind of body language, but as a cold social tool rather than for communicating sentiments. 

These are my personal observations, but for further reading you can check out cognitivetype.com and Socionics "visual identification". Ne is already like the most idealized function, second only to Ni. 

Ne, and intuition in general, is a risk vs. reward function. Intuitions are basically guesses but can lead the user in unorthodox and potentially profitable directions. Micheal Moore [Micheal Moore](http://media.salon.com/2015/12/michael_moore.jpg)Intuition in general is perception by means of the unconcious. Ne is focused on the external, real-world possibilities that these unconcious processes come up with, while Ni is focused on the unconcious images and ideas the function unearths. 

ETA: So, an Ne user is constantly on the lookout for new and exciting possibilities in the outside world. They are inevitably attracted to the things that can offer them the most new experiences and ideas. What separates them from Se types is that they chase novelty for its own sake, rather than for the sensation. 

Ni users have this inner vision they hone in on that can have little or nothing to do with the outside world. They chase their perceptions internally. Part of their lives are lived a world apart, and you can see the effect of this only indirectly, through strong or strange beliefs and perspectives.1. INTP. *95% sure.

2. 18

3. ENTJ mom and ISxJ dad, probably ISTJ 

4. I'm about to begin a bachelor's in Cognitive Science 

5. No

6. No. As of right now, I very cynically don't want children, although that'll probably change. 

7. Yes. I definitely loosen up and get more extroverted when I'm drunk. I won't say I "become an ENTP" because ENTPs are annoying and I'm not annoying. I laugh a lot. Then at the end of the night my feels catch up to me and I can get a bit sombre.

8. Weed very infrequently, when people offer. I'd like to try psychedelics, but on the other hand I'm afraid of schizophrenia. 

9. I like Vikings because I used to be really into history as a lad, and it's a well made show with an amazing lead. I like Adventure Time because it's fun, not vulgar like other adult-oriented cartoons, and I'm an NP. I like community because it's awesome. 

10. I was raised Roman Catholic. I don't go to church anymore, because i have shitty memories of my parents forcing me to go, but overall I remember the church itself in a positive way. I'd say I'm agnostic, although I have some weird Catholic guilt/1 wing cropping up from time to time.

You should ask people how sure they are of their type. Also hang in there buddy! I've only read the first couple chapters but "Gifts Differing" by Isabel Myers is pretty much as definitive as you're gonna get, and it's not academic either.DUDE I legit just started my gap year, and dogs&gt;kids all the way. He sounds roughly like an ISTJ based on your description of him, but you said he's definitely an F so idk.Ti or Fi. They're judging functions, so they're the ones that produce/work with thoughts and feelings. Because they are introverted, they are partially cut off from the outside world and very difficult to communicate.&gt; Actually, it feels like his F messes with his head pretty badly and makes him being all over the place.

Could it be that he is a T with quasi-repressed, albeit active, feelings? Has he always been how you've described or has his treatment of feelings changed with age?+1 ETJ (notice me senpai)Feelers arent necessarily more emotional. By definition, they prefer to make decisions based on subjective values.Extraverted =!= external. Feelings are subjective contents regardless, although they can be influenced by objective things. That's because ENTPs are the only ones who think they're smooth and cool. Congratulations on humility. The great misconception here is that Fi considers one's own feelings while Fe considers the feelings of others. In fact, both work around the individual's subjective feelings, whether they be *conditioned* by the inner world of internalized experiences and universal patterns (*cough! c-c-collectiveunconcious! cough!*), or the outer world of expectations, norms, and other people. 

Fi is pretty hipster. What they like and don't like is not influenced by outside pressures. If a new trend comes along they will only adapt to it if it pleases them on a really subjective level. In some cases they may actively dislike the popular and current, just because it is popular. It stands by its value judgements more rigidly than Fe. With every FP you will sooner or later get to a subject or opinion on which they can't by any means be swayed. Peer pressure works much better on FJs than FPs. 

To the extent that Fi is introverted, it will act in a way that is not "selfish" in the sense of "greedy", but "self-centred" or "self-absorbed". As Fi increasingly rejects the influence of the outside world, it will lose the ability to express its values and feelings, and eventually it will lose its capacity for empathy almost entirely. It will only feel for another person if they strike a deep chord; anything less and they are left on the roadside. Jung thought that thinking and feeling developed out of sensation and intuition, which were the more ancient and primal functions. Sensation was the function by which proto-humans apprehended their surroundings while intuition was the more unconcious, instinctual function that made them wary that there *might* be a tiger in that bush.

Introversion and extroversion were different and opposite ways of adapting to the world. Jung made an analogy to the two approaches of life forms in general; on one end, high fertility and low defences, and on the other low fertility and high defences. The "propagating" and "defending" attitudes respectively. He thought it was a same or similar mechanism at work within individuals of a species. I doubt this is true considering the number of self-hating IxFPs.

To quote myself: "To the extent that Fi is introverted, it will act in a way that is not "selfish" in the sense of "greedy" [or "self-loving"], but "self-centered" or "self-absorbed". As Fi increasingly rejects the influence of the outside world, it will lose the ability to express its values and feelings, and eventually it will lose its capacity for empathy almost entirely. It will only feel for another person if they strike a deep chord; anything less and they are left on the roadside."Fe is not the master of the environment, but rather is subject to it. Fe is not the perception or manipulation of other people's feelings. Instead, the Fe user's own genuine feelings are influenced to a great degree by the outside world.

Fe is:

- conformist, collective (subject to social pressures)

- empathetic (tries to align their feelings with that of others)

- uncomfortable and potentially reprimanding in the presence of those who upset, overturn, or refuse to bend to the general feeling-vibe

It is not:

- pragmatic

- cunning, goal-focusedyisOf course, both Te and Fe are "subject" to the environment, but I think you might be misunderstanding what I mean by that. By "subject to", I simply mean "influenced by".

Te is influenced by the environment in that it is compelled to think around an external problem; by contrast, Ti thinks for thinking's own sake (more or less). Similarly, Fe feelings are influenced by external circumstances, while Fi is relatively divorced from them and bases its feelings on really subjective prompts.

(It's important to note that each pair is not mutually exclusive. Te retains a bit of the subjective factor, Fi retains a bit of the objective factor. Extroversion and introversion are *general* tendencies.)

BTW I actually thought I was the one defending Fe, since the OP is pretty negative.Depression, stoic philosophy, E9, maybe E1, E3 (I'm not too familiar with the latter 2).The extrovert finds his identity in how he relates to the outside world, the introvert finds his identity in the constancy of his (psychoanalytic) ego.

Extroversion is just as valid a way of being, although it's the introverts natural tendency to reject it (and vice versa). #transcendtype2016I think emotions are biological motivators. Without an emotional reaction to things, we wouldn't care about anything or want to do anything (like in depression).

What do you think some of the differences are in emotions between thinkers and feelers?I'm not sure what you mean anymore. Are you saying I am inconsistent about Te and Fe? Because I clearly defined them under the same principle. Do you think I am over- or under-estimating Fe? I can't tell :(

Conforming implies being at the mercy of something, rather than towering over it. Even the (ridiculous and uncommon) mean-girl FJ stereotype is at the mercy of her clique and the social norms of the school/institution.

Empathy implies sharing in feelings as well as understanding. This is the main virtue of Fe. Although "conformist" and "reprimanding" are vices that I put in specifically so that Fe wouldn't be on a pedestal.It's just descriptive language. I imagine a lab instrument wiped clean of bacteria (emotions).The official MBTI describes Feeling as "values", never as "emotions". Feelings=emotions is a community misconception.That's true! One thing that differentiates feelings from emotions is that emotions come with a physical component (flushed skin, raised heart rate etc.). The sensation function especially contributes to becoming aware of one's own emotions. I'm getting ENTJ as a definite possibility..

&gt; Perfect student, she's one of the higher ups in the student council (though she loathes the responsibility of the leadership), one of the top 3 ranking students in school, plus she keeps herself busy with freelancing outside of classes.

IME this kind of person seems to be an ExTJ without fail. This is somewhat superficial but a top-level ambiverted student is usually Te dom, while a strong but still often lazy ambiverted student is usually Te aux.

Although I know social and open ENTJs, ESTJs are generally the more extraverted Te dom while ENTJs can come across as too intense and sometimes feel the pull to give up on social life.

I've never met a female ENTJ who isn't talkative (or at least a good conversationalist) but males, absolutely.Thinking can definitely be qualitative. Personally I like T = impartial, F = partial judgement, S = perception of reality, N = possibilitiesYeah but if we're between the NTJsI feel that Hmm I think you sound a bit unfamiliar with ENTJs. They are extremely smart and logical. "I just have to do everything myself, don't I!!" is a sentiment they often have. Besides, ENTJs and INTJs have the same Thinking style, the only difference is its place in the cognitive hierarchy. 

But regardless of the misconceptions she could very well still be an INTJ. Only you can prevent forest fires. Te. No one man should have that much power &gt;:OI'm pretty sure Fassbender is ISTPMy take: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4t1uln/ne_is_not_inherently_abstract/ISTPs are chess gods IME so I'd say the shoe fits.Intuitive hunches are vague by nature. Thinking methodically and logically is the more important tool in chess, that's why ISTP &gt;&gt; INFJ (the Ni and Ti wielding types)Chess isn't really about patterns. I know an ENTJ who practiced and learnt some standard moves and stages of play, true to form. Te types are very strong but Ti is more naturally suited, my ISTP friend and I can go toe to toe with him unpracticed.

BTW chess is an exceedingly simple board game. It's not even a "hard to master" type thing, it's just pure strategy.Enneagram 8s, maybe 6s.

Really I think it's completely a question of Enneagram. An ISTP 9 or an ESTJ 3 usually has anger under wraps (one way or another).&gt; Ni doms are by definition rare.

How so?I love this! Thank you so much for posting!

I've been looking for a while about some clarity on the reasons why the auxiliary holds the opposite attitude with respect to the dominant. This is pretty satisfactory; as far as I can understand it's framed as another necessary adaptation. Which isn't much of an reason, but it was phrased well.

I like the interviewee's style. I similarly really really hesitate to refer to "eight functions" because it does give the misconception of modular, mutually exclusive versions of each function, whereas I picture each function as a whole with a tendency to trip one way or the other. I don't like how Beebe, by contrast, is so zealous about his divisions of the function-attitudes. It becomes too rigid and starts to smell like Socionics. Fricken ENTPs.

&gt; I don't think Isabel's comments intended to focus on the importance of developing both attitudes of the auxiliary. I think she meant to point out that in some cases the auxiliary is pulled into the opposite attitude from the theoretical one and may cause imbalance. She gave an example of one of the reasons why our development may not fit the theoretical model, and even allowed for other models such as the one proposed by most Jungians. She certainly believed that each of us uses each function in both attitudes and that our goal is to use each one in the right place at the right time in the service of the dominant or at least to increase our skills towards doing so. Her focus, and mine, is to work with each person to explore the way life experience has actually caused us to develop as an interaction between our innate preferences and our environment.

Ugh God I can't keep it in my pants any longer[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/51o043/would_you_guys_say_that_ti_and_ni_doms_are_better/d7dk1a2)I relate to 20 of those so INTP's a guess for sure. INTP with enneagram 9 in particular.IxFP, likely INFP. They lead with Introverted Feeling, which is a process that acts on feelings while simultaneously hiding them away from other people. They also have Extroverted Thinking, which enjoys logistics and problem solving, although this takes a leisurely backseat role.pessimistic streakI think instinctual variant is the *last* thing that would influence content of discussion, although people with the same dominant instincts definitely jive on some energic level.This is interesting for me because I can't remember having an intrusive thought. Consciously I try to be forgiving of myself for my failures, but even without that effort I stay pretty neutral, never overly self-critical. Maybe it's because my thinking function is fully conscious, so thoughts never emerge intrusively from my unconscious the way feelings do. I'd count a crush (as per your example) as an intrusive feeling, and yes I get crushes and feelings I don't want to be having quite often.

Emotionally, I'm relatively stoic and I score pretty low on neuroticism. I've been depressed before, and been plagued by teen angst and girl problems, but I've never let it debilitate me or draw me into a nervous breakdown (although I've gotten dangerously close to the latter). So far I don't know what my emotional limit is but it seems high compared to my peers.

Anger is an emotion I've only discovered over the past year (the 9 is strong with this one). I went from never even knowing I was angry, because I'd automatically frame it as other things (like sadness), to recognizing it but having the occasional verging-on-violent spill of anger, to now surprising myself by expressing it more frequently and in a more controlled manner. Enneagram has been a huge revelation for me and it definitely guided me here.

I am an INTP and I am completely confident of my type. FWIW my Enneagram is 9w1 sx/sp.It's in service to the dominant, so sure. Similarly the tertiary is in service to the inferior, which is naturally opposed to the dominant, although it's possibly to develop each and bring them all in service of the dominant/consciousness.Are you absolutely sure you're not a TJ?&gt; popular memes

&gt; complete snorefest

get out of hereyou're my herobabe I know in my heart you're an entp

love ottercan confirm, fricken ENTP loves getting in my bubble fuckbabe I know you face many hardships, many different types. I just want u to know that no one fucking knows what intuition is and babe u gonna be alright. asuh dudesteamy is my middle name bruv. but ya gotta know that peeps be justifyin shit with tha socionics, an that gives me an itch in the ol bumhole. I know u. I seen u. boy u ain't no entj. xoxoEvery time I make a civil article it gets little feedback and upvotes. No one bothers to read it cause it's just dry Ti-speak. Gotta get the message across somehow.

The title is actually a reference to an article by another redditor that got something like... I dunno, 60 upvotes when it was made?

Ne and Ni are certainly divergent, but people get the extremes wrong, and they don't consider that moderate cases exist in the system because they're all up in the eight function model craze.You would take Jung's typology but call bullshit on all the theory it relies upon?&gt; The unconscious isn't something magical that randomly derives hunches from data, it operates in a particular way

See, I find this ironic because this is a criticism I often make about common definitions of intuition. I don't think I framed it as anything "magical". Our unconscious can formulate conclusions in the same way that our conscious mind can: through (vaguely) logical thought, subjective feelings, (subliminal) sensations, and relating to past experience among other things. The only difference is that we are only aware of the product but not the process, and the processes have the potential to be faulty or vague without us knowing. What else could a "hunch" be?

I didn't really put in examples of the output because I wanted to keep it concise. [Here's one](https://youtu.be/T_7DpbJ1xFg?t=5m).The most common definitions of intuition I see on these forums are Ne as "expanding on ideas" and Ni as "condensing ideas" or something similar (everyone puts their own twist on it). Basically all of my division-things could be present in those except the extreme Ni type. It's taken for granted that Ni is connected to the outside world, even though this is not always the case. It makes for an arbitrary, inconsistent, asymmetrical system since the principles of introversion and extroversion are not properly applied.Something stronger than "I'm calling bullshit on it because I don't understand it?" I don't think I can manage, dude.

MBTI rests on the shoulders of Jungian psychoanalysis. This is a fact. If you want to abandon it that's fine, but you are totes missing out bruv.[This](https://www.amazon.ca/Primer-Jungian-Psychology-Calvin-Hall/dp/0452011868) is the short summary I read to get acquainted with Jungian psychology at large. There's a few different ones out there. It's super enriching.

For type specifically, there's no substitute for "Psychological Types". I recommend chapters 2, 10, and any relevant definitions from chapter 11. I also recommend getting the revised translation, since it's a *much* easier read (the one available online is an older edition), but that costs $$$ :(What am I doing ruminating for 18 hours a day then? O.o

As an INTP I pick up on nothing. My ENFP friend was surprised that I didn't intuit things like people's character from the way they hold themselves. Body language is lost on me. I consciously second- and third- guess everything, I take no information for granted. I don't relate to what you're saying. Maybe that's how you experience things as an INFJ, idk.Even when my intuition/unconscious is chugging away, I assume that as a Ti dominant I refute the information it provides. I prefer to think things through on my own (conscious) terms. Type exists for a reason broYou said "all functions reside in the unconscious". If you mean *in part*, then yeah I accept that but I have my conscious thinking and by definition as an ITP, I value that over any other process. 

I think I'm also hung up on your claim that "Almost all of our information processing is unconscious". Seeing as "almost all" is a relative term I might be misunderstanding exactly what you mean. The unconscious definitely plays a big role in information processing. That role is synonymous (or almost synonymous) with "intuition".In terms of looking, probably because there was a distinctive sight, or sound, or someone started speaking to me.

Se is conscious insofar as the sensory details of what you're experiencing occupy your conscious space/awareness.

&gt; You see shit, and for whatever reason you look somewhere else based on where you looked.

wat.

&gt; This applies to any function, they're all fed by the unconscious and all you get is a tiny little conscious summary, but of course that conscious summary is all you're aware of so obviously that is how you view your information processing.

I'm definitely not undermining the relevance of the unconscious. Others in the thread and this community would reject or ignore the concept entirely. However, even if there's a greater "volume" of neuron snaps working in the unconscious, your conscious mind still possesses a great deal of gravity. Consciousness has dominated the Darwinian struggle for life on this planet, so evidently it has a very important and effective function.

So as far as I can tell, the thing we kinda-sorta disagree on is how great a role the unconscious plays. Either one of us is right or it's some middle ground. I'm alright with that.&gt; There is a whole fuck ton more unconscious life on earth than there is conscious, and we literally couldn't survive without bacteria, so how exactly are we the masters of bacteria and not their bitch?

Ok that's a good point but let's try apples to apples bud.

I think another misunderstanding here might be about the terminology. My entire post is from a psychoanalytic perspective. When I refer to the "unconscious", I don't include all sort of automatic brain functions like motor coordination. I'm referring to the concept of a sort of "conscious unconscious" as it's described in the literature. Whether this exists is controversial (although some of that controversy is again a matter of semantics), but I'm operating under the assumption that it does. If you want to debate me on that... I'm not really into it, I need to read more. If you want to debate the definition of intuition, as a psychoanalytic concept, we gotta debate it within a psychoanalytic framework.Welp. This is definitely a good point. Really that's all I can say, it's a good point. Shit's confusing. Such is the nature of the beast, I guess.&gt; Is this conscious unconscious what we normies refer to as, uh, memory?

More to it than that! See my fun diagram.

&gt; Is there any chance that motor patterns are also... memories?

Patterns, maybe. You could say that the remembered technique to my tennis swing resides in my unconscious until I need it, because by definition it's not in my conscious frame. Actual coordination and movement is the domain of the cerebellum, however. And automatic shit like heartbeat, the domain of the brain stem.

&gt; No we don't? If I think the toolbox sucks, or you know, I don't know how to use the tools and don't care, I'll simply go grab a different toolbox.

Then we are officially yelling at each other in different languages. Ciao.;)Can you guys please then read my discomfort when you're about two feet too deep in my personal bubble? Please? :'(If we give the official stats the benefit of the doubt, then about 9 people are xNxx types and about 4.5 are N-dominant (ENPs and INJs).A. If you look "under the hood" of an ISTJ, their leading cognitive process is Si (Introverted Sensation). It's a process that directs the user's attention towards real, tangible, verifiable things, while the "introverted" part means that what they perceive is fused, to a degree, with their "subject" or "unconscious". This includes thoughts, feelings, images, and past experiences.

B. Although Si types (SJs) are *supposedly* common in the real world, there *seem* to be very few here. Also, the descriptions and explanations of Si (and SJs) are mostly oversimplified bullshit that misses the point. Some sceptical people think there might be a lot of mistyped SPs, NTs, and NFs on here that are really SJs for that reason.

C. "It's my dominant function, so it's kind of unconscious/natural for me ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ "1. I think of it as kinda red, with white spires reaching up to the... sky. There are massive monuments that are really weirdly built tbh, they're all squishy and bag-like. There's an indoor pool but it closed down cause it was too acidic to swim in. Don't tell anyone but I think it was Dan from high school who sabotaged it. He didn't like the owner. Actually, fuck him, I liked the pool. Tell everyone.

2. Chains and whips.I can say no?\1. I think I once described my head as consisting of one never-ending internal monologue, and usually a song that's just stuck there like a gross piece of gum. I'm not sure how to describe my inner world. The imagery that immediately comes to mind is of scaffolding or wireframe, but that might be influenced by descriptions of Ti. Still, I enjoy the thought of it. Still, I don't know how to *really* describe it and I'm resisting looking at other people's comments to use as a point of reference.

Coupled with the idea of scaffolding is the idea of "building up" myself. When people say "people change", I love to be pedantic and say "no, people grow". This is an idea I like and have adopted from psychoanalysis, the idea that we're constantly expanding and building on ourselves, sometimes transforming or re-purposing aspects of that foundation. I'm not sure why I like the idea, because I also expressly dislike remembering much of my childhood. Maybe it's the idea that despite that unpleasantness, incorporating it into the picture is an important way of understanding myself.

I look for ways to hold onto lessons I deem important, cause I forget them easily without reminders and that kind of regress seems like a shame. Right now I feel like a lot of my life and energy is spent towards seeking some kind of enlightenment or wisdom. Wisdom is my little secret quest I follow that no one really knows about. Post-it notes of quotes and shit on my wall and intending to get tattoos are currently my ways of cementing it.

-----

\2. I'm excited most by opportunities to learn important things as well as just things related to my interests. I just got back from europe and I was impressed with myself that I could summon the willpower to go through all the preparation and two months of literally back-breaking work to make it. I really, really wanted it because I knew I would learn a lot, it would likely get me out of an emotional rut, and life-changing experiences make me cum a little.

I like things that require a lot of grit and courage, and chilled-out things, in equal part. I like to alternate. Also, rare opportunities to gel with close friends are exciting.I went to Greece and a few of the Balkans. First I learnt that backpacking is much easier it seems, and that knowledge was incredibly liberating because now I know if I want to go somewhere, I totally can. Financially, two months of work for a month of relatively expensive travel really isn't that bad. I learnt a lot of things about myself, including what I want from travel. I found I like the journey much more than the destination, I like exploring and meandering. I like to walk instead of taking buses or cabs.

I got exactly what I felt I needed out of the experience, which was to put things in perspective and make me and everything else feel a bit small, as well as give me some breathing room after my life (interpersonal life in particular) back home was getting too claustrophobic. I had a thought the other day that it took me $3000 dollars and a month to get over a crush, which is lacking context but it's kind of funny. 

Other stuff I liked was the geography. I was really awestruck by some of the mountains, canyons and islands. Some of it was was like something out of a high fantasy realm. I liked exploring cities and getting a feel for their layouts and I got really fucking good at navigating.So be it! I strongly disagree but what can ya do First I'll say that I've seen some of the arguments people make about me being an ISFJ, and I find they lack substance and involve a lot of incorrect assumptions about me. You can offer yours on the off chance they're different.

Getting typed as INTP was one of the most revelatory experiences of my short life, tbh. Though some people say I have strong Si and Fe the face I put to the internet is an exaggeration of certain aspects of myself. Strong Fe, why, cause I'm not autistic? Which wouldn't even be much of an argument, as I'm pretty sure my fam thought I had more than a tinge of autism as a kid. That brings me to another argument against strong SiFe, that everything in my life including music, working out, making my house a home, social skills, social *presence*, and empathy are all recent developments, and most are a WIP. I'm 18, btw.

A big aspect of my personality, which might be the 9w1 idk, is that I have a tendency to improve myself aggressively. I'm a growth junkie. That the face I put up to the internet might be heavy on things arguably related to my lower functions (I'm aware I threw a generous amount of Si into my answers) but those are my points of interest, not my strengths. I spent a good amount of time last year writing to numerous penpals specifically in order to improve my conversation skills.

It seems there's a catch 22 here. My focus on "SiFe" things (still arguable) could either be due to a focus on lower functions, or evidence of higher functions. Since you've already decided you can use the latter all you want.

By contrast, in the ol' real life I have a reputation for being awkward, robotic, apathetic, inexpressive, odd, typically nerdy, and markedly unbiased. If you don't take my word for it I have the old letters from classmates and teachers stashed away to prove it. Inferior Fe is one of the things I relate the most to in the world. Fuck that shit. I'd like to think dominant Ti is evidenced by the style of my posts and articles but unfortunately that's a matter of subjective opinion. I could have tried to put more of it in my answers but it feels too all-encompassing to describe, and I felt a "you're trying too hard to be an INTP. ISFJ!" coming. Another catch-22.

I've typed a lot of people IRL myself and my place among them has only reinforced my type. SFJs think I'm cute. ENTPs feel like an annoying version of me. ENTJs are dope. INFPs vibe with me. ESFPs can be difficult and ISFPs are the devil (sorry). The person I relate the most to is my ISTP. We have a similar apathy and existential confusion #lifeismeaningless.

Watcha think b0ssI'm sorry! :c I love y'all but IME we don't get each other in the least&gt; Look at everything that you've written here. They are all based upon subjective concrete perceptions, not judgements. Your arguments for why you think you are such and such a person are based upon how you perceive your relationship to others. That is Si.

One argument. Out of like 5. That's a decent ratio, no?

&gt; A catch-22 implies that you are double-bound by reality, indicating your tertiary/trickster functions. Your catch-22 is related to defining yourself in the face of facts. An INTP's catch-22 is more related to perceiving themselves accurately as opposed to objective data.

What facts? The fact that anyone with an opinion and an unfalsifiable method can twist statements to their liking? Seriously, where do people see all this Si? And how are they concluding that, if there, it is Si dominance and not simply the use of Si? Or Te/Ti, for that matter? Is gathering evidence to justify a theory not sound practice?

ETA: Ironically, it's kinda you who is having difficulty with facts, as you pretty much ignored all the content of my arguments in favour of fixating on a subtle semi-present tendency that you have attributed to Si, likely without bothering to cross-reference any examples. So Ti, yeah, but too much so.

ETA2: I'm sorry if my tone is getting heated, this is just getting a bit frustrating. But apologizing would mean I have high Fe right? In which case nvm im not sorry :pSince you're giving me a lot of time to think, if you want some neat evidence of Ti you can check out my personal repository at /r/mbtiarticles and gawk at my obsessive focus on definitions and principles. I was hoping you'd give me the benefit of the doubt even a little but now I feel like pulling out all the stops before the groupthink train runs me over.Nah

&gt; Well I like to argue, and I'll immediately state my belief. I'll probably pick an argument with them, and I'm pretty good at it, I'm good at trying to make an opinion seem like a fact? For say I can back my opinion up with enough facts to where it almost don't make sense to be against it. all my opinions are based around fact, and I feel very strongly about my opinions.

&gt; It depends. Sometimes we have to accept that people believe differently, but if I believe that the said thing is rude, harmful, and just bad, I'll speak up. For instance, as a Christian some things I believe as sin, not everyone sees as sin. While at the end of the day it is a sin black and white, no gray area, can't argue with God, I will not push my religion onto someone else. You do you I'll do me.

This is Te&gt;Fi incarnate&gt; The moment that I thought was suspect though was when you postulated that the difference between Western and Eastern interpretations of Se was because there are a disproportionate of E-8s in Russia, but none in Canada. More and less, sure, but none? That would pose all kinds of logical questions that would need to be satisfied in order to support this idea. This was an indication of Fe over Ti, where something "feels logical" based upon external feeling judgments having supremacy over thinking based consistency.

This is consistent with my current understanding of enneagram as a developmental typology ie. heavily influenced by the environment. Also, my ease in making that claim/observation runs in direct contradiction to this statement:

&gt; I think that you play your Ti judgements close to the chest and somewhat conservatively. I don't think that you get things wrong very often, but it seems more because you proceed cautiously rather than let your Ti-Ne roam free and create Ti values for their own sake.

That aside, I realize the tone and defensiveness of my other comments was kind of disproportionate, but in my defence it was somewhere around midnight and this discussion had been going on outside of this thread as well.

I also realize that no ones means disrespect when they offer an alternate typing, I've done it before, but I find that on the reverse side it's hard to take it any other way. I've researched type a bunch, my content is generally well received and afaik I've never grossly misrepresented either type in question, as a mistyped person would likely do. It's a surprisingly bewildering thing.Te dom/aux. That said, some of your other points could possibly contradict that. I'm kinda too tired to be thorough about this rn but my thoughts went to ESTJ or ENTJ.You have respect for Fi individuality but you seem to put more emphasis on your arguments and opinions. You seem pretty vocal in that sense. You write with a lot of assertiveness. The "cold on the outside, warm on the inside" dynamic is more typical of thinkers. All of this could still be considered a bit fuzzy, though, so def explore your options.Your Ni is actually Ti. Ti loves the "why" or "how" things work, except it's thorough and mechanical, not vague like intuition. [Clicky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/53zq3y/questions_about_te_and_ti_and_understanding_them/d7xx3eg)

Ni is still hunches, but it's often said to have more of a singular vision in comparison to Ne's many possibilities. [Clicky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/52hbun/intuition_a_better_fucking_explanation/)

Fe is not collective values like many people think, but the function wherein *your own* values tend to align themselves with collective ones.

Finally Se is sensation where the focus is on the actual qualities of the outside world. It's aesthetic, it's after peak experiences and thrills of a sensory nature. Si, by comparison, is not just comparing to past experiences but is much broader than that. Si is sensation where the focus is on how the sensation affects you, as well as internal bodily sensations and health.

Notice that I describe each function as having a *tendency* or *focus*; they're not mutually exclusive, it's the same process but with a different direction of interest.Wasn't what he was askingThe only cognitive function test that comes close to working is the keys2cognition one, cause it's backed up by actual scientific(?) research.That's the beauty of this quiz, there are no stereotypes, only statistics.?He actually responded to a few of these criticisms on a forum [here](http://personalitycafe.com/cognitive-functions/128709-nueroscience-personality-dario-nardi-5.html). The discussion goes on for a few pages. Maybe it'll curb your skepticism? Anyway, his methods are arguably meh but his results look sound and unbiased, insofar as they are what they are, which is just correlations.I did say "arguably", as the thread I posted is clearly an argument. He does offer a rebuttal to that quoted section on the next page. Whether it's adequate I'm not sure, since I'm not an expert and I have no personal knowledge to fall back on.

So as to your question, it depends, are his methods bunk or not? IDK, the only comment I can offer, which I did, is that his cognitive function test works better than its counterparts, so until I know more, it follows that his methods should receive the benefit of my doubt. Which sounds bad with respect to science, but this is a hobby to me so I don't care too much.

I'll check out the address!Yo are you me Yeah. Annoying talkative people are :l but interesting talkative people are a godsend do you ever worry about people cutting themselves on you?k cause you got a lot of edgeIME it's like we inhabit pretty different bubbles, socially and capability-wise, but that just means we don't interfere with one another. I would say that instead of jealousy and superiority, there's a tiny bit of mutual admiration.

FWIW I'm only close friends with one ESTJ, and acquainted with a couple more, and they're all girls who are a bit younger than me. That might make for a certain dynamic. ETA: I feel like when people think of "ESTJ" they tend to immediately think of a parent or authority figure, rarely a lively 5'2" one who is, if anything, your equal.

Actually, I had one ESTJ who's my senior at work last summer! He was really annoying in how much he liked to micro-manage but he was still a cool person outside of work and I wouldn't say we were scared of each other.

just doin my civic duty ma'am[arright arright arright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4bg4Q63kJQ)I've actually been wanting to get a tattoo with that inspiration for a long time now. Soon^^TM

What I think the quote refers to is simply the idea of duality; yin and yang. The use of 'heaven' and 'hell' is, as the analyst says, a metaphor or analogy. It doesn't even have to apply to christian ideas or "christ as a symbol of the self". It can be more broadly applied to the conflict or mirror relationship between the ego and shadow; two antithetical parts of the personality.

I want to get it tattooed because it represents in great part the first step of Jung's individuation process, which is recognizing one's shadow. The more you are uniquely good and virtuous (or any other imaginable traits), the more strongly the opposite traits exist unconsciously in the depths of your psyche. Everyone has a dark side, but it's better to be cognizant of it rather than ignorant of it.According to Jung, the shadow is actually supposed to be a great source of energy, creativity, and insight. That might have something to do with the gifts of knowledge and fire.

The thing is, the shadow is not necessarily evil or bad, and the ego is not necessarily good. The shadow only exists by the principle of opposites, no morality involved. If someone's ego possesses 'evil' qualities (which is uncommon; no one perceives themselves as evil), then the shadow will necessarily possess the corresponding 'good' qualities.

On the topic of religious figures, the tendency towards duality and splitting opposites is exemplified by the fact that the God of Abraham did some really shitty things, he was kind of a jerk. As time progressed and religion became more complex and differentiated, this ambivalent God was split into the all-good Christian God and the all-evil Satan. This is the same principle at work as when we develop our types as children. Our functions start out jumbled and ambiguous, equal in strength, and then they differentiate out as we age.

"I'm sorry you're put off by my INTPness"You're only humanMost things you find online are people's own interpretations, which can bear little resemblance to one another. Even a lot of books are far from accurate. If you want the most "official" resource for the MBTI specifically, read *Gifts Differing* by Isabel Myers. If you want the root of all this typology, and arguably the most rich and accurate resource, read *Psychological Types* by C.G. Jung (a very tough read, especially if you go for the shittier translation available online).omfg i never noticed thatThey are incredibly different. Introverted Sensation is sensation that gives its attention to the internal impressions the sensation evokes, as opposed to the reality of the object. These "internal impressions" *include* memories and experiences as a contributing factor, but are in no way synonymous with them.

The kicker is, ALL the introverted functions draw on past experience and the trends therein (among other things). The reason Si is so heavily and unjustly associated with memory is that through sensation, as opposed to the other functions, memories have the most direct link to the outside world. Any object perceived *is* its associated experiences. However, emphasizing the connection between memories and Si, and ignoring the rest, is lazy typology.Hiccup from hhtydThere's a revised translation by H.G. Baynes, but there's no pdf available online :( it makes quite the differenceTi creates a framework of logical principles, based on what they've found to be true or logically sound. Each new "truth" is assimilated and used to evaluate future situations. The same is true of Fi, except instead of thoughts and logic, they create feeling-principles based on experiences to guide them though their lives.

Si accesses sensation-principles; what does this sensation mean to me, based on previous sensations? Finally Ni is much messier, potentially a combination of all three. It uses thoughts, feelings, and experiences subconsciously to get a sudden inspiration, or if it's the dominant function, a persistent unorthodox view of the world.

And again, while I didn't specify, these functions access more than memories. According to Jung they also access what he calls the "[collective unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_unconscious)", which is an additional store of experiences, or the essence of experiences, which is passed down genetically from millions of years of evolution.Right? That would be sick. 

The idea of the collective unconscious can be understood as a product of lamarckist evolution, or the much more contemporary field of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, if that interests you. Yeah, definitely psychological tendencies more than memories. I tried to get that across without getting too in-depth via "essence of experience", but I understand that's vague and I hope people explore some further reading.

Incidentally, I haven't found anything really investigating the potential link between the phenomena, but I starting linking the two together when I learned of stuff like experiments where mice inherit phobias.[Best I can give you](https://youtu.be/T_7DpbJ1xFg?t=5m), since I don't know any INFJs and I don't like pulling things out of my assYeah, I think that makes sense! At the very least, symbols are a very necessary tool for Ni types when trying to translate their perceptions.Irony[Well.](https://media.tenor.co/images/2881fa2ca8fd400b0a68527680a2766a/raw)

It's awks for sure, and I'm coming to the same conclusions as you.tfw no Ne/Si :'(I think the efficacy of the P/J dichotomy depends on the level of ego development of the individual, which can vary. An introvert who has not had the opportunity to develop, or has not put effort into developing their auxiliary function will probably rely more on their dominant, and that may be reflected in the test. I think the MBTI assumes an average level of ego development which gives the test a decent success rate across the board, although exceptions exists.

Does that mean that eastern society is, on average, at a different level of ego development? Maybe. Dunno. That's one hypothesis, anyway. Or perhaps they have a less extroverted culture, and so introverts don't receive so much pressure to extrovert/use their auxiliary.I think OP's confusion, and everyone else's, stems from the fact that J/P and j/p mean very different things, with very meaningful consequences, but are tested for in the same way (both are very similar to the "contentiousness" scale of the Big 5). Your characterizations of IxxJs and IxxPs are shaky and could use some cleaning up, but also fail to reconcile this difference.

For example, this: "IxxJs do this by making decisions but keeping them private" is much more Ji than PiJe.&gt; The problem with the J/P dichotomy, is that it's completely made up based on observation.

Just like Jungian type?

&gt; This book is the fruit of nearly twenty years' work in the domain of practical psychology. It grew gradually in my thoughts, taking shape from the countless impressions and experiences of a psychiatrist in the treatment of nervous illnesses, from intercourse with men and women of all social levels, from my personal dealings with friend and foe alike, and, finally, from a critique of my own psychological peculiarity.

Jung considered himself an empiricist and would have been dissapointed in anyone taking his word as gospel. Finally, if you actually read any literature on the MBTI, namely *Gifts Differing* by Isabel Myers, you'll find she had a much greater and deeper grasp of Jung's typology than most everyone on these forums.* afaik that's the sole purpose of the four-letter notation, as testable psychometrics. Under normal circumstances, they tend to use the three-letter notation, ex. LII = logical-intuitive introvert.

* Dunno why Si should equal conscientiousness. Neither does J, for that matter; they simply correlate, as a portion of J test questions resemble C test questions. In fact, all of those terms you used to describe yourself are linked to conscientiousness:

&gt; I am very decisive, proactive, efficient, and deliberate

&gt; Conscientiousness is a tendency to show **self-discipline**, act dutifully, and **aim for achievement** against measures or outside expectations. It is related to the way in which people **control, regulate, and direct their impulses**. High scores on conscientiousness indicate a preference for **planned rather than spontaneous behavior**.

* "IxxJs do this by making decisions but keeping them private". Decisions + private ~= judgement + introversion.&gt; That's true but the socionics dichotomies are not designed with testing in mind. They are just descriptions of how the types tend to act based on observation. They do administer tests sometimes but they are not considered a serious typing tool by any socionist I heard of.

In that case it seems a bit contrived (I'd be curious to know where the dichotomy originated), and I agree with OP that the J/P system works better when it comes to the characterizations they overlap on.

&gt; You do agree that high Pi matches most measures of conscientiousness, right? An ENxJ will show poor impulse control with physical things such as food, exercise habits, healthy lifestyle, cautious spending, performing necessary chores and maintenance tasks etc. They are very much undisciplined and spontaneous in these areas.

I assume you mean high Si, not Pi. With that in mind, I am currently visiting my eats-healthy-runs-marathons-financially-sound-clean-house ENTJ sister. If anything, conscientiousness correlates most strongly with Te, making MBTI ETJs "hyper-J" types as I recall reading in a Socionist-POV article. Most ENFJs I know are fairly on-the-ball as well, as a healthy lifestyle is in vogue.

&gt; IJs have judging functions as well.. It's not like irrational types don't make decisions, the difference is how they treat them.

Exactly. They extrovert their decision-making process. With a developed auxiliary, they are more vocal, proactive, and commanding with their judgements.

&gt; IPs want to be able to reevaluate and re-decide as often as necessary but they will continue on their already selected path most of the time.

Just as a side, I'm doing some reading on sociotype.com and they say this about j types:

&gt; Are more often rigid and stubborn
&gt; Do not like to change their decisions

Regardless of the fine print regarding these statements you are likely to bring up, there are some definite differences between the way Socionics wants to make things work and the way MBTI views things.

Another random comment: I'm pretty sure it's standard of Ji to be quite painstaking in it's decisions, I by no means "come to a decision fairly quickly".

&gt; His style is usually loaded and complicated by all sorts of accessories, qualifications, saving clauses, doubts, etc., which spring from his exacting scrupulousness. His work goes slowly and with difficulty. (Jung, on the Ti type)

Likewise I hear from IFPs that they often have to ruminate for a long time before discovering the intricacies of how they feel.Ok, that's fair for the most part. However, in my opinion you and most of the people in this thread are still dishing out some unfair criticisms.

&gt; Of course all of typology is based on observation, but the J/P difference has no strict place in the actual typing of people, and it definitely should not be used TO type people.

The dichotomy was *designed* to type people. Myers offered a practical interpretation of Jung's work. If not for her and her assessment, this community would not exist and the only way to access typology would be through the century-old mammoth volume written for academics and psychologists. Again, Myer's understanding of the theory is *incredibly* close to Jung, almost a summary, and it's available for people to read. If people consider the MBTI to be superficial and shallow, that's on them for not digging deeper.

&gt; The point I'm really trying to make here is that when people try to mix MBTI into Jungian theory, we're mixing two systems that don't necessarily have the same basis. 

Same argument as above. Incidentally, speaking of systems: If you consider yourself as habitually using Fe (if you don't then w/e), you are by all means using Myer's system and not Jung's. While the innovation that the auxiliary is opposite the dominant in attitude is not necessarily contradicting Jung (although it sort of is), it is not found in his writings. Most Jungian analysts interpret a same-attitude auxiliary.Te works very well with externally provided logical frameworks and principles, as science courses often are. Ti prefers to create its own logical structures, so it might try to assimilate the tenets of physics or computer science to its own subjective, all-encompassing understanding.

Te is content to think on the course's terms; Ti needs to adapt the subject matter in order to think on its own terms.

I think.Why are ESTJs berserkers?We don't know. What do you think caused it?CrowdedHighways! ISFJ?wow ok that is not the word I would uselol no

Consequence-based thinking is most related to T

and the specific consequences he lists seem pretty concrete

Not saying I know what his type is, but that would be an ST perspective if anythingThe only accurate portrayal of MBTI types and their mindsets will be in autobiographies and non-fiction first person accounts. Fiction is at best approximate.Fictional characters have no inherent type, they're not organic humans with a real psyche. Authors generally have no knowledge of type, so unless the author models their protagonist completely after themselves, no dice.MBTI assumes that people have a real type. Fictional characters don't.This is correct. OP's feeling, as a thinking dom, is "concrete" (grown together) and mostly unconscious. Feeling as an unhindered function is a true function of consciousness, and operates from the perspective of the conscious ego.

&gt; Feeling is primarily a process that takes place between the ego and a given content, a process, moreover, that imparts to the content a definite value in the sense of acceptance or rejection ('like' or 'dislike')...

Jung touches on the phenomenon described by OP:

&gt; Hence active feeling is a directed function, an act of will, as for instance loving as opposed to being in love. This latter state would be undirected, passive feeling, as, indeed, the ordinary colloquial term suggests, since it describes the former as activity and the latter as a condition. Undirected feeling is feeling-intuition.

"Active feeling" here refers to high-order, conscious feeling, while "passive feeling" or "feeling-intuition" refers to low-order, unconscious feeling.does not computeHere's a weird thing that might provide some clues. If we consider that an extraverted function is *externally engaged*, and a feeling function is *emotionally involved*, and both states result in some substantial, additive effects, then Te/Fi types are pretty consistently involved one way or another. 

Fe concentrates both qualities into one function. Fe's got it all. Ti, on the other hand, is completely flat and neutral, and that's how it comes across. IME, TI types:

* Pause fairly often during speech in order to process and think. Usually, in order to focus, they break eye contact and send their gaze upwards or sideways, "reading a book in the air" as one user put it.

* Are minimally expressive when explaining things. Gesture somewhat oddly, I've seen it called "puppeteer hands".

* Have well thought-out and precise diction. When it comes to technical things, they take the time to plan out and say exactly what they mean.

* Are usually the first to conclude that something "doesn't really matter anyways". Strength: rationalization. Weakness: rationalization.This is the Socionics POV. OP's ideas are actually quite close to Jung. This is because for Jung, the functions he described were *basic psychological functions of consciousness*. Between the four of them you could roughly sum up any aspect of conscious experience. [Clicky](https://youtu.be/T_7DpbJ1xFg?t=1m40s). Therefore when you focus on your surroundings and sense-organs you are *literally* using sensation; when you think impartially you are literally thinking, feeling is feeling, and listening to your gut and unconscious is literally conscious use of intuition.

Furthermore meditation can definitely get you to interesting places. Jung analysed forms of yoga and meditation as being potential forms of the Transcendent Function, a fancy term for a fancy process that basically involves 'reconciling the opposites'.Socionics is way too rigid. Also has some arbitrary ideas.&gt; Deliberate use of a function is not the same as using that function as if you were another type.

Straw man, I guess? OP never mentioned "using a function as if you were another type". Neither did he mention turning into another type.

As for the merit of using other functions, both Myers and Socionics seem to place little importance on working on shadow functions (and by these I mean your 3rd and 4th, regardless of attitude). I saw a slide on a youtube video that would be impossible for me to find right now, that said something to the gist of, "Perhaps Myers had given up on ever achieving the Transcendent Function, but she had one right under her nose. The type indicator she created was a way of reconciling differences between people."

So I take this:

&gt; I don't see the point, because employing whatever functions you think work best where you want it won't actually work out in the long-term.

And raise you this: using your shadow function will be torturous in the *short-term*, and will *only* benefit you in the *long-term*, provided you explore them with some carefulness, patience, open-mindedness, and humility.On Ni, if you want the Jungian perspective and not the garbage forumite one, I think his practice of [active imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_imagination#Carl_Gustav_Jung) is very closely linked to it.maybe if you were taller they wouldn't stress you out like thatIt's aaaaaaaaall a matter of definitions. If you decide to call Ne and Ni separate functions, then the problem exists; if intuition is a singular function with a typical attitude, then there is no problem and no contradiction.

Furthermore, some people refer to the function-attitudes not in your stack as "shadow functions", and some refer to your bottom two functions as the same.

Socionics, Beebe, Berens, and a host of others use the former definitions; Jung and Myers use the latter. I strongly prefer the latter and like to pick arguments with people who use the former, cause they're really just fucking things up.Intuition is a function. Sensation is a function. Therefore it's completely fair to test an S/N preference dichotomy. Se, Si, Ne, Ni are function-attitudes. Se is close to Si and far from Ni.I wrote [this summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4in33j/a_summary_of_jungs_schema_of_personality/) of Jung's structure of the psyche a while back. Hopefully it makes a good starting point. The book I reference could make some good further reading, and then you can probably step right into Psychological Types. I recommend the revised Baynes translation, it makes it much easier to read.That's the problem with most function-based descriptions; they lose themselves in technicalities. Typically these are really Ti-esque constructs, on which Jung had this to say:

&gt; Its aim, therefore, is never concerned with an intellectual reconstruction of concrete actuality, but with the shaping of that dim image into a resplendent idea.

&gt; For, as in the former case the purely empirical heaping together of facts paralyses thought and smothers their meaning, so in the latter case introverted thinking shows a dangerous tendency to coerce facts into the shape of its image, or by ignoring them altogether, to unfold its phantasy image in freedom.

So while I enjoy the very technical descriptions, and they are good for getting a deeper understanding, they definitely have their practical drawbacks. Furthermore, the descriptions really fail when the framework first takes precedence over reality, and then starts to depart from it, becoming rigid and arbitrary. Which is what I like to call Socionics.

I showed my ISTP friend a variety of type descriptions in an attempt to get some clues about what works. He said several, I don't really remember which, were too vague, and he settled on the 16personalities one as the most relatable.

16personalities tends to be abhorred for its lacking-cognitive-functions approach, but let's be real... most people are awful at their "Jungian cognitive functions", so much so that they don't realize Jung never used the term "cognitive function".SLI? No typo?SLI should be ISTJ in MBTI. If you are ISTP and SLI it just serves to demonstrate how fucked it all is.SLI=ISTp in Socionics, and the p and j are swapped for introverts when converting between the systems. SLI = sensing logical introvert = SiTe = ISTJ.

IIRC something like 60% of ISTx relate to the wrong type in Socionics because Si is Se and Se is Te. So yeah it's all fucked.Why is Jung an INFJ?Link? I've only seen a video where he lists T, N, S, and F in that order.IMO it would be very presumptuous (and here I'm addressing most people, as it seems, not just you. Especially CelebrityTypes, they're full of shit ;) ) to type Jung as an Ni dom when he always referred to himself as an introverted thinking type. In fact his first version of typology, for which he used his own psyche as a "laboratory", included only introversion/thinking and its opposite, extroversion/feeling.

That he has strong Ni seems to be a given, but I've never seen a solid argument for it. However even if he does, most Jungian analysts believe the auxiliary is in the same attitude as the dominant, and Socionics posits the opposite of the auxiliary being especially strong. Myers believed that people usually balance via their auxiliary but said that un-balanced function stacks were atypical but existed.

TL;DR INTP, probably.\&gt; tfw Jung claimed to be an INFJ

\&gt; tfw subconscious and unconscious mean different things

Apart from that... it's okay. It gets worse as it goes on, such as when it says associative thinking is Ni, and not like... a fairly human thing.noBut symmetry is fun :c Aw, not this again, fuck this. Obviously everyone's gonna [hate on ESTJs](http://imgur.com/a/tg25f), cause they suck at typing and have confirmation bias flowing out of their ass. For them every [asshole authority figure](http://imgur.com/a/p02eV) is an ESTJ and every fun, likeable ESTJ is an ENFP or ENTP. I swear to god.ooh /r/mbti can we get a typing renaissance, that'd be cool

like the meme renaissance on me_irl but for typingInteresting video, if a bit sarcastic and aggressive in delivering its point, and basically completely opposed to the typing paradigm of this subreddit (present company included).

\#typingrenaissance2k16?One comment on his main point, which is that people know themselves better and others know them. According to psychoanalysis, people have a lot of unconscious stuff going on that they might not be able to see. However, type is a *psychology of consciousness* and your MBTI preferences reflect your conscious ego (which you *do* know the most about) and not your unconscious. So while in need of clarifying, his point is correct for all intents and purposes.Indirectly, but the reason someone would pick ex. T over F is because their conscious ego is aligned with thinking and their feeling is unconscious. You get what I mean, right?Finally decided on INFJ?No, he says very little about typing people except for an explanation of the official MBTI assessment. He also says nothing about how the conscious/unconscious plays in, that's something I added. It's all about whether typing or asserting someone's type is ethical (or even accurate).I guess if the typee has a broken grasp of MBTI?Well, in Jung's words, 

&gt; This book is the fruit of nearly twenty years' work in the domain of practical psychology. It grew gradually in my thoughts, taking shape from the countless impressions and experiences of a psychiatrist in the treatment of nervous illnesses, from intercourse with men and women of all social levels, from my personal dealings with friend and foe alike, and, finally, from a critique of my own psychological peculiarity.

So we could roughly say that Jung derived his typology from psychoanalysis, literature, and introspection. Whether it's "behaviour" or not could be argued but I figure that would really just be a semantic debate. I think what MBTV means by "behaviour" is very close to "stereotypes" or "stereotypical behaviour".

One thing I can say with certainty, though, is that the purpose is not to describe the output (#semantics). Myers spends a lot of time on the output (the "effects" of functions and attitudes on a person's disposition), but she considered this just a practical angle, and because the processes had already been fully defined by Jung; she doesn't do this to predict people and their behaviours, but to describe them and their psychological make-up.

Putting a pedestal as God's word is silly, but assuming you know better than a century of research and development is also silly. A lot of people here are at various stages of the Dunning-Kruger effect, unfortunately a lot of them have trouble getting down from the Peak of Mount Stupid.That's a good point. Video guy mentions how people can be too focused on, say, how they are at work, or under stress, etc. rather than their "natural" self.

So (according to vid) in that sense questioning or getting into the reasons for someone's choices is ok, but his big gripe is people asserting someone's type (without doubt or a thorough exploration), which certainly happens a lot here. He mentions that we've all done it, we've all been the troll under the bridge, which is certainly true. What do you think about his new perspective? Is it more ethical or correct? Enlightened?&gt; If he isn't trying to capture manifestations then he's trying to capture his imagination, and he clearly didn't consider his work fiction, he was trying to describe reality

That's the exact thing that makes Jung very scientifically controversial. He considered thoughts as facts; it is a fact that someone has such and such a thought or fantasy (imagination). Thoughts even have a physical reality, although we aren't advanced enough to grasp it yet. So while he considered himself a scientist, and "psychic facts" as empirical proof, it's not rigorous enough by modern standards.

But further than that, the functions aren't *real* things, really. It's a model, of course, but it's not so much trying to capture reality as it is trying to discover a practical and self-evident level of organization of human cognition.

&gt; The four functions are somewhat like the four points of the compass; they are just as arbitrary and just as indispensable. Nothing prevents our shifting the cardinal points as many degrees as we like in one direction or the other, or giving them different names. It is merely a question of convention and intelligibility.

&gt; But one thing I must confess: I would not for anything dispense with this compass on my psychological voyages of discovery.

That's the mistake people make when they ex. misinterpret Nardi's research and believe the brain correlates to "be" functions, when functions are actually abstract concepts.

&gt; If there are no principles that can be empirically proven then the only thing that's left for you is to interpret the theory as best as you can so that it corresponds to empirical observations.

The official MBTI is psychometrically valid. It exceeds the scientific standards for an inventory of this kind to be meaningful.not you too&gt; An object is equal to its underlying meaning.

I like this a lot, but this:

&gt; new perceptions are mapped onto existing concepts that shape one's own understanding of something, or the world itself.

just seems *so*, so vague. When people describe Ni as associative thinking/mapping associations or anything to that tune, it's like great, now anyone can relate to Ni. Do you mean anything more specific by that?I still can't tell if this is an over- or under-whelming representation of Ni. It's just connecting themes? Does that mean that when I extract themes and connections for an English essay, I'm using Ni? Is everyone?

Same with Ne. The only thing I can think of when people describing it as association is my ISTP friend going "lol x made me think of y", which he does often and it's a good chunk of his humour. ISTPs are supposed to have super weak Ne!See, what I think is that people are at a lack for what intuition really is and so tend to frame it as pretty standard human faculties, which is hella confusing. Recognizing patterns, themes, is pretty much a human thing. And our brains are *built* on associations.

This is how I understand it (/u/chadthecat):

Intuition is the perception of possibilities and hidden meanings, via the unconscious. Because the unconscious is full of acquired patterns and inherited instincts or "archetypes", it can add and read-into the objective situation, offering new possibilities and what-if scenarios.

Intuition considers the world unconsciously and ends up in conscious awareness as a perception, something that is a given. Every time you "just know" something, or can't figure out a problem until suddenly a solution appears to you, that's intuition in action.

When intuition is introverted, it's not so much focused on possibilities in the outside world as it is on unconscious images and ideas. It doesn't *assign* meaning so much as it *explores* a world of meaning that mirrors the real world. So I'm stealing "An object is equal to its underlying meaning," but I think the rest is lacking.kiersey is garbageyou fucking scared me man, I thought the socioborg had got you

(jk guys)TIL ESTPs are free from original sinI know I was just trying to talk the guy into a hole (to satisfy my big ego). I pretty much say this down belooooowwwWell I think it tends to confuse people who come to an MBTI sub. There's so much that's straight up incompatible with Jung and MBTI that there at least have to be disclaimers like "ok this is Socionics now I am bringing you strange foreign gifts from far off lands"Yeah ISFP is the one I'm least satisfied with. "Aesthetic Architect" is iffy but "Social Architect" is worse :/

The best option I see is stressing that "Architect" refers to like a metaphorical internal architecture, because that gives a sense of intricacy and depth (of aesthetics in this case), rather than designing things externally.Which am I?Social awareness (which isn't *quite* feeling) started becoming a thing around 14-15 years old, after a couple years of theatre. Since then I've felt things, sporadically. Rarely ends well.

Sensation popped in at around 17 when I finally took an interest in fitness and outdoors. I quite enjoy it now.

So my Sensation was dormant for a lot longer than my Feeling, which seems out of order, but again theatre was a great outlet for Ne-Fe and I did it for years. Now that relationships are part of the game Feeling is taking a huge shit and refuses to cooperate, Sensation is my new buddy.18.1 800 I have a penis btw I'm super cereal yo what about lithuania, my pplcoolio. My parents are Lithuanian but I'm born and raised in Canada.how do you mean?Hunh, I don't really remember how my peers were at that age but I'm sure I was a few steps behind.

As for fitness, I know a lot of people hate sports but I particularly hated anything physical until I... didn't? Meanwhile I live in a rural area and most kids were into it. (I still don't like sports except maybe ultimate frisbee lol)

But I've definitely become a fan of lifting. It's kind of addicting so I don't even have to worry about discipline. Do you think that might be an Si vs Se thing? because the focus is on inner sensations and alllolnopeI've been once but it was a while ago. I just got the impression of like... sullen neurotic gray people. I don't think I could pick a type for that lolTe focuses on applying thought and problem-solving to the outside world. SeTi involves a focus on logical thought (albeit subjective), and a perceptual focus on objective, immediate reality. So, both are geared towards practical or wordly problem-solving, however SeTi will have different motivations and will not have the discipline associated with Te.I might venture to speak for INTPs and say that I think absurdism is a better fit for usSince it's of particular interest to me, tell me how you came to that conclusion about Jung?Well that's odd because I've found him more insightful, consistent and applicable than any other source. Are we reading the same thing? No, functions are basic processes of consciousness. Where did you pick this up? First off if you pay attention to the chapters, these segments should be "Intuition (in the introverted attitude)" and "The Introverted Intuitive Type" respectively.

&gt; What are the elements of the unconscious?

Elements (thoughts, feelings, memories, emotions, archetypes) that are unconscious ie. not in your conscious awareness.

&gt; I think the idea of a collective unconsciousness is clearly one of the most questionable ideas that he proposes. Seems like a prop that he can use to sweep inconsistencies under the rug - it's like magic.

Believing that there is a "collective unconscious" is no more magical than believing that instincts exist. "Archetypes" are the psychological counterparts to instinctual behaviours.

&gt; I don't see any real meaning in this.

He's making an analogy of sense-perception to intuitive perception. He's saying both appear to us in our mind's eye, as a reflection of reality.

&gt; Nothing notable, just more intentionally convoluted writing.

He's laying down the groundwork of the whole theory. Ni suppresses the objective factor and makes the subjective factor the focal point.

&gt; There's a reason he doesn't use plain English.

Yeah probably because he writes in fricken German and this is a translation lol

&gt; A psychogenic attack of giddiness? Does this not sound intentionally vague to you? What is the intensity of sensation? Some of this is pure gibberish.

What's vague about it? Psychogenic attack of giddiness is a neurotic laugh-attack, he's using it as a example. And a walk in the meadow vs. skydiving probably differ in terms of sensory intensity, no?

&gt; All of this is useless information dressed up with an obnoxious vocabulary.

I don't know why you say this about that passage of any possible ones lol. Are you actively trying to not understand? In this case he's saying that Ni only relies on S in order to sense that something is there, then looks at the intuitive possibilities and ignores the sensory details.

&gt; I think we should be skeptical of people claiming 'general tendencies'.

It's a general tendency of people to eat meat. Am I wrong? Is the entire field of statistics a joke?

&gt; Tell me, what does this even mean? it's just a way to say that a person is shaped by their perception of the world.

It means the "crank" version of the introverted intuitive is one who hasn't developed a judgement function and is all perception.

&gt; Okay, so intuition has an intensity level now? Based on what measure? I do not think that the last part is anything more than some observations of people with no connection to the idea of intuition.

All of this is so straightforward! People who over-rely on N are incomprehensible. People who over-rely on alcohol are detrimental to their families.

&gt; So he claims that Ni types go 'beyond' the unconscious? All he has really said is that the Si type uses their senses and the Ni represses them, and he says this in the most convoluted fashion possible to make it seem like it's more complicated than it is.

&gt; Whereas introverted sensation is mainly confined to **the perception of particular innervation phenomena** *by way of the unconscious*, and does not go beyond them

**bold** = noun

*italics* = adjective

Ni does not go "beyond the unconscious", it goes beyond the innervation/sensation. It may be complicated but it necessarily clears up confusion about the difference between Si and Ni, since both are parsed by the unconscious.

&gt; This is just nonsense.

Ok?

&gt; I think this would fit in rather nicely into an astrology profile, don't you?

No? It refers to the specific instance when the Ni type goes beyond perception and develops a judging function.

&gt; There is one point where he mentions that the Ni type may become a complete enigma to his own immediate circle - I do not think this statement has any merit, and would again fit very nicely with an astrology profile. For anyone that considers themselves an Ni type, they are likely to go over this, pick out the bits that fit who they are and ignore the parts they do not agree with. You can see by the way Jung writes that he aims to make it this way: 'if you're not an artist, then... uh... you're an unappreciated genius! a wise simpleton!' -- it's actually hilarious.

So a general description of a heuristic category has to be correct and certain 100% of the time. Ok but that's asking a whoooole lot.Is what they're observing actually Ni? Or on the flip side, are you sure they're an ESTP?

&gt; If it was conscious processes and ability in those processes, it has much larger implications about how intelligent certain people are or how useful certain people can be.

Really? How so? Apart from the fact that "intelligence" doesn't necessarily exist, at least as a measurable thing.

&gt; Plus there's so much unconscious activity not at all linked to these functions that making these insane leaps of logic/ connections to stuff like how you dream being at all related to these functions.

Can you explain further?

&gt; The onslaught of cringe that comes from people who think they're special N doms because they think such weird stuff or do very specific "DAE" shit is my main motivation for holding this view too

My opinion on this is that common community-driven descriptions are garbage and often refer to common sense or basic human functioning (for example when people define it as forethought, or considering ideas, or making associations. The brain is *built* on associations!)Jung called this "intellectual intuition" or "intuitive-thinking" and it definitely contributes to the intuition function, however there is also "feeling-intuition" and an appeal to archetypes (instincts) involved, and perhaps even more.

As for the difference between Ne and Ni, I think a good rule of thumb is that Ne is focused on possibilities/potential while Ni is focused on meaning.&gt; To assert that the 'Ni type' is more deeply connected to the collective unconscious is completely unfounded, to assert that instincts exist without some kind of proof and reason is similarly perilous.

Well, it's founded on observation, as well as an analytic truth (true by definition), but if that's not enough for you that's your right as a massive skeptic. Similarly if you're saying instincts don't exist I guess that's your right, but they're commonly accepted as a fact. The proof is the same for instincts and archetypes; we don't know instincts exist except that animals display universal, unlearnt behaviours. We don't know archetypes exist except that humans (and animals?) display universal, unlearnt motifs.

&gt; I think that in itself is bullshit, it says nothing about Ni, try applying that to a person.

It says everything about Ni; it is again an analytic truth. I can apply it to people; some people don't prefer to entertain a bunch of possibilities, and instead prefer to zero in on their "inner vision", manifesting as a sense of profound certainty and disconnectedness from the world. For example Plato, who believed "reality" existed in the form of ideals, and earthly objects were just imperfect shadows of those "forms".

&gt; No joke, it has no substance without the statistics. I'm saying there is nothing in his writing. He might as well be saying there is a general tendency for the weather to be sunny - this is clearly not helpful.

Hey, that's a pretty helpful thing to know when I'm visiting the tropics (other people)! It's usually overcast where I live (me). These places (people) tend to be pretty different!

&gt; And this is code for? If you apply this to a real person, what is it actually saying or explaining?

"Crank: an eccentric person, especially one who is obsessed by a particular subject or theory". This kind of person is different from a Gandhi for example, who channels their vision into morality and people by developing Fe.

&gt; When someone is drunk, you know that there is ethanol interacting with their brain chemistry, they just drank, you can test it, see it - it is easy to reason and you know the effect in reality.

Ah, but it wasn't always this way! Before chemistry and neuroscience, the only way to tell a person was drunk was by their own word or by your subjective guesstimates. Even the amount they drank wasn't necessarily a tell because different people have different constitutions.

Type theory is still a theory and we're just beginning to acquire the tools to test it. If you buy into Nardi then we've already begun. But basically you're saying the techniques observation and analysis should never ever be trusted, there's too much bias.

&gt; How is this not different from simply saying that what you see with your eyes has an influence on your thoughts.

You're missing the point. He's saying what you see is not real, it's all in your head. Therefore intuition is plausible, because it's *just as much in your head* as your audio-visual etc. perceptions are. What can you do with this? You can make all sorts of inferences about the different ways in which people perceive things, and see if they make sense and hold up in the context of... "reality".Lol I find it kinda curious and quaint that each of us is trying to fit the other's definition into our own as a subset.

So you're saying that feelings are "calculated in"; I actually think your claim that intuition is a (logical) calculator is swayed by your T preference and is probably true of you, but a different type would really, genuinely feel or "feel-into" things subconsciously, and that would factor into their hunches.We're like an ouroboros, two snakes munching on each other into eternity.

Actually that's fair, I get it now lolYou cite the Big 5 as the be-all-end-all hard science but it's grounded in a single, completely theoretical hypothesis, namely the Lexical Hypothesis: "the Lexical hypothesis is generally defined by two postulates. The first states that those personality characteristics that are most important in peoples' lives will eventually become a part of their language. The second follows from the first, stating that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word." It's the same notion that Jung held in mind when he created his typology, which is why he used common terms like thinking and feeling.

WHAT?!? Something theoretical, derived from observation? UNSUPPORTABLE.&gt; This rounds back to me being convinced that you're ISFJ

hello darkness my old friend

apart from that I don't understand the point of your reply except that people misunderstand things? Which is like yeah?

&gt; It's just that people in the same quadrant are likely to understand the other perspectives very easily- on the conscious level.

there's a significant amount of people who fight tooth and nail with their "dual" so to speak. Just look at INFPs and ESTJs on reddit!Alain de Botton is big into psychoanalysis, but I think he's hesitant about Jung. I think they (the channel) said at one point that the more they read Jung, the more problems they had with making a video about him, although they never elaborated. A lot of Jung's ideas are commonplace in psychoanalysis, though, so his influence is probably felt.

I agree with Alain's type being ENFJ. I think it's especially interesting to see how the majority of his videos are upper-Fe problems.

Jung is an ITP thoNone of these really fit me but ISTP is closest.No riotous laughter? How the turn tables ;)I just found it funny af. Though I think the point is to make fun of *people* who use personality metrics (MBTI, astrological sign, whatever) to justify shitty behavior, not just an extroverted commentary on introverts. The narrator would probably actually be classified as an extrovert lol.

'"Well, if you’re such an introvert, why are you talking to a group of strangers in an elevator? This is a social interaction that you initiated and could have easily avoided.”'

"I actually do like parties. I find that the right amount of partying is to do so only on weekends or the funner weekdays (not Tuesday) or whenever I’m in the mood to party. "Kind of a nitpick I guess but Enantiodroma is not the union of opposites, but the idea that opposites turn into one another over time. The problem of opposites, or duality or what have you, is a very Eastern idea while Enantiodroma comes from Heraclitus.

On another note, Jung means something *very* specific when he applies Enantiodroma to his model, that CelebrityTypes completely butchers with their fuction axes articles... I don't know what source you're pulling from so I don't know what you mean by it but that's a point of interest anyhow.T blocks out F in general. Each function pair (and by this I mean T/F and S/N) experience a mutual blocking-out opposition. Introversion/Extroversion also experiences a polarity, which results in the dominant being a function + an attitude and the inferior being the opposite of both of these.

Jung's original 8 types consisted of, as above, a dominant function-attitude with its respective inferior. The other functions he said were generally in a less extreme middle-state, although there is some polarity in that as well. That the auxiliary takes the opposite attitude of the dominant was something Myers observed and decided to add to her model."Shadow functions" are a fallacy. There are four functions, not eight; each one's attitude is only a modifier, it doesn't make it a separate function.&gt; It just puts everyone to 16 boxes- which is bullshit because the cool part about typology is not the "oh here are the 16 types and look at these borders we just set up between us lolololol" aspect, but the whole understanding how groups of people think and how we can relate/ connect or how types that aren't you interact and why certain things begin to make sense-

You literally just said nothing

&gt; PLUS the rampant mistypings, holy shit. People take these test results as gospel, and the tests themselves (and the results) are fucked 99% of the god damn time.

Citation needed.

Personally I've seen a lot of instances where people have an almost irrational distaste for tests/indicators, and as a result they almost have a compulsion to retype other people or themselves. Anecdotally these retyped people usually undergo a period of confusion, before Occam's Razor comes to slap 'em around and they finally settle back on their test results (or closer to). I mean tests have typed me more accurately than you have so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯By what definition? Socionics describes the opposite of the dominant as being quite strong; while by the Jung/Myers definition the whole question is a fallacy.The common community descriptions are actually not particularly Jungian. In the original theory there is no room for "shadow functions" because of the way functions are defined; namely that there are four functions, not eight. Let me know if you want me to elaborate (also @ /u/mirrorconspiracies)

"Getting things done" is not necessarily a Te thing, so I'll use your other example, of an Si type without Se.

The thing is Se is not "sensing the outside world" and Si is not "inner sensations" or "referencing the past" or whatever else it's commonly seen as. Si can do both the former and the latter; so can Se. Everything necessary for all of those things is contained in the definition of "Sensation" as a single function. The i/e appended to it only designates whether it is *primarily* influenced and informed by the outer or inner world. Se and Si are not mutually exclusive.

So hopefully that explains why an 8 function model is redundant, very difficult to apply, and confusing (as exemplified by OP's confusion).

Some other stuff I've done:

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/49qsiv/a_short_analysis_of_four_function_and_eight/) is a slightly dated and overly technical article I made on the question.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/52hbun/intuition_a_better_fucking_explanation/) is a more comprehensive example of how the Xi/Xe dynamic works.

[These](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbtiarticles/comments/59jhvp/functions/) are my short-form functions descriptions, which I pulled almost entirely from Psychological Types.lol hard and fast rules are my lifeblood. #TilifeI think that a Ti type reading about Te is essentially the same as reading about any type other than your own. You can learn from all the types but it's not as useful in describing you since it's not your ordinary nature.

As I understand it, according to type theory the only reason you have unbalanced functions is because you need to specialize to overcome life's challenges. So I think you could balance them in theory but probably not in practice, since you'll always be using your dominant attitude more on a daily basis, if only because you need it to succeed.I like parties.Is there anything specific you're looking to clarify?

Anyway, for fun: MBTI in a nutshell

Two attitudes: Introversion and extroversion. "Inwardness" and "outwardness", defending vs. expanding.

Consciousness is divided into four functions. Roughly speaking, Sensation tells us that something is there, Thinking tells us what it is, Feeling tells us whether or not it is agreeable, and Intuition tells us the possibilities and meaning surrounding it (in a way that seems perceived and not deduced).

We have a natural disposition towards certain functions and attitudes. This makes up our "type". Usually we choose one or two functions as our primary way of dealing with the world; this becomes our dominant and auxiliary. The other functions are diametrically opposed to them, they run interference, so we subdue them and make them relatively unconscious. This is why (ex.) F can never be an auxiliary to T. They are too opposed. It becomes the inferior, while a compliant Perceiving function becomes the auxiliary.

The dominant takes on an attitude (ex. I) so its opposite, the inferior, takes on the other (E). The auxiliary takes that same secondary attitude (E) to balance out the conscious sphere, and its opposite, the tertiary, takes on the other (I).

J/P refers to the type's adaption to the outside world, whether it relates to it primarily through Judging (Te, Fe) or Perceiving (Se, Ne). In Extroverts it refers to the dominant function; in Introverts, to the counter-balancing auxiliary.If your feelings invade your thinking you're no longer being impartial or objective, you can't make sound logical decisions. If you start thinking about your feelings it discredits them and reduces their importance. So for one to be fully in charge it has to exclude the other one.

Same with Sensation and Intuition. If you're looking at the reality of what's in front of you, it won't do to get distracted by daydreaming. If you want to imagine the possibilities surrounding an object, reality is going to limit and detract from your exploration.By thinking I don't necessarily mean what we generally refer to as "thinking" or ruminating or associating, in this framework it's more about mechanical or technical thought. If you *are* dissecting your feelings and trying to turn them into something mechanical, perhaps in terms of biological processes, it really takes the meaning out of them. If you're thinking about what your feelings mean to you and to people, or wondering how to apply or express them, it's still feeling that's dominant and autonomous.

While logic and feelings may sometimes be compatible, other times they're not. When you have a logical conclusion that says one thing, and a feeling that says something else, you have a definite conflict, and that's where type steps in to pick a winner. For example "animal testing is necessary and ultimately spares more suffering than it causes," "but I just *feel* that it's wrong" or "I feel so sorry for those animals!" (Of course there are logical arguments to be made against animal testing but it's just one example of someone's potential thought process).

The virtue of being a feeler is pretty much that: virtue, humanity, emotion/sensuality, and having a natural sense of what is important (to you and to others).Yes, I think it's safe to say that Thinkers are less empathetic on average. It comes to them with more difficulty and scarcity.

I think "blindly following feelings" doesn't quite do it justice, as Feeling can be pretty advanced and differential, and has those advantages that Thinking doesn't (namely, not being sometimes cold and robotic).

Feelers can definitely think, however it's often the case that Feelers will use their thinking function only where Feeling permits it, ie. they'll only make logical conclusions that line up with their feelings, even so much that they're essentially feelings in disguise. Frankly this can make some F types (often INFx) to think of themselves as very logical, despite there being some things that they can't bring themselves to entertain.If that's the case, then it could point towards certain Feeling values. My favourite method of making sure is to just sit on it for a few weeks and try to observe your reactions and tendencies in everyday life, to gather evidence for and against.All robot characters are Ti doms #MemeBTIThis really depends on how you define conscious/unconscious, and in this framework where there's already a definition that's essential to the theory it's important to be specific I think.

You don't really think about using your dominant because it's *how* you think about things, it characterizes your conscious awareness. It's like meta-conscious.Spartans are super ESTJ. Highly disciplined, military society. Authoritarian. Hugely reliant on tradition. #MemesI would never betray my elementary school administrator either.I wrote this while I was an internet-deprived hermit in the hills. It's born out of lamentation for how misunderstood ISTJs are around here, my own close proximity with one, and some good ol' true-to-Jung concepts.

-----

**INTROVERTED SENSATION**

The first process of the ISTJ is Introverted Sensation. Her primary focus in life is on perceiving the world through the senses, in such a way that all her sensations contribute to a “life experience” and every new sensation is viewed through the lens of that same experience. The ISTJ doesn’t so much perceive actual reality as she does the internal images that the thing releases within her; her sense-perceptions are impressionistic rather than photo-realistic. She experiences sensations in a very idiosyncratic way. Because this process is passive, the ISTJ might not be aware of how her perceptions differ from reality.

I’d like to make a distinction between practical experience and the true sum of experience. Si is commonly described as referring to the past, but this gives the impression of an active and useful process. The ISTJ’s inner world actually creates images that can be totally useless, but fascinating and richly imaginative nonetheless, like something out of a Studio Ghibli film.

Because her sensations are viewed through the lens of these internal images, which represent both the past and the budding future of the ISTJ, her whole worldview has a sense of continuity. She has a distinct awareness of what things are like and what they might become, based on what they have been like up until now. Of her own character she is very sure, since she views herself with the same continuity, which can make for a very strong and grounded personality. In general, ISJs, more than any other type, "just are" their subjective experience.^1

Si shies away from engaging with the outside world by means of sensation. Instead, the ISTJ tries to maintain a kind of homeostasis. She is trying to “conquer” or “tame” the sensory world in a sense, which in practical terms means sticking to what’s comfortable and familiar. This is especially true for things and sensations to do with the body, such as choices in food and clothing.

**EXTROVERTED THINKING**

The ISTJ’s second supporting process is Extroverted Thinking. Thinking is a function that connects facts and ideas through the use of concepts, in order to get to an intellectual conclusion. It defines, organizes, and reasons logically in a mechanistic manner. The ISTJ’s thinking is extroverted, which means that thinking is her primary way of relating to the outside world, which in turn means that thinking is usually done in view of an external situation, obstacle or goal.

This kind of thinking, then, is first and foremost applicable. ETJs are remarkably capable of pursuing goals they set for themselves, as they are genuinely interested in what they can accomplish in the outside world. This is less pronounced for the ISTJ, as her Te is subordinated to Si. As it is her supporting process, the ISTJ uses Te to secure and realize the needs and wants of Si, which means working towards a life that is fulfilling in her own unique way.

Te is perfectly capable of all kinds of intellectual reasoning, but in the last resort its conclusions are always driven by the facts, as well as ideas and procedures that are externally given. The ISTJ wants to think in a way that might be considered “best” or “correct” by her peers or society at large and, as a result, herself.

**INTROVERTED FEELING**

Opposite Te is the ISTJ’s third process, Introverted Feeling. At base, the feeling function assigns value to something, in the sense of acceptation or rejection. It asks, “Do I like/dislike this thing?” Expanding on this idea results in a huge variety of possible feelings and moods (which are an evaluation of the current state of the individual rather than of a thing or occurrence).

Feelings have a tone of emotionality but they are not emotions. For instance, something may make us happy, and because of this we like it. The former phenomenon is emotion, the latter is the feeling function.

The ISTJ’s feelings are introverted, which means her feelings are, as much as possible, cut off from the influence of the outside world. They become feeling-principles instead of momentary feeling-tones, which roughly equates to having deeply held values that are resistant to change (In the mind of the introvert, people are continuous; the world is ever-changing). The expression of feelings is also stifled, since they shouldn’t be mixed with the outside world.

Because the ISTJ favours Te, Fi is relatively repressed. Values that disagree with the practical needs of Te are swept under the rug. The more Fi is repressed, the more it becomes childish, stubborn, and black-and-white. Repressed feelings may come back with a vengeance, possibly more destructive than they were originally intended to be.

**EXTROVERTED INTUITION**

The ISTJ’s final process is Extroverted Intuition, which is in opposition to Si. Whereas sensation observes what’s actually there, intuition always wants to perform guesswork and fill in the blanks. Intuition perceives via the person’s unconscious mind. Lots of unconscious thoughts, feelings, experiences, and ideas make inferences about a thing, the end result of which is a hunch that seems to appear out of nowhere.

Ne is always looking to make inferences about the outside world. I follows every “what if…” train of thought, and ends up perceiving a bunch of possibilities about the thing in question, which, due to the rough, unconscious nature of intuition, may be varied in their plausibility.

The ISTJ’s intuition is directly opposed to her primary process, Si. Many “what-ifs” may be rejected in favour of what can be directly perceived. The more Ne is repressed, the more it becomes detrimental to the ISTJ. The possibilities it perceives may become dark and apocalyptic, and they may thrust themselves into the ISTJ’s awareness unwanted. However, if Ne and Fi are allowed a little of breathing room, they can become a healthy compensation to the one-sidedness of the favoured functions.

^1 Thanks /u/akai_n, /u/ExplicitInformant, and /u/FuccFasBefore I forget, here's some stuff I picked up in the no-man's-land chapters of Psychological Types (ie everything except chapter X) and mulled over in my head for a bit.

-----

1. Attitude is a *function of relation*

That is, if we think of "functions" in the mathematical sense as modifiers that are given *x* input and produce *f(x)* or *y* output, then attaching an attitude to a function modifies it in some way. That might have been really unnecessary but w/e

It modifies it by giving it something to *relate* to, to draw from and interact with. So for example, I can say, "Ti uses thinking as a *means of relating* to one's inner world," and, "Fe uses Feeling as a *means of relating* to the outside world. I think this is a useful way of characterising functions, because it sort of serves to explain why (and describe how), say, feelings for Fi types are private and personal, but for Fe types they are meant to be shared. Likewise, thinking for Ti types is quiet and reflective, while for Te types it should be directed.

Jung writes that the introvert finds his identity in the constancy of his ego over time, and the extrovert finds his identity in the way he relates to the outside world.

-----

2. Introversion assimilates; extroversion dissimilates

What this means is that introversion is always trying to take the essential or relevant part of the object and absorb it, like a game of agar.io. Introversion is, "the abstracting attitude of consciousness, which in pursuit of its ideal makes an experience of every occurrence and from the sum of experience a law". We already tend include this in some of our function definitions, for example Ti using internal frameworks of logic and shit. Introversion synthesizes new info with what it already knows.

Extroversion, meanwhile, is in a sense giving itself up to the outside world (and you could say introversion gives itself up to the inner world/unconscious/"soul"). It tries to be on the same page as the outside world, instead of trying to one-up it. Unconscious stuff is forgotten in favour of what the extroverted function can grab hold of in the outside world.

-----

You might notice I only used judging functions as examples... I was thinking that might be because of my nature as a judging dom. I'm more out-of-touch with the perceiving functions. If any P doms can talk about how they might relate to these concepts or make similar principles for perceiving functions, that'd be neat.This little article is based off of my still new-ish understanding of Jung's schema of the psyche and how it relates to psychological type.

-----

**PROGRESSION**

Structures in the psyche (like functions) grow by assimilating or metabolising new experiences. In general, a new experience or challenge faces us with a choice of which route to take. In a new environment we can examine it directly or let our hunches take the wheel; when faced with a dilemma we can listen to our feelings or logical conclusions.

In each case we have a definite natural preference for one over the other; this is what constitutes our type. There may be instances where we go against our nature and choose to navigate a situation with the less-preferred function. This might be for a variety of reasons, most commonly external pressures. A common example is a T girl in an F's world, having to either abandon analytic thought, or alternatively fabricate a feeler-mask in order to preserve the T preference. This tends to fuck shit up in the personality, putting stress on the individual, like a Ye Olde lefty child being forced to use their right hand in school.

In an abstract sense, "offering" a new experience to one function or another injects it with brand new energy, increasing its sum total. In real-er terms, it is now affiliated with more knowledge and experience, and holds more of our vitality and attention. In concise terms, this matures the function.

IDEA: Functions are only opposed insofar as they are actually opposed in a case-by-case basis. More on this later.

**THE QUESTION OF DEVELOPMENT**

The question, "How do I develop my functions?" is often asked in the community, usually to little response. I get the impression that some people believe that they can just decide to shift their focus to another function, while their day still consists of just browsing reddit. There may be a little variety in /r/showerthoughts, but chances are they're still metabolizing it in the same manner as they ever have.

I think that effectively growing a function requires a good outlet, something to force you to focus your attention in a certain way. An environment that makes your preferred function irrelevant or obsolete is ideal. A personal example of this is my experience in theatre, as a Ti dom. When trying to entertain an audience, there is nothing illogical about engaging in feelings, even swimming in them gratuitously. Thought is more or less irrelevant; intellect is less efficient than empathy when it comes to playing with people's emotional reactions. Another example might be Ni doms benefiting greatly from athletics and sports, or anything that really forces you to pay attention to your surroundings.

How is this different from the harmful forced-development from the second paragraph? When you engage in activities where your dominant is not an option, you are leaving your comfort zone but not having to fight your nature. When you look for new experiences rather than trying to relive old ones in new ways, you are adding energy rather than transferring it; there is a net gain of energy in the psyche.

**TL;DR:** Get out and try new stuff. Try the right new stuff.Descriptions of Extraverted Intuition often involve the word "abstract". It, and its users, are characterized as being interested in abstract connections and associations, and anything physical in nature is immediately a sensory thing. I believe the abstract, purely mental aspect is an element of Ne but by no means the whole picture, although it is often understood as such. This misunderstanding (in my opinion) of the theory can often be the cause of typing troubles, so hopefully you understand and agree with my clarifications.

I like to build things from the ground up, so I'll start with a brief definition of Intuition. Intuition is a way of perceiving that is mostly or in part unconscious, in that it presents us with conclusions (hunches) that were for sure created by us, but without any conscious knowledge of the process that got us there. Our unconscious "fills in the blanks" of reality and adds information where only some exists. In this way, intuition is the perception of things that *might* be; possibilities.

Now, something that is "abstract" is defined as something that exists in the mind but not in concrete reality, which may seem to be the case, except that Extroverted Intuition is all about things that, again, *might* be true in the real, concrete, external world. The more Ne is favoured by the individual, the more they are inexorably drawn to anything that is new or that offers plentiful possibilities for novel occurrences and experiences.

In my experience, this manifests differently in different Ne users. I'll use a variety of ENPs I know as examples. The common kind here on reddit, I think, is the nerdy STEM-obsessed ENTP who is probably deserving of the term "abstract", since he's rarely found out of doors doing "sensor stuff". However, another ENTP has much more varied interests, like human philosophy, chamber music, and (gasp!) sports. A lot of sports. "Too much on her plate", as her mother says. An ENFP is even more extreme in the physical respect; at first glance she seems a total Se dom, but with a closer look it's apparent that the novelty, not the sensation, is the driving force of her adventures.

In conclusion, Ne is not inherently abstract, as there's always a MATHS% chance that what it perceives *does* exist in concrete reality, and that's the aim anyway. Ne users can and do function outside of the realm of abstract ideas. Instead they are driven to seek out everything novel and uncertain for its own sake, whether it be philosophy or sky-diving.

To close off, here's some Jung that may or may not explain my point some more. It's about how an Extroverted Intuitive type can be so based on "sensations" that they might be confused with a sensation type.

&gt; ... if I ask an intuitive how he orients himself, he will speak of things that are almost indistinguishable from sense-impressions. Very often he will even use the word "sensation." He does have sensations, of course, but he is not guided by them as such; he uses them merely as starting-points for his perception. He selects them by unconscious predilection. It is not the strongest sensation, in the physiological sense, that is accorded the chief value, but any sensation whatsoever whose value is enhances by the intuitive's unconscious attitude. In this way it may eventually come to acquire the chief value, and to his conscious mind it appears to be pure sensation. But actually it is not so.Ok, I have a budding theory about MBTI and the instinctual variants of the enneagram that seems to be holding up within my small sample size, but I'd like more data. So, my questions are these:

1. What is your MBTI type?

2. What is your instinctual subtype?

3. What do you know about your "lower two" functions? (Look on the sidebar if you don't know what these are. For example, "INTP Ti Ne **Si Fe**). How do you relate to them? What is your experience with them? How has your relation to them changed over time?

thx famRhetorical question. This is an article.

One big misconception is that emotions are the domain of the feeling function. Because of this you get confusion around Thinkers thinking they're Feelers because they have emotions, or alternatively believing they don't "because they're Thinkers", along with other shit. Really *feelings* are things like love, regret, guilt, etc; things that can be broken down to a subjective judgement of "like" or "dislike". *Emotions* have been reduced down to 6 or 7 basic ones in the literature. They include happiness, anger, sadness etc. and you'll find they are not necessarily conveying a judgement (except maybe for "disgust").

Feelings can be linked indirectly to emotions. We can like something because it makes us happy; we can dislike it because it makes us angry. However the two remain fundamentally different and Feelers are not necessarily "more emotional" than Thinkers.

My thesis here is that **MBTI is a sterile typology**. On its own, it has nothing to do with emotion. It instead describes cognitive peculiarities and the structure of the psyche. You could hypothesize that the cognitive functions originate in the cerebrum, the part of the brain responsible for consciousness, while emotions originate in the limbic system, the deeper, more ancient part of the brain.

An example of an emotional typology, on the other hand, is the Enneagram. This is clear, as the different triads of the Enneagram correspond to different emotions: shame, fear and anger. This is why Enneagram and MBTI mesh well together, they do not step on each other's toes.

Going further, how do the two relate? I think the MBTI is the more "innate" typology while Enneagram is more developmental. Enneagram develops out of MBTI. Put in a different way, Enneatype is the "neurosis" while MBTI type dictates the "choice of neurosis". This is why two people raised in an identical environment will react in a different emotional manner. A go-getting Te or Se type is more likely to develop an emotional complex around being tread on or hindered (8) while a externally-influenced Fe type will likely develop a complex around appreciation from others (2).

What do y'all think? any q's?"Goes from the one to the many / The many to the one". "Ideas." "*~Connections~*." What the fuck does that even mean?? I'm going to offer a new definition of intuition that has been around for a century. My understanding of intuition is overwhelmingly Jung-based and ties into the rest of his model of the psyche, as I think it should.

-----

Intuition is defined by Jung as "perception by means of the unconscious". So, to understand this we first have to understand the unconscious, for which I've put together [a fun diagram](http://i.imgur.com/OydAbjI.png). As we can see, the unconscious is full of thoughts, feelings, experiences, and processes, as well as the "archetypes" that reside deeper still. All these contribute in synthesizing "intuitions" or "hunches", which are not evident in reality but are the result of your unconscious "filling in the blanks". That's all! A "hunch" as it's known colloquially is enough to define intuition, no fancy mumbo-jumbo about trendlines (thx Micheal Pierce) and data points (Se is not integral to Ni you troglodyte) and ~connections~ (stop) required.

The difference between Ne and Ni is summed up neatly by Jung:

&gt; Introverted and extraverted intuitives may be distinguished according to whether intuition is directed inwards, to the inner vision, outwards, to action and achievement.

To the extent that intuition is extroverted, it gets hunches about the outside world and synthesizes many possibilities via these unconscious processes. To the extent that it is introverted, it foregoes the outside world to dig deeper into the depths of the unconscious. Moreover intuition (as with any function) can be *a little* extroverted, or *extremely* extroverted, just as it can be a little or very introverted. 

Picture it this way:

-----

[**An extreme case of Ne**](http://i.imgur.com/awZwwf2.png) would be the intuitive who jumps ravenously from one possibility to the next, each one lacking in depth and relevance. The most extroverted intuition is scattered and shallow.

[**A balanced case of Ne**](http://i.imgur.com/AFihDQD.png) would dig deeper into the unconscious, while still prioritizing the external potential. More of the intuitive's subject actually bleeds out into the object.

&gt; The stronger his intuition, the more his ego becomes fused with all the possibilities he envisions. He brings his vision to life, he presents it convincingly and with a dramatic fire, he embodies it, so to speak.

To offer Ni's counter-examples, **an extreme case of Ni** would be all inner and no outer. It would observe the unconscious processes for their own sake. It would dig deeper and deeper, eventually hitting on the archetypes of the collective unconscious themselves. The extreme Ni will be so engrossed by these images and patterns that it will tell the outside world to fuck off. This person is basically a nutjob.

&gt; In abnormal cases intuition is in large measure fused together with the contents of the *collective unconscious* and determined by them, and this may make the intuitive type appear extremely irrational and beyond comprehension.

**A balanced case of Ni** would still be drawn to these deeper parts of the mind, and find many useful patterns and themes therein. However, it would still apply its hunches to the outside world, and not be totally removed from it.

-----

**TL;DR**: Intuition is hunches created by the unconscious. It focuses more on either external possibilities or the "inner vision". It can be extremely extroverted/introverted or more balanced between the two.I'm here for a month, what up? Anyone up for a meet-up? Don't kill meYo I just thought up a neat naming scheme for types I'd like to share. Basically it gives a name to each AxxB and xABx group and recombines them.

-----

ExxP: Explorer. Definitely the most straightforward one. Dominant Pe is characterized by constantly seeking new horizons and experiences.

ExxJ: Executive. Usually attributed to Te and ETJs but it can also apply to EFJs, not as much in the classic corporate sense but in terms of its etymology; to "carry out" judgements externally.

IxxP: Architect. This one is also usually given to Ti and INTPs, but I think all Ji doms are guided by their carefully constructed inner understanding of the world, an "architecture" made of either thoughts or feelings.

IxxJ: Anthropologist. Man this one is so fucking hard to characterize. In the end I wanted to relate Pi's connection to personal history, as well as culture in the form of the collective unconscious. Here "anthropologist" doesn't refer to the type's typical interests, but as a study of the Pi doms themselves, who (more than other types) view the world through the lens of their own humanity.

-----

xSTx: Pragmatist. Easy, really. The embodiment of practical thinking.

xNTx: Speculator. Also easy. In contrast to ST pragmatism, it thinks about what could be rather than what is.

xNFx: Romantic. Here the word is supposed to evoke a variety of definitions; "marked by the imaginative or emotional appeal of what is heroic, adventurous, remote, mysterious, or idealized", as well as "impractical in conception or plan" displaying its antithetical relationship with ST. Another option would be "Idealist".

xSFx: Aesthete. A trickier one, but I think the term, which mean "a person who has or affects to have a special appreciation of art and beauty", captures the sensing-feeling combo in a satisfactory way. Another option might be "Socialite", but I find this one is less universally applicable to the SFs.

-----

In combination:

ESTP - Pragmatic Explorer;
ENTP - Speculative Explorer;
ESFP - Aesthetic Explorer;
ENFP - Romantic Explorer;

ISTP - Pragmatic Architect;
INTP - Speculative Architect;
ISFP - Aesthetic Architect;
INFP - Romantic Architect;

ESTJ - Pragmatic Executive;

ESFJ - Aesthetic Executive;
ENFJ - Romantic Executive;

ISTJ - Pragmatic Anthropologist;
INTJ - Speculative Anthropologist;
ISFJ - Aesthetic Anthropologist;
INFJ - Romantic Anthropologist;

Thoughts? Additions, corrections? u like?
Stereotypically, those groups have similar temperaments to each other. It's probably because F/T show the most distinction in Ns and Se/Si for the Ss. You can group it however you like. It's a way to relate to different types. I've seen some confident ESFJs. They're apprehensive towards strangers just like the rest of us. It's easy to say you'd be confident as a non-Fe user, but if what you said were true that they're insecure, I'm sure you'd be too. I'm pretty sure Bill is an ESFP. I thought this was convincing. Then I watched interviews of him. Nothing like an ESFP. I've met plenty of ESFPs, and considering I am one, I can't say that he resembles one at all. Cognitive functions. I'm not new to this. Have to disagree. Compared to other ESFPs, he's just not the same. Not even close. No authenticity, no warmth, and no Fi. 

Trump:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX06X1RNWt4

Bill:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d90GsmWL8jY

Just look at the contrast. Bill's brandishing his Te the whole time he's talking about the details. Trump talks in a manner that makes it sound like what he says could be true. It's a logical train of thought but lacks concreteness.

Give this a read if you haven't (Te vs Ti): https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4p8wij/te_is_empirical_ti_is_logical/

 And Bill is definitely not ESFJ. Perceiver for sure, quick on his feet.

Edit: "Low information, kinda shallow. That's what you expect in a type with thinking and intuition on the bottom of the stack." Nice to have your intuitive bias check in. I imagined it more as a cultural divide more than the types of people. The values of each region would be different, and different people exist within just like the real world works. Do these cards have the IQ from the shady website? I feel like that would be a good circlejerk for the sub.Interesting descriptions. I've never heard Si described liked that, but I can see how that's manifested that way.
