ENTP, unless it's someone I'm close to or I have to (doctors, work, etc.), I don't call people (parents, my cousin/uncle who are like brothers as the three of us are all only children and close in age, or very close friends or my current SO). I VASTLY prefer texting. I'm turning 29 this year, so I spent the first half of my life without texting even existing so it's not like I don't know a life without texting. I do remember when I hated having to use the phone, unless it was to stay up for hours until 4am talking to my childhood best friend. 

Texting was a godsend for me. I'm a writer both by trade (well, I do a lot of writing in my job in marketing) as well as in my personal time, so I communicate much easier in words. The only thing I've noticed is that a lot of my friends/family joke that my text messages are often mini-novels and how odd it is that my texts are always grammatically correct and you'd never catch me text in lowercase (even in high school, before iPhones when texting was done with that old T9 predictive text).

I absolutely hate video chat, I only use it if the other person absolutely insists. I'd probably like it more if I had family/friends more than a few hours away.ENTP, but relate way more to the INTP description- I'm too apathetic on the subject to troll about it.

Nailed my best friend who's an textbook INTJ!Fellow ENTP with a very similar experience, a core group of about a half dozen, of which we had some intermingling as well as separate friend groups, especially when we were older enough and got our first jobs and made new friends that way. 

I wasn't like super popular but I was friends with a lot of different groups and dated two guys seriously (as much as one can be at that age) while in high school, of whom were both funny, intelligent and attractive guys. One was a writer, one was a musician, and they both make money doing their respective thing these days.

I was a naturally good student so I did very well in advanced courses, even as I became more and more of a stoner every year. I won a cash award through the school my senior year for my writing portfolio, of which the material was written during my early foray into heavy drugs, haha. (This lackadaisical attitude does not work nearly as well in university).  I think this sounds like a fairly common INTJ/ENTP dynamic. My best friend, an INTJ, is extremely risk-averse, while I'm much more spontaneous with "the answer is, don't think about it" as my response to his doom-and-gloom.ENTP, depends when/why I'm drinking the coffee. If it's a fresh cup from Timmy's on my way to work while I'm waking up, it's glorious. If it's my fifth cup on a weekend after a night of booze and coke, it starts feeling gross. Like any drug, set and setting seem to contribute greatly to how you'll react with coffee.

My drug of choice is marijuana, both medicinally and recreationally, but I also enjoy wine and coke on weekends when the budget allows for it. Once in awhile I'll cleanse the doors of perception with psychedelics, but that's more infrequent as I age. I have a lot of respect for xNTJs. They have the perseverance and dedication to implement the innovative ideas I come up with. I really like working with them as a team, whether that's in a professional context on a project or as an intimate partner, with whom I can communicate issues with more effectively than I can with other types. ENTP, Canadian, so not directly involved, but obviously aware of the various political/social situations in American (and Britain for that matter).

Not much to say opinion-wise, seeing how this all plays out. Thinking of how people in similarly tumultuous times in history (Civil War, civil rights movement of the 60's) experienced what they did. 

I did my degree in history/philosophy before getting a business degree so my mind often frames things in that context. I think about how current events will be portrayed in textbooks fifty years from now. ENTP, Rick Sanchez. We're both far too smart for our own good, hate rules and bureaucracy and dull our emotional pain with substance abuse. We love our families but don't show it very well. Also have the tendency to fall off the grid randomly.  I'd say it's a pretty accurate (obviously lighthearted) stereotypical assessment of myself (ENTP) and my immediate family (no siblings, mom's an ESFP and dad's an ISTJ).I don't know, but I feel that it's established early on. I remember the first MBTI tests I took as a young child (around 8-10 years old) I consistently tested as ENTP.

In my teens and early twenties, I fluctuated between typing as an INTP and ENTP. I think, in retrospect, that was just some undeveloped ENTP functions misrepresenting as introversion. 

I don't always like my type or its functions (I feel I would be much more accomplished if I was an ENTJ) but I know how to navigate them. Not the person you replied to, but I think Rick is pretty much the embodiment of an ENTP without the limitations of reality. I feel like ENTPs would be higher on the list, if only we had an INTJ or INFJ companion to actually carry out our crazy and sometimes devious schemes. Otherwise, our evil ideas would just remain sociopathic essays in our notebooks.As an ENTP, I came to this thread considering we'd be at the top. 

We're not sociopathic, really. Just capable of justifying the morality of everything we do ;)1. Liz Lemon from 30 Rock
2. Leslie Knope from Parks and Rec
3. Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty1. I haven't met too many drugs I don't like, but weed is always my first choice. Benzos would be a close second (I have prescriptions for Ativan and Klonopin). I'd like coke a hell of a lot more if I had the money to use it more often. Opiates and Adderall are great too, but not prescribed very freely anymore here. Psychedelics were eye-opening (many LSD/mushroom trips) but haven't gone back to them in years. Will smoke a cigarette on the odd occasion like being super drunk at a party. Never tried any really hard drugs like meth or heroin. 

2. I smoke weed every day, both for recreation and medicinal (I have epilepsy and should take the steps to get my medical card, it's not terribly hard to get in Canada and marijuana has shown to have a lot of benefit for epileptics). I drink wine once every week or two, coke when the mood and budget calls for it. Benzos "technically" twice daily but I've been known to indulge more than that.

3. ENTP. Probably not surprising. 

4. For how much I love drugs, I don't really have an addictive personality. While I smoke pot daily, I rarely smoke earlier than 7-8pm. Eating bores me and I do it out of necessity. Never found cigarettes appealing, even with growing up with parents that both smoked in the house. Benzos are the hardest to be mindful of not falling into a trap of addiction. I love being an ENTP but am fortunate my best friend and favorite family member are INTJs which are the perfect balance to my less healthy ENTP tendencies. 

That said, I'd like to be an INTJ or ENFJ. Mine shouldn't be considered a role model to anyone but rather a cautionary tale- but I can't help but love him: Rick Sanchez &lt;3

(which should make my MBTI type pretty obvious)I think 'The Seeker' by the Who is more appropriate for an ENTP than an INTJ. 

ENTPs seem to embody the essence of the song more (released in the height of the psychedelic rock phase, curious enough to search everywhere, someone who realizes goals are all just leading up until whatever happens when they die, etc.)

In particular, the INTJs I know are much more logic and result-oriented and none of them have dabbled in psychedelics (the lyric, "I asked Bobby Dylan, I asked the Beatles, I asked Timothy Leary, but he couldn't help me either" is a pretty obvious LSD reference)I associate ENTPs to be curious and inquisitive, leading them to engage in the infamous ENTP debates. I picture them being the type to change big life circumstances on a whim with the stereotype of ENTPs being great idea generators but weak deciders.

In real life, I don't find a lot of ENTPs- and I think a lot of them have mistyped as an INTP, as from what I've observed, ENTPs are probably the most introverted of the extrovert types. Myself, at least, I don't enjoy playing devil's advocate (and really don't understand the appeal in debating unless you're a politician). I'm heavily leaning towards ENTP but as another posted said, ENFP is certainly a possibility as well.INTJs for sure, they complement my ENTP weakness and vice versa. For me, they're the relationships where both people make each other better people. A few examples:


-I have five writing projects on the go at different stages of completion. Same goes for books.

-I have degrees in history/philosophy and marketing

-In ten years, I've lived in ten different apartments. Since splitting up with my ex, I'm getting more grounded (at my current place for just under a year now and have signed another one year lease- stability!)

-I am very much a 'jack of all trades, master of none' (the only thing I could consider myself to be a 'master' in would be writing) and love trivia and shows like Jeopardy (I've taken the online test the last several years, aside from the brief period Canadians were ineligible)Conan O'BrienMark CubanI love his style of humor. I would type him ENTP as well but wasn't sure if I was biased, being an ENTP myself.The Sage

Which is interesting, as I haven't seen any other Exxx types of this archetype in this thread.I find other NT types sometimes appear to be haphazard in what they do, but from their perspective, it's not usually spontaneous or "just because" at all. We tend to do a lot of planning silently and alone, only making plans known at the last minute. Which, to an outsider, would seem spontaneous.

As for geuinely spotaneous types, SP types seem most prone to it.  ENTP, only childFrom my own experience (having a double major in history and philosophy), ENTPs love philosophy and INTJs like making the ENTP's ideas practical. I think this list is representative of that.If I'm manic, I'm creative and writing and amazed at the beauty of life. 

If I'm depressed, I have no motivation to do much of anything. He sure sounds like an ENTP to me. The curiousity but resistance to structure aren't typical ENTJ traits. ENTPs tend to be on the more introverted side of Exxx types which may explain the initial mistype
You sound a lot like me at your age. I will say it's really hard to type anyone that young, because we change so much in our teens and early twenties. Don't get too attached to a career choice at 14 years old. Doing well in high school is, not to sound like an elitist, is very very easy with minimal effort. College is where you can start narrowing down your goals.

You sound more ENTP but I might be biased because I wrote with the same passion and confidence when I was your age. Don't hold on too tight to anything- I just turned 30 and I still don't know what I want to do. No rush. College is where you hit a wall with that approach to learning, is all I'm trying to say, especially in a medical field. My friends who worked hard for Bs in high school and applied that work ethic in college are now professionals. While my brilliant but procrastinating ass was writing short stories and getting high found college a huge shock. The amount of work that used to earn me mid 90s were now low 70s.

Not trying to be condescending, you just sound a lot like myself at your age and I have a lot of regrets regarding how I went about my education.Us ENTPs are a weird bunch. I think, along with ENFPs, we are the most introverted-extroverts. And yes, our Ne-dom with Fe makes us a more feeling type than our fellow Ts.

However, in my experience anyway, it also makes us more...flaky than T-types. Most of my close friends are INTJs that give my crazy ideas some structure and practicality.Oh :( I'm an ENTP who enjoys talking politics with my ISTJ dad or my INTJ friends/ex boyfriends. I enjoy IxTJ types, you guys can show me the impracticalities in my crazy ideas. The types keep my Ne weirdness in check and I respect that.I have found the INTJs/INTPs I've been friends with or dated are intelligent people. I think me and my fellow ENTPs are in a similar intelligence range but aren't as studious and therefore aren't as overachieving.

A lot of ISTJs I've known are obsessive compulsive.Rick Sanchez: (unhealthy) ENTP

Ben Wyatt: INTJ

Robert California: ESTJ

Eleanor Shellstrop (The Good Place): ExFP
Liz Lemon.Agreed, that's how I had her typed out in my head. She's definitely not ENTP but somehow extremely relateble. Although, the more I read about function stacks, I'm starting to think I'm ENFP despite over a decade of testing as ENTP.ENTP, navy blue or plum purple.Well, any family with 3-5 kids sounds like a nightmare to me, an only child who is 30 without children. 

But as an ENTP, I think we have the skills to communicate with a lot of different types, because we tend to have so many varied interests. Also, we're often considered the "introverted extroverts" of MBTI so an introverted sensor child (singular!) would probably be fine. I would try and teach them discipline and structure as best as I could, which would be a challenge because, while I think an ISxx would benefit from learning those things, they are a struggle for my ENTP self :)

My dad is likely ISTJ and my mom I suspect is ESFJ and while I'm close with both of them, my dad and I definitely share a lot more of the same views and values than I do with my mom.Yes, I definitely have some stereotypical ENTP tendencies (coming up with a bunch of cool ideas with no follow through) but deviate from my stereotypical type in other ways (definitely not a trolling type, I'm usually the one trying to see both sides of a situation) MBTI is a framework, not a diagnosis.I often say MBTI is a framework, not a diagnosis. It can help make sense of thought processes but I'd never use it as a guide on how to behave. For example, I'm a pretty diplomatic person, so I'm not going to turn into a meme lord troll just because "OMG ENTP!!!!" I started giving myself credit for my debate skills after my few conservative friends have vocalized they won't even bother trying (the two main comments being, "debating with you is like Superman up against kryptonite" and "you're like Ben Shapiro, if he was a liberal")

Haven't seen any videos of "AlexKTuesday DESTROYS Racist Homophobe" yet, so I'm no liberal Ben Shapiro (and I don't have a husband who is a doctor) ;)He's interesting. Politically, I disagree with him on most issues, but I find him sharp and a very skilled debater (wasn't surprised when I learned he graduated from Harvard Law at 23 years old). I enjoy following him much more than people espousing Trump's brand of conservatism (or Trump himself, I can see why Shapiro only supports Trump when they agree on an issue while not caring for Trump as a person)

I'm pretty sure Shapiro would find my viewpoints abhorrent- I'm Canadian so I probably lean more left than an American liberal just by merit of that (even my most conservative friends and family don't want to abolish our health care system, for example) but I've seen clips of him answering questions during his talks and he only starts talking circles around people when they're shaming him or trying to "gotcha" him. I feel like a conversation/debate with him where you're genuinely wanting to discuss issues would be a positive experience.The ENTP description is perfectly accurate to my high school experience.In my experience with IxTJ's, it's because we know if anyone can figure a way to make our crazy plans work, it's you guys. And if they're impossible, you'll say so and we can move on to the next ridiculous idea.I can't say I've actually met any INTJ women, but almost all the men I've been attracted to/dated were INTJs. There's a shared interest in the abstract and both tend to be fond of learning, and the ENTP's tendency to think of a hundred ideas and follow through with none of them is complimented by the INTJ's ability to pick out the innovative and realistic ideas and come up with a plan to actually see them through.Hahaha the ENTP one is spot on!ESTJsENTP, my appearance is important because it's part of the social engineering I use to get by in this world ethically while I struggle financially.

That is to say, I've noticed that society generally treats me better and is more likely to help me or offer favors when I wear makeup. I don't wear makeup all the time, probably 2-4 times/week, but I certainly notice I benefit from others when I make the extra effort. That being said, I have noticed that even without makeup, I am treated well because I fit the generic mold of a generally attractive, tall and thin woman who looks 5-7 years younger than my age and doesn't looks lot different without makeup as long as I'm dressed nicely (business casual is my usual)

This is appearance only and does not extend to my interactions with people, other than being polite and a very effective communicator. I don't use tactics like flirting (unless it's the once or twice a year a guy actually catches my eye) and simply rely on my passion and interest on many topics coupled with my appearance and congenital approach to people to foster those important connections.I'm a female, but ENTP is accurate enough. As far as rom-com tropes go, I'd probably fit into "asshole with a heart of gold" which does tend to be used with male characters more often.Yes. The Vindicators episode showed a lot of these traits on display.ENTP that is (now) extremely diplomatic in how I communicate with people.

Just because you can verbally crush someone doesn't mean you should.This is why I think me in full devious ENTP mode could conquer the world with an equally devious INTJ. 

We can be socially charming (I find this especially true as an ENTP woman, social engineering is really a thing) and like said, have ridiculous but clever ideas. INTJs aren't as social but far more practical and can actually implement the clever ideas that can work and throw out the stupid ones. 

So we act as the face of the scheme basically and they do the nitty gritty work. Now that I write this, I wonder if Steve Jobs was an unhealthy ENTP and Wozniak was a healthy INTJ....I love INTJs and I think they're my ideal MBTI partner. I wonder if it's a hard one to find for me because INTJs are uncommon and I personally don't know any other female ENTPs. Best guy I dated was an INTJ- except he was (and still is) afraid of commitment and has some serious PTSD issues from his messed up teenage years. We are both total nerds, with some overlap but differences- he's a computer prodigy and I'm a writer/academic type. He had the coolest vintage stuff, like 80s era Macs, and built me a computer for my birthday. He introduced me to Doctor Who and Rick and Morty and I introduced him to getting high (the one time that went south was actually a rare emotionally bonding experience keeping him calm after smoking way too much)

Damn, I miss that guy, we still talk but when I am only interested in a serious relationship, it's never going to work unless he decides he doesn't want to be alone and try actually dating someone. We're both 32 so I'm not holding my breath.Accurate, that's why an ENTP/INTJ couple with the right ambitions can be very powerful.Wow the ENTP/INTJ  is dead on for me and a guy I dated a few years ago, even the basic physical featuresThis ENTP girl finds INTJ guys to be by far the best boyfriends/potential husbands/business partners. I have the stereotypical ENTP passion and creativity who regularly goes down Wikipdeia rabbit holes for hours and has a hundred ideas for a business or project. The INTJ guys have the love of logic and knowledge with the discipline and work ethic to reign in the ENTP and narrow down their hundred ideas to the few that are actually plausible and lucrative, as well as the follow through needed to see the ideas to fruition.It's basically the perfect situation for ENTPs- we're one of the less extroverted E types, so being at home with hundreds of books and art supplies means I can spend my days doing little projects or finally tackling Ulysses (not that I have yet, but I could) while watching the vast amount of misinformation and having the time to try to inform while lightly trolling.I think most of us hate binary politics in general and find the people on the extreme left and right ends of the political spectrum equally annoying. I know I hate when either side goes into their scripted spew, but when charisma is at full, I can find common ground with even the crazy right wing Deep State, NWO people (there's been a guy on my Facebook that's been getting into random arguments with my friends on innocuous posts of mine and both him and the people he's been attacking have said they respect my objective mediation)I like that these are all basically descriptions of extremely healthy examples of each type, rather than the usual negative ones.

At our best, we love to debate, not to troll but to generate genuinely interesting and beneficial conversation. For what it's worth, my closet friend ever is (now) a mostly healthy INFJ and we compliment each other greatly.Healthy ENTPs make great politicians and lawyers because they have a lot of the same skills as ENTJs but the charisma and authenticity to actually enjoy their jobs and not do it for wealth or status.
Pewdiepie is probably ENFP or INFPMom: ESFJ

Yeah, I'm fucked.well, at some point it doesn't really make any difference if it's fake or real, innitwe've met the same INFJ?/r/changemyview - ENTP, duhNice. I sometimes think about what makes ISTJs tick and you gave me some insight. That can be useful in getting along with ISTJs I personally know (we have some mild issues with communication). Thanks!I agree with most of these points, except the one about arguing. I AM still tempted to do this at times, but I kinda learned over time, that some things are just not worth the debate. Dat Fe or what.&gt; ESTJ-ENTP

That's some bullshit right thereKylo Ren.I'd say a whiny, sensitive and kinda lost teen.a stereotypical Pole. Emotional, reckless, gossipy, drinking, hospitable, traditional, sentimental, conservative, martyr complex.
Fuck no. If they are already in my circle of "close friend" then they will have had a good reason for their murder. The law doesn't mean shit. Not going to lose a good friend over something as silly as trying to be a law abiding citizen.
ENTP with an ENFJ roommate.  It's pretty awesome because we have a similar way of going about getting things done (although I'm slightly more responsible), and we can talk through any problems we have without too much drama.  We also have similar interests so whether it's chess, smash bros, or talking about pretty much anything, we never get bored.The volumes of liquid spoken thus in me acquiesce i.e. with paragraph minnows in book oceans residing, minimum.Si wants stability and comfort (i.e. Physical consistency).  INxPs normally don't want to lead crazy or exciting lives; they're normally satisfied enjoying creature comforts and doing the things they like to do.  Note: Si is only explicitly repressed in Inferior Si users.  (As an ENxP, I *need* my situation to be uncomfortable (or at least changing) to some extent or I feel stagnant, unchallenged, and bored out of my skull.)  Otherwise, it's a result of other functions taking precedence (like in ENxJs).

Se wants excitement and thrills (i.e. physical stimulus).  INxJs are famous for repressing their animalistic tendencies (i.e. Never giving into impulse or distractions from their vision).  A lot of INxJs are hypersensitive, and either reject sensory experiences in order to focus on their internal world or overindulge in unhealthy ways (because cigarettes, whiskey, and sex are just *that* good).

I see Se and Ne as draws to external stimulus and Si and Ni and draws to internal consistency.  Sensors want physical stimulus and intuitors want mental stimulus.  Thinking and Feeling dominants have other drives.I don't think that people are necessarily good at using their tertiary function, I only think of it as a goal that people have.  ENxJs want to be rich and powerful and famous, ExTPs want to be loved.

Bojack is the opposite of an Ni type, imo.Hmm... I think there is a fear associated with one's inferior function, and while the fear is unconscious, the rejection of it (as a result of that fear) is conscious.Yeah, I'm using a more behavioristic look at the functions because they're often easier to discern that way.  We could talk about Si in terms of the storehouse of physical sensations and comparisons it builds, but ultimately the goal is to reproduce the most agreeable ones.The way I heard it explained is that Fi's goal is to love, and Fe's goal is to be loved.  Being deeply understood and appreciated regardless of what that consists of is the pinnacle of love, imo.ENFJ: "Honey, all of our friends are coming over on Saturday!"

ISTP: "Fantastic, I don't have any friends."

;)ENTP:  took me about 5 years of waffling.Tbh, I think Frank is an ENTP.  Raymond Tusk was an ENTJ.  They appear similar, but their thought processes are different.ENTP- The main character in Californication.  I can't remember his name.Think about dogs for a minute with me.  So, you walk into your house at the end of a long day at school.  You may have had a presentation that didn't go so well, you may have had an awkward interaction with a girl, or you may have had to skip lunch to work on a project and your stomach is killing you.  You walk up to your driveway thinking "fuck the world, I'm going to bed," but as soon as you open the door **BAM**.  Good ol' Spot comes running at you at full speed, tackles you to the ground (depending on the size of the dog), and starts licking your face like you've just come back from the dead.  Suddenly, you're smiling and giggling at how cute your fucking dog is.  Your day just went from shitty to not too bad in an instant, no?

As it turns out, we get these types of responses from people too.  If you have to deal with that bitchy lunch lady every day for a minute or so interaction, it's going to leave you with the impression that she's always like that, whether she actually is or not.  Eventually you'll start to dread talking to that fucking lunch lady.  But let's say this lunch lady is funny, happy all the time, and may sometimes give you a free muffin, " 'cuz you're sweet as pumpkin pie" (don't judge me, I'm southern haha).  You'd love that lady like she's your mother.

So how do we use this knowledge to cultivate an image?  That's up to you.  Just know that whatever you get out is exactly what you put in.  If you push her too quickly, she'll be shoved right out the back door.  If you are too quiet or too shy, she won't even notice you're there.  What you want to do is become somebody that girls will draw themselves to.  Essentially: be sexy in that clever, semi-geeky way that only an NTP can pull off.

As far is immediate skills to work on: get good at telling jokes and stories.  The South Eastern Conference is collectively one massive ESTP.
Another ENTP here, I'm a pastafarian, (follow we of the flying spaghetti monster) and yes I do dick about with religion
ok, I might be able to type you on a few questions, but if i can't im sure everone else will correct me for you!
 
1 Do you like timetables/scheduals?

2 If one of your friends were sad, maby a relitive or pet died, how would you/would you help them?

3 Do you day dream about ideas and things?

4 do you like public speaking?

also I can't garentee that what I, and the reddit comunity say you are is true, you should do some reaserch yourself aswell.

edit, redid the layout thingthis sounds like (and again i might be very wrong) xNFP
ENTx
I might be wrong though, you should read up on ENTP and ENTJs to see if you fit in one of those 2.
I started wearing makeup for fun around age 5, professionally (I was a pageant child) a year later, and on a daily basis around 13. I wear makeup almost every day. A full face takes about an hour - but that includes time to try and remove my makeup at least twice first. My favorite part is always going to be eye makeup; it's also my least favorite part as well. It's my most time-consuming.

Favorite lip color at the moment is "Cathedral" by Kat von D. Favorite eyeshadow is probably the Naked 3 palette from Urban Decay. No, I don't contour (though it's not out of my skillset). Depending on the day, smoky or winged.Not so much to remove mistakes as to change my mind about what I'm doing.the funny thing is that more often than not i tend toward a smoky or sculpted eye and a nude lip (if anything). the current heat wave puts a definite damper on my will to apply makeup!
Haha. That's almost exactly the story of my parents. Except my mother waited until she was 75 to leave my father. They're still on speaking terms though
It is hard. Very very hard. More so for me than her. I feel like I am the chord keeping her tethered to Earth. Like Atlas I am the only thing keeping her from falling apart.My INTJ buddy has a messier room than I do. It doesn't really mean anything.ENTP. None. I have more important shit to do.INFJ's are the epic fail of MBTI types.You don't know anything about the occult.Why do you say that?Thanks, kiddo.Lol I have kids, a job, and a wife, and I am in the Kentucky National Guard. When I want to waste my time I play Battlefield 4 on Xbox One or drink at my neighborhood bar, which isn't often. Fuck off and go chase some Pokemon around your backyard, kiddo. Only reason I commented in this Pokemon thread is to remind you millennials that you are effeminate beta man children.And you are in the Pokémon National Guard. Now get out there and catch those Pokémon, soldier!
SJs are the scum of the Earth.Especially you&gt; Cersei Lannister: ENTJ

Lol she wishes she was an ENTJ. Where's the Ni? She has no foresight or vision, she just wants to be one of the guys. Compare her to Littlefinger (NTJ), Littlefinger: "Knowledge is power."; Cersei: "Power is power." A really sensor way to respond to an intuitive. ESTJ might make sense, ENTJ doesn't. And btw, EFJs aren't nearly as nice to everyone as descriptions would have you believe.!HAHAHAHAHAHA. Wow. You're a deranged ENTP if you think she's an INFP (or any kind of P).Farage: ENTP. [Gotta love him.](https://youtu.be/5aZi1RXe9kY?t=11)Judging by the other thread that's you mateThe other thread dumbassYou don't know what an ENTP is thoAnd u just admitted to knowing about the other thread

REKKEDNahhhh u just got PLAYED

INTJ "mastermind" hahaha gg ezThat's actually pretty funnyISTP extraverted? You're crazyThis sub is kind of PC&gt; I will bet you that 2 out of 3 are mistyped Sensors.

Sensors generally just don't give a crap about MBTI. I don't know what it'll take for you people to accept that.Yeah Se makes them active, they spend a lot of time *doing* stuff (people say INTPs are hermits), but they're not really social or gregarious at all. ISTPs probably say the fewest total words out of any type.I can't "PROVE" anything because the theory doesn't have a shred of evidence to support it. You're a fool if you think you came close to proving anything with your function magic.Nonsense. The dichotomies correlate to the Big Five, which is much more scientifically valid than the theory. And what exactly do we KNOW about typology? All we have is mountains of anecdotal evidence.&gt; Prove with dichotomies that ISTP is more introverted than any of the other types.

Well again, it's hard to *prove* anything (you should really stop using that word so carelessly) but here's some [evidence](https://type-coach.com/istp).

&gt; They're not mutually exclusive with function theory.

No, of course not, but they don't RELY on function theory either. It's perfectly possible to have a personality typing system just based on observable behavior. And just because Jung's functions claim to explain more and be more fixed and rigid does not make them correct. That violates Occam's razor. Religion claims to explain everything about everything, but that does not make it true. Any evidence for one type being more introverted than another based on *functions* is dubious at best.&gt; You picked a fight

I never really saw this as a "fight" tbh. I don't know, maybe I'm coming off as condescending or aggressive, but that's not my intention. I casually remarked that ISTPs aren't extraverted at all, the part about you being crazy was a joke, and then you escalated asking me to "prove" that ISTPs are super introverted. Seriously, you spouted some random crap about functions (anyone can bullshit about functions, it's easy) and now you're holding me to some insanely high burden of proof.

Here's what I'm saying: my PERSONAL experience is that they're not extraverted at all, and this study/survey/whatever I found online agrees. Your entire case is loosely based on functions which, like your argument, don't have empiric evidence to support them. My case is at least somewhat based in reality and that's why I agree with myself over you. And I know the study used dichotomies and not functions because out of the thousands of MBTI studies that have been done over the past few decades, SIX have tried to test for functions (that should tell you what actual psychologists think about the functions).

&gt; I'm guessing the entire field of typology is dubious to you as well?

It is, and I'm just amazed that no one here shows even the slightest bit of skepticism. People are way too dogmatic about this shit, especially with functions. There are many function theories out there, this one just happens to be the best known, and none of these is necessarily more accurate than the others.&gt; I really just wanted you to prove that there was some actual thought 

Your original post wasn't defended by any "actual thought" either.

&gt; my "functions bullshit" actually adheres to the general consensus in this thread

I see like, two people who agree with you about ISTP.

&gt; It's objectively defined

It's not objectively defined at all. The functions actually seem very poorly defined (Socionics defines Fi totally differently from how Myers defines it) and people usually twist them to mean whatever they want.

&gt; widely agreed-upon premise for my argument

Widely agreed upon? By whom? These people are sheep. Actual psychologists don't agree upon it so I don't care.

&gt; correlate with big 5

Tenuous correlations which they only reached by simplifying the theory to what was strictly observable. Nothing about this implies that there even is such a thing as a cognitive function, let alone that everyone has 4 of them in a fixed order that dictate everything we do and say. And as I said, the stack varies from theory to theory; Jung never endorsed this particular function stack so the idea that ISTPs even have Se has nothing to do with him. Most of his writings were focused on introversion/extraversion.

&gt; if you aren't willing to at least entertain the idea that there might be something to function theory

I am not an extremist. I do think that there's something to the functions, I think that they're good symbols for explaining what goes on "behind the scenes," but people are just too literal and dogmatic about them.

&gt; Did you perhaps consider that I may know some socially extroverted ISTPs?

Do you? I'd respect your argument a lot more if you just said so.Ok *friend* I'm just having a lil fun. And I have brought rationale, I gave you an outside source. You just ranted about "Se" in general like every armchair Freud who fucks around with this quacky theory.

And the idea that there can somehow only be 4 "introverted" introverts is ridiculous. I know you like having your cute little quadrants but it just doesn't work that way. Most extraverts are extraverted and most introverts are introverted. As it stands, the only introverts I could see myself mistaking for extraverts are IFJs.

&gt; or care if you respect it

I still don't but whatever.o shit wadduphow u been cuz? I'm on s2e4 of house&gt; Your outside source was literally crap

You're literally crap.

&gt; In fact, I made them before this thread even existed.

I don't see how their date of creation has anything to do with them being bullshit?

&gt; it's fucking THEORY

It's not a theory, you have no idea what that word means.

&gt; It's a rational explanation for observable behavior, not a hard and fast, fool-proof law of human nature.

It's unreliable pseudoscientific bullshit. I don't even know what you're trying to say here.

&gt; Nobody ever took this shit for dogma

Of course they do. Their identity is inseparably tied to this stupid typing shit so they feel threatened when it's questioned. You don't appear to be any exception judging by your butthurt little rant.

&gt; You wanna argue with me, do it in my fucking court.

Lol ok, let me put this in terms you'll understand. ISTPs have Ti and Ni which according to your "theory" should be the two most introverted functions. (But idk, you seem pretty inconsistent. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)&gt; Trump is an ESFP

What a ludicrous typing. Love how you tried to just sliiiide that in there lol

Pence is probably an ISTJ.Disregarding "Se," I don't know how you could possibly think Trump is any kind of J, let alone an STJ. You basically said him and Pence are the same type which is just straight up laughable.Your post history tells me you're a centipede. And yet here you are, talking shit about the God Emperor. I am so, so disappointed in you.&gt; Laughable? Really?

Yeah. And what's *really* laughable is the fact that you say "STJ" as if there's even a remote possibility of him being an introvert. ISTJ Lmfao, that's a good one.

&gt; Are you arguing that two people cannot both be STJs if they behave differently?

It's just funny that you would group them together like that when the whole point of Pence is that he's a boring, traditional conservative (i.e. the total opposite of Trump).

&gt; Trump is a bizarre dude

*Bizarre*? Not really. He's about what you'd expect a narcissistic ESTP with a high IQ to look like.

&gt; why have you quoted Se?

Because it's obvious you came to your initial conclusion with some weird-ass twisting of functions. Forget that crap for a second. You don't need to know the man personally to see that he's a perceiver in every sense of the word. (And, you know, you could just read personal accounts of him, like the one you cited.)Why is it hard? Narcissism is its own thing, it has nothing to do with any of the four dimensions. (It's not going to make Trump look like more of a feeler, for example.)

I also remember reading that ESTP- obviously Trump's type- is correlated with NPD.&gt; Ne-Si dom

1. LJ (and RH) were probably locked up because they violated the law, and whether LJ was catching the rebound on MM or not, he ultimately defended someone from being put down by a loved one.

2. MM had the best intentions, and I get moving heaven and earth for a loved one. However, there wasn't a life or death ultimatum hanging over RH (and LJ), and it's not like the S raped MM. She still could've refused. Her plea to RH was basically, "You need to appreciate me and overlook this grave breach of trust in our relationship because I thought it was best for us!" MM is well-meaning, but naive and selfish.

3. The S was just doing his job up until he used his position's power to twist MM's arm for a fuck. What a sleazy, grimy bastard. (Still not his fault that MM agreed though.)

4. RH is in an established, intimate relationship with MM. So unlike the S, RH actually **owes** MM something, but he allows his emotions to flare up enough to actually *abuse* her. Abuse of a loved one is the mortal sin in this story. Call her a slut and say you never want to see her again...fine, dick move but that reaction is still reasonable. Putting hands on your significant other? Utter scum. Go burn in hell.

Whoa, 2edgy5me. Top kek. 

Probably ENTP.ENTP - Whatever you're passionate about and have a solid grasp of knowledge on. I love seeing people get exicted talking about what they love, and I get to learn something I might've not bothered with in the first place!
I have a very strong faith that I came here to learn - not just on the scientific meaning, but spiritually too. Even if I'm going through times in wich I don't feel motivated to do mundane tasks I view that as a state of being that must be overcomed, that must be conquered and learned to be dealt with. Every problem is viewed this way, and thus I can always find motivation in the darkest of times.As a fellow ENTP:

Working with most other analysts (NT) is a blessing. They just 'get it', they are quick, they know when to follow orders, know when to 'bend' laws and rules, know to analyze things logically and find rational solutions to problems.

Working with most of the Feeling types, specially SFs, can be a pain in the ass to me. They tend to put their egos in the middle of everything and to always put the 'human side' of things in front of the most rational solutions (eg. unfavoring being productive in favor of not making anyone offended/not making anyone feel bad).That thing about not understanding how do I get from point A to B really hits the point. NTJs mainly have very structured ways to do things, like setting rigid schedules and procedures to do stuff, while I tend more to do everything on the fly. It takes time for them to accept it when I say "trust me, things will be sorted out in the end". It always baffles my colleagues when I say "well I did X thing for 9 hours straight yesterday after procrastinating for a week" - in the end, the results are the same, while they work a steady 1 and a half hour a day on a certain thing and I like to concentrate that on a magical day in wich my motivation makes terms with my intelligence to be very productive for a while.
Good question.&gt;you basically just ultra-derogatory stereotyped XSFJs.

I actually said that they're the best at spreading their genes. That's a good thing in case you didn't realize that.

I think having a majority of XSFJs is a healthy thing for society. They keep everything stable. I also identify more with XSFJ politics according to [this.](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/the-us-political-personality-iv-issues)&gt;if your theory were correct, there would be an increasing number of NTs as humans evolve socially, especially in places where challenging the status quo is more acceptable.

According to [this](https://mbtiresearch.skillsone.com/discovery/Documents/Ethnic%20and%20Gender%20Diffs%20in%20Best-Fit%20Type%20Discovery%207.22.09.pdf) there are more white NTs than other races and whites have lived in places where challenging the status quo is more acceptable. 

&gt;My own theory, which could also be bullshit, is that SJs are plentiful because they keep the world going round. They take on the role of maintaining the here and now both socially and logistically, while other types are dreaming about tomorrow, or collecting information, or doing whatever their type contributes.

I totally agree, our two theories aren't mutually exclusive. 

EDIT: Even bring up the possibility of differences between races and you get downvoted to hell. What is wrong with what I said? Is the study bullshit? Seriously asking.No one MBTI personality is better than the other imo. Out of all my friends I probably have at least one of each type.

&gt;I'm interested in the role systemic racism contributes to that...

I don't know what you mean. It's just a study or whatever. The findings of a study commit systematic racism, only racists can.Are you saying that if it weren't for systemic racism there would be more people of color NTs?Interesting but I can't think why that might be the case :/I think genetics has to be a factor. Like ask a mother or a father with two kids if they could have done anything to make one of the children more like the other in terms of personality. Everyone I've asked said that there's nothing they could have done.

And even infants have different tendencies. An infant by definition has not had enough nurture to make them so different. Good idea, I'm open to anything. I'm very new to MBTI so I'm just spitballing. Libertarian - ENTP&gt;NTs spreading genes via obtaining power.

If you're an INTJ you're not as good at socializing as say an ENFP. An ENFP can use emotional bonding to spread genes. So can INTJ, but it's going to be more challenging. The INTJs with the most reproductive success were probably ones who obtained power.

&gt;On Whites having a higher percentage of NTs

I didn't say that out of the blue. The commenter before me said that if my theory were correct that there would be a higher concentration of NTs in areas where disrupting the status quo is acceptable and so I brought up that according to a study there are more white NTs. 

&gt;On whites living in areas where challenging the status quo is acceptable for a longer period of time than other races/ethnic groups.

Of course this is totally true. There was never free speech until western civilization. There isn't free speech in tribe or feudal societies. It makes sense there's more NTs in places where they don't get killed for speaking truth to power.

&gt;your entire post and all your comments on this thread are full of contradictions

Be specific. Thanks. I don't know anything about determining what's a reliable sample size so your comment is helpful. Hopefully someone does a study where the results can be more trustworthy.&gt;there are democratic civilizations that do not involve any western influence.

I'm not denying that. But the West has had freedom of speech longer than every other part of the world. So it would make sense they would have more NTs.

I've read from many different source that NTs are the rarest combination. Here's [one source.](http://www.asiancemagazine.com/2012/07/03/how-rare-is-your-personality-type-out-of-17-main-personality-models)

&gt;you implied that NTs are rulers. 

No, I said for most of human history that was the best way for NTs to reproduce. 

&gt;would you have an SJ as a ruler?

I think one day humanity will outgrow the need for rulers. I certainly think that SJs could be good leaders. If I had an SJ for a boss, I'd have no problems following their commands as their employee.If a reliable study proves that there are more white NTs than people of color does that mean that I'm right?Let's say this hypothetical study is iron clad. Completely trustworthy with results that have been reproduced 100 times. I think the reason why there's no good studies on this is because people are afraid to point out any differences between the races, even differences that have nothing to do with the quality of a person. They're afraid of people like you calling them racist for nothing.

I'm not racist in the slightest. I don't think any race is better than any other race, rather that each race is adapted to their environments. I also don't think any MBTI personality is better than another. 

You're contributing to people's fear of communication on important topics, and I'm not referring to the topic of my OP. There can be no peace without discussion. I'm an ENTP who went from being painfully awkward all the time to smooth talker 95% of the time. Advice: take your time. People make mistakes when they hurry, and there is no reason to hurry a conversation. Try to minimizing saying "um," use a moment to carefully choose what you want to say and how you want to say it.Wow, I totally understand ISTJs now that you compared them to Hank. Thanks.I hate when people type Job Bluth as ENTP, he's clearly ESFP.Wow, that's a good one!Solid criticism thank you.1) ENTP

2) Male

3) Both the xNTJs seem pretty cool but I don't think I know any in person. I think I'd make a great sidekick to either of those.

4) My best friends are all intuitive feelers.

5) I struggle with relationships. Looking at the aftermath of each I'm not sure which train wreck I'd call the most dateable. 

6) I'll have to wait and see. I could even see myself with an xSxJ, maybe they'd balance out my weirdness. 

7) ENFPs/INFPs make the best friends for me.

8) The person who makes me laugh the hardest right now is an INTP. I know they're not known for their humor but he's a comedian and we both enjoy dark/offensive comedy.

9) I'd say xSxJs. They're probably the ones who get freaked out when I start talking about something controversial.

10) I'm weary of ISTPs/ESTPs since they're the types that can be psychopaths/sociopaths. I think you should keep an eye on these types.
Take characters and assess their types, then find examples of their behavior that represent why you chose that type.I'm an ENTP who loves ENFPs apparently. Reading about ENFPs I wouldn't necessarily pick them as my favorite but in the real world I just click with these dudes. Funny as hell, still willing to have deep conversations though.Who's the female ENTP?They got it right on my very first entry. Neato! How do I get it to test based on my Facebook profile?I disagree. I don't think many people here are mistyped. I just think that most SJs have no interest coming here.First I should say that I'm still new to MBTI so correct me where I'm wrong.

&gt;Why do you believe that most SJs would be uninterested in mbti?

Don't all sensors care less about abstractions like personality types? I could see xSTPs being more interested than xSxJs because of their desire for discovery. 

Also I think people with less common personality types are more interested in analyzing personalities since they don't relate as well to the average person. Whereas a person with a common type like xSxJs would be less interested in personalities since they're so common.

&gt;But in the community as a whole, I would say that there is definitely a lot of mistyping.

Mistyping of themselves or of others? I would think most people could type themselves since it seems so easy to me. I also think the test on 16personalities.com would be pretty accurate. But then again I'm always surprised by how many "type me" threads there are. Damn I hate those.&gt;I think your sense of humor, taste in music, movies, art, etc., and political ideals allow you to relate to others more than your personality type ever could.

There are correlations between personality types and taste in [music](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/music-preferences-by-personality-type) and [political parties.](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/the-us-political-personality-i-parties) There are probably also correlations for taste art, humor and movies that no one has studied yet either. 
&gt; My whole point was that I don't think we necessarily get along with other people of our own type

I agree, but I think SJs are more likely to get along with SJs than NTs are to get along with NTs. I'm an NT but I mostly hang out with NFs.&gt;I'm sure some of them don't, but it isn't accurate for all sensors (or all SJs). It would make sense if you simply referred to the theory, but we have to remember that these types are referring to people.

I totally agree.

&gt;I'm unsure of what you mean when you refer to the 'average person'. 

What I mean is SJs are the most common types.

&gt; Therefore, any type could be interested in mbti based on that reasoning.

True but I think it happens least to SJs particularly if they live in an area where they're more common.

&gt;has definitely occurred in the past where people would type others as Intuitives if they really liked them (e.g their favourite youtuber or something) or believed they were intelligent, witty, etc. as they believed sensors were less capable of this. And I think part of the reason is because of the crappy descriptions online

You're right. I see a lot of ESTP characters mistyped as ENTPs for that reason. 

&gt;I wouldn't trust the tests so much if I were you. If I relied solely on my test results and the descriptions, I would probably still believe that I'm an INFP. 

Good to know. In my case it happened to be correct but am glad to be aware of a case where it was off.

&gt;Just as an extra note, it's super important to remember that mbti is about preference and not ability.

I actually love this aspect of MBTI. If I see a person who seems really well rounded I know now that it's not because this person doesn't have weaknesses, but actually because they are overcoming their weaknesses. 

&gt;Welcome to mbti by the way :)

Thank you so much. Great to have someone more experienced explain some things to me.Kevin Conroy (the animated series): INTJMy theory is based on the premise is that your MBTI type is genetic and that certain types are better at spreading their genes than others. ISFJs and ESFJs are the most common and I think the reason why is because both of these types choose a very safe strategy for spreading their genes. They don't challenge the status quo and are ideal subjects to a totalitarian ruler. 

NTs are more rare because for most of human history it was suicide to speak against the ruler. For a long time, the only reliable way to spread your genes as an NT was to become rulers themselves.

What do you think? Am I full of shit or am I onto something?I've gotten a better understanding of mbti by finding characters that represent different types. Which character represents each type best? I'm new to mbti but I'll give it a shot.

ESTP: Bender
ISTP: Bob Belcher
ESFP: Mr. Peanut Butter
ENTP: Jack Sparrow 
INTP: Neo from the Matrix
Someone told me ENFPs always try to avoid conflict and situations where they have to give criticism. But my friends who (I think) are ENFPs aren't really like that in particular. 

Which types avoid conflict and what functions are responsible?

That's not exactly what Jung is saying.That's what I've been unable to spot in her. I cannot determine her cognitive functions, as she seems to have exceptional control over functions which do not "stack" into any archetype.Thank you but I follow this guy's videos quite a bit--highly informative. I am very familiar with the cognitive functions and how they manifest.Very late to this post, but... Maybe I'm an exception to the "rule", but as an ENTP, playing games with your affection is the easiest way to get me to not like you. I have consistently cut people out of my life for doing so.&gt;Every time I see this thread come up I think they are talking about what types people with borderline personality disorder have. Sigh.

Dare I ask why?

&gt;Everyone has an S and an N function and use it for different purpose. Same with T and F.
The biggest importance is just to figure out the dominant function. 

I am aware of this, but it's also a spectrum. For example, one ISFP may have very strong Se as their second function and very weak (i.e. more difficult to access) Ni as their third function, whereas another ISFP may be more closer to "even" between the two with only a slight preference for Se as their secondary. The latter case is what I'm looking to explore here.That was actually very insightful. Thank you for your input!I think it's very interesting because some branches of MBTI state we use all 8 cognitive functions--every single one of us. However the functions that aren't our "starting 4" are the Shadow Functions which emerge when things aren't quite right with us, and can manifest in destructive ways.

I think you could make an argument that someone with access to a higher number of functions without them necessarily being "Shadow" gives that person some sort of heightened natural ability, if only it could be consciously tapped.ENTP:

logic/math (4.29/5)

social (4.14/5)

*tie for 3rd: language &amp; self (both 3.57/5)

This test would also appear to confirm my spatial retardation, which I long ago accepted. (1.43/5)You people crack me up with your talk of MBTI "biases".

The "sensor bias" I can kind of understand, I guess. But now there is a bias of Ti &gt; Te, and people "act like Ti users know all the answers to the universe and can fart out information [???] on outer space"?

You sure you aren't projecting a little bit there my friend? LolFriendly advice...1, 2, and 4 --&gt; Work toward cultivating your Fe. Once you personally place value on empathizing with others (that is, *understanding* why they feel a certain way and then taking stock in it--I personally find it very difficult to actually achieve any kind of emotional "transfer" except in unusually traumatic circumstances, but I *can* comprehend a stranger's feelings on a logical level and help them to feel understood), it will start to come naturally to you if you are correctly typed as an ENTP. And this skill is so incredibly critical to interpersonal and professional success as an ENTP that I really wouldn't suggest you wait to start practicing. You *will* see positive results in the way people interact with you.

As far as Si goes though...I feel like I have no access to it whatsoever, other than it manifesting in the form of anxiety or recognition of my own failure. I have *no* sense of time or direction whatsoever unless I focus 95% of my attention onto it, meaning I'm pretty much always leaving late and usually getting lost on the way...so I'm almost always tardy. I wish there was an easy fix for this. It causes me great distress when people for whom punctuality comes naturally assume I am being intentionally disrespectful to them because I am 15 minutes late to our meeting/appointment for the 3rd time in a row.I'm not sure I agree with this, although it would depend how you define "cold" and "sensitive".

I actually have the capacity to be deeply caring and occasionally even altruistic, especially when I see innocent people suffer. If you equate being "cold" with "not caring as much as they appear to", then I'd have to say this is not the case (at least not with this ENTP)...I would even say that at any given moment, I probably care *more* than it appears that I do.

Granted, however, that when it comes to the day-to-day or in any sort of business etc. type transaction, becoming strategically detached is not difficult for me if it suits my best interests or the best interests of people I care about. So if *that's* what you mean, then I agree.

I can only speak for myself, of course. I personally have gone out of my way to try and learn how to "cultivate" my Fe because I recognize how crucial that function is to succeed as an ENTP and to truly understand the way you impact the world you live in.Agreed.In other words, you want someone to play games with your emotions?

Hey, at least you admit it. Nothing wrong with that.I think that says more about you than it does about them, no offense.For all 9 of them huh?I like it. Although I feel like two Ne-doms planning a prison break would devolve into some sort of prolonged half-assed protest about the cruelties of the criminal justice system which would result in 0 prison escapes.Vaping helped me quit smoking, kind of on accident. It was winter and I hate the cold and didn't want to go outside to smoke -- after 3-4 days of vaping indoors, I could taste and smell the tobacco again and it was no longer enjoyable (I actually tried to go back to cigarettes and could not do it).

Granted I'm still very much addicted to nicotine and some people associate vaping with douchebaggery, but nicotine &amp; tar is a lot harsher on your body than nicotine &amp; water vapor, so I'm not complaining.Really requires an audience though. Plenty of people will just get pissed if you argue with them in private (even if it's good natured) and will leave with the exact same mindset they entered with - or with their perspective even strengthened out of ego defensiveness - irrespective of what you say to them.Agreed!I can think of 9 reasons.Late to the party, but I have some insight here. Your guys' functions are clashing big time -- you share Ne as 1st or 2nd, so there is common ground. The problem is your dominant Ti vs his secondary Fi.

Being your close cousin (ENTP), and having worked on a multi-year design project with an ENFP business partner (design &amp; building of a mobile app), I can relate more than you know. There is very likely no amount of Ti or logical reasoning you can express to him that will get him to change his mind about the features he *feels* are important for the grand end-vision he has in his head.

My ENFP business partner was awesome and talented in many other ways. However, his stubbornness to give over any amount of design control was a major problem. I eventually had to go behind his back to have our programmer implement a feature that would allow the app to be monetized, because he would not agree to it and did not want anyone else speaking with the programmer (he later acknowledged that my feature was necessary for the app).

If I had actually solved my problem effectively, I could provide you better advice. All I have are suggestions that, in retrospect, I feel may have worked well:

**(1)** Drop all attempts to convince him from the jump of your ideas, even if you disagree with the fairness of the balance of power. Instead, become as enthusiastic as possible about his "grand vision" -- get him to map it out for you visually. Ask questions. Share in his excitement. Get him talking about the benefits of his design to transition him into Te-mode.

**(2)** Realize you won't be able to get him to agree to deviate from his grand vision. However, you *can* enthusiastically suggest "improvements/tweaks to his ideas" and make it seem like he came up with them himself. He will be much less likely to shut you down if he feels you are enthusiastic with him.

**(3)** Try to do this when he is in a positive and non-distracted mood. Not when he is tired or zoned-out. Otherwise you won't get very far no matter how well you play your hand.

Hope this helps a little.You're damn right.ENTP-ENFP or ENTP-ISFJ?

The former: definitely, some of my best friends are ENFPs who also can *occasionally* annoy the shit out of me. Never had any issues with the latter.The armchair psychologist in me speculates that he/she struggled as an adolescent to connect with others due to the inherent focus on intelligence and data-centered preferences of the INTJ. He/she had to either turn that conflict inward and assume "fault" with him/herself, or direct it outward to the "concept of humanity". The latter is a much safer choice for the ego to make.&gt;Or I'm just saying idiocies and the guy is just shy, who knows.

Not at all, what you're saying is pretty crucial to understanding ENTPs. To me it is almost momentum-based. If I am alone for any extended period of time, it really feels like work to socialize. However, once I'm "on a roll" socializing it comes totally naturally and I find myself feeling sad when the night is over and the group disperses. It makes for an interesting social life.Just not always by choice.When people speak to you about a personal problem they are having, what is usually your natural inclination?

**(a)** Find the solution using logic because you care about the person's well-being and want to help them solve their problems.

**(b)** Find ways to relate to them and their problem on a personal level and comfort them because you care about them, with less emphasis on actually finding a solution.

If it's the former, then you're likely an ENTP. If it's the latter, then you're likely an ENFJ.

This is presuming your options really are narrowed down between those two types, which honestly seems a bit odd.I can't argue with you there. ESTP and ISTP had the same answer in my mind but I didn't want to repeat myself.&gt;Come up with a more efficient design

How you gonna do that in the dark?

Another INTJ missing the forest for the trees...What you just described, and the way in which you described it, sounds more like Fi than Fe or Ti. As an ENTP, I would be very hard-pressed to make the decision that my friend would be better off getting rejected so he could get over a crush.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do, it's just not a natural ENTP move.

Fe values social cohesion and is drained by emotional conflict, and a high-Fe user would likely be extremely hesitant to manufacture conflict between two close friends, even if he or she believes it to be in their best interests. Fi, on the other hand, has an internal "map" of what is morally acceptable and morally repugnant, and so long as the actions of its user do not violate that compass, it would be much more inclined to manufacture an external outcome based on the perceived ideal emotional states of third-parties. The logical explanation is often applied *ex post facto* as a rationalization for the high-Fi individual's actions so that he/she can express his/her intentions in a way that makes sense.

Of course, these are all generalities and every individual is different. I'm just trying to give your thinking some guidance in the right direction.&gt;I don't really understand Ne.

Ne is all about possibilities and finding connections between seemingly-unconnected concepts. Think of it as "connecting the dots" of ideas. Ne seeks an objective path to the truth and is not afraid to argue the opposite of what its user believes in order to vet the merits of a new idea.

Ni is all about solutions. Rather than connecting the dots, it "fills in the blank". It is thus inherently slightly more reliable but substantially less flexible than Ne. Ni seeks a subjective path to truth, and its user will find solutions with great precision but will be hard-pressed to deviate from those solutions if presented with competing theories.That could be Ne, Ni, or a fluke, to be honest.

Which of the following statements do you identify more with?

**(a)** Anything is possible, and one of life's purposes is to discover its secret truths. Life is full of mystery.

**(b)** Life has an inherent order to it. Given enough time, every problem has a rational solution.

Don't parse the options for total accuracy, or answer based on how you'd want others to view you. Just state which option resonates with you more deeply.You don't sound like an INTJ. If you were an INTJ, you'd have likely framed this conversation as "I think I am [type], but it's also possible I am [other type]" rather than your insistence on keeping everything open-ended. With that said, one of my best friends in the entire world is an INTJ. They are brilliant and anyone should consider themselves lucky to be one. The Ni/Te link makes for a tremendous computational mind.Lol that's exactly why I said don't parse for accuracy.

I think you use Ne/Si/Te/Fi but I do not know in what order.Despite the semi-successful professional and non-basement-dweller that I am, I cannot stand bright artificial lighting. Even at work I turn my office lights off and just open the blinds. Gives me a major headache too

Perhaps we are kindred spirits.You're high if you think an ENTP is making three subsequent trips in one day to buy lightbulbs.Do you get the same with your computer screen? Even on the lowest brightness it gives me a headache. That is, until I installed f.lux which filters out portions of the visible light spectrum from your computer screen in the evenings (runs on a timer). Supposed to help prevent using a computer at night from giving you insomnia.Hasn't attended University courses. Could easily be a highly underdeveloped/immature INTJ, I'm guessing 16-17 years old.

Although my guess is ENFP. Ne/Fi/Te/Si. Ne dom explains the metaphysics. Misguided Fi explains his conclusion that University is brainwashing, and that's why he's a member of the alt-right! Te in 3rd position (per Socionics) explains his deep desire to appear well-informed and smart to others using external "evidence" as proof.If solving problems, then having problems.

If having problems, then negativity.

Therefore, if solving problems, then negativity.

He wasn't wrong.No offense intended my friend, but I do not believe ENFPs are the loneliest of all types.

For one, you are extroverts. It is generally easier for you to make friends than introverts. (Moreover, it is generally easier for ENFPs to make friends than some of the other extroverted types.) Of course, this does not translate 1:1 with lack-of-loneliness, but it certainly can be a factor.

Some loneliness of the ENFP is self-chosen. Harsh, but true. Some of my closest friends are ENFPs and their high-Fi causes them to reject people whom they sense as immoral (sometimes before getting to know them at all). Almost as though association with these people would change who *they* are at some core level. It doesn't have to be like that. One of my biggest lessons as an adult was learning to compartmentalize the people in my life -- there are going to be some people whose company you love but who are inherently unreliable. Others may lack common decency but have other redeeming traits. Others may be important professionally but the last type of person you'd ever have a beer with. And if you're extremely lucky, you'll find one or a few "best friends" who you can rely on completely. Friends shouldn't be all or nothing -- find the role they are meant to play in your life, and try not to become sad when not every friend reciprocates affection in the same way you do to them. This paradigm truly changed my life.

I think all types have the capacity to be lonely, it's just ENFPs have a lot of love to give and think it's personal when that love isn't reciprocated. It isn't personal. Like life in general, learn to take friendship as it comes and for what it is. Don't complicate it, appreciate it. Your suffering will lessen, I guarantee it.Reposting my comment in reply to the OP of this subthread, because I think it could help you too:

This is a false and limiting belief.

Introverts who carry themselves with an air of mystery are some of the most conventionally attractive personality types on the planet. It all shows through in your body language. As an introvert, are you "closing off" your BL and sending the message "please don't talk to me", or does your BL state "I don't seek social interaction or approval because I am on my own path"? (Note: It doesn't matter which is true. It really is a choice.)

Human beings love nothing more than mystery. There is *no mystery* to the slouched over guy not making eye contact. It's clear that he avoids social interaction because he's afraid of it. Alternatively, the outwardly-confident introvert is like a mystery-radiating magnet. People *do* want to be close with this person, unless you reveal all of the mystery as soon as they say "hi". Make them work for it.

Paradoxically, the best way for an introvert to succeed at social interaction is to stop using social interaction as a measure of their self-worth. Because then, the "skills" come naturally.

Practice breathing from your diaphragm. Learn to speak deeply and slowly. Walk slowly, shoulders back. Move deliberately. Sit up straight. Look into daily affirmations. Envision yourself as a fucking superhero if you have to. It's all in your voice (**not** your words) and body language. Repeat until it becomes muscle memory... or don't. But it worked for me, at a time when I was terrified of social interaction and would have *barely* considered myself an extrovert, if at all.Yes but with the opposite conclusion.If that's the case, then you are talking in broad, unreliable generalities. For every "extroverted alpha male CEO" stereotype, there is an equivalent "brilliant never-leaves-his-penthouse introverted millionaire daytrader" stereotype. I think you're rationalizing.Would society on the whole value someone who doesn't contribute to society? No. No it would not.

That doesn't mean such individual has no inherent worth, or that particular persons wouldn't value him or her. But you aren't entitled to be regarded as valuable, in the strictest sense of the term, by someone or something to which you contribute no valuable. It's kind of self-righteous to suggest otherwise.I think as a general rule, the person who accuses someone of being sensitive about a subject during the course of a tame dialogue is the one who is sensitive about it.

&gt;I never said it means that the person has no worth.

I never said that you did. I was engaging in a conversation, not directly countering every point of yours (and thus not implying that if I say something, it means I believe you said the opposite).

&gt;My entire point was that the stereotype view of the introvert is someone that is withdrawn from society and thus not valued unless they contribute, because contribution is associated with extroversion, not introversion.

Society values contribution. It doesn't matter if it is introverted or extroverted in nature. Your association of contribution with extroversion is all in your head and is what I'd call a "limiting belief", not *at all* factually based, and will hinder you from achieving your true potential.

Two replies ago you implied your main point was that society would not value the introvert if he or she did not externally contribute. (Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just reading your words.) This is 100% true, and it's not prejudiced or a bad thing. It applies to all people, not just introverts. [Also, "external contribution" and "extroversion" are not even close to the same thing -- there is really no such thing as "internal contribution". I'm pointing this out because I cannot tell if this is where your thought pattern is arising out of or not.]

Yes, I agree there is a stereotype that introverts will be less likely to contribute *in a certain way*. But stereotypes apply to extroverts and their abilities to contribute as well. At the end of the day, the scale is not tipped against you. I apologize if I seem combative, what I am really trying to do is either **(a)** get you to clarify your statement in a way you haven't so far so that I can more easily catch your drift or **(b)** if my assumptions are correct, pull you out of the defeatist thought-loop you seem to be stuck in. 

At the end of the day, the societal deck is not stacked against you by way of being an introvert -- but it might as well be if you go through life thinking that it is.
Out of 23 sentences in your reply, you spent 15-16 talking about my tone and how I'm taking this personally, rather than addressing the substance of what we were talking about. In fact, you concluded with, "All I'm trying to say if you tried to listen...is [your extreme involvement leading to overreaction] says more about you and your relationship with the subject than it does me."

Any hostile/reactionary tone to my reply is quite literally all in your head -- you are reading my typed words on a screen, how else can it be? All I can say to that is at no point have I intentionally disparaged you, and my statements are intended to provoke thought rather than prosecute. This is just the way I talk and I think you'll find it quite rare that any ENTP take a discussion or debate personally. I'm really not trying to have an argument with you based on anything other than the ideas you purported, though, so I'm going to ignore all of that starting now and instead just semi-briefly address the first summation of your point. After that I won't reply any more as I seem to be either distressing or annoying you, which hasn't been my intention.

&gt;I'm talking about how introverts are seen and thought to be like which has nothing to do with how they actually are like.

I recognize this and confirmed it in a previous reply.

&gt;people aren't going to judge an extrovert or an introvert the same for what they do because the stereotype assumes that introverts only live in their heads and are therefore unable to be productive whereas extroverts are more naturally assumed to be productive because they aren't introverts.

This is simply, on the whole, not true -- society does not assume this. I've tried to demonstrate that through counter-examples of how the societal idea of introverts "living in their heads" actually manifests itself in positive stereotypes too. Living in one's head is associated with intellectualism, which is one of the most highly admired traits in our society. That's more true today than even before -- "nerd" is rarely used as a pejorative anymore and can actually be a quasi-compliment. 

I know these things to be true. However, you seem to take issue with my implication that your believing there to be a negative stereotype will create a self-fulfilling prophecy for yourself (which it will). This is the "defeatist loop" I was referring to, for lack of a better term really. How you think society will view you plays a tremendous role in how society actually views you. This is not a "point of vulnerability" for me but a point of personal change and experience, which is why you are picking up a sense of my own involvement. Changing the way I assumed others thought of me (a process taking practice across several years) was one of the most positive changes I ever made, and this is at the heart of what I was trying to express. Additionally, ENTPs are one of the least extroverted of all extroverts, and further, my "E" tests very close to an "I" -- so I'm not entirely unfamiliar with the introvert's frame of reference.

I'm not going to respond after this, because I have clearly made a mistake somewhere insofar as I directed this conversation toward a harmful rather than a helpful reference frame -- but God bless and I wish you the best of luck.&gt;I am sorry if I offended you

Again, I have no personal vested interest in this conversation beyond the extent it is relatable to past issues that I no longer struggle with. So within those parameters it is impossible for you to offend me. But I appreciate the sentiment -- be well.I have an ISTP friend who is nothing like anything of what the article described. Either I mistyped him or this article is off base.

EDIT: This site also lists Jimmy Dore as an ENTP. I've watched hours of his videos--Jimmy Dore is for sure an ENFP.You're an INTP, so you know how to spot Ti.

To spot Se in conjunction with it, look for Ti being used *much* less philosophically/academically and instead being applied to in-the-moment problem solving. For example, my ISTP friend (who happens to be a genius) will spend weeks trying to hack into a piece of hardware, with no end goal in mind, simply because he *needs* to understand how the hardware works.You sure you don't mean Ne-doms buddy?ENTPs, but that's partly what makes us so lovable.ENTP, 15, non-binary apache helicopter, Aramaic&gt; Next up, Fi or Ti? I asked him, would you rather be good or intelligent? Do you listen and care about most things people say about themselves? 

I'm an ENTP and I would rather be good than intelligent. I also listen and care about most things people say about themselves.

The problem you'll face with your approach is the exact reason why MBTI question-based tests are so frequently inaccurate. The old adage "actions speak louder than words" comes to mind.&gt;The person you are arguing with does not agree that an ENTP would rather be good than intelligent.

I know.

&gt;you are assuming you are an ENTP

No I'm not. I know I am one.

-

Where is the fallacy?&gt;It doesn't matter how strongly you've decided that you've found an absolute truth.

So you are one of those "we can never really know anything" types? Why are you in this sub if you don't believe MBTI types can ever be accurately determined?

&gt;Btw, have you considered starting a religion around this absolute truth you've found?

No. And I don't think many people would want to join a religion based solely on the fact that I'm an ENTP...kind of an odd suggestion if I'm being honest.&gt;The way you talk you must constantly see only one possible explanation for everything, and jump to conclusions as a result. That's extremely anti-Ne.

You mean the way I talk in the 2-3 reddit posts of mine, each being a couple sentences long, that you've seen? And you think you can type me more accurately than I can type myself based on that? Lol.

&gt;You don't need absolutes to use a theory. Have you never stopped to think why they call Gravity a theory rather than a fact?

That honestly doesn't even fit in this context. Gravity is called a theory because it is a collection of suppositions which can all be formally tested using the scientific method. You cannot formally test MBTI in anything resembling the same way.

-

&gt;Well no, I'm not a Ne-dom

*LOGICAL FALLACY. You can't know that.*

That^ was my impression of you.&gt;You need to actually grasp the concepts, and be self-aware to type yourself with any hope of accuracy. So yeah, I'm pretty sure anyone who knows the concepts could type you better than you can.

I have a pretty strong grasp of the concepts, but then again, I don't go arguing with strangers online about how they've mistyped themselves. So I may not be a guru like you are.

&gt;Is this an attempt to troll or what? Like you just completely missed the point of both of these statements. If you seriously aren't trolling you must be a complete moron.

Not a troll, I just find you very annoying and pretentious.&gt;LOL. You don't know the basics. I bet you haven't even read Jung's book on the subject.

More pretentiousness.

&gt;Well you would find me pretentious if you're seriously that stupid.

No, I imagine most of the people forced to be around you find you pretentious when you claim to have a deeper insight into their own psyche than they themselves do.

-

Since this has now devolved into nothing more than trading insults, I seem to have lost interest. Be well my friend!&gt;entps though, when criticized, need to present the whole “I know it seems like im being offended but really im being objective and your criticism of me is totally unfair” thing

While I can definitely be insecure (although I think "sensitive but prone to hiding it" is a better description), I'm sure I could count on one hand, and one hand only, the number of times I've had the reaction you mentioned, or one similar to it. I appreciate criticism that is made in good faith -- I may ask you some follow-up questions (to better understand the constructiveness of the criticism, and to ensure good faith is present), but I have zero proclivity to manufacture outrage.

If this truly is common with ENTPs, my guess is they have failed to develop their tertiary Fe to any appreciable extent. ENTPs who have strong Ne/Ti but very weak Fe are prone to narcissism. Most of them grow out of this by adulthood (as in true adulthood, not 18th birthday).&gt;I also wish I could tell this to an ENTP I knew but I had no idea how they'd react so I avoided it until there would be a smooth transition into it

I think your ENTP friend may tease you lightly for it initially, but if it were me, it would really brighten up my day to hear that from a person I respected (and I would probably appreciate him or her more afterwards). Just FYI :)Define triggered and define offended.

To me, "triggered" is "offended to a degree that frustration is manifesting outwardly in the form of personal attack(s)", which I cannot identify with at all as a life-long ENTP.Dear Friend,

-

Fellow ENTP of 26 years here. Presently working as a private practice attorney where it is frequently expected for people to pay attention to me publicly and for them to point out flaws (particularly in my reasoning, but really sometimes it becomes "no holds barred").

I also strongly dislike feeling vulnerable. The difference between you and I is I am not *afraid* of being vulnerable. This is because my policy is to operate in full truth (with very few exceptions). All things I do true to myself, speaking and acting the way I feel is right irrespective of convention.

Operating under this principle, I am totally confident that were any individual suddenly able to interpret my every "secret" intention and motivation instantly, I would be *temporarily uncomfortable* but *not afraid* in my vulnerability. Because nearly all serious character flaws arise from some bastardization, manipulation, misuse, or lack of truth. 

What I discern to be truth, I wear like a belt fastened around my waste -- with faith in myself (and without getting evangelical on you, faith in God) used as a shield in all circumstances.

If I am living according to truth and another individual slanders me, I know it is either due to their misunderstanding or to their own misalignment with the truth. So I have no reason to fear this.

-

Generally speaking: Don't lie. Don't manipulate to another person's detriment. Don't people-please to your own detriment. Don't regularly engage in activities which you hate doing. Don't be afraid to politely state what you want. Never accept second-class behavior from others or from yourself.

Do these things, and you don't need to fear vulnerability anymore.

-

Good luck buddy.Starting it off -- ENTP, 46/9/9, respectively. (Numbers are the percentile scores in each category). 

Raw scores 2.7/1.4/1.4 each out of 4Your raw score determines your percentile, which is displayed to the right.

Your percentile is based on the aggregate raw scores compiled from all who have taken the test. For example, a percentile score of 20 means that you scored *higher than* 19.99% of the population (and therefore 80% of the population scored higher than you).

Example two, a percentile score of 80 means you scored higher than 79.99% of test-takers, and 20% of the population scored higher than you.

Higher raw score = higher percentile

-

Your scores have little meaning until you look at your percentiles, which the test provides for you.Check your percentiles, on the right.

Those numbers are generally quite low though, I can tell you.Your Machiavellianism is wild, yo&gt;Though I haven't done anything super bad with it **yet**

How do you define the phrase "super bad"? LolThat means you scored higher (worse) than a mere 2% of people on Narcissism; you scored higher than 35% of people on Machiavellianism; and you scored higher than a mere 4% of people on Psychopathy.My grandma always said it's good practice to not murder people.No -- your numbers are very low, indicating you are a good person.You're quite welcome.Your low psychopathy score reassures me that you aren't a serial killer. But I feel like if you were CEO of a company that was tanking, you'd find a way to award yourself a bonus of all the excess cash before manipulating the Board into dissolving the corporation.I consider myself a kind person. Except in the case of people making a serious and bona fide threat against me or my career or my loved ones, then I become a mechanical destroyer of worlds.You're very right. I'm willing to wager there's a correlation though.True or False:  *It is morally acceptable to bring myself gain at another person's substantial detriment despite no practical justification for the other person's detriment, as long as I know for certain nobody will ever discover what I did and I am not in an important relationship with the other person.*You have the highest psychopathy score of the thread btw.When you "score high enough" Arya Stark slices your throat with the dagger that you previously commissioned to be used in the murder of her brother.&gt;Sorry to bother you, but can I get a prediction too, please?

In about 5-15 years, a close friend of yours is going to invent a new technology and you two will go in together as business partners. After great success and cash flow, inner feuds will lead to you cutting him out of the company (despite the tech being exclusively his idea and invention), and your former friend will spend the rest of his life lower-middle class, highly resentful of you. The company will suffer for his absence. You will care but only slightly.I do not believe you are a bad person friend. Just perhaps try to remind yourself the importance of truth (in all forms, including with respect to lack of truth by omission or distortion of fact). Be trustworthy in *all* matters, both small and large, inconsequential and significant. Your behavior in the rare significant situations is formed by your habit of behavior in the common unimportant situations.I think Ne/Ti produces a comparable effect to what you describe with Ni/Te. Although instead of a mental "flow" state, it's more aptly described as a mental "scatterplot of inquisitive abstract mysteries" that refuses to be tamed (even though one would never desire to truly tame it). However, it likewise produces what I imagine is a very similar consistent detachment from "being in the moment", which is not always pleasant or desirable.Fi/Se/Ni/Te

?&gt;Learn Basque

You could tranquilize me and have me wake up naked in the indigenous tribe of Basque, bound and chained to a tree with no possession but for 12 full volumes of Rosetta Stone books within my reach, you having given the key to the Basque Tribal Chief who will forfeit it to me if he understands my request, and guess what, I'm *still* going to try to burn the paper to send up a distress signal for search and rescue rather than attempt to learn some ridiculous impractical foreign language in order to escape the situation you put me in, the only situation in which learning Basque will ever have any utility for me, because you just *had* to go so far as to kidnap an innocent man to demonstrate how "quirkysmart" ENTPs are, didn't you??I'm curious as to the extent of your prognostication. Reading between the lines, I'm presuming you're predicting that the U.S. economy as a whole will crash -- if so, by what means exactly? How, specifically, would the dominoes fall?Ladies and gentlemen, I think we found a winner of the naughty person contest.&gt;3.An attempts to impose on the ENTp some regular obligations will be received by him with exceptionally hostility. It will be perceived as someone's evil intent: this means that somebody is bothered by his innate desire to be free in his activities, thoughts, and plans. This means that somebody wants to "rein him in", somebody wants to "use him to haul water on his back". The question is: Who? Who is he, this evildoer? The "evildoer" will be quickly found and war will be declared on him or her "until a victorious end". Anyone who is close to this person can also land into the ranks of "enemies". This can be ENTp's close relative, spouse, friend, boss, etc. It is useless to convince the ENTp that these demands are being made in his own interests and for his own livelihood — how would anyone else know his interests better than himself?! An ENTp who concentrates all his strengths and thoughts on "a war with the windmills" is always a tragedy, always a sad and unpleasant event to witness. An inexhaustible rich fantasy, meticulously gathered information, brilliantly constructed game plan — all of this gets directed towards undermining his former boss, giving his former mother-in-law a heart attack, depriving his former spouse of living space ...

This is grandiose and absurd. Yes, ENTPs are deeply annoyed by any perceived arbitrary obligations forced upon them. But none except the most juvenile and immature ENTP would assign the label of "evil" to the person suggesting the arbitrary obligations -- and only an ENTP with severe mental health issues would "go to war . . . to give his former mother-in-law a heart attack" over it. That is ridiculous.

-

&gt;4.Literally with every step the ENTp creates situations in which everybody present becomes extremely uneasy regarding his behavior, not to mention the people closest to him, who often want to vanish into thin air from embarrassment. For example, take this situation (described by A. S. Griboyedov in his comedy Woe from Wit): an ENTp comes to meet the relatives of his fiancé. During a conversation, he expands the discussion to socio-political topics and, not concurring with the views of the majority of those present, he tells each of them the most unpleasant things. The fiancé and her relatives are shocked by both the situation itself and that they are being called "pathetic and puny people, incapable of thinking". In the end, the engagement is broken off, and the ENTp is left to deliberate about how many halfwits and bastards are in this world. These unceremonious and rude behaviors that are characteristic of the ENTp, such as presumptuousness, imposition, indelicacy, bordering on boorishness, total disregard for decency, all of these are trifles compared to the truly serious problems that happen in the process of ILE's personal relationships at closer distances.

Is the ENTP a 15-year-old moderator of r/politics who randomly stumbled out of his parents' basement? That scenario has nothing to do with being an ENTP; it has to do with being an asshole. A mature ENTP will have functional Fe, and would feel shame even considering calling the relatives of his fiance "pathetic and puny people, incapable of thinking" because of a stupid conversation on politics.

ENTPs are generally very open to contrary points of view (as long as they are plausible), and ask questions in an attempt to expand the scope of inquiry to reach truth. There is hardly ever maliciousness involved in their "debates", particularly in comparison to the argument-style of many other types.

-

&gt;5.Sometimes the ENTp starts sorting out his relations with people who are close to him (his wife, brother, mother, mother-in-law, and other relatives) in populated and completely unsuitable for this places: on public transport, during guest visits, at the theater, during a presentation or lecture, in the presence of other people or even common acquaintances, which only aggravates the uneasiness of the situation. In this situation, the "guilty person" must not only blush from frankly boorish behavior of ILE, not only listen to his insults, which are often unjustified and go far beyond the limits of decency, but also suffer excruciatingly from shame before other people due to the uneasiness and publicity of the situation itself, and their connection to this angry person. In such instance the ILE may be monstrously cruel: the situation is intuitively planned by him in such a way that it is impossible to find a way out of it. While there is an audience around, this "public execution" will continue. (It should not be thought, however, that the ENTp starts these arguments only in the presence of outsiders; they are possible in any situation, but in every instance the ENTp will try to foresee the moment when his partner will be especially defenseless and vulnerable.)

The only situation I could see this happening in would be if the ENTP had, for a substantial period of time, suspected the individual of covertly undermining him/her in some important aspect of life (relationships, career, etc.), and then that person made a comment that was the "straw that broke the camel's back". ENTPs are not naturally prone to making "unjustified insults that go far beyond the limits of decency", especially with people whose relationships are important. ENTPs tend to be more sarcastically ambivalent in their insults, rather than monstrously and directly cruel just for the sake of it.

Who authored this nonsense? (If it was you, OP, then no offense intended my friend -- but you're very off base).Replace stupid with irrelevant and you're right on the money.ISTJ. They're so damn conscientious that it'd take you a year to even convince them to hear you out as to why this isn't totally irrelevant and impractical.

Then you can spend the next 8 months after that convincing their Te that it's actually an accurate methodology.Drugs are bad.If you aren't being facetious about the above "Unhealthy" description applying fully to you, then seriously take some time to evaluate yourself -- lest reality inevitably bitch slap away your hubris and send you spiraling into self-loathing helplessness.Yes, narcissism is a fantastic trait. ^/s ^obviouslyHello all,

I am wondering if anyone can shed some light onto what I have dubbed "Borderline Types" -- that is, people who are so close on the (E vs. I), (N vs. S), (T vs. F), and/or (P vs. J) spectrum that they simply cannot be classified.

What brings this up is I have a very close friend so I have been consistently unable to "type" -- I simply cannot identify her function stack. So I had her take a few tests, and on every one she scored only *a single digit preference* (i.e. under 10%) for E/I, N/S, and T/F categories. It would appear as if she does not fit clearly into any of the 16 archetypes.

Has anyone here experienced the same? Are there advantages to being so "borderline" (like the ability to consciously access both intuition and sensing depending on what the situation calls for)? I'm interested to hear your thoughts!(1) A scavenger hunt

•	ENTJ:  One ENTJ, but at minimum three Sensor-doms to delegate the tasks to and then get discouraged at when done “improperly”…finally ending in the ENTJ doing it himself somewhat mediocrely.

•	ENTP:  One. But if he forgets to buy the lightbulb while at the store (probability: high), or shows up at the store an hour after it’s closed (probability: higher), then the ENTP may spend the rest of the day designing (via candlelight) the most innovative breakthrough in lightbulb technology since when Thomas Jefferson went public with the original lightbulb startup.

•	ISFP:  Three. One to whine that it’s dark, another to try and persuade some other type into fixing it for them, and one more to remind the group that this experience will only make them stronger in the end.

•	ENFP:  One, assuming you bring the broken lightbulb to their attention. Otherwise it may require several days, possibly weeks or months, of the ENFP using their phone for light before realizing the lightbulb should probably be changed now. Alternative: rationalizing that living in darkness is cutting back on energy use and they are just doing their part to save the planet.

•	INFJ:  Uncertain… The lightbulb has to really *want* to change. The INFJ is willing to help though, but the lightbulb needs to open up and express itself first.

•	ESFJ:  Two. One to screw it in, and another ESFJ for him or her to call and tell about it for the subsequent four hours.

•	INTP:  One, but not until after a rigorously controlled research session about the history and current state of the lightbulb as a tool and the most efficient methods of modern-day lightbulb changing. (Note: Do not expect results on Day 1.)

•	INTJ:  N/A. Is already making computer-generated models of his new, better lightbulb and scoffing inwardly about the impracticality of the ENTP’s stupid bulb design (even though at this point the ENTP has already moved on to solar panels made out of layered sheets of magnifying glass). 

•	ISTP:  One, installing the best, most cost-effective bulb on the market and getting it done quickly and efficiently. 

•	ISFJ:  N/A. The ISFJ is perfectly content just sitting in the dark.

•	ENFJ:  N/A because the lightbulb doesn’t want to be changed, so the ENFJ is going to love the lightbulb for being exactly what it is and not changing just because other people think it could be better.

•	INFP:  N/A. But you will get an abstract painting and/or poem entitled “My Journey within the Darkness that is My Soul” after the INFP has a sudden realization that the lack of light is symbolism for the inner struggle (or something).

•	ISTJ:  One, and you won’t see it because he will have it fixed it before you knew it broke. If the ISTJ buys a brand of bulbs that don’t fit, though, or the experience is in any other way negative, then he will never dare try to change another lightbulb for the rest of his life.

- *Narcissism* is an egotistical preoccupation with self. Because of all their experience with maintaining their self image, people who score high for narcissism will often appear charming but their narcissism will later lead to extreme difficulty in developing close relationships.

- *Machiavellianism* is a tendency to be manipulative and deceitful. It usually stems from a lack of respect or disillusionment for others.

- *Psychopathy* reflects shallow emotional responses. The relative lack of emotions leads results in high stress tolerance, low empathy, little guilt and leads them to seek extremely stimulating activities, resulting in impusivity and a disposition towards interpersonal conflict.

All who feel comfortable, please list MBTI type and Dark Triad score, and also feel free to talk about any surprises or insights you attained.

**EDIT:** Your Raw Scores are meaningless without your Percentile Scores, which are displayed on the right of your Results Page.Put another way: Which type would you *least like* to face in a random game of intense strategy, where the stakes are life and death?

Why?I am curious how all you expert-typers distinguish Se (Extroverted Sensing) from Te (Extroverted Thinking) in others.

Both are very "active" functions.

What would be the clearest differences between an individual with dominant Se vs. an individual with dominant Te?I'll start with just a few:

- ENFP:  Head of networking and outreach

- INTP:  Head of research

- ISTP:  Head of technology and development

- ISFJ:  Head of inner-team HR

- INFP:  Head of marketing and branding

- INFJ:  Inner-team consultant and fixer for other teams

- INTJ:  Head of analytics and strategic planning

- ENTJ and ESTP and ISTJ:  Co-project managers and head administratorsWhat additional or complementary information does it generate?How could you choose between the two?

Think about what sort of dark age of innovation the world would exist in if there were no INxJ / ENxP and ENxJ / INxP duos out there. Earth would get like 25% less interesting overnight!Your Te drives you to feel comfort when you've organized the external environment.

My Ti drives me to feel comfort when I've organized my internal environment. (For example, ensuring my beliefs are built upon a well-reasoned foundation, and trying to find schemas within which to "store" all the new information I'm bringing in.)

So that messy room, or tardiness, or forgetfulness of some deadline (all things which you feel good when you control) -- for me, those are insignificant. If I brought up a random, abstract theory to you and then asked you on the spot to justify your reasoning about the theory, the level of natural care you would have is the same as my natural care for general disorder.

This is one of the reasons why ISTJs and ENTPs can make great teams -- *if and only if* they deeply understand and tolerate one another's differences.Immature ENTPs who have not developed their tertiary Fe can come across as quite narcissistic.

Very mature ENTPs have worked on their tertiary Fe, and they also recognize it as a weak point (and thus place more focus on it). These ENTPs are actually quite compassionate, on the whole, to people whom they are close with.As an ENTP, I find that social "games" wherein people hide what they really want are silly and pointless. I would have way more respect for someone who expressed a genuine interest in working with me (presuming that interest is not built on a foundation of emotional neediness). I love people who know how to get straight to the point smoothly and tactfully.

&gt; I’ll say “by the way, Main teacher’s name told us to think about the TPE groups, I’ve been thinking about it during the weekend. I was thinking that my group would be *friend’s name, you and me. I think we’d work very well. What do you think?”

I think this is solid. Just be sure to avoid 'analysis paralysis', where you avoid taking an action because you haven't planned said action perfectly yet. In this scenario, try to err on the side of action. Good luck and God bless. :)

Disclaimer:  These could be "me" traits rather than ENTP traits. Please take with a grain of salt.&gt;He wants people to consider his feelings yet has a hard time even recognizing other people's feelings

Have you tried using rational language to describe emotional content? E.g.:

*"I went out of my way earlier to be considerate of the need you expressed, because your needs are important to me. When I asked you to do the same for me, your choice of words and tone of voice seemed very flippant, and made me feel like my well-being was not a priority of yours. And this makes me feel hurt and unwanted by you. Please try harder in the future to consider how your actions look to me and how I can be affected by them."*

-

I ask because of the possibility that he wants to meet your emotional needs, but literally doesn't understand how. (It's also possible that he actually is just a narcissist, but better to rule out all other options first.)Keep reading people in a friendly way and make them comfortable -- it's what makes us charming.

Furthermore, adopt a policy of Radical Honesty. Next time you have an opportunity to lie, don't do it, even (and especially) if you won't get caught. Then continue with this pattern of behavior as much as possible.

This doesn't mean be a jerk. It doesn't mean say everything that comes to your mind without using any sort of filter, nor does it mean phrasing honest opinions to intentionally hurt others. It simply means to stop tolerating dishonesty from yourself -- sooner rather than later, you'll realize how immensely valuable this way of living is, and you'll stop tolerating dishonesty from others as well.

Practice this a little bit and watch your feeling of camouflage fade away. Will you still be lonely? Possibly. But it's a huge step in the right direction.By definition, you cannot be an INFP if your Ne is stronger than your Fi.

Based on the description given, you strike me as an Fi user rather than a Ti user.

Is it possible you are an ENFP? (Ne, Fi, Te, Si)Dude ISTPs are awesome. You guys are absolutely brilliant!&gt;I'm an ENFP with a Capricorn Moon, and it really does seem to me that the capricorn in me puts the brakes on my type at times.

alt+F4People don't use pottery to claim they can predict the future. (Same with vases.)Thank you.

&gt;*It seems constantly to be affected by objective data, drawing only those conclusions which substantially agree with these. (Te)*

&gt;*Sensation has a preferential objective determination, and those objects which release the strongest sensation are decisive for the individual's psychology. (Se)*

Honestly this seems like two ways of saying virtually the same thing. I was with you until these parts.INTP:

Ti (dominant/hero)

Ne (auxiliary/parent)

Si (tertiary/child)

Fe (inferior)

FOR REFERENCE:

-

---

-

Ti (Introverted Thinking)("Understanding"): Thinking that is formulated internally. Ti builds a logical "map" of the world around it. That map is constantly edited when new information is brought in.

Te (Extroverted Thinking)("Evaluating"): Thinking that is externally-driven. Te draws conclusions by collecting external data points.

*Ti may reject external data points that contradict the logic of a deeply-held theory. Ti will explain things to you by starting at the beginning and building your understanding of the whole system. On the other hand, Te will reject a theory that contradicts clear external data. Te will explain things to you by appealing to factual information.*

-

---

-

Fi (Introverted Feeling)("Value-focused"): Feeling that is formulated internally. Often, these feelings have a deep foundation in an individual's personal and evolving sense of morality with respect to any given situation.

Fe (Extroverted Feeling)("Harmony-driven"): Feeling that is driven by other people and their emotional states. Fe seeks group cohesion, unity, and comradery.

*A good way to understand the difference between Fi and Fe is to think Morals (Fi) vs. Ethics (Fe). While morals refer to an individual's personal sense of right and wrong, ethics refer to external codes of proper behavior.*

-

---

-

Ne (Extroverted Intuition)("Abstraction"): Ne attempts to "connect-the-dots" between outside data points. Ne is very free-flowing and unconstrained. It is as useful at innovating new systems as it is weird. Ne exists in what can best be described as the "metaphysical" realm of operation.

Si (Introverted Sensing)("Familiarity"): Si operates using stored memories of previous sensory experiences that relate to the current situation. Si frequently values tradition. It also can act to perceive internal sensations of the individual's physical body.

*While Ne and Si work together and are inseparable from one another, Ne seeks to develop new and better sets of standards through a process of unconstrained innovation. This is in tension with Si, which seeks the safety and reliability of previously-proven standards based upon past experiences.*

Two ways to figure out if you are an INTP or an INFP (I'm assuming that confusion is why you posted this question):

(1) See whether Ti or Fi makes more sense as your dominant/hero function -- i.e., the function that you relate to most clearly.

(2) Or, see whether Fe or Te makes more sense as your inferior function -- i.e., the function that is there, but barely, and causes you problems in your personal life due to its difficulty to master.This was the most insightful commentary of the thread.&gt;Often I feel like people and life move at too much speed and I can’t compare to it. I must reflect and sort out my feelings before making any decisions. Also, sometimes i feel like like I can’t figure out the big picture,

&gt;I withdrawn from people too much, because I can’t stay with them for too long and I fear I can’t meet their expectations.

&gt;I become oversensitive and I take everything personally;

&gt;I keep writing lists to organize my life and my thinking. I really need to follow a schedule to feel in control towards the long-term goals

&gt;I fear success, self-exposure, and possible humiliation but I'm also competitive and interested in making something of myself in the world.

&gt;I’m too sensitive to criticism and quite romantic and passionate. I experience many intense feelings in a day and tend toward melancholy and melodrama. I think i must have one of the worst coping mechanisms ever.

&gt;My tendence is to overanalyze my own feelings.

&gt;I’m always analyzing myself and rationalizing my feelings, considering the pros and the cons of an emotional choice, and trying to make sense of my feelings.

My diagnosis:  You are an **ISFJ** [Si, Fe, Ti, Ne] with a slightly heightened grasp of Ti in comparison to the average ISFJ.

(Fun fact, as a female this is also the statistically most likely result.)

(Also note:  You list traits that contradict the ISFJ characterization but there's a non-negligible possibility that you are projecting these traits based on how you want to be viewed / think you are viewed, rather than your actual inner makeup.)

&gt; I'm sure I'm an INTUITIVE over the SENSOR

Yea sorry I disagree :PDepends if you mean generally speaking, or when they are mad at you.How do you format bigger text in old reddit editing mode, ISTP friend?Come at me w/ the gag bro I'm taking your team overGreat you're hired for the team. When can you start?&gt;I can conquer the world killing everybody with a deadly disease

You gonna live in a bubble suit on top of a mountain?I would actually posit to you that a given type is most easily manipulated through leverage of their "Blind Spot" or "Trickster" shadow function -- that is, the inverse of their tertiary (3rd) function (i.e., Fi if the tertiary is Fe; or Se if the tertiary is Si; etc.)

*"The shadow is the part of us that others see, but we don’t.”* - John Beebe (psychologist and Jungian analyst)

Hypothetically, the mind relies heavily on the "Trickster" function only when exposed to trauma, as a means to keep information *out* of one's consciousness. Thus our mind, if untamed, is inherently *untruthful* to ourselves with respect to this function's use. For this reason (the relationship to untruth), intentional leverage of the Trickster function by others can cause manipulation to go undetected for extended periods.

Again, this is all very hypothetical -- but I have noticed this vulnerability specifically in my own self. (And I explain this not as a blueprint on how to manipulate others for bad, but rather, to show how to recognize when others are manipulating your Blind Spot, for positive.)I was not expecting a reply of that quality at 2 a.m. Thank you, that was particularly coherent and insightful.I don't at all mean to be offensive -- but if my emotional state swung like that for little things such as online personality tests, I'm not sure if life would be an awesome rollercoaster or a terrifying freefall from a skyscraper. However, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be anything other than one of those two extremes.I would describe ENTJs as anything but "squishy."cuz we're *wicked smaht*I'm sure, however, that others have put their rent money on black because their horoscope told them it was their lucky week.

While no doubt it can lead to creative thought as well, which is great, I view anything that creates a gateway to mysticism as something to be avoided -- primarily because my Christian beliefs warn against such practices. I don't view it merely as something 'silly but harmless', which is why astrology sketches me out. 

Anyway, just my two pennies.Except Sarah SilvermanNe is water, Ni is fire, Se is wind, Si is earth.

(Water/Ne can extinguish fire/Ni, but fire/Ni can boil water/Ne. Fire/Ni needs wind/Se to grow, but too much wind/Se can cause fire/Ni to extinguish. Water/Ne can reshape the boundaries of earth/Si, but without earth/Si the water/Ne will flow aimlessly. Wind/Se seeks earth/Si to be the recipient of its motion, but too much wind/Se can result in earth/Si becoming disordered.)

-

Te categorizes external data, Ti creates internal hypotheses, Fe connects through emotion, Fi judges on principle.&gt;Example for bad tradition: **not allowing** Jews and Muslims to eat pork.

The way you phrased that is pretty hilarious. As if Jews and Muslims go out to restaurants and try to order a pork dish, but if the restaurant sees them in their yamaka or hijab, they "don't allow" them to order it. (Rather than Jews and Muslims choosing not to eat pork because they voluntarily elect to follow the edicts of their heritage, based on their own analysis of what's important to their happiness.)Not to knock you dude -- you seem like a cool guy -- but situations where you're getting handjobs from taken women while speeding out are not the type of thing to seek for long term fulfillment.Generally speaking, women are a lot less visually-oriented than men when it comes to attraction. If a woman likes you to begin with, the vast majority aren’t going to care about something like that. As long as you are seeking out the right kind of woman, and focus on being the best version of yourself, I believe you’ll be all good.Great workyour*Not the greatest quote, but the artwork is excellent.

Blasphemy!

Burn the heretic I say!This essay is a diamond in the sewage that is reddit. This is the kind of post I'd like to see more of, instead of the useless one-liners and trolling remarks. Please post more!To get a little more clarification, what exactly is your job in software? Are you an engineer? If so, what kind? Applications, systems, web, network, etc.? If not, are you in UX, or a requirements analyst, etc.? More specifics would be helpful.I am not a psychologist, do not consider myself to be an "expert" at typing by any stretch of the imagination, and the more I learn about Jung's typology, the more I have come to appreciate people's unique characteristics as well as what they have in common, and how little I really know. If you're serious about wanting to learn to type people using this particular typing system, then I think reading the primary sources on this is incredibly helpful. It's hard work though, but then again, you have to ask yourself, do you really want to learn this stuff in depth and use it to develop yourself, or is it just a passing curiosity? I firmly believe that the benefits go far beyond typing, to included spiritual and emotional development. That said, it took me many months to work through *Psychological Types*. It's not easy to understand...Here are the books I would recommend:

Carl Jung: *Psychological Types* and *The Question of Psychological Types*

J.H. Van der Hoop: *Character and the Unconscious* and *Conscious Orientation*

Marie-Louise Von Franz: *The Inferior Function*

Isabel Myers: *Gifts Differing*

CelebrityTypes is also quite good, and tries to stay true to the original system, unlike some other authors out there.Just to nitpick a little: If you are a male INTJ, then your type is 2-6% of the population, and if you're female, it's 1-3%. 

Source: https://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm?bhcp=1

I purchased a massive dataset from CPP, MBTI's research division at considerable expense. It has millions of datapoints. I know how much INTJs love facts, so here's the deal: I'm going to assume you're male and well-educated. If I'm wrong on both counts, then yes, people with your personality type (assuming you really are an INTJ) are very rare, somewhere around ~2-3% for males, and ~1% for females. If I'm right in my assumption though, you are part of a select group of people in terms of gender/education. As educational attainment increases in any given sample, so does the percentage of XNXX aka intuitives. In the context of college-educated and above males, the data indicates INTJs are not as rare as you think, probably around 5-6% or even higher potentially. The reason I say that is because for my ENTP dataset that had over 600,000 total surveys from males, and nearly 50,000 ENTPs, the percentage of ENTPs in that sample was over the upper bound of CAPT's estimated 7% for male ENTPs. My sample was largely of full-time employees or self-employed workers who had been employed continuously for at least 2 years and reported being satisfied with their jobs. This may or may not have been a confounding factor. Just wanted to point out that gender and educational attainment make a very big difference and should not be left out of consideration.

But yeah, otherwise I agree with your point.Most people including yours truly are not all that smart or interesting. It's just the way of the universe. Intelligence, charisma, sense of humor, insightfulness, etc. all probably fall on a Gaussian (they are normally distributed). Most threads are largely bullshit that doesn't add much value to your life except as a source of pointless entertainment at best and negativity, unpleasantness, and pain at worst. And my post probably isn't telling you anything you don't already know, so file it under "bullshit" as well.I bought the dataset a few months ago, and I believe it covers everything that's in their database from 2008-2015. I am back in school for computer science after 4 years as a teacher and wanted to figure out where people with my personality type end up career-wise. I  looked at several published books on this but found the data to be too superficial, which led me to go directly to CPP for a more accurate dataset. The infomation I got on occupations and type basically confirmed a lot of my hunches, but also contradicted much of the other data that's out there. Because I can see myself in so many different occupations, it's helpful to have information that narrows down the list.Are you a teacher? Why are you asking?&gt;I need help with typing myself. I've read so much, like, WAY too much and I've asked on forums about my type before but I still don't feel 100% about it.

Have you read these books?

Carl Jung: *Psychological Types* and *The Question of Psychological Types* (The second is actually not as necessary)

JH Van der Hoop: *Character and the Unconscious* and *Conscious Orientation*

Marie Louise Von Franz: *The Inferior Function*

Isabel Myers: *Gifts Differing* (You might want to start with this one actually as it is the easiest to understand)

CelebrityTypes.com (the whole site is good)

"Most people do not know what they're talking about when it comes to typing."
 
I've seen many people who are actually not very knowledgeable about this whole system make the above statement, and yet I am going to make it here as well not because I'm an expert (I'm not), but simply because it's an easily observable fact that the vast majority of people on these forums have not actually done their due diligence. I know you want an answer, but ultimately, you're in the best position to type yourself. If you want to be lazy and risk not typing yourself accurately according to this system, that's fine, but if you really, really want to get an accurate understanding of your psychic architecture according to Jung, then there is no substitute for reading the books I mentioned above.

Based on your description, I could see an NF type, but NT is also possible. Hard to tell just from this if you're an extravert or introvert. Could be ENFP, INFP, ENTP or INTP. I would lean heavily in the direction of P, but then again, I've also known INTJs who didn't have their shit together at all when they were younger, only to make a massive 180 later. Probably also N given that you seem to be good at expressing yourself verbally and intuitives outnumber sensors on these forums anyway, but typing is a tricky business and you shouldn't get your guidance from anyone on a forum in my opinion, including me ;).This guy actually doesn't seem all that bad. As far as ESTJs go, he could be a lot worse. I've only known 2 confirmed ESTJs and both have been unpleasant to say the least. Sadistic tendencies, nitpicking at everything people say, enforcing their view of the world as it should be on others...basically intellectual thugs. This guy thankfully is into "personal development" (of course that may just be a marketing tactic), but if he is sincere, then I'm hopeful he actually does value points of view different from his own. Skeptical though as it could be he just values different *competencies* from his own, which is a completely different thing entirely. I actually think the latter is more likely. In any case, my experiences thus far have made me want to avoid ESTJs in general like the plague. ENTP and ESTJ are like oil and water in my opinion.Yes absolutely. The job tables online are only somewhat accurate anyway. In reality, INTJs are found in every occupation you can imagine, but then again, I would contend that they are probably going to be happiest in certain kinds of roles. Artist is an unusual choice of occupation for an INTJ, but if it affords the opportunity to build a business and/or make a real impact, then yeah, I can see the appeal for an INTJ. I would be surprised if many INTJs would be truly content just making art for art's sake though.So I'm in my 30s, but I too hope to one day have some ESTJ friends that I get along with. I've read Carl Jung, Marie Louise Von Franz, Isabel Myers, JH Van der Hoop, Keirsey, Quenk, and many other authors who created or contributed to this personality typing system. Based on what I've seen, and judging by who's on this forum, it's unusual to find SJ types interested in this topic, so I'm impressed that you are, but I'm not convinced that you're trying to do anything other than promote your video here, which is fine too. 

That said, if you really do want to grow, and you're sincere in that desire, for which I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, then in my opinion, the single greatest weakness of ESTJs and ISTJs, is the rigidity of their views. I noticed this tendency in the video:

"I like to have my friends be quite different than I am, even though **I wished that they picked up some of the habits or have the same ambitions that I have**...If I know that I have friends that **specialize in something that I'm weak at, I'm gonna be able to grow from it**, but at the same time I'm like **'dude, why ain't you doing this? why don't you do what I'm doing? what the heck?**...For Trey for instance, I wanted him to join a student organization or be active in Meridian...**What the heck were you doing in 2015?**"

The theme here is that there is an underlying resentment when your friends don't have the same aspirations, values or views as you do. That said, I mentally applauded when I saw that you overcame this resentment through humor. That was really great to see, because I think that's one of the best ways that ESTJs can interact smoothly with other types. 

Seeking friendship with people who have different competencies from your own is a step in the right direction, but it's too easy. Anyone can do it. The real weakness of ESTJs, and I'm not saying this to be a jerk, is that they have a very difficult time putting themselves in other people's shoes: In other words, seeing the world from someone else's perspective and not getting annoyed by opinions/actions that contradict the *objectively right* way of doing things. 

ESTJs are indispensable in my opinion. Without them, it would be incredibly difficult to maintain a functioning society. Their conviction and assertiveness, which is evident in the video, makes them excellent organizers and leaders. That said, those strengths can also be potential weaknesses if they're unable to back away from their own convictions and make room for alternative points of view. 

I'll just end this with an example to make it concrete. Say your job is running a division of a company. If one of your employees suggests an idea that you 100% *know* will screw things up, that's when your conviction is a strength. But if you don't actually know for sure, and if the idea kind of bothers you, that's the time to step back and reevaluate. Engage your auxiliary Si by assimilating more facts from other people on the team, and then make your decision. Perception without judgment is spineless, but judgment without perception is blind. I'll leave it to you to determine which of those two is most problematic for you. 

Anyway, that's just my two cents.Completely understandable, and for what it's worth, I think there are *loads* of INTJs in computer science. In my research program last summer, there were 10 students, 2 were male INTJs, 1 confirmed 1 not, and the director of the program was an INTJ (unconfirmed). In just my little group of friends I personally know 1 male (unconfirmed) and 2 female INTJs (confirmed). The data I've seen also suggests that computers are an extremely attractive choice for this personality, everything from hardware to software to research. Anyway, just saying you're not alone. What kind of art are you into?Just meditate. It's really a two-pronged approach: concentration meditation helps you calm your mind so it becomes settled. The rest of the time when you're out and about, cultivate mindfulness. I'm a Buddhist so this is just part of the package deal when you sign up for the religion (and it's not really a "religion" if you ask me...more like a roadmap for psychological wellbeing). I'm definitely trying to get more acolytes so since you sound like you have a problem, consider this my attempt to convert and assimilate you into the collective...Seriously though, even if you don't convert, the psychological research is pretty clear on this. It was even in my PSYCH 100 textbook, so meditation/mindfulness has become mainstream at this point. Be cool or be a tool. :)

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_From_the_Perspective_of_the_Five-Factor_Model_of_Personality

The authors, McCrae &amp; Costa are notable Big 5 psychologists. But Big 5 measures traits, whereas MBTI, while arguably also measuring traits, is really based on a system that portends to examine an individual's cognitive orientation. It's subtle, but the difference is significant.While I appreciate the invite, I don't really feel like going on Youtube. Plus, I don't think I'm an expert on this stuff by any stretch, so my personal interpretation may actually be wrong in some ways. FWIW, Jung thought it was impossible and maybe even dangerous to try to consciously "embrace" your inferior. Reason being that it is completely submerged in the unconscious. Trying to develop the inferior before you even have a good handle on all your other functions is a recipe for disaster. I'll give you an example. My father is an ISTJ in his 70s. It's only now in his 6-7th decade of life that I'm seeing him reaching out to his inferior Ne. He's not so rigid in his opinions, and he sees the value in my perspective, and indeed, he even enjoys being a stand-up comic when the opportunity presents itself. That's something he never would have risked for most of his life. But I'm guessing you're nowhere near that old are you?

However, Jung did say that it was possible and recommended to elevate the auxiliary. Focus on Ti, not Si. Productivity is something I continue to struggle with even now in my early 30s. There are 2 things that have helped:

1) Meditation. I became a Buddhist. I try to be mindful at all times. I meditate morning and evening. This is probably the most important thing I've ever done.

2) OmniFocus and iCal on my iPhone. I use the former to keep track of my to-do list. I use the latter for scheduling. This off-loads all those pesky details into digital memory and relieves me of trying to keep everything in my biological memory. Keeping track of facts and details is something Si types are pretty good at I've found, but I've always sucked at it...so I let a computer do it for me. It takes a big cognitive load off.

Anyway...just be careful. You don't need to try to be a different person to be more productive. And keeping to a schedule doesn't mean you can't vary your activities within that schedule...then it won't feel like a "routine." I keep learning new things during meditation, so it's never boring.Thanks for your post. This is an astute observation. I think the real problem here is not the theory, but the fact that people *don't understand* the theory. 

Judging by the comments on here, I think I'm one of a handful of people on reddit that has actually bothered to read *Psychological Types* by Jung cover-to-cover as well as Von Franz, Myers, Van der Hoop, and a bunch of other well-known MBTI authors including Quenk and Keirsey. These books form the foundation of the system. Reading articles online, which is what most people seem to do, is basically like the blind leading the blind. Everyone needs to do their due diligence. MBTI is just a test, but the underlying type system is not behavioral. It's a cognitive orientation or "psychic architecture" if you will. Everything you described suggests, and I'm not trying to be mean here, that you yourself have not reached this level of understanding yet, even if you do see that there are obviously large variations of behavior within a single type.

The data on type and occupation, which I have purchased directly from CPP, MBTI's research division, clearly indicates that while there are definite patterns in occupational choice and type, every occupation has every type. So if you know an INFP engineer, that doesn't surprise me one bit; it's just that INFPs on the whole are *under-represented* as engineers relative to their prevalence in the general population. Nothing is going to change that fact. If you meet an engineer in the future and are trying to type that person, probability dictates that a feeling type should be low on your list of possibilities. Engineering is dominated by male, T, S, and J. 

As for your INTJ boss, I have found that as a rule, INTJs do tend towards narcissism, however, I have also met many that are not. Does that mean the tendency is nonexistent? Of course not. The correlation is still there, and nothing will change that fact. However, I agree with you that if an INTJ acts condescending and then blames it on type (or not), I too would take issue with that. 

In any case, I think you are right to make a post about this since the theory has the potential to be used improperly, but in my view that is a result of the laziness of people who use it, not the theory itself.LOL. How do you "know" this? Not trying to be mean, but if you "use" one, then the other will be unconscious and not under conscious control. Have you taken the test, and if so what was your result? Let's start there.Ok then INFJ should be your starting point in my opinion. The test is wrong on a single dimension 50% of the time. Instead of looking at the functions, it might help to step back and just treat the letters as independent dimensions. Are you energized by being around other people? Meaning, could you imagine spending your working life constantly interacting with others in a team and be happy about it or would you prefer to spend most of your working time alone? Do you care more about the here and now (what is) or about what could be (what is not)? Do you think in terms of cause and effect or is every decision related to some sort of value system? Do you like to have things settled in advance or postpone as long as possible (do you have a problem with procrastination)? If you are uncertain, then there really is only one solution...Have you read the following books?

Jung: Psychological Types 

Jung: The Question of Psychological Types

Van der Hoop: Character and the Unconscious

Van der Hoop: Conscious Orientation

Von Franz: The Inferior Function

Myers: Gifts Differing

Also: celebritytypes.com has some of the better articles out there, and they've done their due diligence as well and even added some interesting ideas such as psychological disorders.

Uncertainty/doubt would lend itself to Ne, not Si. CelebrityTypes also has some interesting type tests you might like to take that are not as obvious as the MBTI. &gt;Science is based on the testing of quantifiable data. And personality can't really be quantified or tested. So it falls into one of the weaknesses of science that everyone seems to overlook.

But that's not true. Personality can be quantified and reliably assessed. There's decades of research on this, and it keeps getting closer to the theoretical limit of what's possible using self-report surveying.

&gt;It shouldn't be used to describe or prescribe outside the very specific definition of what that category includes.

I relate to the ENTP "type" more than any other, and I've read *Psychological Types* cover-to-cover. I could see myself enjoying marketing. My question here is why hasn't the field of personality psychology provided the same kinds of insights? And if they have, where are they?&gt;This is false. MBTI itself is descriptive.
The difference between the MBTI assessment and the big-five is that the latter measures traits, while the former indicates type (basically presents a hypothesis of type). MBTI type theory describes general behaviours and thought patterns of personality types, it does not prescribe what they will do.

Fixed.

&gt;As to your question, the big-five comes from academia, so you should be able to find this data in published journals or university library databases. Also, "the big-five" or "five factor model" is just a model; try searching for NEO Personality Inventory or NEO PI or NEO PI-R (a common assessment of personality based on this model).

I'm well aware of the NEO PI, but from what I can tell, they're not using it to help people choose careers. My question is why not? You may or may not know the answer, but the thread was meant to generate a conversation about why they haven't pulled together to do this in a comprehensive fashion.How do you know there aren't clusters though? What does "quite often" mean and how big is the change? Research that I've read suggests tests like the NEO PI-R are fairly reliable which basically refutes the idea that there's much change. If what you're saying is true, then I think we should scrap the whole idea of personality, which I'm not ready to do just yet.Yeah, that's not really what I meant LawBot, but thanks for playing anyway.no not really.reckful is that you?Ok, while you make some good points here, I think there are some holes in your argument:

&gt;scientifically valid

First of all, all self-report tests are subject to several limitations, not the least of which is lack of perfect self-knowledge. A quick Google search will make this clear. The article below mentions the following problems: introspective (dis)ability, honesty, understanding (or lack thereof) of question items, inappropriate rating scales, response bias, problems with using ordinal measures over interval measures...and I'm sure there are many others. The point is, this is a soft science to begin with. Psychometric assessments are a work in progress and an approximation. 

http://www.sciencebrainwaves.com/the-dangers-of-self-report/

Secondly, be careful that you're not falling into confirmation bias (absolutism). Nowhere in your argument do I see you exploring the possibility that the functions and the Big 5 are different ways of *labeling* patterns of traits. Instead of saying someone is low E, high O, low A, low C, we're just labeling them as introverted thinkers. I understand you dislike the lack of precision, but I don't think you can discount the labels simply because of the increased ambiguity. What if most of the people Jung typed as being introverted thinkers did actually get those same results on the Big 5? The functions are a convenient but less precise way of talking about the same thing. This is something that bothers me about the functions and the MBTI as well, but I don't think the world would be a better place without them either.

Thirdly, by typing people as either T or F or E ... the MBTI sacrifices again some reliability for convenience. For example, I mistyped as an INTP for years before realizing I was an ENTP. How did I figure this out? Not by taking the NEO PI-R! I read Jung, Van der Hoop, Von Franz, Myers and most importantly, learned through experience that I was just a brooding (neurotic) extravert. There's no reason people can't use *all* these different personality assessments and take into account a variety of different perspectives. 

Fourth, your dissatisfaction should be directed not towards the MBTI but to the academic psychological community for not developing a publicly-available comprehensive career database using the psychometric assessments they already have at their disposal. The primary market for the MBTI is business. Academia doesn't have anything that comes close to this. In my opinion, the academics and government need to get their act together and fund an additional data gathering effort to correlate personality traits with everything career-related. In an age of increasing automation and uncertainty, this would be a big help for people who are transitioning to new careers or learning how to function in new capacities in the same career during industry upheavals.

FWIW, if you are a young INTP, Jung and Myers would say that you should focus on strengthening that auxiliary Ne so that you're more open to alternative possibilities. I've found that as I've gotten older, my need for precision and exactitude has increased, which is right along the lines of the MBTI developmental perspective (Going from Ne to Ne+Ti) One suggestion I have for you is that next time someone asks for help with their type, encourage them to read the original works by Jung and others and take tests like HEXACO as well, which is available for free here:

http://hexaco.org/
Ok let me address each of these arguments

&gt;I wrote it here:

Ok so you kind of pointed out the limitations. One thing I had not noticed before was this:

&gt;the correlation between your level of extroversion and your ACTUAL level of extroversion compared to the population is not going to be perfect, far from it.

This is not a "correlation." One's actual level of extraversion is an unknown variable. The self-reported measure is just an approximation and subject to change. There are many versions of the five factor model (FFM) tests, of which the NEO PI-R is just one. AFAIK, Hexaco may now be the king of the hill. In any case I believe the NEO PI-R only has high long term test-retest validity for N, O and E, and short-term reliability for the other two. MBTI has also taken to using scales and showing users where they lie on it:

https://www.cpp.com/pdfs/smp261001.pdf

&gt; That's why the big 5 can't be translated into the MBTI, with the theory I propose, in a literal way, it's all still too fuzzy.

This contradicts the conclusions of the authors of the NEO PI-R, McCrae and Costa. There is a great deal of correlation:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2709300

&gt;everything that people say about functions is unclear, flawed, inconsistent, etc.

I would agree with you that there is a lot of misunderstanding online about the functions, and you could argue that their definitions are less exact than those of the FFM scales.

&gt;One word on Jung, his theory about functions (from what I remember) are MUCH more simple and (maybe) coherent than all the other models, why did the community in general flock towards increasingly complicated models? IMO, it's to try to eliminate the big flaws that it had, in the same way that I remember the horoscope incorporating the hour that you were born as a variable, not just the month.

Unfortunately, not many people online have read *Psychological Types* or the other important books concerning the functions by Van der Hoop, Von Franz, or Myers. The definitions are pretty clear even if there are some differences especially between Myers and the rest. If you haven't read these books, then there's no way you can make any claims about the functions. Sorry but it's true. The overwhelming majority of people online have not either, so it's no surprise they get things mixed up.

&gt;That's the thing about MBTI tests - they're complete shit, so many of them have such moronic questions and that's why, it seems to me, the test-retest consistency is so low.

Ok so this is not really a response to what I said, and is a value judgment. The fact of the matter is, people want to be able to take a test to narrow down lists of occupations. The MBTI and Holland Interest Profiler are the only game in town. (Well actually that's not entirely true, there are others but AFAIK none with as much data.)

&gt;Question is: what makes people think that the MBTI is ANY different from all those other things?

So what are you actually saying? Are the MBTI and Big 5 similar or different? That article I referenced is the only one I've been able to find on the issue, and is evidence that they are very highly correlated. My position is that MBTI is far from being "complete shit." Be careful here.

 &gt;If the tests aren't good enough to consistently determine someone's type, then you would see a bigger pattern there.

Big maybe here. The sample size is enormous though. Far larger than anything the academics have. The pattern in occupational choice at least for ENTPs should be obvious to anyone who looks at the data. I would say that's very useful information. The reliability is a completely separate issue.

&gt;Finally, I'd argue that functions aren't even correct in theory. Like I said above, Ne is objective intuition and there's no such thing, everyone's perception is heavily biased or framed in certain ways. Ti is subjective logic, but there's also no such thing, logic is objective and decision making is subjective, if you could generalize that some people have one thing and the others have another thing, even if you think it's a spectrum, you should be able to measure it very easily.

I hate to break it to you, but it looks like you haven't done your homework. I mentioned above that reading the original works by Jung, Van der Hoop, Von Franz, and Myers was crucial to understanding the functions. You clearly do not. I'm not saying this to be mean, but when someone does not even understand Jung's definition of "objective" and "subjective," their argument kind of falls flat. I would advise doing some reading and then re-evaluating. 

&gt;I believed MBTI for a few years, then learned more stuff not related to the MBTI and, over a long period of time, came to change my opinion, I'm not being close minded in the slightest. People here are starting from the presupposition that the function theory is correct and then getting to their inconsistent conclusions, I did that and then I changed to something that's more concrete and all that.

Your points are well-taken, and I agree that there are tests that do a better job of assessing personality than the MBTI. However, I think reading the foundational works *and* taking multiple personality assessments is best for everyone in general.One thing that I've been thinking about is the difference between the Big 5 and Hexaco versions of "Agreeableness" compared to MBTI T/F. They're highly correlated but still different. It might be worthwhile to check out some of the items on IPIP and compare that to the T-F dichotomy items for the MBTI if you can find it. 

http://ipip.ori.org/newIndexofScaleLabels.htm

Here's an "MBTI Test" for example:
https://d3jc3ahdjad7x7.cloudfront.net/spokaLTFBEADL9JnMd7njgJd96nyp7YNgICG2tlJWifcI7GP.pdfDoes he have sadistic tendencies? I mean does he seem to really enjoy it or laugh when he hears or sees or talks about other people getting f*cked up? Does he seem to like taking out his pain on others around him?

If so ESTJ.Are you more avoidant or schizotypal?

http://www.millonpersonality.com/theory/diagnostic-taxonomy/schizotypal.htm

http://www.millonpersonality.com/theory/diagnostic-taxonomy/avoidant.htmThose descriptions characterize an extreme personality disorder, but everyone is susceptible to falling in one direction or another under stress. INFP is linked to avoidant. Have you read Jung, Myers, Van der Hoop, Von Franz? These are the founders of the field. 

Another way to look at this is do you make judgments (not life decisions here) primarily based on cause and effect or on an internal system of values? 

Check out these pages for more:

http://www.celebritytypes.com/infp.php

http://www.celebritytypes.com/intp.php

Who do you relate to more? Also are you sure you're not an extravert? Like ENFP or ENTP for example? You're sure you're a dominant judger and not a dominant perceiver?I'm asking about the inferior. 

http://www.celebritytypes.com/estj.php

http://www.millonpersonality.com/theory/diagnostic-taxonomy/sadistic.htm

CT says that ESTJ is strongly associated with the sadistic personality style. Certainly, I think this is true based on personal experience. Everyone can act like an a**hole sometimes, but the distinction is that some people actually derive a lot of pleasure from this behavior. It amuses and delights them. I'm trying to assess whether or not this is the case with the OP's brother, because if so, I think this would support the typing of ESTJ.Well there's a distinction between TeSi and TeNi. ENTJs are much more likely to be compulsive than sadistic. Personality "styles" just look at what happens when the normal individual is under stress. The descriptions on the website are really of pathological cases but may help shed a clue on a typing nonetheless. 

I've met several ESTJs, and immature ones can be really nasty. Because of those sadistic impulses, and because they have a very hard time putting themselves in other people's shoes, once they upset someone, to see the other person angry/hurt gives them a great deal of perverse pleasure and they keep going on the attack instead of backing down. Obviously this makes a bad situation worse, and may result in permanently damaging their relationships with others.

I had to cut one ESTJ out of my life entirely after the way he behaved. He's alienated many friends and I think now has learned his lesson. I notice he's much quieter and less outspoken than he used to be. Every time he looks at me, I can see the shame in his eyes. It's really sad. :(According to Millon, these are separate styles. That would still just be considered sadistic afaik.I don't think they're opposites, they're just different in the same way that each type is different. It's a different category. Jung thought that the inferior function was the dark side of every personality type, but as you go lower down on the stack, everything becomes fuzzier, more primitive, and less differentiated. Inferior FiNe vs FiSe. I don't know, I guess you just have to observe enough examples of these types in action. ESTJs and ENTJs I know are all very orderly, but when they are highly one-sided, the former tends to be sadistic while the latter is fastidious and orderly to a fault, or maybe more precisely is very bothered when things are out of place.CT characterizes ISFPs as being linked to the dependent style. It's interesting you think you're being sadistic though. I bet your definition of sadism has a very low bar. 

I thought this did a decent job of describing the issue:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-41di8yTwMYeah, it was pretty weird, but well-narrated I thought. I'm happy to hear you don't have this problem. I think it's a pretty horrible one to have. I mean, if I get pissed off or sad, I might lash out at someone, but I wouldn't derive much pleasure from seeing the damage. In fact, if I yell at someone, and they get upset, I'll immediately notice and stop because I feel bad. Unfortunately, sadistic people don't though, because it's amusing, and that's why it must be so tempting for them to hurt others. The shame and regret after the fact is something they then have to carry around with them, on top of the damage inflicted on the victim. So it's really a problem that magnifies itself. I mean compared to the avoidant style for example...if those people get hurt, they just run away. The hurt stays with them. 

It's kind of ironic to me because ESTJs basically want to bring order, peace, security, and stability to the universe, and if they become too one-sided in this pursuit, it turns into sadism, and they end up sowing strife, discord, chaos, and misery, exactly the things they set out to eliminate. While INTJ is possible. I vote INFJ. CT makes an excellent case, and after having read *Psychological Types* cover-to-cover (took me a few months), I would have to agree. At the end of the day, no INTJ would ever express themselves the way Jung did. He goes on and on, and it's so convoluted. If anything INTJs are exactly the opposite. They say what they mean, mean what they say and then just get to what's next. This is true in both writing and speaking. 

Jung was so out there, and as someone else pointed out:

&gt;"It is only possible to live the fullest life when we are in harmony with these symbols; wisdom is a return to them.”

This is Fe. 

http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2016/05/why-jung-is-infj-part-1-how-jung-saw-himself/It's hard to tell right? I think CT is right in asserting valuation aka feeling over thinking. Have you read PT? It's dense sh*t compared to Ayn Rand or Nietzche for example.Woolf is a likely INFP according to CT

http://www.celebritytypes.com/infp.php

Don't know why you type her as INFJ.I hate to say this but you're a bit short on arguments. I mean I read your responses to some of the other posters and it's basically you saying that the writing styles are different and therefore Woolf is "obviously" not INFP. Have you really read Psychological Types in its entirety? How about Von Franz, Van der Hoop, and Myers?

&gt;I think you will find learning the differences between the two language patterns (or characteristic forms) will vastly enhance and expedite your experience of trying to understand people via type; for example **at the putrid Celebrity Mistypes** one finds aqueous author Virginia Woolf typed as an INFP, by learning the difference between Judgerspeak and Perceiverspeak you will be able to look at a representative sample of her writing--even quotes, such as at https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/v/virginia_woolf.html --and **almost instantly know that this typing is inaccurate, even without knowing anything about her or paying heed to the content of her writing.**

Two things: 1) If you want people to take you seriously, it's best not to be condescending. If you disagree with CT, that's fine, just say so. No need for "putrid." 2) Writing style is really only part of the picture. How people speak can lend a clue, but the content of what they're saying matters a lot more. If your whole argument rests on writing style, I would say you need to dig a little deeper.It's a possibility, and if you think you can do it, more power to you. Unfortunately, it's hard to get feedback for this sort of thing. If you read someone's writing and only use the form and never meet them in person so you never have the ability to see how they act, behave, speak, and tell you about themselves, there's no way to really see if you were correct in your assessment. What do Te vs. Ti judgments sound like in your opinion? &gt;The reason we know this has validity is because it has been observed over and over and over in countless individuals of known type. It is part of what it means to be a "J" or "P" and why it matters. I am hardly the only person to notice this, there is certainly more writing on this than the two links above.

Who is we? And what is the other writing that has been done on this topic?

Also, how do you know Emily Deans is INTP and Minger INTJ? 

I've read Keirsey's books. He self-identifies as an INTP. The issue I have with what you're saying is that you're not actually making any arguments. You're still just making assertions. Like it's self-evident. But it's not.Ok so I asked Denise what her type was, and she did in fact confirm she was an INTJ, but borderline on the T/F and J/P. I haven't read enough of her stuff to confirm or deny. I will take you at your word that Deans said she was INTP. I will take a look at the book you reference. As for Rowling, I know she types herself as INFJ and CT mentions that. I'll have to look into that. I tend to agree with them that it's not a good idea to try and type someone from fiction that they wrote. Interviews are more reliable. Also many people mistype, so I think the most you can say is that you "think" this typing is wrong, but you don't "know" for sure.
&gt;You seem to be insisting that because you, yourself, lack confidence in your ability to type people this necessarily applies to all people under all conditions. It doesn't.

Look let's be real here. You started a thread asking people to "make their case" but actually, you really just want to make your own case. That's fine. You'll get no judgment from me on that point. But when you make an argument, it's generally always better to adopt a stance that is not absolutist because then you don't come across as being omniscient. No matter how you look at this, typing is still just an educated guess. Even Jung thought typing someone was tricky and difficult. This is a not a matter of "confidence." In general those who claim to "know" the most actually know very little and those who make no such claims can at least be reasonably assumed (at least at first) not to be suffering from confirmation bias.

&gt;I know that both of these are wrong, that both are in fact INFPs.

Again, please erase the word "know" from your vocabulary in this regard. You mean to say that you "think." Also, please stop referring to CT as *Celebrity Mistypes* because A) people don't know what you're referring to and B) they're no reason to condescend. You're just going to get sh*t on if you keep that up. They make a pretty good case for why Dylan is ISFP and not INFP. You're not the first to raise an objection, and you may be right. But you don't "know." As for Meryl Streep being INFP, there's something to be said for being able to more accurately type others of the same type as yourself, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on that one. ESTP does seem suspect to me. It may be that thinking types have a harder time accurately typing feelers and vice versa.
You lost what little credibility you had. Sorry. I tried. I really did, but I can't take you seriously.I know you care about this stuff, and you obviously have strong convictions. When I say you lost what little credibility you had, it's nothing personal and you shouldn't take it as such. 

1) I don't know you, so your credibility is low to begin with.

2) You make absolutist and in my opinion unwarranted and condescending statements. You don't provide reasons for your beliefs except to say that you can "instantly" tell from someone's writing style what their type is. When challenged about your beliefs, your reaction is to become even more obstinate and reiterate that you just "know." You claim typings made by other people are "wrong" and give no justifications. You call CT a "garbage" website when they arguably are among the best, even if they're not totally accurate. There aren't many other websites where the authors have obviously invested so much time and effort and delved into the literature as they have.

From this kind of behavior, would you honestly take you seriously if you were another stranger you'd just interacted with online? Because in my experience someone who acts this way can be safely assumed to know very little. This is the Dunning-Kruger effect. And that's too bad, because you might actually know something valuable, especially regarding F types, but you're sabotaging yourself with your communication style. Didn't that book by Donna Dunning teach you about this? In my opinion, you need to engage that Ne and think about how you come across to others and question those "ironclad" Fi judgements a little more. 

Ok, I'm done.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effectAccording to the five-factor model of personality, neuroticism is its own dimension, meaning it's not related to the other dimensions. You might try taking this test, which is the current gold standard of academically-validated personality assessments:

http://hexaco.org/

You can then take the MBTI and see how it compares.

Your treatment should not change your type. Are you 100% certain you have ADHD? Because it's widely over-diagnosed.Father: ISTJ

Mother: ESFP

Me: ENTPPossible ENTJIf you really are an ESTJ, which I don't really believe you are, that is refreshing to hear. 

&gt;I absolutely love psychology

I just have a really, really hard time believing that an ESTJ could ever say something like this. No offense. Hope you understand where I'm coming from when I say that. It's just completely at odds with what I know about how ESTJs think.Freud was probably an ISTJ. Totally different animal from ESTJs. I've noticed lots of ISTJs seem to like collecting various ideas and experimental results from psychology. There are a number of ISTJ psychologists.

&gt;my only proper ESTJ friend is into psych, if only as an interest. 

How deep is that interest? Have you ever found out?
I have found the same thing, and I think that's a great explanation.True, but...ESTJs by their own admission tend to prefer black-white over gray. Much of psychology, probably most of it actually, falls into a kind of gray zone. The only parts that might appeal to an ESTJ I think are the conditioning parts (Pavlov) and neuroscience. I doubt the rest would appeal. Too tentative and not concrete enough as another poster mentioned.&gt;It's rare to see ENTPs taking such a black-and-white/ absolute stance on something like this — whether ESTJs enjoy psychology or not.

This stems from numerous experiences I have had with ESTJs that made their loathing of this field abundantly clear. I have nothing but my own experience to go on. Starting this thread is my way of rattling the cage and testing my own beliefs. Is that not ENTP enough for you? 

Also, you're not really adding anything to the discussion except to tell me that "typology is not everything," which implies that you believe there are many ESTJs who enjoy psychology. But how many is "many?" Are we talking like 20% of ESTJs? 50%? 80%? I don't care about the absolute number, only the *relative* percentage. I already know from this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/6173nn/ever_wondered_how_many_subscribers_there_are_in/

that ESTJs are the 2nd smallest subscriber base in the r/MBTI, and that should tell you something already. My math may be wrong but that's 0.5%. I think we can say based on this and what some ESTJs on here have described that while "typology is not everything," in this case it seems to be "almost everything." Ok, that's interesting. Let me tell you my experience:

Like I said to someone else here, I think ISTJs are completely different from ESTJs in this regard. Even from the data I referenced above, ISTJs are five times more highly represented on here than their extraverted counterparts. So your anecdotes don't surprise me. My ISTJ physician father likewise enjoys discussing the law, psychology, and bioethics, but he is highly skeptical of MBTI. I've tried numerous times to get him into it, and he really just doesn't believe in it. My psych professor last year was a likely but unconfirmed ISTJ, and his area of research used to be personality psychology. 

So psych-interested ISTJs are certainly out there, but like ESTJs, I think they really only tend to believe in articles published in high-caliber peer-reviewed journals (established authority has put a stamp of approval on it), and/or scientific findings that have been replicated numerous times. Everything else is seen as unproven and therefore not worth attaching much importance to. For the latter, I think that while ISTJs will just shrug their shoulders and disbelieve, ESTJs are much, much more likely to actually take a strong, near-militant position on the matter and view what is either unproven, not accepted by authority, or just plain new and unconventional, as potentially threatening peace and order in society. To them I think that they view unproven ideas as very risky due to their potential to spread delusional thinking in society. Therefore they are more likely to be vocal about telling others that it's "wrong" and advocating against it, usually forcefully. :) 

They're not called the "enforcers" for nothing ya know?

Can you tell me more about the ESTJ you know? I can totally believe that your friend could be highly religious and by that I mean have strong religious convictions, but the part about spirituality is a little vague, what do you mean by that exactly?

&gt;Do the other anecdotal experiences by actual ESTJs in this thread change your perception?

Somewhat. There are so few on here though unfortunately. I got one very useful response on r/ESTJ from a grad student who claims to be an ESTJ. That's really been the only post that's shifted my view.

On this thread, there's one ESTJ who might actually be an ENTJ claiming they "love psych," and another ESTJ who thinks psych is "not really useful." Everything else is second-hand, and of those, the posters indicated that the interest in psych is either shallow:  

"my only proper ESTJ friend is into psych, **if only as an interest,**" 

"**doesn't really care much about why or how cognitive function works,**" 

or completely non-existent: 

"My ESTJ husband accepts the helpfulness of the study. **He has no interest in learning about it himself,** but he appreciates that there are people who benefit from it."

So I think the responses here have mostly confirmed my suspicions, but in r/ESTJ, one poster, who claimed to be studying human resource management claimed their interest stemmed from wanting to "harden the soft boundaries" of psychology. So once again, that person is not going into pure research and is wanting to change the field to make it more concrete. This is something I had not thought of but actually makes a lot of sense given what I know about ESTJs.No I don't think I know your friend better than you do. 

&gt;Well, if you think you know a century-old dude better than his IRL best bro of all time... ;)

Can you clarify what you mean by this? Your friend is 100? There is no such thing.Did you read the collapsed thread right above your post? It unfortunately got down-voted because people had a knee-jerk anti-stereotyping reaction. If you read the reasoning behind the claim, I think you'll have a better idea of why I said that.Did you read the collapsed thread right 3 comments up? It unfortunately got down-voted because people had a knee-jerk anti-stereotyping reaction. If you read the reasoning behind the claim, I think you'll have a better idea of why I said that.How very precise of you. Also, what's a "thumb of rule?" Very nice :) Is there only one thumb of rule then and all the other rules of thumb descend from the one and only thumb of rule? What you're saying is that thumb of rule is the root of the tree and all the other rules are child nodes of the root? What is the thumb of rule then? Can we ever know?Oh I see. Actually Freud and Jung split up when Jung was quite young. So the whole "best bro of all time" thing doesn't really ring true for me, especially not after I read Psychological Types. Tell me more about your ESTJ friend who's interested in psych. Which parts did they enjoy most and least?Yeah see this is exactly the area of psych that I think would be appealing to ESTJs... behaviorism, conditioning. I think for them that's much more likely to be valid because you're controlling factors in the environment, and that's pretty concrete, very black-white. It's not like studying norms or values. You either change something in the experiment, or you don't. There's no uncertainty or gray area. Then you observe the reaction. If it's statistically significant and the study has a large enough sample, I think most ESTJs would probably not be averse to learning about it. I think that kind of thing could be considered useful from an ESTJ's perspective because they're usually quite assertive and like taking charge of things, and if controlling the environment helps control or manage the people in it, or if it helps them be more efficacious, I think they would enjoy having that knowledge. 

Have you asked your friend what's motivating her interest in behavioral psychology and typology? I mean why is she interested in it? What does she hope to understand or get out of it?In isolation it does make some type of Si type seem more likely, perhaps ISXJ, but I don't know enough about Hitler to be able to make an informed judgment on this.INTPAre you a guy?I will take a look. Thanks for the recommendation.Just to play devil's advocate here, I plugged a transcript of an interview Trump had with an AI app called receptiviti. It pegged him as being an "emotional" thinker, not analytical in the least. He also ranked high on many aspects of things we might associate with feeling types except for agreeableness. On the other hand, the whole "tough" talk of his strikes me as being so unlike a feeling type. But it's really hard to say for sure because the guy is prone to moodiness and anger...what to conclude? What is PoLR btw?
Why is Obama INFJ? I promise I'm not looking to fight, just genuinely interested in your reasons. 

Also, see this:

I see ESFP in there is the need for tidyness, everything must look perfect and be pretty, to the extent that he rips up a freaking water cooler because its very presence offends him. I feel unqualified to assess his sense of aesthetics though. It feels like excess everywhere for the sake of excess without any real subtlety, and I'm not sure an ESFP would decorate/build the way he does. Did you know he had the wall lowered on his property so people could see it? Would an ESTP really do this? It's this whole wanting to be seen and showing off thing that just doesn't quite fit for me regarding ESTP.Potentially ENTPYes, I think that's accurate. I get perverse pleasure of thinking of all the horrible things someone has done to me and then thinking about how I would one-up them. It's really unhealthy, but that is the pattern I've noticed happens. Need more data. You should take the real MBTI, and then tell us the breakdown in terms of which scores were unequivocal and which were borderline. Most online tests are shit. MBTI has actually been validated to a certain extent.

Also, another strategy would be to take HEXACO and/or the NEO-PI-R which rely on the Big 6 and Big 5 respectively. These can help shed light on your type as well. Invest the time and take the long version:

http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/

http://hexaco.org/hexaco-online

It will give you more detailed scores for each of the different facets of openness, agreeableness, etc. That should help make nailing down your type easier. It's also really interesting in and of itself I think.No it's all free. Plus it's actually been validated as opposed to all the other online tests out there that claim to tell you something about your personality.One thing you don't address in your post is self-selection bias. This is something the MBTI does not suffer from as much since it's largely administered &gt;70% for training purposes. On the other hand, check this out:

https://www.reddit.com/r/ESTJ/comments/6173nn/ever_wondered_how_many_subscribers_there_are_in/

The most common personalities on here are completely different from the type distributions indicated by CAPT. Also, 16personalities looks very different from MBTI:

https://www.16personalities.com/articles/our-theory

I couldn't find any evidence on their website for their test's reliability or validity. Most significantly, MBTI data indicates there are very large differences in type distributions between the genders, and type distribution changes significantly with education:

https://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm?bhcp=1

Their test is as far as I'm concerned unproven and should not be used to determine type. A better strategy is to use MBTI and the NEO-PI-R and/or Hexaco:

Here's my opinion on this, and I could be wrong. Functions cannot be quantified. They can only be described qualitatively. Jung goes so far as to say that each type has a "co-determining function" of greater or lesser "consciousness" but fundamentally, the functions are motivations, and it's inappropriate to attempt to quantify this. 

I understand where you're coming from though on this, and the only thing I would suggest is that the brain develops according to the underlying psychological type. If you're motivated primarily by Ne, then you'll find certain types of cognitive processing to be easier, more natural, and more enjoyable than others, but really the amount of those different types of processing that occurs is 100% contingent on what you're doing and thinking every day. 

For example, if as an ENTP you're coming up with new ideas and new ways of doing something for your job and brainstorming frequently, say as a marketing guy, then the type of cognitive processing you're doing every day is likely to feel natural and easy because that's the kind of processing you've done most throughout your life. If on the other hand you are doing clerical work, you're still going to be "using" Ne to do this, but it's just not going to serve you very well and you'll have to use parts of your brain that are not particularly developed, which will be taxing. 

It seems like a minor distinction, but really I think the dominant function is "used" 100% of the time because it's the conscious one, and the others will be more or less conscious depending on the individual, but everything operates as a whole all the time. One function never takes over for another. The exception is the inferior, and that's what you experience under stress.Interesting. Here's a couple papers you might want to check out:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20447534_Reinterpreting_the_Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator_From_the_Perspective_of_the_Five-Factor_Model_of_Personality

https://jfdeschamps.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/correl-ocean-mbti-furnham-2003-6p.pdf

I am not a typing expert, so please take all of this with a big grain of salt. View it skeptically, don't try and define yourself by it. If you really want to be sure, there's no shortcut. You have to read some books, specifically Psychological Types by Jung, Gifts Differing by Isabel Myers, The Inferior Function by Von Franz, and possibly Conscious Orientation and Personality and the Unconscious both by JH Van der Hoop. Those books will tell you all you need to know about the *functions*, which are much, much different from the *traits* you found out about with these other tests. That said...

Both tests suggest you're low on Openness to Experience, which would put you in the S camp. Both tests also seem to indicate that you're an introvert and probably (but not definitely) a thinking type. The only question that remains is whether you're J or P. You're borderline on conscientiousness. There's really no way for me to know. The one thing that turns me off from ISTP are these two scores:

&gt;Excitement-Seeking 1
Cautiousness 92
Self-Discipline 68

On the other hand:

&gt;Adventurousness 48
Dutifulness 28
Unconventionality 3.50 3.38

Your post seems very unlike what an ISTJ would write, but then again I don't know that many...Reading about the functions Si vs. Ti in those books should help set you straight. Your original post made you seem somewhat neurotic (no offense), but the tests don't seem to indicate that. Don't dismiss the possibility of being an F type either, although I don't think it's likely based on your results. You could also check out what celebritytypes has to say about both ISTPs and ISTJs:

http://www.celebritytypes.com/istp.php

http://www.celebritytypes.com/istj.phpWhen it comes to personality assessment, I think everyone will agree that the MBTI is not as well-supported as other assessments. Here is a decent one for anyone that's interested for example:

https://sapa-project.org/

That said, the the five-factor model (FFM) along with others like HEXACO are *descriptive* whereas MBTI is *predictive*, meaning that if you're an ENTP, the former will tell you how extraverted, open, neurotic, agreeable, and conscientious you are relative to others, whereas the latter will tell you that you would probably enjoy marketing and being a lawyer among other things. I know that there have been probably over 50 million administrations of the MBTI since its inception.

My question is, where is the data correlating "gold-standard" assessments like the FFM to occupational choice? I've looked, and I can't find it. What gives?I have never met an ESTJ that held psychology as a field in particularly high regard. In fact, I have found quite the opposite. From what I can tell, they seem to think that it's a load of nonsense, imprecise, vague, not reproducible, and generally pointless. One major reason I have heard cited by them is that everyone is unique, and therefore there is no point in trying to categorize people or look for patterns. This strikes me as being incredibly narrow-minded, and quite frankly runs counter to everything I believe in, but I still want to understand why they believe this. I understand some studies are better than others, but the blanket aversion to and condemnation of psychology as a field is really surprising. A lot of studies in psych have not been replicated, but that does not mean they are not reproducible. The same holds true in other scientific fields like biology, chemistry, etc. Academics are under pressure to produce new findings as opposed to replicating old ones. Can anyone, particularly any ESTJs on here, explain to me the apparent ESTJ hatred of psychology (and probably other social sciences as well)?Just to keep this informative and interesting, please no posts like "He's *obviously* ESTP" or "He's definitely ESFP." These don't qualify as reasons or arguments, and no one is "definitely" or "obviously" a type. There's already plenty of uncertainty when typing someone you're very close to, so trying to do this for Trump, a celebrity showman who loves grabbing the headlines by saying outrageous things and who most of us probably have never met, makes this a difficult and tricky task. 

I'm interested in hearing *why* you believe he is one of the above two types or a different type altogether.
Same here. I can't get along with ESFPs.I laugh for 2 hours straight and make the most creative puns and jokes.It's obvious he has Ne, I think. Don't know why he has Ni as a primary function lol.&gt;Specifically, he has never been the type to come up with a bunch of innovative or interesting ideas, but rather the type who notices patterns and connections between lots of small things.

&gt;Maybe, but he's always been a deep thinker that often times misses the small details.

Those with dominant Ne are big picture people. They don't enjoy the details, but will handle them when necessary.

Dominant Ne's can see trends and patterns. They are especially good as seeing how things, events and people are connected. They can see the meaning behind people's actions. 

I can definitely see the Ne here but not sure if he's a Ne-dom or not.

Also, I wouldn't trust MBTI tests that much if I were you. I can't even count how many times I tested as an ENTJ when it's obvious I'm an ENTP.Purple doesn't suit ENTPs, that's for sure.Someone should do it for all personality types. It'd be awesome.You're totally a Ne-dom.

I'd say ENFP.ENFP .-.INFJ, INFP, ENFP, ENTP

definitely not ENTJEveryone is in the ENTP sub.
Yeah def! I feel if they probed us long enough they'd uncover some dark stuff you know? We're not gonna do anything bad because well the fleeting dark moment is gone! But yeah maybe they think the INFJs are the mastermind but behind the INFJ is an ENTP with a dark vision hahaha! Thank you! And do you know maybe how to comfort one? In a way that's true to ENTP nature?Ahhhh ok! I have a lot to learn about mbti but I'm kind of getting a gist. 

I was reading through an infp thread, just because I get curious as to how types interact with each other and infps talk about "rejection" and "crying" and i noticed other types referring to infp as "sad" .. 

Very interesting, now I want to know if they "feel" upset.Very good read by the way! Opened my eyes a lot I enjoyed it Got ya! So if you ask an infp why their sad and they don't answer or elude the question? Do you push for more? Do you leave it? Or does it depend on the relationship? 

What makes them uncomfortable? Do they still want to share their emotion even though they have trouble expressing it?I love this! Can't promise that my ego will always obey but that's some nice info that I can add to what I own and I'll put an authentic version to practice! 👍👍👍Very very difficult for me to grasp, I understand everything you've written and the sentence structures are great it's all clear but I find it hard to explain the sensation to myself. 

That's so interesting! And you feel comforted by the feeling.

Any particular reason you chose sadness? You said strong feeling and chose sadness.. do you ever try to feel angry? 
Do you ever try to feel more abstract feeling? 

And can I PLEASE ask.. do you ever try to project your feelings? I'm challenging myself.. as always. In true ENTP style lmao! 

But when do you think I'll have access? Wow.
I don't think I can be around that because I can't just let that be. I need to know why why why and then what and then how. 

How complex? I bet they could answer so many questions I have about emotion and feeling!
But then would they answer.. 🤔So you enjoy "depth"? Wow 😳 I can't get over how much I've been oblivious too for so long! 
This is so very interesting! Thanks for all of the input! My mind is blown! Infp seem to enjoy the depth of emotion, especially sadness or melancholy. 
I want to know if you've ever tried to project feeling onto somebody else, perhaps someone that you knew was emotionally sensitive.
If not do you think it would be possible? Hahaha oh trust me! I live in New Zealand! And so I don't get to interact w Americans very often. When I do I flip out, I get way too excited! 

Generic accent! I don't think there's a region I'd turn down I find them all amusing, but my favourite would definitely have to be a nice standard, generic accent. 

Slang from the Bay Area confuses me sometimes, southern drawls are interesting. All of it! Hahaha I love America so much I should be American!Haha yeah that's the plan! And i am EXCITED about it! 
 
Oh I'd love it! What's your accent like? Oh if you think the Aussie accent is something you're in for it! Interesting! On the rare occasion I feel this as well! Interesting!!!!! What stops you from processing? Ok here I go! So background info! I'm 23/F live in New Zealand BUT I match on tinder with Americans because I just love Americans.. everything about them. I'm attracted to their nature I find them fun, and a lot more interesting than guys I cross paths with here. 

Anyway I matched with a fun guy, let's call him John. Right off the bat the conversation was amusing. It was about nothing but I remember half an hour in thinking "ok this is different" and he said the same! 

We exchanged snapchat usernames a few days later after days of talking and it was a Big Bang! He was quite mysterious and I picked up on that, he enjoyed the fact that I could draw information out of him (curious ENTP nature) anyway we were on the same wave length and everything! Typing the same sentences! I've never felt so attracted to someone! There was nothing about him I could fault. He would say the same about me. He'd told me he was obsessed with me, he'd refer to me as the perfect package! What I found interesting was the fact that I 100% felt the same way! Was not really something I'd felt before! I'm used to people feeling that for me but not really understanding it or feeling the same way, with him it was so different! It was the two of us trying to understand how two people could get om so well! Everyday he'd have something new to amuse me with!

He'd often refer to the feelings we had for each other saying he was excited to meet and and after such a short while we had gelled so well, we both couldn't wait to see where it went! He asked me if it was "dangerous" that we were so attracted to each other.. 

We'd never met but I felt like I knew him, inside out! I just got it and at the same time he got me. I remember once I had been feeling really nervous and worked up but I couldn't pin point what was causing the emotion. I mentioned to him how I'd been feeling for the two or three days! And he responded clearly with all the things that were on my mind that I hadn't recognised as the cause but he had just put into a linear pattern. He was so emotionally aware.. and thoughtful. 

I forgot nothing about him, I remember nothing about everyone else. 

Interesting guy/HILARIOUS/super intelligent and always doing something weird like riding a bike to a river and snapping funny pictures on his own. Really amused me! He was amused by how quick my mind would work, I was amused by the fact that he could pick up on that! It's not really something that comes up in convo "oh yeah my thoughts are scattered And i come up with new ideas all the time" but he knew! I don't know how and on top of that he'd manage to get me to focus my thoughts and energy and if I was confused or stressed out he'd know the perfect thing to say and clearly step by step tell me what I could do to get rid of my problem or cause of stress. 

We were very similar in mindset but also very different and we'd talk about how we were such a great balance for each other. He said he loved my energy but what I enjoyed was his calm nature and stability. Any question I had was answered instantly, which I LOVED! He enjoyed his mind being challenged. 

I met him before I became interested in MBTI - if I had to type him I'd say he was INFJ! I'm convinced of that! 

Sadly things abruptly came to an end, I had planned to go over in November to meet him. But life changes sometimes! But definitely a memorable experience interacting with him! I still want to visit but I mean it's awkward saying hey I'm coming over even tho we don't talk but definitely an interesting character. And so funny!! 


My description does not do justice for the experience but I really don't want to tap into emotion coz I don't really wanna know what's in there right now. 
[Me](https://www.instagram.com/lemaaike/) More than important. I don't like being misperceived  it frustrates me because I will always act how I want to act. Can't always avoid it though because people have their pre-conceived perceptions of who you are and why you act like you do. 

I'm happier if people don't like me for who I am, than I would be if people loved me for who I pretended to be.Hahahah!!I'm gonna have to take over as leader, looks like you've melted :)Oh no that's ok haha 

You have the TJs I'll go hang with the FJsScary? No.. this is why I should be the leaderBut I like the FPs and I want them on my side! We bargain. What can they offer us? In place of time spend with F types.Look I'm clearly the leader! Haha yeah so whatever we need can be delivered that's fine get your quality time and let's move on Kill: INTJ 

Bang: ENTP

Marry: ISTJI just answered the test backwards and I got isfj-t instead of my usual ENTP-a 

Wow lol This is very trueENTP Well I’m really close to my dad he’s an ISFJ. 
My best friend is an ISFJ. 
And a guy I’m super attracted to (personality wise) is an ISTJ. 

On paper, I find INFJs super amusing and interesting but when I’ve come across them in real life I’ve had clashes with em... I also have a lot of ENFP and ESFJ mates.

INTJ/ENTJ - I just don’t get along with. 

A friend of mine that I love to sit down with and bounce ideas off of, for HOURS is an INTP. 

I’m an ENTP. Hi I'm looking for an INFJ to have a funny convo with! I love American accents so feel free to share that with me! It'd be a special treat! I love reading about INFJ on paper and would love some funny interaction! Pm me!Feeling is that sensation in the heart. 
Thoughts are my words. What I know and understand. That’s what I got lol drama club treasurer.. least likeable? Aite 
I would first start with taking multiple MBTI tests online, preferably ones that show what percentage you lean towards one letter over another. If you get consistent results, you're probably that type. However, even if you see consistent results, I would still suggest your next course of action to be to look into the cognitive functions and self evaluate. 

Finally, realize that the online tests are basically just self-evaluation worded differently. All the questions they ask you are basically just asking you to self-evaluate one of your functions, just in a less direct manner. Usually, the information they give about your type fits you almost perfectly because you just gave the test a whole lot of information about your personality based on what answers you gave. Examples: "You enjoy social events and parties" is Extrovert vs. Introvert, "Your emotions control you more than you control them" is Feeling vs. Thinking, "I am uncomfortable with new ideas" is Sensing vs. Intuition, and "I like to keep my options open" is Perceiving vs. Judging. 


TL;DR:

MBTI is basically self-evaluation and you should do it in multiple ways to confirm your type.MBTI tests give you an overall category that your personality falls into, nothing more. Naturally, many variations exist within one category. For instance, 16personalities also tests your self-confidence as a separate trait (ironic in how that gives you 32 personalities), just to name one way of further subdividing the categories. 

In terms of whether MBTI is accurate, it is at least somewhat accurate in describing the overall pattern of an individual because it is basically self-evaluation. However, it is not at all accurate any deeper than that.ENTP here.

Decision Making: "Let's try this option. Wait, this one looks better. I'll try this third option instead and do something else if it doesn't work." *proceeds to procrastinate endlessly*

Understanding: "Oooh, what's this Wikipedia article about?" 

10 minutes later: "I now know why zoning codes prohibit buildings thinner than a certain amount, but I was looking for a taco recipe. Let's go back and take another look." 

1 hour later: I AM NOW OMNISCIENT. BOW DOWN TO ME! *proceeds to browse the internet some more and learn a new thing anyways*

Thinking: All this information I gather goes through complete deconstruction and analysis before I add it to my theory of everything.

Feeling: "Hahaha that joke was funny, now I'm bored. We should do something else." Also, what are emotions?

Common behaviors: Browsing the internet, pacing, thinking out loud while walking/hiking/pacing, PC games, procrastinating on work, reading Wikipedia or other online databases, Skyping/Discord with friends, not cleaning, forgetting to eat, and staying up-to-date on the news.The worst offender would have to be ESFJs. No matter how good-hearted they seem, they are always manipulative in a way that never works for me. I have an ESFJ family member and they are always trying to get me to do something. No thank you, I have plenty of other things I want to not get done today,

IxFPs can be nice, sure. Though if they have an unhealthy mental attitude, they are like mosquitos. For some reason, they often flock towards me for advice (I've had 2 really depressed ones do that this past year alone), yet all they do is suck my time away as I futilely attempt to talk them through their problems.
ENTPs may be full of bullshit, but we make sure our bullshit is the highest quality possible. An xNTP train of thought is like taking the trolley problem, adding another 16 paths each with a certain number of victims, then cloning the trolley and sending one down each of the paths to see what happens. Once the trolleys all arrive at the station, you argue with the police that there should be an electric fence around the tracks so the problem never repeats itself, then move on and invent a monorail that is too high for any would-be assassin to strap victims onto. What brilliant ideas for projects are you currently procrastinating on?I understand, though if you do choose to tell me, I have a cool maze of deadly traps you can explore outside of my place.ENTP, Ravenclaw with Slytherin leanings.My favorite board game by a long shot is Diplomacy. There is no luck but the game always progresses in unpredictable ways based on who is playing and how you interact with them. I'm also fond of Mafia and its variants (online, I love Town of Salem). I like Chess and Catan as well but not as much as some of the other ones. Sadly, I've never gotten to play Risk though I think I'd like it.Huh, I'm about as emotionally stable as my INTJ mom and much more so than the INFJs and INFPs I know. Of the 4 ENTPs I know, I'd only describe one as neurotic.
What is this "other type" you're talking about?
I am an ENTP, and I know one ENFJ. I am still a teenager, so we're both pretty immature, but my god! This ENFJ 'friend' of mine is the most over sensitive, cry baby, thin skinned, needy girl I know half the time, and the other half she's like the peanut butter to my jelly. She wants harmony, but can not deal with discord, she want's to be loved and given attention, but doesn't know what to do when the attention is negative, she is caring and selfless but can not deal with rejection. 
The main reason I think that society views ENFJ's as the 'golden child' is because their not that common, and so are more refreshing than another know it all, outspoken NT type, and are more grounded (or charismatic) than the other NF types, so appreciated for what they are... which is rare. 
(sorry if that didn't make sense). i'm an ENTP, and lately I've been forgetting what I'm saying mid way through saying it, like sometimes even mid word. I am pretty sure it is cause I have low SI and high NE. ENTP
Know-it all: cause I totally am
or as a quote from two of my friends respectively:
Teletubby sun 
&amp;
Robotic bitchprobably because of TI coupled with NE... but I suck at structure, and all my NF friends are great at English....the functions of INTJ and ENTP shadow each other, with INTJ having: 
NI TE FI SE
and ENTP having:
NE TI FE SI
Si inferior: "wait, what was was I doing/looking for again?"
wut...Need tl:dr please. Hell yea dog, I was going to say that. At first I was on the fence about NL being an ENTP, and thought he might be an ENFP, but after I thought about it for a bit, I think you are correct.^ thisReally? One I know (and this may be an outlier) and he will say shit like that all the time. To the extent of doing the opposite of what I ask him to. Its really annoying, but makes easy to manipulate, not to sound like /r/iamverysmart but really it does.This frustrates me, and makes me sad. Stop.
WD40 or duct tape?ENTP here, I think ESTPs. I find it really refreshing that someone, not like me, is using tertiary Fe. So easy to get along with, the attention span is similar, the structure of interaction with people and talking is quite similar as well. But I find that I don't need to exert so much energy and can kind of tag along in the shadow, easier then when I'm the token extroverted P. Overall I think I like interacting with all of that quadra.haha, I have an ENFP friend and I often feel I'm led on in the most unusual manner with stuff like 'I'm broke this week, buy me a drink and then we'll sit and you can explain me this stuff (insert random science theory)'. Oh, you never *have* to choose, don't want to put any pressure onto you.Exactly, I always think about my mom (ISFP) as a cat, helps greatly with our interaction. Let's just keep it at duct tape is more versatile at keeping *things* from moving...Yes, weirdly all INFPs I know are male.I'm in arts :D but it's a real mixed bag.I find XSTJ quite cute, they usually think they're super smooth and efficient when talking to you, but actually are a bit dense and awkward (which is absolutely not a bad thing in my book).Oh, yes, that is true. I mean the initial talks you have at a party ie., when you meet someone at the balcony smoking and you just starts talking on some non committed/personal subject. I don't think it's necessary shallow, just a way to get to know something about the other person and form some initial opinion of what they're into. But for example I find that FJs often are really good at making that initial part of conversation comfortable for everyone.I'm really good at small talk because I'm often delegated by my group to be the nice person talking to people that are new and feel out of place. So I kind of try to keep that vibe that everyone feels included into the group and has fun, feels like they're valuable addition to our party and that they're interesting. Greatly helps that I know bits from loads of topics. Yes, sometimes I get bored as fuck but I feel that keeping the peaceful and welcoming atmosphere is worth it.*Raising the hand for ENTPs*

I think I have this kind of interaction with most not TPs, because I'm good at explaining to other people how they themselves work and validating their view. That also helps to show them the possibilities they have in themselves but may be reluctant to engage in, kind of like cheering them on from the sidelines and giving guidance. But only when asked for/situation requires it or if I know this person well. 

That being said, this is a very slippery road because it would be easy to manipulate people to make them aim for things that are not only beneficial for them but also for me, so I do keep this in check. 

To sum up - ENTP great at getting into your head and helping you rearrange your thoughts so you feel motivated or being manipulative shits.yeah, I have a male INFP at my coworking space:
 
few people socialising and INFP is leaving

person 1: leaving already?

INFP: yeah, I have yoga on Mondays

person 1: respect that you can just say it w/o embarrassment

INFP : oh, but it's always been on Mondays

●︿● he is like a magical marshmallow&gt; And whenever I want to see my INTJ coworker awkward I start talking about how we're best friends. Or I narrate his life.

haha, this is the fate of IXTJs that know me. It's funny when they're unsure if they should be pissed that you're making fun of them or blush.I'm sure you do.I find all TPs to be notorious for oversharing

oh, are you the ENTP from the podcasts? thumbs up if you are&gt; made him prove himself

that must be like ultimate turn on for Te men&gt;"You're being irrational!" "PEOPLE are irrational!"

Who says what?  This sound like me and my ISTJ SO, when I sometimes don't know better then to not call out irrationality of his reaction. I usually can shut my mouth before going into detached logical reasoning. 

I think with low stack Fi and Fe in a relationship, it's really good to acknowledge the fallibility of both functions and not just go with the flow.

For low stack Fe users - getting respect is a powerful enabler for Te-Fi stack, learn to respect TJs and their vulnerable feelings. Fi is not a logical input to analyse, you don't explain to someone to not be sad, angry, etc. Try to make a mental map of the Fi of your partner and you'll gain understanding of them.

For low stack Fi users - Ti-Fe people have problems showing negative emotions because of Fe, the negative views will often come out as detached analytical suggestions or a call to action. If you react dismissively about negative communication, it's more probable then not that you'll just make the low Fe user stop communicating what is wrong (this may grant you peace for a long period of time) and earn yourself a Fe doorslam down the line - because all TPs are FJs deep inside. TPs are good problem solvers, but they need to know you are on board with them, aka you're a team of two and your enemy is the 'problem' at hand while both of you want to work towards resolution.&gt; love language is acts of service

yeah, dated two IXTJs, and that is pretty much typical. I find ESTJs really great, one of the types I usually get along with easily. They're really caring and protective of 'their people'. 

&gt; I do pride myself on my sense of imagination and individuality, and **absolutely detest conformities**

haha, unless you're very, very young, you probably don't have Fe. Problems with conformity are usually Fi problems. Pride, or respect, is a TJ thing. Can't picture a Ne dom/aux talking in such black and white distinctions. It's not gospel, but I suspect that everyone that can pinpoint their Ne use is not a Ne dom or aux. 

Problems with conformity, hierarchy, and power are typical for XSTJs I know. 

I think this is part of why they're so successful in workplace, they detest others having power over them and strive to be at the top of the food chain. 

You are for sure not a Ni-dom.ah, yeah, damn, the nesting of replies. Yes to the OP.

Yet to meet an XSTJ who doesn't have a major problem with authority, unless they are the authority. (At least from my generation, I think it may have been different when type descriptions were written.) All TJs have this 'my way or the highway' stubbornness, but ENTJs are a bit better at swallowing the bitter pill of not being in power because they can find solace in the big picture, while ESTJs just get Ne restless and ie. relocate somewhere.&gt;I don't have the outer confidence to be that "my way or the highway" person

yeah, it's more prominent in IXTJs, not sure if they're aware of that. EXTJs are more like entrepreneurs from Shark Tank, they like to examine and judge ideas of others. They're not so in your face like introverted perceiving doms, who approach everything with with a nearly solidified outlook.

I see a lot of Ne influence in decision making with ESXJs.&gt;ENTP = entrepreneurs

god, I can't stop laughing at that one. Someone at ENTP sub described it very nicely 'ENTPs are idea children'. So, firstly Fe needs external acceptance and validation, which is hard to come by if you're at the top. Ne-Ti usually makes it so that completing a semi cohesive concept is motivation, you don't feel much for completing the project. That is why ENTPs always have a lot of projects started and are described as people who have problems with finishing anything. Which is not the case for them, the thrill is in making the concept, but implementation is a side thing. So in a way ENTPs don't want to be entrepreneurs because of the same reasons ESTJs would, they don't approach it from the point that they want to make a change in the world / implement something effective - they just throw out bunch of ideas and see what is accepted and praised. The only time ENTPs do well without Fe feedback is when they heavily use Ne-Ti-Si, which is probably academic setting.

I think this is quite adequate [description](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/44mwk4/the_secret_of_nts_inadequacy/) of ENTP motivations.

I would bank that a most entrepreneurs are Js, with large portion being ESTJs.It's not about how much you're in your head. N's don't have as much of concrete thought pattern as S's, aka reality for S's is divided to reality and imagination/speculation/meta-sphere - for N's those two are just mashed together.Someone should start making jokes about two TPs walking into a bar, after 15 min everyone inside knows everything about their sex life...

Why does it happen?k, but I take the top bunk
hah, well, I think it'll be the other way around. Don't worry, I'll be gentle.I don't even want to think how that'll go when I have children... No  worries, I'm still waiting for the moment when being an entrepreneur will not require you to fill out tax forms.Just don't make me talk dirty. Ne and dirty talk don't mix so well as it would seem.very likely imoI would put you as FJ. 

If I may, probably from alpha quadra - that is ENTP, INTP, ESFJ, ISFJ. Purely because what you describe as your world view/things you enjoy, is what sometimes I aspire to do when I'm in my SFJ binge. 

The second thing that makes me think you're an SFJ is the sense of focused, or planned, wanderlust. It's typical if you have Ne in your stack, but ENXPs are much more opportunistic in it. Wanderlust as you described it usually happens when you have firm idea of yourself and can visualize where you come from/want to be/etc. - the personal myth-making of Si, which ENXPs are not very good at but we try. &gt; you see something there but you might not interpret it right at first

you see something and it's not even there...if I got a dollar every time an INTJ pushes that train of thought onto me...just for consideration for Se:

- you know what you're about

- you know what works for you/is real for you

- you have a sense of self

- you know what you are like 

- you deal with concrete expressions/insights - you don't write that maybe blah blah or sometimes if ever blah blah (or maybe even if not blah) aka parentheses of possibilities - Ne lets included everything theory

- you actually wrote description of yourself/your behaviour - Ne doms have very hard time not flying off on such topics into very broad subjects

- you stuck on topic through 4 paragraphs

- you seem to have realistic sense of what your doing, where your actions lead you 
oh, to which illuminati office should I forward my receipt?
there's some catch to this, isn't there?&gt;I know what I'm about? I never once said I did.

Then you list all the insights about yourself and why you are how you are/who you are. Feeling lost is not a N or S thing, it's human thing to wonder who you are. Ne doms have problem with distinguishing themselves, aka they conjure up 'versions of themselves' and all seem equally probable and real to them (they aren't, it's only problems in their perception). Ne doms also get involved in typical  Si myth making, but because it's inferior it's very random - ie. they tend to associate non impactful sensations/impressions/details as a core of themselves or their memories. Because of that inferior Si, they usually have problems distinguishing what is real (aka how things are) from probabilities they present.

I'm not saying your have to be a sensor, if you feel you're a Ne-dom then go for it.

let me guess, you said the same thing to FaustGreat, because I am not contradicting myself in any way.

&gt;somedays I feel like a nerd some days I feel like acting like a badass

that's cool but that's not what I'm alluding on being a Ne dom. Oh, but this is not true. The sub tries to help people type themselves as much as they can, you don't have to take it into account at all if you don't want to.

I have hard time understanding this N conspiracy idea, most N's know quite well they're not any more special. Yes, some have inflated ego but it's very misguided to get inflated ego from having a cognitive preference.&gt; all the other ones I know usually say that they do feel as if they have the power to change the world

This is very Gamma quadra thing in my book, especially the idea of being able change the world by a singular person.

How many intuitives do you know?Plot twist, maybe no one is deadset on proving you're a sensor, maybe you just heavily seem like you have preference for Se.well, haven't met any intuitives that are not INTJs that would think that way. But INTJs often learn the quick and hard way that they also lack this special power. Yeah, seem being operative here. We can only judge what we perceive of you, for all it's worth you may be the most introverted recluse with computer analytical mind challenging Spock. 

I'm very ENTP and I'm not unrealistic, I would say Ne-doms deal with probabilities more then anything. They are great with that, with assessing probabilities. They also don't feel their thoughts are unrealistic, what is very typical of Ne-doms/auxs when you point out how unrealistic their idea is, they instantly try to expand the framework their working on. 

I don't live in the future in the sense people speak about he future, and most Ne doms/auxs who I know don't either - what is consistent is the lack of understanding of what is and what may be. 

&gt;How I like theories and abstract over proven facts example 

this doesn't connect in any way to S or N. So the Ne theories are not philosophical theories, because their S is low in stack they make theories to react to the world. Their perception of the world is not immediate like with S types,  it's like if you're watching the world through haze or a milky glass - you know there is something there but you can't access the raw experience. So one of the problems they run into is that nothing is real or more real, it's all at probability as I mentioned before. It has little to do with being clumsy.How could I be biased if there is nothing to be biased about, what kind of bias would that be? 

how would it work? 

what are the necessary assumptions and fundaments for it to occur? 

how would it connect to being intuitive in cognitive functions? 

why would the bias work towards claiming other people to be sensors, if in fact they are intuitives?

what kind of perspective shift occurs? 

what kind of cultural context does it have?

So, do you want to tell me about this bias, I'd love to ask more in depth questions about it.Well, my grandma tells me I'm special so I guess I am.

Unless it's all a lie and ISFJ conspiracy on her part...If you talked to my ISTJ, you'd be sure you encountered NFP at first. One of his notable life decisions - starting a business with another person after meeting them twice, and through online forum, to perform black magic rituals. That is just the tip of the iceberg.&gt;I need a ritual to stop needing to have everyone like me...

Haha, he also needs such exorcisms. 

If you met me at some points in social setting, I would have a strong ESFJ vibe. &gt; An ESTJ would call an ENTP unrealistic and unnecessary, an ENTP would call an ESTJ boring and uninterested in truly mixing things up. (because an ENTP wants to mix it up, everytime, an ESTJ finds this annoying and unnecessary)

as an ENTP who has a history of collaborating with 2 different ESTJs, this sounds very out of place. 

ENTP-ESTJ is one of powerhouse work combos from what I observed.

To consider:

-Te and Ti are very good at troubleshooting each other

-ENTPs like to think about loads of ideas, but it's really nice for someone more grounded to evaluate them and point out weaknesses 

- ENTPs often try to reinvent the wheel so to speak, TJs are very good a pushing that aside

- ENTPs are good at cutting corners, which helps one of Te weaknesses

- ESTJs know when something is more efficient and they don't find such changes unnecessary, this can reign a weird Ne quality of mixing stuff up just for the sake of it and focusing it 

- actually ESTJs have easier time noticing ENTP ideas potential because of shared Si and Ne, with ENTJs it's much harder to get this vibe because their Ni has already evaluated future potential quality of the idea and has hard time giving up this vision

- ESTJs are good at planning implementation of said ideasThe personal icons mostly look like Voltorb...I wouldn't say N is pathological construction of ego, although how it manifest is similar to dissociation and splitting defence mechanisms.

I had my typing done with a psychologist because I was thinking that there is something wrong with me, purely basing it on the detachment from reality I always notice. So, I'd say it's probable other N's always felt that something is not working entirely correctly in their perception. I don't think it's necessarily pathological, just a preference. Well, who didn't try magic ;D through he stuck in it for a long time, now we share a bookshelf of black magic books (his) and white magic books (mine, handed down from my ISFJ grandma).

In recent years I think he has become much more settled down and constructed focused outlets for inferior Ne, instead of it spilling all over the place.&gt;You want that pat on the head? 

which head is he talking about?I was expecting quite a different visual aid, up your game so it's really NSFWenjoy it while it lastsshush, just lie back and think of Englandcan you reformat?&gt; The Wall of Shame.

yeah, that is the tertiary Fe way
this is oddly touching that you went through the trouble of making a picture, now if you only take a few more we can start some ESTP rental serviceso, what I'd add if you allow

Si in dominant is very condensed sense of what they themselves are, as you mentioned it is not a conscious perception of character, but more of unconscious understanding. I often read that Si is linked to memories, but in my experience strong association of yourself with certain memories and sentimentality is more of tertiary/inferior Si - because Ne doms have so few of Si impressions, they can get reaaaally attached to them. Si dom/auxs are more of embodiment of their experience, they don't take active stance in their recollection. that reminds me of that one time when I tore frenulum linguæ while, em, you know... it was like a scene from class D horror movie, my tongue now has a wider range of motions at least :D
the wonders of viagra...well, Ni vs Ne is not much better but involves less dick measuring &gt; they just are their subjective experience in a way that they sometimes have a hard time recognizing

The introverted perception, Ni or Si, approaches anything with some preconceived expectation so basically it's often flags the inconsistencies in their view not as them being wrong but as the world being wrong.Yes, this may be why SJ are miss tagged as conservative. It's not that they are conservative in cultural sense, they just approach things with preconceived concrete and personal perspective. So they're only conservative towards their own Si, not to conservative as worldview. Si-doms will say no not to *new* things, but to things that don't fit into their perspective. Same with Ni-doms.

But to extrapolate on the conservativeness, EXXPs will also act conservative - choices bending to their Ti or Fi. It's just less visible, because being primary extraverted perceivers they don't approach things with a preconceived notion. Their Ti or Fi needs time to chew onto their perception and test if it matches whatever system they have inside.

As an ENTP, when I hear things that are illogical to my Ti thought pattern, I'll immediately be opposed to them or approach them with reserved attitude.Ti vs Ti looks like bloody fistfight from the outside, but in [reality](https://media.giphy.com/media/YfQYj5pW7UbQc/giphy.gif)ha, no one is fighting, we're just aggressively exploring logic...Well, it's illogical to say that other people should validate someones opinion because that someone said that and he knows best. It's just others opinion, and the person posing the question can take it or leave it but shouldn't expect other's to bend to what they want. If other people didn't see Ne as primary perceiving function, then you shouldn't expect them to lie that they do. If he knows better, then why ask?&gt; He asked them ENFP or ENTP and everyone kept saying all kinds of crap.

Well since he didn't seem like a Ne-dom user to others, why should people lie to him? From what he wrote ENXP didn't fit, should they have still validated his opinion because that is what he wanted. It's not as if they make him reconsider, it's not as if he is forced to take it into account if he doesn't want to. Many people proposed ESFP. If he was so sure he is Ne, then what he wasn't sure about was Fi-Te or Ti-Fe - he should have just jumped onto ENFP. 

Se and Si sensors are as different as Ne and Ni intuitives.Si and Ne come together. Your primary perceiving function is like breathing - you breath but you don't consciously think you're breathing.

 If I asked you 'what are you doing now', what would you say? Reading reddit? You wouldn't jump onto pumping blood through my heart, breathing, dissolving food in acid. But primarily you're doing all these things to function first and foremost. That is why people can be blind to their primary perceiving function. 

I am a Ne dom, but I don't notice my 'intuitiveness', I don't notice the Ne part of my perception. I notice my Ti somewhat, but functions I really notice are Fe and Si because those are the ones that fire up in certain circumstances and do weird things to my perception of the world. 

So if you notice Ne, or intuitiveness, in yourself it doesn't mean your an intuitive - it mean you are using your 4 function stack correctly and in unison. That is why it's easy to confuse Si and Ne. People put far too much weight on the imaginative aspect of Ne - which is accessible to both SJs and NPs; but Ne is more used as probability assessment / pattern seeking / big picture without details / symbolical relation to concrete objects in Ne-doms then the godforsaken 'imagination'. All what is accessible to Ne-doms is also accessible to SJs but for them it's more focused in application.&gt;You are a very cold person you know?

a pick up line?yeah, Ni and Si as both introverted perceiving are prone to very similar failures. 

I mean have you ever convinced a Ni dom their vision (aka streamlined pattern they see) is wrong? From what I experienced INTJs, and I dated one for a few years, they're notorious for disregarding anything that doesn't fit their abstract vision. (Which btw drives Ne-doms mad, because Ne want's to expand the vision to include all possible 'futures' and construct the system of relationships between everything through Ti or Fi.) 

But since most people can pin point where perceiving bias in Si comes from, as it's linked to more concrete experience, they get called conservative - Ni perception bias is when a person sounds like conspiracy theorist. Not the caricature conspiracy thing you see when a person with Ni/Ne lower in the stack jumps into conspiracy thinking as some Deus Ex Machina solution. It's the deeply ingrained notion, experienced by Ni person, that what they see is the correct vision and everyone who doesn't confirm it just lacks the foresight... Of course, it's their primary function. If it was as off the wall as the lower N in the stack ones, how would they function in everyday life? It must be much more ingrained in reality then the ones, sorry to say it this way, sensors suggest. It functions with reality much more smoothly, so it's not as detectable.IMO in Ne-doms, all Ps actually, perception works better when they 'work through' situation. That is why they're called out as awful planners, it's because they don't have as crystalized preconception of what will happen. So each time a thing happens, they work through it and add that knowledge to their Ti/Fi. Ti and Fi are subjective, but they are fed though an objective function - so what P's intake is objective but how they judge it is subjective, it's the other way around with J's. (God, I'm probably reiterating myself here.)

In this way, P's instead of finding themselves at odds with reality, will try to construct systems where all the reality fits - value systems for Fi and logical systems for Ti. 

So, I'll speak of ENTP because ENFPs are bit different. Some of ENTP's 'argumentative characteristics' comes from ENTPs encountering something that is flagged by their Ti as illogical and them trying to take that new information apart to see if their hunch was right. They are open to changing, more like expanding, their Ti logical system but they need to chew through that data first. But for every Ti aux/dom there will be places where the logical path is so traversed that it's basically solidified and unchangeable, it's the core logic.

Now ENTPs, here I speak from my perspective, are great at assessing and judging possibilities - this is Ne fed to Ti. It comes out in indecisive statements as 'it's more likely then not that x will be the result', but is not as often portrayed off the wall suggestions and openness to everything under the sun. I actually hate that stereotype, ENTPs are logical in their thinking and will not accept every suggestion as viable because *'Ne'* - they'll consider it because it already was fed to Ne, judge the viability though Ti and come to conclusion. 

Now, ISTJs use Te to test their preconceived perception, Te is not concerned with integrity to the user himself (that is what Fi is for) but with input-output. So by default ISTJs should be more open to suggestions where someone aligns input a to output b, if their Si didn't flag it as wrong. 

Okay, so after writing this long and probably not readable thoughts, life example (my SO is an ISTJ) - the conversation is about if grapefruit seed extract can prevent/cure cancer:

ISTJ: I heard about these grapefruit seed extract supplements that are supposed to prevent cancer.

ENTP: They don't work.  *(This is obvious Ti stab in the dark, the fact doesn't click with it's understanding of how the world is structured)*

ISTJ: Have you read about it?

ENTP: No. 

ISTJ: Then how can you say they don't work? I read they've done studies *(Te knowledge)* and it looked promising.

ENTP: If they worked, they would be implemented long ago. It is ridiculously hard and expensive to test new cancer drugs, if something as easy as grapefruit seeds would provide any hope of preventing or curing cancer then all big pharmaceutical companies would be on it long ago. *(Ti logical framework - disregarding Te facts in favour of logical integrity)*

So as a disclaimer, in this example I'm not saying that ISTJs are gullible or believe whatever anyone says, just that sometimes an ISTJ will have an easier time entertaining a new notion then a Ne-dom. But a lot of notions and values ISTJs entertain are closer to NFPs then NTPs.&gt;My default expectation is that something is wrong if it doesn't click

yeah, mine is similar - do you have Ti?ha, soon it'll be that SJ's have the real special snowflake syndrome.&gt;INFPs look like a poor man's version of an ISTJ when they're stressed.

That goes both ways, ISTJ's can go into Fi-Te logic when stressed or depressed.&gt; And certainly some of it is my own sensitivities, because I can't think of how you describe Ne, and its imaginative, possibility-envisioning, divergent nature

Let me help you. Ne-doms are not imaginative, they construct 'symbolical' reality and exist in that as their primary space. Now, this sounds magical at first glance. But for me it feels as having lower count of input nodes, what you call 'imagination' is probably just Ne-doms perception trying to fill in the wide blank spaces. Since their Si is lackluster, they learn to weight probabilities of things that can occur in real world. There is no much deliberate envisioning on their part, just they have hard time checking the realness of one perception over the other. 

If I had to put it down, where you're an S you entertain varied and large amount of input (details) of the world - you see the dots and perceive they more or less resemble triangle. When you're an N, you get like 3 dots and connect it to make triangle because you know there must be something in between those 3 dots but you can only more or less guess what, so you try to get some pattern of how the dots connect. So what Ne doms get good at is guessing where may the next dot of the input possibly be. The 'imagination' comes from the fact that they only guess, so sometimes the dots they see don't connect in smooth pattern and woeee - visionary. Or in my case, woeee - I guessed that yellow trashcan is not for recyclables. Do you want to know the elaborate analysis I go through each time to determine where the taxi is? Good work Ne, good work.

The lack of input to consider makes Ne deceptively quick in operation, seeming 5 steps ahead. But it's not 5 steps ahead if you only have 5 steps to consider, while a sensor has to go through 20.

This is why Ne-doms can get very attached to the few concrete sensations or memories they entertain.&gt; Jung's description of the Ne type reads as an amoral novelty-whore for whom nothing is sacred. It's an exaggeration, but..

I think well... it's not about novelty as much as dissatisfaction with what you usually get. So I can pinpoint very few 'raw' experiences, and the need for new is primarily guided by the want to take part in more of that raw/immediate experience. I'm not really sure distinction to conscious and unconscious is so easy. I'd hazard a guess that most introverted function counterparts have a bigger unconscious part, they're not as shallow or linked to reality as extraverted ones.

F part of functions are not so much feelings but motivations for me, the T is more like the process those motivations take to react to reality. I wouldn't say T is more rational or certain then F in your perception. 

Ie. if you look at ESTJ or ENTP, to understand what motivates them you need to look at their F not their T. I think this is why often F-dom/auxs have easier time describing what motivates them, their descriptions also tend to be fuller. That is why it's easier to look at the Fi-Te/Fe-Ti axis then each one separately. Yeah, that's why saying you dislike authority/conformity so you must be an N, and can't be an SJ, is not a valid reasoning. Just presenting a point that ime STJs are usually at odds with authority, something usually not associated with SJ.I don't know much about socionics, so I'll speak from my experience and feel free to incorporate or scrap it.

&gt; To the mind, a “real” perception is no more tangible than an imagined one.

I think this is the clue for N or S, N's have bigger problem in understanding what is objective real then S's but it's not that they have more imagination. They function more in symbols which are distilled from reality, fed through their S, but are imperfect representations. 

This is why N's theories are so elegant at first glance (they only consider those representations) and fall apart when scrutinized closer. When you have two Ne doms/auxs talking the bullshit can get through the roof, neither can pinpoint where the other's representative idea of reality falters. Uh, I'm probably overcomplicating now...&gt; I am way too much of a daydreamer to be an S.

em, not sure all NT's view themselves as daydreamy. No saying you're not one, just I think a lot of NT's get quite insulted when their perception of reality is called out as daydreamy or unrealistic.

If you'd have to say, as a quality in people do you think imagination is high up there? Do you get attached to very specific but few concrete sensations? Do you long to experience sensation more fully?

When you construct a theory, do you often find that it looks great at first glance but you have a weird feeling that you haven't included all the necessary data? How often you jump onto a theory, only to start finding that details don't align with your initial perception of it?



sidenote - this is highly personal opinion - (I can't speak Se/Ni much), this is why S, or Si, often comes out as more imaginative then Ne. Ne writers often fall onto grand narratives to mask the fact they can't flesh out in the details the characters or their motivations or actions. This is how I feel about ie. Tolkien, there are soo many characters but their motivation/construction isn't very nuanced and sometimes seems clumsy with the backlog of who is who from where. I have the feeling as if Tolkien thought up narrative in broad strokes and then tried to fill in the blanks, but it's hard to fill in the blanks fully if you already decided on the outcome of actions in the broad narrative. Or so I say, I'm crap at writing...Uh, this resonates very deeply why in social settings I get at odds with INTJ's or others from that quadra. It feels like no matter how many times you extend hand or give them signals that they're making others in the group uncomfortable, they're like 'nope - this is what I want to do'. NTP's sometimes repress their logic sharing in interactions to kind get this smooth vibe, and can get quite passive-aggressive when someone else doesn't. 

Even Delta quadra is better, thou from my perspective they just want to share, consider and validate uniqueness of perspectives of people in the conversation, but at least there is some justice in allocation of the focus on each individual. Tbh I find that vibe boring, because what fun is there in just sharing unique disjointed viewpoints, but talking to them makes me feel special...I'm not sure it's Fi-Te, STJs I know are very passionate within their moral code - I think justice is a good key word for them, NFPs are more passionate then moral from the outside - they have easier time entertaining moral grey in others then STJs, at least until a point.

&gt;she is very open to hearing new ideas, and from what I can tell she does seriously think about them but at the end of the day, she has a strong moral compass that she sticks to which determines her ultimate opinion on the issue/topic

Ime whole of that quadra really enjoys this weird looking at people uniqueness and kind of validating individuality thing. It's subdued in STJs because of Te logic of the world taking prominence, but if you're talking how you feel they're rarely try to push for harmonization to the collective.Ha, yeah, I'm agreeing with you. I just found the description decisively more Te-&gt;Fi then the Fi-&gt;Te, if that even matters. 

&gt;every Fi user appreciates this approach to some level, definitely

weirdoes...Okay, what do you value in yourself? 

Do you sometimes hear initial question, and automatically know how you view it? 

Do you sometimes feel like other people are just not capable to see the whole picture / entertain the whole concept and have a hard time changing your mind?TJs, yeah probably... do you want to add to my knowledge of preferences by type on this topic?&gt; Whenever I hear a question, my brain starts working and produces an outcome based on my thoughts.

Yeah, kind of like every brain in all honesty.

&gt;A lot of people don't get the shit I'm saying.

Why do you think they don't understand it?&gt;SFJs are even worse in my experience

They do it less in a joking manner because it's easier for them to aim at the end goal - like for all judgers, they don't need as much validation for their Fe as TPs.

haha, well alpha group dynamic is like rubber band - we want to expand things while discussing, but the moment someone is left out/uncomfortable we kind of aim to navigate the discussion to shrink back to comfortable level. This is noticeable with NTPs because sometimes they'll blurt out some Ti analysis, see distress and try to kind of explain their way out back to pleasant vibe - in the form of 'there's no need to be sad/angry/etc., we're only talking about ideas'.

I also get:

&gt;"please stop doing x/y/z" and  "calm down." (yeah, house cat reaction)

in social situations from delta, but usually when I meet an STP and we proceed to playfully explore concepts. Or I hog the discussion time because everyone else is introverted and feel I need to fill in the silence and make everyone included and *having fun*. NFJs will be a bit more caring towards inclusion, STPs can run people over when they get excited (and I had younger ISTPs question my pleasant vibness of 'well, maybe it's just x person's beliefs, they maybe... don't have to be logical' *cue let's hold hands*) but both need input from social setting. So unlike gamma, I enjoy XNTJs but one on one, XSFPs championing people for their individual qualities makes me uncomfortable.Do you think people don't get the logic? 

Do you try to explain logic behind them when they don't get it? 

How do you react when people don't get your ideas, do you think your logical conclusions should be obvious to them?

Sorry for the question time variety thing, but you're more explaining how it must look from the outside then the process.

Do you often find yourself impossible to consider other outcomes in the future, then the one you visualize?thought it was a yes or no question, but... I don't really think sexual preferences have anything to do with MBTI type. Would be neat if it would, but I don't really have a big sample size apart from TPs who forget inhibitions when sharing how things work - they often retell them with emotional investment of recalling instruction on how to sharpen a pencil. TJs always make those things sound much more romantic/dreamy/special.I'd say either ISTJ or maybe INTJ - anecdotal evidence from dating both types for 3+ years each. Even EXTJs exhibit strong and personal emotional motivations. Fi always adheres to the user himself, so it's much more complex system of value relationships.

TPs on the other hand seem fine with quite shallow emotional responses when the overall vibe is positive. If it's fun and pleasant, they seem okay most of the time. The certainly exhibit lack of a lot of negative emotional feedback, until a certain threshold is reached.?Well imo, TPs usually adhere to the *pleasant Fe rules*, so they voice their discontent with passive politeness or joke stabs in social situations. 

Now, this works well until there is something ongoing in their immediate relationships. They have problem communicating how bad they feel, so they superficially upkeep the pleasant vibe while their Ti tries to crack through the problem. Once Ti gets enough *'rationalization'* (it's sometimes not rational, because not everything is rational) that they can and should in fact feel bad, they either doorslam that person or act like caricature FJs.

Fe as butter is priceless, Fi is those colorful candies that explode on you tongue - you think their eatable fireworks but in reality it's just baking sodathere is not much in here, but stabbing in the dark kind of - ESFJ or ENTP

&gt;Crime shows bore the fuck out of me but I have a huge soft spot for old CSI (Vegas) and old seasons (before Stabler left) of Law &amp; Order SVU.

It's interesting because such attachment to one specific part or thing, I often associate with inferior Si. The fact that your description is painfully low on details about yourself, but constantly lists this one or two things that you find core to yourself but are not very important/helpful to anyone else is like typical faulty Ne-dom/inferior-Si myth making - slap everything that comes to mind and we will see how it goes, this is my precious sensation collection - look this must mean soo much about me. Sadly my own analysis of myself would be as painfully blank as this.

You should have Ti because

&gt;I really don't know. I might be more Thinking than Feeling because I think a lot about my feelings? And then I feel them?

well, just because this is very Ti way of asking things as you figure them out. Then forgetting to figure them out and get conclusion.

I'd say ENTP, but well this may/is probably wrong, anything you'd like to add?How well do you communicate negative emotions?Yeah well, I'd say ENTP. Try the ENTP sub, if you don't find how they talk and present ideas at odds with your perception, you're probably one. Now we can't say anything for certain from the other side of the screen, but you didn't include any value judgments (or any judgements) in your post, which usually is like not Fi-Te. Your 'analysis' of yourself, is devoid for any Se or Ni for me. There's no Ni single bigger vision there.

For me, since there is not much but what is not there should also be taken into account, this is inferior Si, with Ti-&gt;Fe. I mean, if you're asking other people is what you're feeling about your feeling and how you're feeling is correct, I'd rule any F out in dom/aux.No, I think you've done okay job. Try to confirm if you're ENTP, try the sub. Read stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/44mwk4/the_secret_of_nts_inadequacy/) and check if in any way it resonates with you.

I think some Ne-doms have problems with describing themselves, so maybe that's just confirmation.Oh, okay, what kind?What type would you be comfortable in being then?ENFJ's don't have extroverted thinking - Te - they have same as ENTP's introverted thinking - Ti. 

ENFJ - Fe-Ni-Se-Ti; ENTP - Ne-Ti-Fe-Si

What you're describing is Ti-Fe process, sometimes Fe-Ti. Extraverted thinking - Te - doesn't have to ask for opinions, it's in the real world so it knows it's correct. 

&gt;I talk to many people about a problem/opinion, before choosing the one I think is best. Sometimes I just look for input despite already knowing what I'm going to do.

Well, you're talking about intuition later, but introverted intuition (Ni) or introverted sensation (Si) is more like already approaching things with conviction of how they turn out. Like you have already idea how the world is/should be and if what you think will happen doesn't you feel at odds - that there is something wrong with the world/this isn't how the world should be. So it doesn't wait to judge the outcome, because somewhere unconsciously the outcome they think will happen is decided.

Extraverted intuition or sensation is more like crystallizing the outcome while you move through the motions, not approaching a situation with definite outcome in mind.

I am not implying you're not ENFJ, you may be, check it out.

It's the non-finesse version of Ti, you see *input A* comes out as *output B* and that's it. Weirdly it's more correct and efficient...Easy, ENXPs are also enamoured with their inferior Si. So it'd be weird if ISXJs, weren't enamoured with their inferior Ne.

So Si as I understand it is not past experiences/traditions and more like a core of concrete being that is backed up but what you experienced. Like a big black hole that has distilled everything you experienced into some signifying potential because the mass is so great, or something... It's the concrete and assured one'ness with what you experience subjectively in real world. Or so I think from what I can access.

IME what ENXPs do is entertain the Si collections, they get attached to very specific distilled Si singular experiences/signifiers and try to kind of map themselves from them. This is why they sound so random sometimes, because those signifiers, being so sparse, link to several inputs.
Ni is convergent, it doesn't like new per se, it likes what fits it's vision. It's not out there looking for the better option, it already knows what is the best for the future/fits best to it's preconceived vision and tries to influence the reality so it fits to it.welcome then, ENFJ cult leader ;D...&gt; (Ti) decision is based on what makes "most sense." Applying even rules to a system.

Yeah, Ti is blind to facts' obvious correctness if they don't fall into it's logical structure/grid.yeah - I think term stuff foot in ones mouth was developed solely for us - and when we blurt something that is received badly  it's like explanation time - *'don't be cry, it's not like you know...'* Well in some situation for me it looks like:

I'm sad (Fi), so what you've done is wrong (Te 'objective' proof).&gt; Fi users in general can process their emotions on their own so when they are feeling awful they can go and get it out.

That is not my experience with people with Fi. Yeah, the do get it out, but aren't like FJs who will talk their feelings out and kind of find solace if someone commiserates. 

I can't really see myself, but it's subjective, that my Fe comes out in spikes. My Fe is pretty passively keeping up nice mood of my surroundings, for it to come out with vengeance or a spike you need to burn many bridges. Well, from my observation:

When I walk around with my mom - ISFP - she is constantly changing moods, like constantly evaluating her surrounding and giving tangible outcomes/objects some significanting 'emotional' values. She doesn't need to rationalize at all those values because to her Fi they are obvious, so not sure if that would mean processing, because there is not conscious process - Fi 'sees' a sign and it pings.

Now, when I see TJs, they have the spikes. Their Fi doesn't have such broad assortment of separate values and is a bit under the Te objective influence, so it comes out in spikes. Those spikes have the same Fi quality as the typical FP's Fi - something pings. 

So in my experience, everyone with Fi likes for someone else to rationalize 'the importance' of those pings. But also doesn't take very well when someone tries to reason with them why those pings are wrong - trust me I tried that many times.

FJs/TPs don't really experience those pings so much by themselves, their emotional expression is linked to the group. Especially TPs don't strike me as the ones that have random spikes of expression by themselves. When I, and some other TPs I know, talk about emotions it's usually linked to some herd collective emotions and validate them by saying that they are in fact correct with the collective emotion.&gt;  As an N, I tend to find myself very practical, even if people say I'm not. A lot of my S friends find themselves impractical, until people tell them otherwise.

Yep, that is my experience. I thought for basically most my life how grounded in objective reality I am, only for my ISTP best friend to show me time and time again how unrealistic my perceptions were. Only later I started to keep track of what is actually happening in my perception, and really notice that my perception of 'what is' can't dissociate itself from 'what may be'.Thank you this is a good explanation. I, ime, will firstly disregard objective facts if they don't fit the logical integrity of my Ti. I will also accepts conclusions that fit into my Ti, which are objectively wrong at first glance to Te. Both of these conclusions can be corrected later, but that is the initial response.

I like the subtle gender thing :D.more like Fe and Ni... but it's quite shallow label thing&gt; was I right about the gender?

who knows, this is like objective Te knowledgeEm, so this is what I can deduce, my best friend is an ISTP. When I talk to her - like two people with Ti do - of how things work in real life situations, she constantly asks me what is 'now'. I can't cut through between 'now' as the state world presents - what Se deals with - and the probability it signifies (Si and Ne). There are things true and false, but only because of Ti/Fi-&gt;Fe/Te in my perception of how it works. Of course there are Si signifiers that also help, but well Si is already subjective.

Now, this may sound very exciting for SJs because they use their Ne to do the mystical things in their minds, when they want to. But when you have Ne as your dominant, it's not those mystical things as much as primary everything. SJs can get very attached to their Ne visions/input but their Ne is also more grounded in details then exploded to more imaginary/improbable things - aka used as a tool or enjoyment. If you use your Ne as an enjoyment, sure it'll be nice - it's like SJs escapist to wonderland function. If you use it as a tool in entertaining decision making in certain situations, sure you'll know where to best apply it. 

But when it's your primary function it is contrasted with world in a different way, we can't simply unhinge Ne from reality like SJs and have fun with most improbable scenarios. We also entertain better dose of 'judgement' over Ne conjured reality - as in we know after some time that Ne is not real just probable real, something that not as easy for ISXJs when their inferior is acting up.&gt; exciting VIVID possibilities

Yeah, no so much for us

&gt;cough cough edgy internet INTPs.

I have an INTP friend who ones in a while will go into this giant theory of how in primal/early societies everything was felt in unison, like people felt together - it's elevated onto some mystical telepathic link that was lost. Yeah, inferior Fe...&gt;It's like all the entirety of my experiences have been boiled down to short paragraphs that basically say "Yeah, I did this thing."

Yep, that is how I feel. When it was introduction time at my uni, years ago, I was like 'I'm A, I did X, I don't like watching movies(which is one of the most bodily experienced things for me)'.

&gt; Finally, I want to add that what keeps me as identifying as ENTP (besides everyone telling me I am lol) is how much I relate to Jung's description of the Ne-type. That person who gets so enraptured by the possibility inherent in something (the delusion of how it will be amazing and life-changing) that I pursue it extremely aggressively and single-mindedly until I have it, at which point it becomes dead to me. The person who goes point-to-point with their interests and the things they want, obsessively fantasizing over and chasing them, but abandons them mentally and physically once he achieves or acquires them as he orients towards the next thing.

This is for me Ne fantasizing about the rawness of encompassing-condensed Si, the raw signified experiences that Ne want to find and fantasizes how when it does it's perception will converge and the reality will feel real *(I'm a poet now)*.

edit: and thank you, rub my Fe moreyou we're wrong ;D

You really don't speak Ti-Fe speak.&gt; I'm sure it's different for ISxJs. Probably more like that creepy fucking baby that always whispers in their ear that the world could end in the next five minutes

Haha.

I have access to 3 Si-doms, ISFJ and ISTJx2. Their Ne is sometimes catastrophic - as I feel *something* bad will happen, or whatever happens it will be awful (it's never like tertiary Ni of my ISFP mom acting out, which conjures what *exactly* bad will happen and interprets everything in objective reality as signs of confirmation). But on brighter days, it actually really supplements their Si - makes them look for something beyond but in more subconscious level. They're also very attached to their Ne-visions, like very attached - Ne-doms would never be so attached, it look's like Ni in dom/aux conviction but absolutely unchecked by Se. It also vomits all over their arts and humour, because even Si-doms understand more then subconsciously Ne pattern making.

&gt;His non-physical thought processes stop him from being as safe as he could be in situations like that.

So STJ, so STJ... they've come prepared...So, from my perspective it's different.

My ISFJ grandmother, 73 y/o, will ie. talk with me about these elaborate logical system she conceived on how magic/spirituality work. She will go into this in depth explorative analysis, but will always be like 'or maybe not?'. She is still more convinced on Ne probability true'ness then any Ne-dom, but her investigative nature is close to NTP.

Now my mother, ISFP, won't ask 'or maybe not?' when talking about new age'y things. She'll be like and that's how it works - proof - proof -proof - Te mind numbing facts. The problem is her Te doesn't come with unfaltering bullshit fact detector like Te-doms does, for her all 'facts' are equal and opinions and 'facts' are muddled together. Te/Ti also have gradations, like Fi/Fe.

Now, I'm not sure how inferior Ne works in ISTJs, but it must be somehow aligned with NFP logic because my SO often says:

'You can't see anything special in people, you just can't acknowledge any value in individual imagination'nah, entp sub is close to entps not getting visible cues from environment they're crossing the line - entp's w/o Fe inhibition - allow us this escapism. Your perception is skewed because Fe in entps well, kind of often lands at odds with all ENFP-ISTJ quadra. There may be few others from alpha quadra in entp sub, but it's mostly alpha being 'you're not special, no one is special' let's be together thing + let's correct the logic w/o emotional input from others.

&gt;NTPs as these edgy sarcastic assholes with LOGIC

My ISTJ SO view of me when I don't remember to uphold to his Fi justice system. I'm sorry, it's just sometimes really hard for us to not over-cross/understand those lines - but it goes much better for Fi people we know personally.Te has it's problems, Ti also. But inferior Te has, em, more problems?

ISTJs enjoy analyzing things like NFPs, NFPs enjoy seeing Te facts/proofs of their value relationships. Idk, I don't really get that, they just like to share and validate each other's unique viewpoints/experiences, that are somehow inherent in 'objective Te reality'? Like this is important, I felt it - oh you felt this, that's unique, I felt that - I guess. I have no idea what goes on in that quadra's head so I'm just outside observer.&gt; only fleeting glimpses that suggest there's more to be seen

The thing you really want is at your fingertips but you can never touch it, kind of thing...&gt; or correctly typed SJs?

XD ... I made a post about what being the *snowflake* [Ne-dom experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mm1jn/the_unromanticized_view_of_ne_in_dominant_si/) is about...&gt;a kind of tribalism

Fe, it's Fe. Don't worry, it's like... damn, I can Ti explain my way why we're like that (god, TP's *'don't be cry'*). Tertiary Fe tribialism is much more aggressive then inferior Fe, which is often enamoured with it as some hidden thing. A lot of ENTPs, at least me myself, act like caricature SFJs when growing up. I'm sorry this is making me uncomfortable so I'm getting into explanation mode, but on the other hand I think I know me explaining you why you shouldn't feel a certain way is like not good and will actually not help at all - and I'm still doing it as I speak of not doing it. Is that non-explanation explanation alright?gimme, gimme Fe...well, allow me to elaborate then.

Fe is always herd like, so in it's judgment it'll always refer to the herd and probably it's inclusion. Now, like ESXJs have great new toy in Ne, EXTPs have it in Fe - this is why they're seen as 'charmers', we can crank it up or down but it's a bit unreal, it doesn't have that much power over our internal world but we still like it? (edit: it has loads to do with how we evaluate the rest of our stack and ourselves, but that is not important atm) So the 'herd' is not as varied or realistic for us as for FJs, we tend to treat it as it's homogenous with ourselves. And since our cognition goes from Ne to Ti, to Fe as validation, we presume other people present their theories (opinions often are taken as theories) to our Ti to check for logical integrity so we can give them 'herd' judgment. I guess? I mean when we feel one with the herd, like the herd reflects our logical cognitive preference? If not we just passive-aggressively polite you? So we like want our herd to reflect our logic? Idk...&gt; If sensing is the literal senses, I am trying to imagine what going through the world as a Ne-dom is like. I have definitely experienced my mind -- when I am really excited -- connecting ideas across gaps in information 

Em, I think this whole text is the romaticizing on Ne in a way, I can't really in depth answer it point by point because there is too much detail. What you describe is Ne from dominant Si, it's like woee-Ne but with full resolution of Si. But I'll try to answer how SJs and NPs create art, because I'm an 'artist' (whatever that means, I have paper to prove it) and multitude of SJs I know are. It may also explain how Si looks to Ne.

So Si is not senses as they go (you may be more blind to it) but distilled quality - it's subjective compressed essence of reality perception. Like signifier of reality, it's not exact but it's very *raw* due to it's upped fidelity.

Now I'm not saying your idea of what Ne-dom artists does is wrong, it may be right from the outside perspective?, but honestly I can't conjure such resolution of motivations/logic to confirm/disapprove it. Like you already connected dots in a pattern.

What Ne looks for is novelty, but this novelty doesn't look for new for this sake, it looks for raw. The Ne-dom then constructs some framework (Ti or Fi) of how to investigate the reality, it hopes to find the raw - the tangible sensation that reflects what judging stack searches for. Now the true 'rawness' of Si, comes not from singular Si impression but from it's multitude - like the 'critical mass' of Si that becomes the raw, the distilled reality. But since Ne dom find patterns, it starts with some vague Si notion, some singular impression that fits in the investigative framework. Going with the learned pattern finding, Ne traverses not only what is immediately perceived - that can't provide enough resolution to achieve rawness - but also external things that are associated (by Fi/Ti). The borders between things/concepts/impressions are not as tangible to Ne. So in a way by trying to fill the resolution, Ne will draw in more and more singular signifiers (Si impressions), since it's own cognition of reality is sparse it starts looking for signifiers that it can experienced 'by proxy' and are more accessible in large quantity - theories, books, everything really is a fair game. Basically Ne strives to reconstruct the fidelity and rawness of Si, so it's always cracking up more to the theory - it's still principled to judging functions so it cohesive to Ne-dom, but the perception will never reach the fidelity and compressed immediacy of Si. Ne-doms kind of feel that if they add one more detail-one more connection then their reality will feel truly real, reach that fidelity - like if they turn one more page in a book everything will make sense. But what they're really doing is tearing pages from various books in the same section of the library, slapping them together and hoping the 'rawness' will magically happen.

So, to give an example - I'll try to explain the process because it may not be em, evident? My ENFP friend was doing installation, and she brought to show me an old empty photo album. She was like all over the texture of the album, it was her family photo album, all photo albums in her house had this texture, this texture was her *family memories*, now if she only expand this to a whole room this would let her reach wholeness or rawness with family memories, like it would be her map into family memories, map of ... - now, what was happening was that her Ne was pulling similar signifiers to the initial one which was associated with 'rawness' of the album texture. Once she expanded it to the installation aka real world, the presumed installation didn't give her the rawness - it was still like a low quality photo blown up to billboard scale. This is how it's like to have Ne, you think that if you expand those few nodes of 'raw' you find so precious, add more of similar, they'll magically start feeling raw real... but they never do. They're still like a low quality photo that you just made big. Once the explorative rush of Ne new is gone, you know what you made didn't give you the raw real...

*(I think this should give you the idea of how much Ne-doms can romaticize Si)*

SJs approach art differently. My ESTJ friend investigated and made a concise map of what he wanted to do, what he is interested - he made a high fidelity impression of reality he wanted achieve in his work. Then he meticulously tested how to make that reality tangible. He made from scratch a whole programming library that worked and emulated how he thinks is optimal and correct/best way a specific physical fluids worked. How he envisioned them. Then the fluid reminded him of how various objects behave in water current, this weird motions. He added that, played around and saw which mostly fits his preconceived vision, and so on and so forth - Si expanding on Ne hunches.

Idk if this is correct or cohesive, it's probably just part of Ne-Si relationship, it may be more personal for each ENXP - but reading both u/MetricExpansion and u/dogmanthedestroyer it may be em, kind of similar experience, but this is what I kind of think of it atm, idk...&gt;  I would be thinking, "...yeah, that was totally called for. I deserved that one. Dangit I can be an asshole sometimes. Poor cat, having to put up with me."

I often explain how my ISTJ behaves to my friends in the cat anecdote, but it's more like:

"...dang, what happened. The cat was playing, I was playing - we were playing together, having fun-best day of our life, totally cool, then poof! got scratched. WTF? like we were playing, the cat wanted to play, if it didn't want to play he would not be playing with me. So whyyyy? Why is this cat so irrational? You know what I mean fellow Fe user? Like the cat shouldn't be angry, I didn't mean anything bad (TP versions of FJs passive 'I wanted to help'/'I did it for you')"

&gt;Just because y'all grope each other randomly doesn't mean that by walking into this room, I should de facto expect and be okay with being groped. 

Em, not necessarily but... like some ethics are kind of relevant to Ti, like big ethics, I mean it's such a vivid and kind of negative example. It's negative, of course even TPs will know such stuff will distress others. Like we don't want people to be unhappy, we want to be happy - but together. We don't want to go against everything a person's wishes, but well we know our wishes and we think your wishes are like kind of our wishes - like empathic together wishes? Maybe we bend our wishes a bit so we can kind of do them together in some form, even if those together wishes are no longer 100% like our initial wishes, and maybe we expect you to also kind of bend yours in a bit more pushy way? Like it'll be less fun if you do your wishes, I do mine and we won't do them together? Thank you, didn't know if my thinking over this description was acting up or was it coherent.

I'm not sure if we're agreeing (re-read it, I get the tertiary plot angle now :D - nice point) or, I think your description aligns with some of what I observed in real with the tertiary. There is description by ESTJ how he uses tertiary Ne, so maybe that...

&gt; Fi is not really about being stuck in your ways, but...

...but, but *cat values* trump card!

I think there is also somewhat haphazard tertiary Fe process, what you describe is kind of external expression of tertiary Fe and how it looks.

I absolutely relate, and from what I observe in INXPs the nostalgia for something that is related to their inferior is em, at least in INTPs (it's somewhere in the text, but I'll just copy it)

&gt;I have an INTP friend who ones in a while will go into this giant theory of how in primal/early societies everything was felt in unison, like people felt together - it's elevated onto some mystical telepathic link that was lost. Yeah, inferior Fe...

This is the Si flashes, I guess...


&gt; And Ne can get lost in the abstractions and big picture, and can be unsettled by a feeling of being unmoored or of the map being intangible/malleable, and it craves the kind of resolution, depth, and texture that Si has in the domains where it has experiences.

Unmoored (Ne-Si) is probably good way to describe it, it's neither positive or negative in emotionality - it just is. Kind of like Si/Se also just is but it's described in that everyday'ness whatever blandness (because as I proposed, SJs write those descriptions so their blind in a way), I'd say Ni as well but Ni doms will be hurt D: . 

Ne is a perceiving process, P's experience things as they come, kind of, they don't have already converged idea what to expect.

Yeah, the are two other Ne-doms in this discussion and both have interesting things to say about Ne, so maybe how I experience it is validated *(it's taken very smooth for a Ne description, so idk... makes me antsy)*.

So unmoored or like watching world thought a haze (it's not empty haze, there are some tangible impressions there and loads of connections and there are concepts, for example there'll be a book - a perfectly fine detailed book - but it lacks the book's intensity, that's not how real book's are or should be I think - it's a *simulacrum* book - a concept - oh, god, dk how to describe that).

I think the examples are kind of too hard, I think the way you summed up examples of Si would be kind of what I think. But Ne parenting, in me would be instead of Si-dom grand ideas, like some kind of 'feeling at fingertips' what parenting in raw sense will be about (but still kind of by proxy? like some impressionistic probability of tangibility of parenting) and expectations and oh, boy Ne needs to try and find out what!

Think it's kind of in the clear.

Now, I can't really do the "attempting to draw it together" (I think I can't really do that Te align input a to output b recipe) , because as educated artists I know all types can do those. I mean all can have a very nuanced perception but what I hear in my head is:

*Ne - would provide early sketches that would be like: human, great, 'k, can't get anything more from this lets move on* - no matter how good and tangible in details the end sketches are, Ne is kind of disinterested because the details in the sketches don't signify in their perception - like there is no distilled sense of *red* that red provides in those sketches. It's like 'oh, red' then 'but I know there must be like the high-fidelity red somewhere out there, I must go and find it - it should be there because when I look at this red I perceive through a haze that raw quality of this not high-fidelity red'. I mean Si-Ne/Ne-Si, human perception, deals with much more complex signifiers then *red*, like ie. *exist* or *be*.

Or something... idk, I think we could kind of construct a Si-dom/ISTJ description if we included your Fi analysis/reluctant example as well as Te analysis that was kind written down yesterday in another postYeah, but kind all ENFPs to ISTJs do that, so you know ;D still helps&gt; o. m. f. g. ... are you me?

yeah, sounds oddly familiar to my experience.I like the concept of Se, I don't have it so idk, concept is nice

btw I like all my functions, but it just wouldn't be fun to include them... I perceive by them so how can I not like them, there is no other reality I know apart from what they feed me...Woohoo, INTJ thanked me.

This clarity (I very rarely have such streamlined/sure line of thought) was achieved probably because of not sleeping for more then 24hrs and idk, crunching stuff. A lot of contribution is thanks to other people that I spoke to in other threads who are on the SJ-NP axis (and few unfortunate that thought they were but they didn't Ne/Si at all) - kind of pruned the way of what Ne is and isn't for me. Because for me it just is, and on ENTP forum it also kind of just is - we kind of exhibit more Ti in longer posts? And kind of really getting rilled up with how *'Ne-doms'* look at Si when describing themselves, like it's an alien function to them. Then describe how imaginative/innovative they are and omg' woe ideas - I'm not saying it's not correct - it's just kind of not makes sense to me. Now, at entp sub we ~~joke~~ investigate? the hell out of SJs/Si along those typical lines, but we ~~joke~~ investigate the hell out of everything...

Tbh I'm really touched that all the SJs-NPs axis that read that body of text (gonna wait for INTP to be like 'this doesn't make sense' and cringe at the inferior Fe example) kind added something and got together to kind of discuss and deepen understanding - oh, the alpha... And we have talked about Si so much, and that Si is now kind of more like I find it representative then when people ask do you like details? do you make lists? (my ISFP mom loves to do lists btw, she has notebooks filled with lists - anecdotal). I enjoyed the Fi-Te / Te-Fi in depth principles analysis provided and I think this should exemplify how in depth thinking/analysis can be exhibited by both S &amp; N.

I can write Ni ;D but I'd think it'll turn out more like grievance list against Ni...I find it very em, insightful how SJ view Ne - like it's still kind of principled by Si. I mean their idea of higher Ne is like so appealing in contrast to what you experience.

Btw, can I use/add a few key sentences from what you wrote in initial reply to kind 'edit after though' to the main subject.What appeals to me in Se (I may be way off) is it's immediacy. It's like clear cognition of what is, an untainted perception (god, don't laugh guys, I'm just very tired so this comes out like this). It's like a concrete experience of now that is so clear you can see a thread of how that now will/may unravel in the future (Ni). But what I kind of think about Se, it's that because being trumps over any should be/could be, it sees the values of it's perception (Ti/Fi) in outside things rather then constructs in it's head. So the world is fully immediate and real for it, I think? Well, maybe it's not Se, maybe it's just how I think of Se dom/aux.Yeah, like just look at the sunset once with Se-dom's outlook... Or the forest? That must be nice. Or take apart a robot. Or solder stuff together...&gt; 'm a little confused with inferior Ne

I kind of feel ashamed to suggest it as it was started by me, but there is a very interesting discussion about Ne in all four position and it's experience [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mm1jn/the_unromanticized_view_of_ne_in_dominant_si/)'Kay, time to bend logic and try to explain the nuances of Fe? Oh, I'd say most ENTP forum people that identify as ENTPs and are frequent posters are ENTPs, there may be lone STP/SFJ or two... Ni is very obvious, so is Fi-Te for us? Like those don't structure thoughts the same, their logic is waaaay different. This is typically called out when FP/NFJ comes around and starts asserting it's NT. 

Well what ENTPs do is kind of aggressively explore logic, types are concepts - like individual'ness of them as singular people is sidelined to determine the underlying logic, it's not of concern for us what a random concept would feel unless someone would directly target the singular person we're close too (and I never seen it happen tbh)? So ENTPs share more like insights to how types work and are kind of merciless in their analysis - we don't approach it with any conviction of what we want from it, so the more depth to the mechanism we find the better Ti reconstruction will be - it goes like: that type is like that, it does this, and another ENTP will be like that same type did this - I pushed that button and it worked like that, or in another way - and the chain goes on - until we reach P 'conclusions' like *em, maybe it's this but it's also this, idk*. 

Or if we have enough similar *push button - worked like this* then a group of ENTPs in a thread will reach consensus (I for example scan a thread when there are replies and look for similar mechanism reported - Fe consensus of sameness, my insight may match their insight to deepen Ti - or glaring different logic to how it works imo - Ti disapproving with expressing non consensus of Fe) - but we don't aim for the FJ 'smoother all Ti' so everyone feels included. 

We, I think - not sure, think that once we distilled enough Ti logic of everything, every type will fall into it's rightful place? So I think in threads a lot of same answers/similar experience converge in like comment chains - like ok TJs like respect, - yeah, they like respect, but respect doesn't motivate me - me neither, it's so boring - but like, if you can respect one, a TJ will always have your back - yeah, that is so in my experience (tangent about a TJ they know) - yeah, I had TJ boss once - oh, yeah but IXTJ and EXTJ doesn't work the same - yeah basically I think this is the difference between them - yeah, ime EXTJ... and it's full of Ne jumps to the side, sometimes which dilute the point, or off hand remarks which are only evident to user. But what we're doing is seeking herd consensus that observed qualities of x were also observed by others, that is why Ti can get so rambly while explaining how things work... like in my perception there is just pleasant vibe, no one is attacking anyone and we're kind of exploring logic (like there is no Fi value judgment in it, it's like Ti logical conclusion/analysis which other can confirm or not... we just present logic snippets and evaluate it together). 

We also explore the ENTP type in same way, but it may not be as evident  because we know logically where we falter, so a very slight remark will make another ENTP ping - like there is ie. ongoing joke how other types react to the Ti exploration which started with a gif of two whales throwing between themselves a seal (so it probably looks  to righteousness of Fi like we're laughing at other types being delicate, but what we're laughing at is how fallible we are with keeping Fe pleasantness. So probably every TP feels like they put one's foot in one's mouth with what they said every once in the while because we want pleasant vibe.). Now when we sense that something someone says about that Ti exploration variant, often a whale/seal joke will be made and that's that... 

So now this is all kay and nice until there is a Fi involved, because when someone presents us Fi we're a bit perplexed. We normally confirm or not confirm (Fe) each other logic (Ti) until consensus of how it may work emerges, but Fi doesn't like to be scrutinized within Ti logical system because it's a system in itself. So we're like 'oh, it's Fi system? why are you showing us that? you want us to take it apart with Ti? - *now it's sad but we just did what it wanted to. This is why ENTPs aren't really em, aren't really open to Fi, especially high Fi. Fi is like - it gives you stuff to take apart, you start to take it apart and it starts screaming that you're wrong. But you haven't even taken apart it entirely to know if you're wrong. You just took out a part and told the Fi that maybe it doesn't fit in logically very well, maybe considering another part would be better, maybe this part is just faulty? (We appreciate that usually, like someone asks if a part is wrong and we explain them why it's right or reconsider is it wrong or not) Confusing...* Like some FPs have high tolerance to this, but ime this always happens unless the subjectivity of presented Fi is stated. Especially if FP is not known directly. And where the shit really is confusing is that Fi likes Ti logic but when it validates Fi, like my NFP friend will present she feels like that and I'll explain her  why she is entitled to feel like that and all is well. Dk, it's probably Te proof for her.

 You're kind of saying that Ti is at odds with Te in other posts, but when Te disapproves because 'Te proof' - Ti can kind of present it facts and Te will judge their validness and reconsider the Ti logic. Ti is always somehow linked to facts, just not directly. What Ti really has problem with is Fi, Ti present's it's logic to Fi and Fi is like 'I don't feel it's correct'. It's perplexing because we're supposed to 'feel' if it's correct - judge value of Ti - together.

&gt;What are your thoughts when that kind of "yuck, ISxJ..." attitude comes up?

Oh, really, I have like a sample at home. It kind of works like this and that from what I observed. Like it does this and I think it's because of that. And once I pushed like this button and it scratched... Anyone else had a sample that when you pushed that button it scratched? Any ideas why?... this kind of thing, it's more flesh out with Ti logical assumptions but you should get the gist

Well, this is how I think of people, I think Fi value system is more visceral and more aligned with real feeling - like feelings for something get muddled within it. My feelings for something - the personal feelings, are not external Fe value (does herd see value in what I present) judgment structures. Like I love x, but I will scrutinize it, take it apart and see how it works to satisfy Ti, present it from good and bad side w/o much emotional involvement and allow the herd to confirm if my observation of Ti qualities was correct. This is why on closer analysis some of us think STJ are dreamy and white knight'ish probably, like they don't dissociate from Fi their Te.

As it was once summed up, *oh god, we're awful people* 

&gt;Not my job to correct 'em nor is that gonna be fun or uniting

Te correct the external world to represent Fi internal value system - we don't work like thatwhere did you get these descriptions from?Yeah, this is crap - there is a long ass [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mm1jn/the_unromanticized_view_of_ne_in_dominant_si/) that talks about Ne for various types, Te-Fi, Ti-Fe but well if you'd want to read it. These descriptions are very vague.

For example this posts is quite nice idea how Te is:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mjxhb/please_define_extroverted_thinking/

Best to get an idea if you have Ne &amp; Si, Se &amp; Ni, Te &amp; Fi, Fe &amp; Ti first I think.yeah, probably written by INTJ ;DWhatever, both work similarly on the principle *this is my reality, your reality is wrong...*

We this is how I see my Ne as core of my perception, I tried to describe it in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mm1jn/the_unromanticized_view_of_ne_in_dominant_si/), I think there are also interesting ideas/accounts by other NP's and few SJ's view of Si and Ne.

So, what got me thinking is. When people talk about Se, they ask stuff like do you live in the moment? Well all people live in the moment, like it's impossible to go live in the future. Are you aware of your surroundings? Well, in a way as long as your consciousness is on then every person is aware of their surroundings to some degree. So, like Se is senses, right? Well, all types use senses, I still see things like normal person. I think what is interesting is what happens after that senses input enters your mind - cognition. Apart from comment above I made, for me Se-Ni user is like: Se is the HDR immediate perceiving of the world/experience (as in HDR is like hyper real, so much that it borders on abstract, is that why it sees it's Ti/Fi logic inherent in other things? dk), with Ni mirage somewhere in the distance. I don't blame if Se users are like oh-Se-it-just-is, yeah for me Ne-it-just-is.

I think, I may be wrong or off, Se users tend to scan their Se perception for mirages of the future Ni presents, for objects that with Ti/Fi system will unwrap the thread of Ni. But they think that if they had more Ni then the future they see as far of mirages would be as real as their Se perception? Idk I always think Ni perception is like play between the mirages that you perceive exist and brief moment of touchdown with real Se signs, where you validate  that *'no, you're not totally delusional'*.&gt;Yeah. Tearing apart and rebuilding your systems is never easy, but it's necessary. And, hopefully, the end result will be stronger than what you started with.

I have a weird idea, that TPs somehow delude themselves that the whole world is definable with Ti logical grid, like if they tear down part of Ti logic it means it wasn't the absolute and correct principle of Ti (as if Ti was un faltering as maths) like that logical part was faulty. Instead, I have a nagging feeling not all world is Ti extractable... 

&gt;If only the world was full of robots and all the robots knew what they were talking about.

Yeah, I mean people are special and all but maybe they could only expect special people treatment during designated times of the day? Everyone would be less frustrated.

&gt;I feel like ISTPs are happy to sit back and let the world reveal itself to them, 

I think STPs get so much information from reality that they can just relax and kind of watch the world for 'concepts' that their Ni unfolds? Like Ne is more of noise/haze perception for me, and you kind of know Si is super raw distilled quality of things but there is not so much of it in your perception. So you look for Si like qualities of reality by proxy. Maybe?&gt;separate the already nebulous perceiving functions

I don't really think you should or can separate the perceiving functions. Maybe that's part of the problem, people try to describe a perceiving functions and it becomes unbalanced? They kind of try to define the whole function from singular examples, like give examples where Si/Ne/Se/Ni really got at odds with objective reality and was like 'woe :0'. Now this may explain why Si/Se mostly has negative/bland 'woe D:' impressions, it's more prone to perceive itself as the world objective. While Ne/Ni has positive 'woeee :D' because it's wrong like often. But all perception functions kind of *just are* perceiving reality, the whole cognitive stack makes those impressions (especially for the outsiders).

So if you distill Ne like that, not like constant experience, it becomes woo 'connections', 'ideas'(very romantic) - but that is a full ENXP stack impression when - primary Ne is validated(?). It was nicely described that Ne as it is - is like *a whole lot of noise in your head*, and when Ne connects and find what's it looking for Si (which I think of as raw, subjective distilled reality with high fidelity quality) with it's judging stack then you could kind of describe it as such a strong 'connection' experience, but most of time it's a *haze*.

So, uh, getting to the point, I suspect that no functions are really seeing as like the objectively world is. They're all abstract in a way, people don't think un-conceptual - like they don't have real carrots, books, suns in their brain? Because this wouldn't make sense. The difference is how they reconstruct that objective world in their mind, the cognition, and how they act on it.

This is probably not correct reasoning, but I think this is why Ne-Si / Ni-Se are paired together. Ne can only function as expanding symbolical meaning perception because it is based on already subjective impressions which are compressed (Si), more objective/HDR Se allows for convergence to more singular perspective of Ni.

What I think S's think of N's is that N's have raw/immediate quality to their N like their primary/aux S does and so descriptions involve a lot of muddled S-N. Like Ne is not connections for sure expanding from concepts/things, you don't see tomato and have Si distilled experience of tomato branching of to other such high fidelity impressions. IMO (I know shit about it) Ni, Ni-doms are going to kill me because I'm talking w/o first hand experience, is more like mirage current. But you don't perceive that what your seeing is a mirage/a possibly faulty perception (like Se expanding objects into maybe Ni goals?), and then you get this random flashes of HDR reality with which you interpret as if your Ni is correct. This is what I think happens in their cognition, their Ni current is the reality reigned by judging stack and then magic *symbols* (Se HDR) flash before them and confirm the Ni. (last two sentences may be just reiterating the same) This is why they sometime sound like *they know* what is going behind the scenes, with sure overconfidence. Ni is introverted perception, so it needs to be expanded with Te/Fe to kind of link to reality, on it's own it doesn't acknowledge it's subjectivity - similar to Si. But Se flashes are vague/few so the Ni-dom will supplement it's Se with Te(-Fi)/Fe(-Ti) (like abstract theories/facts), but those are judging so their kind of already specific at least in part to the person. I think that's why they may sometimes sound so conspiracy theory/cult leader - I perceive something no one else does - their Ni current dislocates from reality, is more guided and takes more input from judging stack and starts interpreting anything Se gives them as confirmation to the rest of perception. Instead of looking at Se as a check if Ni is faulty.

Btw maybe Se-Ni is also faulty, it's HDR so it feels it's more real then the it really is, it doesn't acknowledge it's perception aspect so it sees in it's immediacy Ni thread and thinks acting on it will unfold the situation to the Ni goal... dk, looking at my ESTP friend common fails.

Or so I say, idk...

&gt;fields the collective's opinions on their findings but for practical use and application

I think it may be due to Se-&gt;Ni, Se perceives the system's state *how it is* and expands it with Ni. Ne-&gt;Si is more ontological, like those are the probabilities not lets find the raw-high fidelity Si that produced them? Kind of your impression of us you mentioned later. 

&gt;TP relationships face-to-face, across the board is being able to bridge various topics for a more well-rounded understanding together

&gt;Each are more receptive to indulging in an "adventure" in their own way.

Yes, I think that is the quintessential Ti-&gt;Fe axis fun time. The best thing, imo, is that it can be never-ending.

&gt;(You see?! That's how easy it is to send me into an existential crisis. Be careful with your words.)

*don't be cry*, my ENFP had the existential crisis - of *I don't see value in anything* kind, and trying to be good friend I started to explain her that all values are subjective... :| 

&gt;  Ni branches things out, shows all the ways a situation could change?

I think it's more like a thread they unfold? Like Ni, in Ni-doms, is never *all the ways a situation could change*, more like this (Se) proves (Te-Fi/Fe-Ti) events will unfold in a certain way. Like this notion of Ni+judging stack is very strong, and they don't like to consider alternative Ni's that Ne provides.

&gt; it means that I chase things that give me a feeling that is familiar to me. Like hazelnut coffee. Or the smell of rain. Or music.

That is why Ne doms are soo new-hungry probably, like Si-familiarity registers with us less but it's kind of what our Ne is looking for. Like not familiarity as *I always get this coffee*(that too) but kind of familiarity of 'ontological' or 'anamnesis with the world' flavour? Can't describe that.Nah, that noise/haze of not realness is kind of like how feel. You kind of don't but do exist, but it's not negative or anything, and sometimes some experience/object of a raw quality is there and I start to value that experience very much.I think I kind of explained in other re that Ti is not at odds with Te, Ti likes Te most of the time because Ti can present it's logic to Te and Te is like *hmm, yes that aligns to collective facts*. But how much of facts/logic do you talk in daily basis on dispassionate detached topic? Not much. And thats where Ti-Fe and Te-Fi get problematic? In my understanding Fi-Te/Te-Fi is not a logical system of Fi - it's a value system of reality that tries to determine/investigate concrete and accepted proofs/facts from which the Fi value is extracted. So it accepts Ti-Fe as Te when it aligns to Fi because it's interpreted as kind of *Te*.

&gt;I think this all gets complicated further when feeling is tertiary!

I think your description is really spot on. But that tertiary Fi is also nice. Like a bit white knight'ish, ideal, dreams, and a bit righteous justice - like I will not bend my core principles because there is a higher value in them. Deal with it. My SO even jokes(/not jokes?) about it 'Do you know why I know I did right. Because that was justice'. Or says about a game/book/person *It's nice, I respect that*. I think that's a joke manner, but who knows... But Fi is nice, will kind of validate how you feel whatever convoluted logic you have behind it. 

&gt;What happens when your ISTJ SO gets bitey? What does resolution look like?

Yep, like *'I'm angry so what you did was wrong'*. But it was the worse in the beginning when he was sad/angry/etc. I was trying to kind of prod into probably Fi and make him explain why? Or maybe correct it's logic a bit... It's exasperating sometimes, when I hear 'No, I don't want you to explain why you think what I feel is wrong. I'm angry'. But now I just kind of leave him alone... And check back, get some more Te-proofs why what I did was bad, until it passes and then it's ok... Like nothing I can do if he doesn't want explanations.

Em, a short hand is : *I'm sorry, don't be mad? :D* (TP social mimicry, if I smile that other person will smile - I  have to remind myself not to smile or try to lighten the tone with jokes because it's not taken well, I have to look like sad I think?)Yeah, it's always seems nice when you just get a taste of something, like Ne 'vacations' SJ go in their perceptions and conjure magical/nonsensical imaginative worlds... &gt;  Te-Fi communication or deduction style which uses logic in fluid motion

I think they just interpret our Ti as Te, then get confused when out Ti reasoning changes - and feel like we've given them wrong Te? 

Nope, this happens because people fall in love and rationalize why that person is special then uncover that they conjured up image of that person instead of examining that person - woe' disillusionment. *Of course it's not their fault ;)* Then other people, like people truly are, want to cover their asses when falling in love and avoid heartbreak and ask questions does x type go with x type? Will my heart be broken? Will my life turn into sea of despair? (at least temporarily)

Every relationship, between any types, has it's problems - MBTI may help you smooth out that communication problems and fill the understanding gaps - but what problems will happen are dependent on your preferences... Some problems are common between value stacks / perceiving stacks, but you can't really determine by proxy if you'll see something as a very cool feature of your SO or something that frustrates you. If you want smoothest experience in communication go for TP if you're TP, if TJ go for TJ, etc... I can't really write, but I like your poem.It's all fun and games with TJs, until you overstep some invisible line that shows disrespect for them - my concise experience.

FPs and TJs kind of know where those invisible lines - values  inherent to other things - are, TPs not really ime...I have some experience with FPs, but from the ones I'm not super close (which know I don't mean harm) I remember the weird sensation of noticing that line just as I'm crossing it - like car crash in slow motion.I think it may be because you 'shit function' is the one that proves that your normal perceptions of how world is/works proves you're wrong/not entirely correct. It comes out visceral: *'that is so wrong!'*.

But only if you don't mistake that function for em, some of your own cognition? Like I think my ENFP friend really likes my Ti explanations of how things work/Ti underlying logic inherent to systems - when I talk/analyze about her emotions - but she thinks it's Te? Like Te-concrete and accepted proofs/facts from which the Fi value is extracted? Same when she presents me Fi-Te and I'm like, well that's logical beautiful Ti and I can see the Fe-grading? But sometimes I can't really accept 'Fi-Te' of her somethings, because I judge it always on Ti-Fe axis and it doesn't fall on it at all? I my head it feels like 'omg, this is such a wrong Ti, and it doesn't have any Fe-value'.

&gt; Her love for harmony and equality is thing I really love about her.

Isn't that Fe reinterpreted on Te-Fi axis? Like non-compulsive Fe idea?Things (ie. people/theories) have inherent logic to them or inherent value?&gt;INTJ: How many are unable to sleep because of you?

This is such a classic IXTJ dispassionately-framed rhetorical question to communicate that your actions are **wrong** because they impose on their perceived reality...yeah, but which one do you take for granted, like everything what is logical must be valuable or what is valuable is logical? god, I'm asking nonsense questions, but I mean good... or do you have harder time seeing values w/o logical coherence, or logical coherence w/o values?hmm... I'd  the INXP, or somewhere on Ne-Si/Si-Ne axis...

So I did write some things and there are imo insightful comments on the threads, which may be very pointless for you, but may also describe how you see things, or help clue you that it's not how you see things? [Ne?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mm1jn/the_unromanticized_view_of_ne_in_dominant_si/),[Ti-Fe axis](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4msyog/tps_the_aggressive_explorers_of_logic_or_people/)&gt;  meanwhile i'm annoyed that she keeps stating facts about the situation like she KNOWS it so well

&gt;she told me she didn't think i understood myself very well

tbh, this is my classic INTJ experience... For me they're notoriously come of as if they're 'In the know' - I think Ni-Se gives you that assurance stuff will extrapolate a certain way which Ne-Si/Si-Ne axis can never have (because Ne is always 'um, or maybe not?). For me especially INTJs when they're talking about you or your motivations, like they'll be super confident they've figured out and know you like the back of their hand, even if you say they're wrong - they'll just try to explain/show you some Te-Fi that you don't understand yourself correctly... uh ime Ne-Fi/Ti has no problem with Ni when it converges and behaves similarly to singularity of Ni, but on other times...

Guess INFP's Fi really wants Te, so the Fi-Te axis will work smoothly, IXFPs have this mind numbing for me factual talk of right/wrong sometimes... like these facts prove those values... idk Ti must be like supper connected Te-Fi ideal? If you had Fi-Te and had Ti then the disjointed factuality of Te which produces Fi would be also filled with Ti which would produce Fi so everything would have factually proven logically coherent super value?em, this may be different for perceiving-doms then for judging doms, so I'd kind of interpret it in the stack like Ne-Ti is not Ti-Ne?

So my Ne is never tired, it's just passively there, but Ne needs to be pruned by Ti (I still get the distinctive feeling that Ne had more possibilities but Ti has already cut the ones that didn't fall on Ti-Fe judging axis). So when Ne-Ti works together it's like directionalized Ne, but when my Ti gets tired then Ne becomes still Ti logically obedient but unfocused, like things still connect by Ti but you don't have the feeling of validity how much that connection is logical or where it leads. Like if everything connects to everything, then what are the qualities of singular everything - just noise. Ti is like a stabilizer to that noise, like antennas were for old TVs - the picture may be full of glitches but you can still make out what's on the screen.

So maybe INTPs have it other way around? Like their Ti doesn't intake Ne, and Fe is like what if the logic I'm seeing will not matter for the whole? This kind of loosing sight on Fe-communal-value of logical-analysis-ongoing-in-me is kind of how it looked to me when I observed my INTP friend existential struggles.

btw. ty for reading TP postYeah, Fe-dom/aux is like compulsion, like every dom/aux judging function tbh... looking at you Ti.&gt;uh uh, sure, but ACTUALLY it's -insert whatever off the mark thing they think it is here-, no sense in hiding it/lying/etc!-stupid smirk-."

INXJs - I have seen the *signs*, so you're wrong! (I kind of tried to reverse engineer what those [signs](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mtguu/what_is_intuition/d3yft8b) may be?)

ISXJs are more causal in that, like suspicious (because inferior Ne is still *oh, reality doesn't expand into singular realities*) - so they frame it like *if you say x, but you exhibit state y, you're hiding something*.

&gt;at least f'ing listen to someone when they try and explain themselves and not superimpose your idea of reality onto what reality actually is

valid IXXJ advice :D. I think both variants get a bit hyper when trying to impose their reality onto reality, their energy levels go drastically up. Like their perception looks at reality passively and just wakes them up to action when it flags that something they perceive doesn't match what's in their head. That's a great way to put it!I think it's Fi &amp; Te / Te &amp; Fi axis then...Haha... yeah, there must be a logical principle, but is the bite is inherent to the cat part or inherent to the hand coming in touch with the cat?&gt; In arguments I'm very often citing various things like studies, statistics and various facts.

yeah, it's something typical I see in IXFPs speech, for me it gets mind numbing because sometimes for me it seems disjointed - I mean it's joined by value judgment rather then logical principle, but trying to understand value judgment grid? especially when it's more convoluted and refined and based on weird for me Te associations gets tiring.&gt;Whereas you throw that history at me, and I will try to document all the depth and nuance and possible variation in each of the domains of their life **(Si)**, and then it is like a giant game of, "What if they have this? Or maybe they have that? **(Ne)** 

I think a bit more of your in depth analysis and we'll(Fe)/you'll(Fi) be able to describe and maybe make some in depth profile of ISTJ perception. I mean I guess while all people write such things it becomes kind of like step-by-step analysis, but that analysis is kind of ongoing all the time so it's hard to describe it in all shades.

&gt;It filters through with all the authoritative speech of Te, but I'm thankfully at a point where I can recognize how extreme and distorted those interpretations are. But they feel correct, and I can't logically dismiss them.

This is where the inferior Ne of ISXJs get all the descriptions from I guess? Not when it allows them to consider all those *what if?*, but when it gets high wire. Don't worry, inferior Si - which not often is described - is also not that fun when it goes reaaally off.

Yeah, good way to describe it FP - TP. So it is all great when you speak about stuff both think is right / wrong, athou they come from completely different perspectives. But when they they don't match on right or wrong it clashes like crazy, because Ti wants to take Fi apart and straighten it's logic - and kind of correct it by giving it more Te, and Fi feels to Ti like it wants to disturb logic it has in itself with facts Te - which Ti understands but they don't fall in the same value judgment grid as Fi would want.&gt;do you think that they are really only acting for self-satisfaction?

Yes, because you are only you, you are not anyone else so you cannot act on impulses/wants of anyone other then yourself. Now that we have this out of the way, I don't think Fe/Fi can predict how singular person in singular situation will behave. The hypothetical situation you propose and how you see it is totally correct imo, the reaction is a response to cognition but kind of your cognition is also only yours?

IMO Fe-Ti logic may have some quality distinctive, like if people around me  value x (Fe) then it must have a logical principle (Ti). That comes out in disagreements as 'that's what people want!', so if a Fe user was in a society where everyone is aggressively acting for themselves (which is hugely unlikely because human society can't exist on such principles) he'll think there is logical principle to that (Ti), and find at odds objective factual proofs that go against the logic it defined in that system. While Fi user in similar circumstances would associate factual proofs (Te) as confirmations why he can feel/act as if everyone is entitled to act aggressively for themselves. Luckily world is objective and multifaceted so such singular perceptions don't matter...

&gt;Yes, but I also think that having a tert/inf Ne instead of it in a dom/aux affects the interaction greatly. It's not so much the Te sledgehammer to the Ti that is a problem so much so than inferior Ne pulling out the worst case scenarios to the Ne-Ti musings.

Well, that may be kind of that SJs are more what they went through temperament then NP. Most SJs I know never pull this card, but sometimes kind of feel that Ne-inferior bad thing but squash it themselves? I actually have bigger problem with ISFPs, especially my mom, where tertiary Ni is so 'I have seen how the catastrophy will unfold, I feel it's right and you can't prove me wrong'. Maybe it's just mother thing?

&gt;So where intellect is concerned, N vs S shows a 10 point lead in average IQ scores

We kind of went though this but I lost the thread where. So my take on it is that if you're a very high IQ S you'll more likely then not to get N. Those studies were done like on 1000+ people who first got administered the mbti test, then IQ test. Now mbti test/typing as it goes, w/o understanding functions, is super inconsistent - I can't really imagine high IQ sensor getting S if he doesn't know the functions. Because of descriptions and bia'es, and how the test/typing is presented. So I think the highest IQ S's just jump into N's typing, so their curve lowers and our grows. 

As for non brilliant or even non average N's I met, their like a brick you wanna bash with baseball bat, or like the most negative stereotypes you could conjure. Like that one INTJ I knew, who was smug as fuck that he knows what everyone else doesn't and has whole world figured out while tripping on his metaphorical 'feet', and instead of noticing that maybe he was not in touch with real - he was interpreting that everyone was too stupid to acknowledge his insight. But you meet N's not as frequently, and a stupid N will probably rile you up so easily that before you even can understand they're N, you'll just decide you don't want to have anything to do with them. S types are much better at appreciating uniqueness of dumb N's, even if it's more like 'a specimen in the zoo'.

Btw, I kind of started to form an idea what Se may be, instead of *'Do you use eyes and ears?* - yep, you're Se.

Maybe it's different for perceiving doms, It looks like you're using Ti-&gt;Si and jumping over Ne. So instead of perceiving-doms being able to just perceive, your active open-world perceiving turns off if your IXXP. Looks like the loop thing.&gt; Like one bad night's sleep and I can't really do anything except just...perceive.

Yep, that kind of like it for me. Like instead of arriving at Ne-Si connections guided by Ti, I just jump w/o finding anything concrete.&gt;but it's because we're looking for that in each other and engaging with each other on that level, if that makes sense

yeah, I have this with SJs, few ISFJs particularly seem NTP to me when I interact with them, like I feel they're not Ne but they seem so Ne and Ti. ESFJs less because there is less Ti, unless they're way older - like my MA tutor. But STJs have the grounded NFPs tinge.Yeah, but can Fe w/o Ti determine what is socially acceptable? Like Fe needs to extract Ti logic in a way, some unconscious causal effect. Is that off the mark? Fe can't really judge on it's own, because it intake objective data from environment, if not it's just simple mimicry - and that simple mimicry is faulty, ime it's seen sometimes with TPs who smile when another person is angry, because they think that if they smile someone else will smile (that is usually the case in human=human interactions).going back, I was thinking about SJs and Ne, and maybe we're salty a bit because SJs like Ne but automatically think our Ne is like theirs? Focused and applied. Like they expect Ne-doms to use Ne like they do, in appropriate situations. So they'll either be super wow'ed when they see your Ne is a certain situation, ie. when working on a project, and praise it as imagination; but confused and dismissive when we use our Ne in situations they deem not in need of Ne? Like they praise you for the same thing they don't praise you?

But maybe it's more introverted perceiving doms - IXXJs - vs extraverted perceiving doms?

Well I think, since I'm kind of trying to weed out the idea in my perception that S functions are objective, that Se must be like hyperreality, crystal clear feel/perception of the moment. Which EXSPs scan for Ni?, like the reality of perception seems so clear that Ti/Fi inherent logic is in concrete things/object/constructs more then in their head and they kind of can perceive/or have this feeling under their skin how those unravel into *future* *Ni*. But for them Ni is not sure thing, just a goalpost in the distance, so they quickly jump into doing stuff to check that hunch.

I can't really understand, but maybe I could try to analyze, when my Ti picks up...
Is it the blending?Well said, TPs feel strongly for few moral things, but those things often present encompassing logic system of good/bad judgment.What make you sure?Isn't that EXXP trait? Through I can't get energy from like the immediate experience of just being(?), or more like can't register it that much.&gt;English, History, Psychology etc rather than physical subjects like Sports and Cookery

lol... actually most ISFPs I know do prefer academic subjects. Still your description of why you may be ISFP is kind of not like ISFPs I know, Se people(?) speak with impressions, maybe INFP? Ne-Si/Si-Ne axis probably? Need to ask INFPs. Why Fi-dom?

Sample, ISTJ and ENTP walking, ISTJ starts laughing, ENTP: what are you laughing about?, ISTJ: that man that just passed (goes in depth into weird qualities that man showcased), ENTP: what man?

Maybe all people have moments like this, but I usually feel like I need to spend mental energy on focus to feel more immediate (but not to use senses). But it's not like consciously saying to yourself 'now we concentrate on reality' just in feeling of perception - like noise, noise - details - noise... I'm trying to describe the experience, not like conscious process...&gt; sensing as literally being sense-perception

yeah, that can't be valid description of sensing, because all perception is subjective. (side note: I always find it funny that your brain is the organ that makes up all of your world, but it's also always in the dark. unless part of your skull is missing in which case... nvm). I think senses as in sight, proprioception, smell, etc. must be the same for all types, so what sorts that later must be vaguely different? 

I also think intuition in MBTI sense is hard to dissociate from the broad understanding of intuition, which I think mbti N is not so much about. The broadly understood term of intuition is kind of accessible to all humans, but different types may perceive it differently?sounds like Fi...

Is one of those frequent' ish: bouts of unidentifiable nostalgia or sense of dread that certain situation now will unfold in a specific way?


&gt;  i don't have words to describe how Fi does it

they are stored in relation to Te social accepted factual proofs?There is inherent logic to every system, including FPs, we just need to extract it.&gt;Define 'new reality'

So there is like typical new reality - that is like changing work, or city you live in. Idk, it just is, unless there are some challenges I don't register it. I lived and studied in two different countries and didn't really register that much of change. Thinking about living in the other country was exciting, but once I got there I didn't really register that much. Still get bouts of nostalgia about that other country experience and what it could be, but not very grounded in definable way.

&gt;You believe the world is a certain way.

Well, I think I do think world is a certain way but it's more like a judgment of viability, world can't be all whichever way, but that is the flavour of my perception. I feel that everything is undecided until it's past me, like while certain thing is happening it's still undecided/doesn't have much fidelity but sometimes when I look past my shoulder I kind of can see that raw full of integrity impression.

&gt;5 stages of loss and grief. I'm interested in finding out personal observations of how your type might experience these phases of accepting a new reality

About grief after a loss, first it's nothing. Then something hits you (wow, like all humans?). Like when I talk about what I think of Si, as the distilled sensual high fidelity perception (just not sensual as in from senses, more like from concrete impression). Something with that Si raw/compressed nostalgia and loss (with some concrete component - like not sensory nostalgia *my heart hurt*, but you can't dissociate it's realness) hits you, and you project it on everything. Everything connects to that impression, and it lasted for around few months. Well, was fun D: ...

&gt;Does the psyche behave irrationally?

Does it mean without inherent principles or w/o logic - because no human is fully logical.Sell it with encyclopedia of Te-proofs ? :D&gt; When you were planning to move to another country do you think this built towards the time of moving?

No, not at all. The instance it was decided in was like excitement rush from impression that country has. But then not much.

&gt;My perception of the world is very ridgid so it takes a lot to shake me. My expectations are usually confirmed. 

I think my perception of the world, the first function it's just noise. So like nearly nothing can really shake me up (unless it's somewhere near Ti 'you're wrong' in nonsensical internet argument) because it there is nothing decided then how can you have any concrete expectations on how things will turn out (well, no Ni is no Ni I guess). I don't hold much beliefs about turn of situations unless their grounded in the judging stack, end even then it's like *maybe?*...

&gt;So perhaps my perception of a 'world changing event' is considerably more impactful.

I'd say probably yes, like my super strong impressions of events are randomized on super random events.

Since all types go through 5 stages of grief, (or maybe not? -  but maybe I'm still to experience real grief - I didn't experience anger for sure) - they may be not about cognitive process?well you've got Ti probably ;D But I'd say ISTP because you have this, at least how I see it in my ISTP friend, Se-&gt;Ni way of framing of events. Like this deadpan observational style - *this is what it is, wtf do you want more?* I kind of tried to describe [TPs](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4msyog/tps_the_aggressive_explorers_of_logic_or_people/), maybe you'll think it's how you operate?

Whatever, for sure you don't have Fi because there is not a shred of disjointed value judgments throughout this.Sounds like that one time my INTP friend broke up and got really, really into weird new age shit to explain her feelings. now she's like *'do you remember that time I was into that? omg - that was so weird, like it's nonsense and it was kind of scary'* - doesn't register why she was into that...&gt; this is going to sound judgy

I think you're stating the truth. FPs give warning signs sometimes, but TJs are *I'm logic, nothing is going to phase me* - well unless it's just that one little thing **you just had to do**.

At some point other types will kill me for trying to imitate them...&gt; how do you survive noise?!

Ne is the noise, it's like there an object/construct and it can be connected to any other object, but your missing out on the inherent properties of that object (like if you ask yourself what they are you can list them) - like distilled impression/details of that singular object/construct are not present. So when my Ti is less then in good shape then it's like jumping between all those non-full impressions not arriving at anything, like if everything is connected to everything then what is that one everything? Like before you form a connection to the next node of singular impression (Si?) you jump sideways. It's not conscious but thats how I'd describe it. Everything seems diluted in perception but your senses are present.

I'd imagine Se w/o Ti pruning would be like getting blasted with hyper real HDR photos.:0 oh nooo...

sorry for your lossIdk, ISTPs touchy-feely? weird description.

So like, I know this ISTP mathematician who built a whole big bitcoin farm to further his thesis and research about some obscure maths, not because he had to but more because that was interesting, read as more a compulsive interest how things will pan out, way to branch it out. Then as soon he was finished, and did some tests he was done and off to something else. I think this is how ISTP imagination works, the Ti-Se --&gt;Ni provides goal, you investigate something concrete so it proves some abstract principles. INTPs are more out of it, I guess?

Ok, gonna borrow and quote /u/yelpet , I think it exemplifies difference between Se-&gt;Ni, Ne-&gt;Si when you have Ti:

&gt;Personally, I see an "aha" moment as more of a Ti thing as they are more focused on understanding and solving problems. Users of Ti are interested in getting to the bottom of things, and when that final puzzle piece fits in, they have a very strong sense of gratification.

&gt;In reality, you can have an "aha" moment with any type. Whether it is an Ni or Si "aha" is determined by what you solved that lead to it. As an INTP (Ne/Si axis), we have more of an "aha" when we solve a problem that is concrete in nature, or if we find an alternative (auxiliary Ne) to a concrete topic (tertiary Si). On the other hand, an Ni/Se user may have an "aha" moment when they find a pattern in, for example, an opponents actions (Ni) that allows for a direct reaction (Se).&gt; Ne-dominant NTP swings their immature Fe at me (which really pisses me off as immature, reckless, and irresponsible)

Ha, must be the perspective. Like I feel that with FJs sometimes, not that often, when they use Ti to reason something they find true. And I'm like *'uh, maybe not?'*(as hard disagreement), and they go *'no, no, I'm pretty sure that's what people/you/another person really wants/really meant'*.format?

idk, NTP/STP?I think inferior/tertiary Ti is just less noticeable in day to day  interactions. But then, I'll quote, there be like singular weird things FJs say, like *'couldn't we just put all the immigrants in closed camps, when they come here (EU)'*, and you go &lt; :| well, I don't think it'll go so well, then FJ is a bit disbelieving/suspicious of my assertion like *'I'm sure if people got together and made accommodations everyone would okay be with that'*. But I find it more humorous, because it's more like the logic derails for greater good/harmony...Well Fi as value system inherent to the user can't exist w/o concrete and socially accepted confirmations/proofs of them (Te), same with Ti - it can't exist as logical system inherent to the user w/o concrete confirmation of socially accepted value of them (Fe). You couldn't really thinking you right logically and feel your *right* and actually make any good judgement w/o some real world confirmation. I would be some weird *I think/I'm sure I'm right therefore I feel I'm right* w/o need to actually engage in a world...

But Ti-Fe or Fi-Te can imitate Fi, or Ti, on the first glance. I'm like super Fe, like a weird ESFJ when I play going 'well I know you're upset, but we don't have to win as long as all of us have fun' at a raging player.&gt;Users of Ti

wow, you make us sound so grand. Say it again. Then we will organize an annual summit of *Users of Ti*^TM.

I think your observation of 'aha' moments between NTP &amp; STP are right on point, maybe you could make it into a post? I think it would be a good aid if you're unsure which one you are. But w/o socionics maybe?You're calling me captain obvious, I know I'm obvious but at least I claim the captain seat,well, I have moments of clear judgement. I don't think you can determine stuff like relationships by proxy basing it on the type. It's like theory building w/o details.

Some things come more naturally depending on functions, for example expression of *respect* is kind of a learned trait for me. User /u/ExplicitInformant made this in informative analysis on the sample of the cat about kind of like Te-Fi sees, analyses and acts on boundaries, which for me are defined as push the button and see how it turns out.&gt; -I'm really good at saying witty creative stuff

&gt; -I'm very smart,but I don't apply myself,aka smart slacker

Sounds like an EXTP who didn't really have a run in with the real objective world...For what's it worth, from observing NFP friends - they can be reasoned with to reconsider? But you must really show and prove yourself. 

But that is only if the issue the ENFP gave you are what you say, and not them just not wanting to be in relationship. Because if someone doesn't want to be with you then no amount of changes will make them want to be with you. The rest of questions about what exactly to do you should take to your ENFP.Sounds like we're strategical teamwork gods :D all the carrots and no stick is my theory.

Yes, like if your rage or blame others then well, the slim hope of victory is disappearing... sadly my ENTJ friend never gets a grasp on that...

btw, what do you play? I play support. Idk, I just run around and save others, communicate next team goals, so no one will rage. So not like I'm actively having any goals but more like trying to lessen negative experience for more active players - but in the back of my mind I just know that when they're happy they'll do what I want in the end - which is win? Because we want to win, but only wanting to win by yourself will not push you that far.yep, sounds like someone I knowWell I always pick support then mid, because I don't play anything else well other then support. Everyone wants mid, so yeah? I think ie. support &amp; jungler duo, as I sometimes play with one of my friends, is enough to pull through most teams to victories. Unless someone decides to have a reaaaally bad day.

I never thought of BM'ing opponents, that didn't even occur to me until you said it, like whats the point? But I often/sometimes write things alike 'gotcha XD' when I flash to ping last Q with Sona and kill them or 'nope, not this time' when they narrowly don't kill me. But it's more like fun? Like I enjoy the teamwork aspect, we're all out here to have fun? Which seems a bit masochistic considering it's  lol.Well, idk what's necessarily in ESTP head, I think it must be prompted more by real world? Like Se needs to get anchors from concrete world for it's thoughts? But the above specimen seems smug as fuck, so he may be very young - ENTPs that got bashed with ongoing concrete world experience seem to have tempered smugness. Actually, smugness about oneself - without the doing things aspect - is like a very NT trait, it usually comes paired with walking into lamp posts and tripping over shoelaces. &gt; Anyone have any ideas what a dual Pe type would look like?

It can't happen together- Ne-Se. Because MBTI intuition works like switching on and off more concrete perception experience and learning to fill in the gaps. You won't learn how to fill in the gaps in your more concrete part of perception if you have more ongoing experience of it? When you read ie. about Ne examples you read about adult Ne, not little Ne which didn't have the backlog of distilled Si experience. I'm pretty sure I can't but people romanticize it in descriptions of Ni/Ne as this future foreseeing superpower. Like they think of them as some clear vision of events, instead of seeing N fuctions as this disjointed focus that you link together while you perceive what is now. 

Idk, it would probably be like Ne everything can be connected to everything by a principle perception plus ongoing Ne 'wohoa' moment when you were just about to pick up a 5mm flimsy notepad stacked with hot coffee cups on top because w/o consciously thinking your mind associated the concrete qualities exemplified by notepads with qualities of trays. That would be a very weird and overwhelming experience if it was ongoing.some FJ? It's full of people logic observations.Ni-Se vs Ne-Si in doms is well, all good and well when Ne-Ti/Fe converges into some clearer understanding or directioned Ne and Ni-Te/Fe extrapolates a bit from Ni so it's like directioned Ne. When that happens it's kind of easy and nice. If that doesn't happen the Ni-dom will disregard anything Ne-dom proposes and not consider alternatives to it's 'one correct interpretation', and they'll act smug because they feel they've figured everything/you/your motivations out and know you better then you know yourself. I don't think it's as noticeable if your an S, because you actually see that person as talking some trivial nonsense - but for N's is more like reality?

Si-Ne and Ne-Si usually get along when they're on the same judgment axis in my experience. Sometimes SJ will have different perception of Ne user - like between borderline imaginative and ungrounded, but when I speak to SFJs I kind of see their Ne a lot. With STJs I feel like talking to hidden NFPs, so superficially they're T but the underlying current is the Fi borders...

Yeah, when you get two Ne users - especially from same axis - the bullshit can pile up pretty fast. Like there's no facts / details to converge the theory, so if they disagree they just make a bigger theory to fit all the hypotheses. And neither can point out the flaws. Not that it ever happened to me...

on the sidenote: personally I really like presenting ideas to Te-doms, because they curiously judge it for flaws but they're like quite easygoing with pointing them out? They seem to like getting theories and kind of doing the hard work for you, so mentally testing them for viability. Curious types...The only thing that for sure gets me laughing is how TPs talk and advice people, especially IXTPs.

Like put it outside, will it help? No, so maybe put it inside and check if it's comfortable?

:Dwell, I met few ISTPs and none would view themselves as outdoorsy. But they still did fuck ton of shit that required doing, just didn't register how much it was because it was focused on some goal? Like building a whole sound registration device then spending night out to record sounds bugs make, they come back and are like 'just recording some stuff'. 

But he is a TP...If you know that person, I think it's the easiest to understand their functions by observing your reactions. It's not foolproof but if they have different stacks you'll get a distinctive sense that they have different logic? This is how I know SJs in real life, even if our perceptions comes from different starting points we work on the same spectrum. But with NJs/SPs I get this uneven rythm. So, I'm dating ISTJ for 3 years. And if you have the *childish 'Fi' / This is quite aggravating feeling*, then I'd agree on a IXTJ. This is essential impression between TPs and TJs especially if one is E and other is I (not only my experience) - it was the same when I dated an INTJ. The Te-Fi always is linked to some kind of let's call it *respect* or right/wrong judgment ime, and basically pushing buttons and questioning values - which TPs tend to do - proves TJs that we don't show respect. So as long as you don't show lack of respect, both are quite complimentary because the preference for T makes it easygoing. Another thing I find is that Ti can really rub Te-J the wrong way, when it doesn't want to arrive at definitive judgment after in depth analysis. Basically TPs can get into over exited analysis pattern, and I'm talking both S and N, where they just want to talk more and more in depth about subject. This is what aggravates my ISTJ SO about me and his younger brother who is an ISTP. I think? Like 2 hrs is max... and then he's like *could you just please stop that*.

&gt;SJ's are Si right? As an Ne dom, how do your relations with Si doms tend to be like?

So, I have run into very few SJs that could be in any way associated with any samples or typical depictions of the type. I think the facts that SJs seem to construct perception of the world more from what they experience then any other type and the lack of one common path in life nowadays, make the ones I know seem wackier then NPs in some behaviour. (Although the few older ones I know are also wacky, so maybe that's just how they are?) Like real weirdoes, or NPs that go their shit together but are more about individuality. Or grounded NPs that apply Ne to appropriate topics. The Ne thought pattern, as typical for NPs, shows most when discussing dispassionate topics - like future of humanity, the role of media, physics, etc. But since my SO is an ISTJ, he prefers to discuss topics that fit what my ENFP friend likes to discuss just in a bit more concrete manner. 

I think in the end, what you like is more dependent on the person, but I find that in my adult life I always land with a TJ, so maybe there's just some fatal attraction in that? People that usually interest me instantly in social situations are TPs, which are easy to spot - there is no mistaking that Fe lower in the stack *awkward charm*.got mostly alpha, then bit of beta, no gamma and near no delta - at least Te Fi / Fe Ti should match. dk how gamma has any fun...I took different understanding to what you wrote, and I absolutely agree with your proposition. I think the mistypes are due to very miss informative and non descriptive profiles S tend to have, like I wouldn't be able to identify an SJ from what they say even thorough I am pretty certain I know SJs when I come across them. Most of them are not accountants  and kindergarten teachers (which are great professions btw but should dictate the type) but architects, physicians, researchers, entrepreneurs, and whole slew of other things. The thing is a lot of attitudes in mbti are due to lack of information how functions work, what N and S means (how many people just say it's intuition and your senses?), it's like a big game of Chinese whispers... Plus people ask questions about things mbti can't determine so it's a weird reverse engineering of theory to people - like if Ni would go with Si? idk, but like probably not... Ne is not irrelevant shit ; _ ; *cry*

yep, that's the impression, Ni just doesn't like alternative Ni's which Ne provides all the timelike TP logic - human states: happy +1 / dk? 0 / sad -1 ?

does this maybe [describe](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4msyog/tps_the_aggressive_explorers_of_logic_or_people/) you a bit?

Haha :D, well this is informative.

&gt;A good example here would be the "what if everything is a simulation?" line of thought, that you can't say anything about anything for certain except that you exist in some form.

Omg, this part got me so excited that we're gonna have super fun time together but the rest of the reasoning felt like you've shown me the most fun thing in the world (atm at least) and just hidden it right back again. Of course I would entertain any of the following thoughts, but there are so much more thoughts to be had from each of those sentences which could branch off to new sentences...

But I get the idea, "we can't know anything for sure" is very Ne and shows even in SJs.well, not my idea but this was proposed to check which quadra you are [quiz](https://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/socionics-quadra-values-test), ISTJ and INTJ are in different quadra... but you may not even be TJ, but probably surely a T.

You describe yourself like INTJ, but if your first function is introverted perception it's quite hard to point it down.yeah, I mean well "you can't know anything about anything" but can assign it probability, I think it's a bit how I perceive the world - like not consciously, but the vibe I can't shake off.

I think I get humility in more the feeling singular, like there is singular reality in the end and you're just speck of dust? But well, NTs are not know to be humble - look at our descriptions.

I think this highlights a bit, SJs very often can entertain such Ne mussing even if not all the time, like not when there is stuff to be done, they react more as if you showing them something exciting. Like you're a bit of a magician? which often feels very nice.eh, then you maybe can determine inferior, inferior Ne makes you feel like something bad will happen sometimes, and inferior Se will make you feel overconfident in same situations.EXTP has this Fe performative quality in social situations, like you're a bit awkward but still social - a bit of a magic trick thing? Like you can switch it off or on, but are quite good at it. IXTPs don't care that much, they want atmosphere to be w/o drama but don't have that compulsive performative social aspect to them.

STPs investigate more concrete aspects (but it doesn't mean manual, it can be books, knowledge, etc) of reality and then form abstract conclusions.yeah, that's like defining quality of all TPs, like maybe ESTP the least, but usually that's the drill... but we're also kind of crap? we're useless...

on the other hand, Ni and Si, introverted perceives are nothing like EXXPs - so the method seems not valid. Unless INTJs decide to be happy and cheerful from now on...do you value respect? or do feel very validated when you feel respected or maybe also do you respect certain things for their value?yah, the rare unicorn...but imo it's easier to interpret Si-Ne as Ni then the other way around...ouch, Te :D 

but I agree, typing people you come in immediate contact is easier because of speech and thought formulationI agree, it's nice distinction, STPs are very goal oriented, NTPs are more like *so I'm feeding myself and changing underwear* - life success! But INTPs I know, 2 of 3 are not that fun loving, but they're fun drinking? If you have Ti you're more likely then not to believe there is logic in some system or see the logic w/o proof, Te is tied to socially accepted knowledge/factsI think it's Te-Fi then...So, not trying to be dismissive but the Ni description from the first test seems a bit like magic ball. Although Ni-doms do formulate impressions on big questions and kind of overall perspectives, so if that seems right, you may be a Ni-dom. Through all types and humans formulate such perspectives, I mean were humans after all.

The way you portray yourself is a bit like my ISTJ friend who also has mild Aspergers, especially the idealistic to disillusionment perspective you described. STJs often have a strong or maybe yet uncurbed NFP idealism when young.

Either way, it's very likely that you're an Introverted perceiver as dom or aux, and since you're ruling out ESXJ, I'd say ISXJ, INXJ.

&gt; I can get rather annoyed, especially if others are saying things I find wrong or inaccurate

I think it's quite alike Te-Fi axis judgment.

Can you describe that experience in detail, when does it occur:

&gt;I have a strong tendency to overanalyze almost everything in my daily life, which gets worse when my mood is worse, including daily social interactions. If only I could apply this to something useful...So, as a theory I do think that Te-Fi axis is portrayed as organisational gods, and though I met a few TJs that embodied just that most of them - especially IXTJs - are rather prone to procrastination and uneven energy levels. In example my ENTJ friend is notorious for leaving his assignments until the last night, but on the other hand says he has trouble finding peace when his mental list is not ticked off at the end of the day. I think you could/should consider IXXP ruled out, I don't really remember an IXXP having any expectation about others being prepared. Ever... but I have pretty bad memory for such things. 

&gt;beyond that making me fairly hypocritical, albeit something I'm trying to work on

I think, but that is my impression of the type, TJs usually are very hard on themselves and actively point out - work on their flaws. More from factual understanding them then some higher emotional/idealistic imperative. Like strive to be a better version of yourself.

&gt; have some difficulty working with existing structures imposed over me, especially when I see some easier or more convenient way to do it

This is also typical in my impression of all TJs, both NTJs and STJs. They have, well imo (said the Ne-dom), problems accepting any structures or ways of doing things that don't seem efficient or they deem pointless. Whereas TPs/ or people with Ti usually cut corners and kind of act like they don't until someone calls them out on it. The common misconception about STJs is that they like old rules? conventions?, which may be the case for some (like for all people) but usually the rules or conventions they subscribe to are their own. So while that doesn't necessarily mean you have Si as your main perception, it doesn't also rule it out.

This whole analysis may of course be wrong, or I may be reading into your response from completely wrong angle. If so, let me know.Yeah, I usually don't concentrate on chat, only when I kind of communicate goals and all - just standard. I never even take the underdog side because it divides team even more, plus sadly more often then not  the raging person is partly right :0. I prefer working towards peace.wow, may I say with few adjustments for Ti, I'd say it's a pretty on point Ne-dom relationship instruction. I think parts like the 'bringing up stuff casually that you really want to tell more about' is very alike me.Well I come from the point that if I smoother everyone with Fe zen everything will work out - like *no sad face, group hug, chop, chop*

While I never mind players learning, the one instance where I actively clench my teeth is when someone else plays support. I guess it's very seldom experience, so I should be thankful. I do understand the beauty of first item Liche Bane Sona w/o sight-stone, but WTF? Arghhh!whops, someone really has to chug those articles out to pay the bills...

&gt;Si users are all about adhering to tradition – and alcohol is the most traditional drug of our time.

No coffee? You disappoint me... Si-doms should get all super high on coffee, like it's so proper and all. Or opium, that was very traditional drug at some point. Like hello Freud, ...

&gt;Extroverted intuition is somewhat of a high in itself – but a high that lacks focus. Ne dominant types are constantly searching for a way to defy their physical needs and improve their follow-through on their many excitable ideas – and speed (or amphetamine) provides a shortcut to accomplishing both.

I actually love the idea that Ne-doms lack focus, but well at least I'm high in a way? All the time? Like I'm so unfocused I can't make a step by step plan of what to do? And perceptional focus will actually let me follow through ideas that span several months? Or does she think Ne-doms have attention span of a gold fish?

Yah, someone should understand what cognition as in the term **cognition** means.well all drugs do same things for all types, since they affect you on neurotransmitter and biochemical level. It's more then phenomenal factor of cognition which imo is what MBTI is about the most. All type get drunk the same, wow, that data we should/can check. How you react to drug is very different depending to a person. 

What maybe rubs salt into my voice is the weird idea exemplified in this article that:

fact 1 + fact 2 = theory

let's mix and match facts so they kind of fit our interpretation...IXTP, maybe read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4msyog/tps_the_aggressive_explorers_of_logic_or_people/) and think it this fits how you reason/function in daily life

I think it's highly unlikely you're not a TPThere is a certain way elegant 'theories' that include brain/consciousness/neurology are constructed. Especially ones that don't include data, just vague concept of how stuff works. Once you've went thorough a few, your spider senses are tingling.

I mean, while drug experience can give you fundamental impressions, and help you visualize how other function work/could work - it's highly unlikely that they tamper with actual your  cognitive preference but more like change phenomenal perception of it. As in your brain is not functioning as it should, so your cognition of itself is also not like it should. As in they change also sensory input. But idk...&gt;he doesn't know himself well enough?

Since you say classmates, I'd say you're young'ish? It is very hard to know yourself well when you're young and objectively evaluate the core of how you behave, since MBTI is not about conscious way of thinking, but about way your perception is focused/skewed. When you're growing up use of some functions becomes more evident/natural, it's not that they're developing, but you're becoming aware of them and how they influence your life. For example, when I was young I still had a compulsive and performative tertiary Fe aspect of Fe, but was introverted and very emotional in how I behaved (aka like a stereotypical bad ESFJ).Well, the N are nearly bearable, but S are cringeworthy ? 

God whenever I read something Heidi Priebe wrote, I have this feeling she doesn't understand the term *cognition*.Taken the easiest one:

&gt;As a dominant function, Si manifests as a powerful memory 

Does it mean Ne-doms don't have powerful memories, memory plays part in cognition but is not internal.

&gt;for what has worked well in the past, 

Simple reinforcement learning, yep to certain degree we're all Pavlov's dogs.

&gt;and the desire to structure one’s life around the traditions 

I find Si-doms very good at navigating traditions if they have a sense of them, if not they're as hopeless as everyone else. But do they like traditions, probably only the ones they make up themselves / accept - like all humans.

&gt;and positive outcomes of past experiences.

Well, don't all humans? I mean once burned always shy...Yah, I'm just poking OP with a stick in a friendly manner. No judgment done, through I find younger TPs hilarious. Like you know, excited puppies? You wanna hug them, but they wanna play bite with you :D

I think for sure debating in ones head is ENTP'ish thing, but probably many non ENTP's have it. Yes, I'd say that sensing could better described as abstract impression that is concrete in origin but doesn't lack the qualia aspect? While intuition is more to do how with the amount of such impressions filtered through and how one starts to cope by connecting the dots from that disjointed current. but idk, circular thinking about it atm... 

Like you can't incorporate the senses used as input and the ability to think abstractly by forming MBTI definition of sensing and intuition. Is that a benchmark? Is anyone even doing that?I think at least ISTPs know when (and what about) they're overthinking, like when they get into Ti-Ni loopall TPs do... sadly it's hard to switch that off&gt; Ti by definition has to do with logic therefore it would make sense to say it has at least to some degree do with "proficiency in logic"

I cannot agree, Ti has to do a lot with perception of logic - as in you automatically come from a standpoint that a system presented to you has a logical principle that does not have to be proven. You don't as yourself 'is this logical?' you take it as a given - even if a system does not exhibit any logical basis. "Proficiency in logic" comes mostly from your intelligence, so Ti/Te doesn't take into it so much. While some Ti users will have easier time grasping logical principles in systems, the essential Ti, it doesn't mean they're be any good at understanding or extracting those principles, even more applying them.&gt; / subjective in the sense of being a personal experience but it is a mindset that doesn't seek to highlight that - it strives to get the most "untainted"

there is a fleeting thought that I'm wrapping my brain around what is Se, but also kind of impossible? like Se the function that wants to create a hyperreal reality of the moment... haha, probably just another attempt for me trying to burst through the door that is already openI wouldn't describe it like that. Grasping is more to do with the fact that Ti 'extracts' and accumulates logic from 'systems' it previously encountered. So the grid of logical relationships is dense. But Ti alone won't give you the full understanding, I'd regard understanding must be somehow linked to knowledge about a certain system. While ime. Ti gives me a good jumpstart in new programming language, it'll also make me look for syntax expressions that were never part of that language w/o me consciously thinking if I ever encountered such syntax.   While I do understand Jung's principles and a bit of where a lot of his accounts come from. I do find a lot of his insights and examples are a bit mystical, or maybe border line? I do see myself in some of the Ne, but I guess many not Ne-doms in certain situations would encounter such perceptions. Just trying maybe wrongly, to crack what it feels like in everyday life? How it influences perception but more at a core level then on stereotype level...&gt; "anyone can be anything regardless of types"

oh, yes it is stating the obvious imo. Not harsh on this statement as I agree, but I guess most people don't think anyone can be anything if they only wish for it.

As far as MBTI may help you show personal blind spots, I am very sceptical that it influences at all which path in life a singular person is viable or likely to choose. The overall statistic may be skewed one way or another, since T's tend to have preference for maths/programming or so the tale goes. I doubt it influences how good you - singularly - can become. Hence not every ENTP will turn out like Feynman, and not every ESTP like Winston Churchill. Perception aspect in MBTI has little to weight on how good you'll be, there is so much more to factor ie. intelligence. I only get instant gut feeling when I'm about to do something veeery stupid, like pulling a carpet from under a standing piece of wood frame. Premonition magics!F(e)ondling...I'd say the prompt ping / hunch in perception is something Introverted Perceiving types experience I think, as they build a mental model of expected reality and anything that doesn't fit/match jolts them awake. Maybe that is why they have uneven energy levels...

I find that tbh I never get gut feelings about how events will unfold from perception alone, Ne is like noise in perception which you sort through assigning probability with your judging stack. The hunches I get are mostly from the judging stack.Ne can give you a feeling of probability, at the point of perception, if *n* things go together - connect (but only along judgment stack axis), but it doesn't build a preconceived notion of what to expect of reality like Ni/Si do by themselves so there is nothing to get the hunch about?Am I missing something, or are you trying to incorporate a quantum physics' [double slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) findings into interpreting probability of certain MBTI types choosing professions? Because, god I'm not that science read so I may be off, I though the wave patter comes from nature of photon itself and wave-particle duality theory? I think it's beautiful and I may be falling in love with it, even if I have a nagging suspicion people scale doesn't obey quantum physics.

I think Gaussian distribution should do the trick, but then you'll find most Ns and Ss are mediocre at everything.

On side note, there is great book *In search of Schrodingers cat*, it's quite fun read and you may like it.&gt; The human mind is of greater complexity than the mechanics of the universe.

em, Ni speak? How can it be greater if it needs to obey mechanics of the universe? (cue *playful Ti poking*)

&gt;I'm saying that to not acknowledge advantages and disadvantages of different types in this crazy messed up world is dishonest and wrong.

I am sure types have their advantages, but they are slim on the scale of more fundamental things like intelligence, IQ, memory, etc... like if an INTP has IQ of a 100, and an ESFP IQ of 130, who will be better at grasping mathematical concepts? 

I think if there was a probability distribution of jobs types work in, all S and N would fall in mostly 9 to 5 desk jobs despite the type. They're still Ss and Ns with different stacks, but most people just don't have possibilities/qualities and circumstances especially to be benchmark examples, I'm not saying this snobbishly because I'm part of that pack. Cognitive perception can give you an advantage of course, saying being a certain type will propel you further (unless all the other major factors are there) is raising pointless expectations. How many ENTPs come around that think they're destined for some greatness, because wow Ne is so ideas friendly?&gt; Super reliable, hard worker, smart, great knowledge.

The TJ analysis... &gt; cocksure asshole

but they don't mean it, do they?&gt; The most complex system you can come up with in simulation pales in comparison to the human mind.

Yah, for now. The thing I see is that human mind is just well, not much in the whole scheme of things. We have very distinct, autonoetic consciousness, which probably makes us feel special but imo we're not much. The fact we can visualize or understand more of the universe, is just that probably we're dumb as fuck in comparison to nature of things.

&gt;ESTP physicist/mathematician does sound kind of dissonant though haha

I know an ISTP mathematician who is doing extremely well in academic career, and an ISTJ engineer who is researching comp-sci for quantum physics experiments. I also know a few Ns who are so dumb they have problem even being average at their work. 

&gt;Take the IQ of all North American INTPs, average it. Take the average IQ of all North American ESFPs, average it. Which is higher? Are they the same?

There were a few studies on IQ and MBTI correlation, the average difference is around +10 IQ for N's statistically - there was no variation between F or T preference. I think it's safe to say with the way those experiments were conducted - 1000+ participant getting administer MBTI testing then IQ testing - that we can safely assume there is no S and N IQ difference because with the way the MBTI tests are provided no person of very high IQ regardless of S or N preference will get an S. So S curve slightly lowers, N rises and that is +10 IQ difference. If there was a substantial difference, it would be much more visible. So afraid to say, if you're an INTP more likely then not you'll be around 100IQ even if you're an INTP... plus additionally type is not that correlated biologically in monozygotic twins (but only few studies were made), IQ has correlation regardless of later environment.

Oh, but average N's sound like they're smarter then they are I think, because they make these swiping generalizations and conclusions. So it's more to do with pattern of speech and how much conviction they project behind it.

&gt;I want to be proven that it's pointless.

; _ ; I don't do particularly well with that, but since there are so many factors outside of MBTI I'd say it's slim. Being great or even moderately good at something is not only down to your perception (cue ISTJ SO who thinks he's planning but can't plan for shit, he's not even interested in consciously planning), and I think as long as a person acknowledges that it's all good. I think there are some very predictable thought and behaviour patters or perspectives that are very insightful in MBTI and one can apply them to themselves within their type (as in understand which way his perceptional pattern is skewed and kind of adjust to help, like you're ISFP - weird grips of singular dread about certain things in Fi-Ni loop - understand what may help you and that those loops are wrong perception of things in real world instead of being stuck in them for days), but extrapolating them onto career or relationship choices seems overrated. Through MBTI seems very good at bridging understanding in ongoing relationships, so that is cool. Guess you need to actually fancy that person first, then get down to really taking apart how they work.

Yeas, the efficiency rating.Well, in my small experience Ni and Ne, unless both dominant perceivers have very alike views of what they want, are awful together. Since INXJ already approach a lot of things with specific vision, after initial awe moment the process is full of pushing and pulling between Ni-doms and Ne-doms.

On the other hand, from small experience EXTJs go with ENTPs, at least me, like marshmallows and hot cocoa. Te and Ti are great at troubleshooting each other and no being perception-first both EXTJs have more impartial approach to presented ideas. They just get them, evaluate them and do implementation planning for you.So, I'd say just from experience - EXTJs and ENTPs seem to fall into a natural pattern of interaction. Of course there must be stuff like ENTP respecting the EXTJ judgment and not tripping over his logic, but with that in place ENTP can generate new ideas while EXTJ feels like a kid in the candy store because he can pick and choose whatever thing he finds valid for the cause.

With Introverted Perceiving doms, I find that basically one needs to be hierarchically - like a manager - in charge for more chances for seamless interaction. If not, IXTJs can be very attached to their initial vision and very judgmental for other people ideas. So things like collaborations ime go off the rails and become pretty salty.sshhh, listen, it's cryingHa, great reply! Can we have another one? 

So, I think your insight is on point with statistics, but I think what a lot of this thread is harping about is the lack of validity in the stereotypes. Or so I say, the lack of observational aspect of the stereotypes. The career ones, or educational ones seem pretty skewed two ways between T and F, at least to a degree and feel more like a reverse engineering.

The basics of many stereotypes is the fact that they ascertain a proficiency of T or F in an average person being linked to math/science or liberal arts, because of preference to make judgments on certain axis. Then build up from there. Instead of acknowledging that an average person of a type will be average - average marks in education on all subjects - maybe with one better when they like the teacher, average interests, and average intelligence and pretty much an average non descript job. Now most average jobs have marginally hard tasks that could showcase cognitive preferences. And I think similarly can be said for up to BA degrees.

So what it boils down to is *'librarian or a farmer?'* question. Is an average ESFP more likely to be a an accountant or an artist. I'd say accountant. Is an average ENTP more likely to be a cashier or an entrepreneur? An INTP an office clerk or a researcher? God, maybe I'm mixing stuff up. Anyway, what I'm saying some of the stereotypes are hugely exaggerated w/o any connection to average, and some are just said as average. While certain things maybe can be said at marginal jobs - ie. higher in academic position in specific fields being N domain, I'd say most career stereotypes in MBTI are hardly helpful for an average person with an average education.I think it's down to an individual.

But theory...

well, I'd say the most likely is the Te-Fi or Ti-Fe axis, with the favour to the first - but you never know. Purely because both axis don't depend on human value systems as much, and have easier time forgoing human sentiments. A Fi-Te axis may be more likely to stand up, but also being brought up with certain degree of 'proofs' already it may have problems seeing that the initial moral stance is wrong. While Fe-Ti may have easier understanding the that system lacks integrity in logical moral sense but not act because of social approval for it.Haha, yeas I also jumped a ISFJ librarian connotation.

&gt; among librarians

I'd hazard a very rough guess that for most works with low entry levels you'll have a mix of everyone, because those jobs are usually snatched by a person needing work with certain low entry qualifications. This is also based on two stereotypes - of an ISFJ and of what library work is like. There is very little function validation why a librarian would be such a good choice.

Well, still I think the idea that ISFJs are majority of librarians is neat.

&gt;So you have to ask... what matters more? (...) or the proportion of types within a given job when making those career lists?

I'd say, and it's only my theory, that the most valid would be to taking into account ISFJ'ish type and the alpha quadra, one could determine job with certain vibe that may suit the ISFJs within the workplace. I imo think that most of those career lists are done ad hoc by people, to fill the space on the profiles. It's like theory on certain stereotypes. But you may be right.yeah, I mean I started to understand that *'I respect x'* is kind of a TJ slang for *'that's so cool'*.Reaching P conclusion :D

&gt;Move into something like engineering, physics, counseling, or C-level executives, and I think you'll find a vastly different population perhaps dominated by a few closely related types.

I'd say, and that what was I alluding with quadra and maybe type or typical types temperaments ie. FJ/TJ/TP/FP, that you could compile a descriptive'ish lists about workplaces/needs. I actually could hazard a tough guess that a lot of TJs are executives/entrepreneurs/managers, over certain proficiency level, but not because of the function by function analysis but by the (ime observational experience) very big problem in accepting hierarchy when they don't think the structures are valid and they don't respect person in charge. Idk, all TJs I know one day - more or less planned - go like 'fuck that, I'm quitting'. I think there is more in type/judgment characteristic that can be made about workplace atmosphere then well, just these stereotypes.

Btw to clarify as well, I have nothing against ISFJ librarians. I haven't met an ISFJ librarian, I only know an ISFJ: architect, programmer, accounts manager, herbalist and artist. 

Well, gonna not point at INTP because that is too easy.

I'd say an ESFJ, that's quite a long shot in some parts, but sometimes I go into these weeks where I get really into caricature ESFJ stuff. Like baking bread every day, planning picnics, etc... plus I think while I was growing up I did have these weird caricature Fe-dom loop going on for quite a long while. Over all, the ones I know, are like applied ENTPs they work hard and then play with me. I also think I have a bit of mature Fe~ wibe (if I say so myself) with younger people. Dk, I think it would work.&gt; INTP is idk, your typical thinker or theorizer

haha, that's awful, just someone OPWell, it's pretty much I think because it's easy to mash what you do with how you perceive things. Ie. I have a quite strict moral rules imo. but when I look back I kind of know they're constructed from more logical/by proxy basis. 

/u/ThisWontDo had a good idea, that if your unsure it's nice to do a quadra quiz (yay, more quizzes for you):

https://www.helloquizzy.com/tests/socionics-quadra-values-test

because quadras are easier when narrowing down your introverted vs extroverted aspect of function, Fe vs Fi, etc. Not always, but that may help.I think if you're tertiary Fe but you don't have many FPs/FJs in your daily social life, you can get into that way of thinking that your feeling preference is strong, or that your Fe is great. I know I thought I'm like social harmony sage when I flat shared with two STJs.I think that is probably it. Tertiary Fe seems very sensitive and easy to use but only when people around you have less F~ wibes. Since tertiary Fe is ime a good translator between F preference and T preference of thinking, much better then tertiary Fi, you never really feel that out of place with both. 

Funnily, I think Ti also seems like superpowers when your social circle revolves around FJs and FPs. Maybe that's a way to tell what preference makes up your social circle mostly when you know your type? well, seeing your flair - welcome onboard fellow TP, I wrote a little [instructional](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4msyog/tps_the_aggressive_explorers_of_logic_or_people/) piece about us if you care to read.Cognitive functions are not behaviours? Or even stereotypes of behaviours each function gives you? Especially when some descriptions touch on single function, what it is, w/o interplay with rest of the stack, especially Se/Si. Cognitive functions tinge perception of the world, not influence as much singular behaviours or preferences. Yes , there are some outward clues but they are not what one should base their type on. You don't so much go by behaviour, but try to determine what is the core of that behaviour.

So for example, if you take Te it means nothing, like simple catchphrase:

&gt;Te looks at the facts and tries to organize the outside world

but the organization has to come from an inner impulse, so you need to look at Te&lt;-&gt;Fi stack interplay. 

The problem with stereotype behaviours is that they try to determine what is visible, ie. who is more likely to be Te-Fi axis user, you can pick only one:

-a person who makes lists

-a person who, even unconsciously, sets themselves goals they want to achieve/changes they want to make and is motivated by the end result 

yeah first person can be Te-Fi, the second may not be Te-Fi - but if you look at ongoing day to day basis in the case of first person it may still be anyone - everyone makes lists, the second one can give you a hunch that it's Te-Fi.

Any type can feel, perceive, think, and behave like any other type. But of you scrutinize yourself closely, look at a pattern of how you feel/think/behave etc. it becomes clearer. 

"Gut feelings" for Ni is over simplified, mostly everyone gets them. But what, dk if that's how it is, you walked around having a gut feeling almost non stop? Maybe even elaborate one. How many of them would be wrong? 

&gt;Anyone can assess their personality and mold themselves to fit virtually ANY type!

If you asked me I would never think I'm a Ne dom prior to the test, or that I use intuition at all in my perception. I wouldn't even think I have preference for thinking then feeling, if I judged it by the field I'm in. Tinge of your perception is so obvious for you, that most people never even stop to think about it. But since MBTI has some classes, you can try and determine which fits you more, what is your bias in perception.btw, do you know any good/in depth ISFP analysis/articles, that touch maybe on Fi-Ni loop?&gt;  Ti considers the facts but the internal logical framework wins over if there's a conflict.

All hail Ti! :DGoing to start with tried and tested **every type can be creative**.

Well, I'm going to answer indirectly to your question and maybe you'll get what creativity is? So, I've finished several years of arts (lol) and also taught at uni, in the department of 'new media'. This is a handful of clues by which I divided students, it worked with around 70% accuracy. Just keep in mind that the person must be committed to the studies, not go 'oh I'm an artist, I'll just sit around drinking latte'.

The group beginning project with: idk how it'll look at the end:

* SJs - people that research and formulate concepts - they quite meticulously weave the pattern of associations and theories, further their understanding of what they want to get by experiments, set parameters of what they really want and start working - then they iterate through a lot of changes to arrive at final piece.

- NPs - people that are going to talk loads of theories, then bring you more theories/concepts and make some weird association with a family outing in '95 - so they are maybe not masters of procrastination, but they have very big problem getting to actual work or envisioning the final result. Most of experiments they make are on paper or in their head, unless they feel the pressure or fancy. They notoriously use their past impressions as a essence of their work, even if it's not evident to them or in the final result. Most of their artworks are done as a kind of summation of the process when the turn in deadline is near.

The final result oriented group:

- SPs - people who make things - so usually it's not easy to stop an SP from creating final artworks. Their theory and work process seems the most disjointed, but they have no problems explaining their theory or motivations. The rarely use experiments as a stepping stone, unless they're trying something specific out. Their singular works sometimes seem not enough conceptualized or the concept is not evident, but that is usually not the case when you get selection of their works. They're the easiest to be unsatisfied with final results of their work, and have no problems with remaking them until they're deemed 'well enough'.

- NJs - the 'visionaries' - NJs are the students that present you vision of their final work pretty quickly. They have usually no problems in defining the topic. Then they conceptualize (sometimes with small necessary experiments), and perfect their final vision putting work and theory pieces in their place. For so long, that they're usually the students that start making final artwork around a week before the final turn in, making the final vision just as visible as lack of refinement in the result.

These approaches are usually visible on long research - artwork projects.&gt; Home Economics?

I'm good at cooking, what's wrong with that?Yes, I mean not 'no person' but at certain point I'd say it's very easy to confuse S and N. And much better then falling on stereotypes, it'd be better to engineer some basic principles of what each type, etc. would find preferable in a workplace.

&gt;For me, answering positively to these questions would indicate a high confidence in one's own (intellectual, creative, artistic...) abilities, and not necessarily actual ability. Plus, finding that people who answer positively to these questions also score higher on IQ tests seems hardly surprising to me.

Well, there is just that. People of higher IQ or people that had more possibilities in life, or both, will usually find more external validation for those traits. Ie. if you're average but you come from family of artists... Argh, it's too many changeable circumstances, the questions are roundabout but they're very open to interpretation. With MBTI you can learn functions and determine or confirm your type so that's at least that.Mom - ISFP

Dad - INTJ

Me - ENTP, seems Fi + Fi makes Fe :D

No joking, there is probably little biological correlation as in inheritanceI saw a study somewhere, small sample but even monozygotic twins don't necessarily have the same type or S/N or / Si/Ne - Se/Ni axis. If it was so genetically inclined, it would come up. Ie. monozygotic twins usually have similar IQ, even if they were separated at birth and lived in different environment. 

Btw. my dad is the only INTJ whose Ni never clashes with my Ne. Nature or nurture? ;D*Me and 10 of my INTP friends...* ;D

also my mother must be an ISFJ because she told me to look both ways while crossing the road...hmm, I know INFP cameraman and INFP geographer, it's not much to choose from but well - pick one?quiet dinner times?&gt; The statistical probability that ENTP women are even less likely than ESTP (even though both are in small numbers) comes into play, also.

We're so rare...

but my best friend, since kindergarden, is an ISTP and since we stuck together for so long, we only started to discover not all girls are like us in later teens and early twenties.well, since we're talking about stereotypes, and you don't want to do home economics, you have to pick something else. Dk what else INFPs do.

Actually, just dawned on me that probably F preference types have the most ad hoc career lists, because it's hard to associate what fields F could be used in, T is seemingly easier because you can just say some science/math/engineering and since large proportion of people do/study just that - they'll get confirmation.It may be genetic or it may be something while the brain develops in the womb. There are only 16 types, so it's easy for patterns that are not there to surface.

I dated INTJ for 3 years, nice guy, wanted to strangle him every time he started to talk about postmodernist philosophy during breakfast. No, after some time, I wanted to strangle him every time postmodernist philosophy was mentioned. I understand he liked it, but never seen anyone who had such a boner for Baudrillard. Plus he linked everything, every decision people made, to some grand postmodernist worldview. It was bizarre...That is only if you like Dawkins...He was very ISTP'ish. 

Despite how common tale goes, most INTPs/ENTPs also don't revolutionize thinking, philosophy, and industries. Average N's are no more 'big idea visionaries' then S's. Most ENTJ are also not entrepreneurs but office clerks.

It's takes an outstanding individual and great circumstances to revolutionize anything on such a large scale. 

In a nice way, your stereotype use sucks.Well it's just personal opinion, don't want an argument. In high school when I read some books the first time it was like *mkaay... interesting*, but when I came back to them later they seemed pretty shallow. Like the investigation into points he makes is done with a result in mind. His Selfish gene is kay, but it's just popular science book. Later he wrote autobiography and his weird ego really put me off - like he is a popular science book writer, his last published research paper was in the 70's I think so he's not much of scientist tbh. But some of his funding for some science prizes are nice, so brownie points.

Well yes? I mean well Ne is cool, but you're not going to stop being human when it's your primary function. What even prompted this question?yeah, but all people fear of criticism at one point or another. There may be different degrees, and it may be attached to different things. But Ne will not make you not fear criticism. You may be less prone to fear criticism or bad result in some situations, but even that is not a given. Perception, is not behaviour? &gt; When a sensing function is higher in the stack, they just aren't going to be as oriented towards concepts and big picture possibilities; which is at the core of intuitive functions in some capacity.

Oh, I agree. Intuitives approach things naturally from big picture perspective because their perception is more or less devoid of details in comparison to S types. The funny thing is, having big picture perspective doesn't mean their naturally better at doing big picture perspective stuff or that their big picture perspective is at all viable/real. Or right. N makes their perception a certain tinge, a skew one way.

Your taking a outstanding individual and assume he's N just because his achievements are so broad. While S types often work from details to big picture, and it takes longer, it doesn't mean the big picture they envision is less valid. An 130IQ ESFP will have wider horizons then average 100IQ ENTP. That is sadly how it works, intelligence gives you bigger opportunities then preference of perception.

Anyway, since we're drawing on personal experience, I like to dedicate following part to an INTJ that was in my MA class (it's no about you INTJs, just that one. You're normally pretty cool.). The guy was dumb as a brick, talking to him felt as if you were bashing your head against a wall. Was his perception Ni big picture oriented? Yes. Did he have classic INTJ way of speaking, expression, and seeing big picture? Yes. Was his big picture vision in any way real/viable/visionary? Well, no. He was an average person that thanks to his tinge in perception skewed for N thought he was in on something big, some great theory no one was gasping. He would talk to you as if he figured you, your motivations and topic you tried to explain to him out, but his observations were crude and well, very shallow. You couldn't communicate him that, he would just assume attitude that 'you don't get how great and infallible his big picture is'. He approached everything with unsubstantiated confidence that he had a better idea, better vision, just people didn't get him. (well, at some point people just started to avoid deeper/longer ((double pun, yay)) conversations with him because it was hard to listen and not cringe) He still was an N, but he still was stupid.

So as much as N's can be all over the big picture, it doesn't make them brilliant. N types are just as prone to think bullshit, shallow theories if they can't grasp enough data, and the tinge of your perception will not make you smart. 

End rant.

Wow, thanks. As I thought, trying to understand other perception from your type perspective is hard.

It's very helpful. can confirm, resting bitchface is Ti.

But no OP, I don't think you can really type reliably by behaviour, w/o much interaction.nah, one does not simply stay quite when there is internet self-righteous argument to be had ;D plus this association comes up so much, I'm amazed... and as someone from this sub elegantly summed it - Ne likes to harp on irrelevant shit.&gt; I imagine that intuitives, on average, do have higher IQs.
&gt; And I think that NTs on average have higher IQs than people who type as INFP, which is my type.

Which is false assumption, and easy one to make. There was small scale difference shown in studies, one which can be take into consideration but  highly unlikely to be correct. 

There were a few studies on IQ and MBTI correlation, the average difference is around +8 IQ for N's statistically - there was no variation between F or T preference. I think it's safe to say with the way those experiments were conducted - 1000+ participant getting administer MBTI testing then IQ testing - we can probably safely assume there is no S and N IQ difference because with the way the MBTI tests are provided it is highly unlikely a person of very high IQ regardless of S or N preference will get an S. So S curve slightly lowers, N rises and that is +8 IQ difference. If there was a substantial difference, it would be much more visible.

In case of N's they very loosely exhibit sings of higher intelligence, but it's only the signs our society seems to attribute to intelligence not the proof. Since people usually keep their social circles semi similar in IQ, damn can't remember which study it was, the N's often get classic confidence of Big fish - small pond.

I am not even claiming that there is an even field, but it is more decided by your intelligence then perception bias. And N can use the intuition as crutch to seem more big picture and intelligent, but will still bite the dust once more intelligent Ss and Ns are around. Yeah, N will still be able to spout abstract shit, but how correct will it seem to the others then?I agree, some fields may be geared towards some perspectives and if you're ISFP it may be harder at some points (btw. great explanation of Fi-&gt;Te, will convey to my ISFP mom). 

But what I'm harping about is that even if Ns come from naturally abstract perspective and can often assume it's some magic gift, most average Ns will have very shallow abstract perspective because intelligence is linked to operating data in your mind... god I sound so judgmental now.

I think there will be a perception bias based on your functions - good to acknowledge it - but claiming you're something more based on your type is misguided. I can't validate if Ns and SJs are better at academics, but just going to paste my observation on [creativity of types/axis](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4ngv6h/what_is_creativity/d43ucf7) from my humble experience at university.Yes, but it seems only for certain types. Which makes some Ns start overvaluing their type and prize it as some kind of stamp of intelligence.&gt; There is no such thing as the bigger picture if you are missing the point and vice versa.

Yep, while a lot N theories or abstract thinking seems elegant, it often misses all the details that disapprove it. N global perspective is cherry picked in a way, and acknowledging that will further your understanding into where your perception falls short.

I would say no one perceives more accurately the complete picture, perception is subjective - reality is objective, but the perception you have will make you extract certain information easier. Through I'd love to rip someone's mind out, hop in their place to experience their perception and go for a ride.&gt; My INTP friends are the embodiment of intellectual; very very cerebral, always making logical distinctions, could talk forever about theoretical possibilities and abstract systems.

it doesn't matter if you can talk forever, if theoretical and abstract systems you're engaging in are faulty and shallow. Not saying your INTP friends are like that, just saying talking at length about something or preferring certain perspective doesn't make you competent in that perspective. You naturally find another Ne-Si user easier to engage, but that only validates that both of you see on the same axis, express and judge viability of ideas in similar way. People usually overvalue their subjective perception and insight, so while a Si-dom will have harder time dissociating from irrelevant details, a Ne-dom will engage in incoherent unsubstantiated associations.IQ is for now is as proficient as we can get in testing intelligence. Yes, intelligence quotient is not the same as intelligence, but it gives you workable rough estimate. Statistically it's much better at asserting cognitive possibilities an individual has then a MBTI type. That is why IQ tests are administer to children who are admitted to gifted programs, not MBTI test through that may also happen. And I think it's a bit delusional thinking that being a N type will let you reason on higher level that a person over one standard deviation above you in IQ testing. There may be singular flukes in that, but I'd wager an average person's IQ testing in relation to intelligence is more likely then not correct. Whatever your type may be, meeting someone one standard deviation above will usually be noticeable.

Easily trackable - do you think most people in MA programs are N's or people over 115 IQ? Which assumption is more viable?

&gt;Statistically the average N is more intelligent than the average S.

And if you use *statistical*, and intelligence is impossible to check accurately - the easiest and for now best way is to administer an IQ test, how are you constructing those statistics?

Anyway since were talking statistics, there was small scale difference shown in studies, one which can be taken into consideration but  highly unlikely to be correct. 

There were a few studies on IQ and MBTI correlation, the average difference is around +8 IQ for statistical N - there was no variation between F or T preference. With the way those experiments were conducted - 1000+ participant getting administer MBTI testing then IQ testing - we can probably safely assume there is no S and N IQ difference because with the way the MBTI tests are provided, without knowledge of functions, it is highly unlikely a person of very high IQ regardless of S or N preference will get an S. So S curve slightly lowers, N rises and that is +8 IQ difference. If there was a substantial - aka more then one standard deviation - difference, it would be much more visible.Thank you, I try to at least stab less in the dark when I'm ranting. I just find that some weird associations in MBTI irk me very, very much.I agree that a lof of N's are curious, but being curious is not being better or more proficient. Curious is a broad, open term. While a lot of Ns entertain certain thoughts easier it doesn't mean they entertain them in a deep understanding, an average N will probably seem to have more depth to S types (this is not intended in any way as a judgment of S intellectual abilities). Purely because they are the odd one out. If you're the only one who has perception skewed to paint broad theories easier in your surroundings, does it mean your good at making broad theories or does it mean you're the only one in the contest? If your surrounding is not really bothered to examine your theories or not interested in them, does it mean your vision is unmatched or does it mean they easily deemed fantastical in not a positive sense? Big fish, small pond creates certain illusion of proficiency. Yes, many young N's have problems finding common understanding no matter if they're average or not, and that is not what I'm trying to point to here.a girl... yeah, it's like these weeks when I'm fantasising of being a soccer mom or 50's wife, and then they pass...Well, it may not be the case how he talks but his latter work about archetypes and collective unconscious is far more likely to be attributed to Ni then Ne user.Yes IQ tests don't cover everything but there is nothing better at the moment, it's one of the best tools we developed so far. You can't claim:

&gt;Statistically the average N is more intelligent than the average S.

if you say:

&gt;Its hard to measure intelligence, and IQ doesn't cover everything.

Where do statistics come from, if the intelligence can't even roughly be measured or covered?

Maybe I haven't explained my point properly, there are only few studies about IQ and MBTI correlation. The correlation is skewed around +8 points in N favour.

Now what is more likely :

* N's are +8 IQ on average (which btw is half of standard deviation, nothing to write home about) 

or 

* is it more likely that high IQ sensors being administered the MBTI test answer N vs S questions in the fashion that points they're intuitives. Even if they are not intuitives in MBTI sense. There are many roundabout and open to interpretation questions.

So it's easy for brilliant S's to jump from S group to N group on such statistical studies. Consider how many mistypes there are. If there was really big difference it would be visible by a larger margin point. 

So I disagree with you, and I haven't proven my point wrong at any part of explanation - I just summarized the studies I encountered and inherent problems they presented which were obvious when I read them. Unless you propose one should just blindly take any psychological / sociological / any soft science study and without scrutiny go 'oh, that must be correct'. No control group! oh no, it's still correct. No double blind experiment in medicine! oh no, it's still correct. Non replicable results! Still that first one was correct.

Why take for granted you're intelligent just by MBTI typing, it's not hard to get an IQ test, try to join the so called 'island 135' at MENSA, idk... why take for granted your intelligent because of one test that doesn't even aim to test intelligence, and not take direct IQ test... it's so much easier.&gt; could have something to do with the mother's stress maybe?

oh boy, could it or could it not. Seems neat idea at first glance, so I'm suspicious. I think as far as MBTI is applicable, tracing such huge correlations at this point is out of a grasp. It's imo just very hard to provide wide statistical studies, because personality tests aren't the most reliable.

&gt;Ni tends to over fixate on a singular interpretation/understanding not even realize that it does it, and feel the need to obnoxiously connect it to everything. Since the brain is fixated, it can find a way to distill some sort of affirming lesson about said understanding in everything.

This is a beautiful explanation of the phenomenon.

Yeah, it's very hard, w/o reminding yourself, to remember that introverted functions are subjective. Ti can get into this standstill where it's so rigid that it just takes it's logic as some higher power.&gt; When you spend the majority of your time thinking a certain way, you tend to become somewhat of an expert at it.

Well, let's agree to disagree. If you're average you'll be expert at thinking a certain way on the average scale.

&gt; A lot of SFJs, STPs etc just aren't interested in spending all their time in a cerebral headspace.

Of course. But at some point in life, you don't get cookies for doing something or being interested in something, you get cookies for results.  

&gt; certain people are consistently called intelligent whereas others aren't. Pretending that we're all just floating entities who don't exist in comparison to others at all is IMO just glib.

Yah, MENSA members come to mind. Or your children. Basing comparison on personality test is super shaky. Why not instead of reverse engineering from personality types and 4 letter, people don't just go and take an IQ test. You'll know where on scale you're floating then. You'll have better point how cerebral you are, instead of attributing it to N.

But let's just agree to disagree.&gt;  Just trying to approach this rationally instead of emotionally; obviously emotionally we want everything to be an even playing field but I'm not sure I buy that.

Well, if you say thats what people want. I just think there are far better methods to ascertain if an individual has outstanding intellectual qualities then from a type on MBTI test. There are thinking preference tests, IQ tests, etc. which don't ask a person stuff about their personality, and do much better job a determining  individuals intellectual qualities. Not always, but most of the time. I just think it's usual shallow stereotyping, personality tests tend to measure personality traits not your intellectual prowess. Sure, I mean, I love speaking to Ne types, but I keep it in mind that it's not our high intellectual standpoint that we paint those broad perspectives from, but from the amount of bullshit 2 Ne's can generate.Well highly unlikely, there are a few studies from what I remember - but on low number of samples - and even monozygotic twins don't necessarily have the same type. There is slightly higher chance for the type to be the same, but it's not a certain - and that may be due to low number and weird correlations. Even if they are brought up together. If there was a high correlation to genetics, most monozygotic twins in those studies would have the same type. Therefore it's highly unlikely that genetics play major or only decisive factor in MBTI typing.

For comparison, monozygotic twins usually have roughly the same IQ scores, which are also heavily correlated to parents IQ scores. Even if they are separated at birth. This shows it's highly likely that intelligence, at least measured from IQ tests, has a major genetical factor.

edit: btw my dad is an INTJ, my mom ISFP, on the sample size of us two it's pretty clear that NTJ and SFP make an ENTP ;D You can make a *'league for type intercommunication and appreciation'* - call it 'INTJ and friends' - and discuss certain stacks and axis interplays and stuff like common problems, procrastination, goal setting&gt; They're children basically.

Yep, forever...not that much, if you take how varied siblings can be...Well, I think all types can be manipulative because all people can be manipulative. It's more to do how you view agency of another person.

It may be one of those old type tales, I really would be surprised if someone knew so many ENTPs irl to form a substantial conclusion.

There is a subtle thing to Fe, that it can try needle into some soft spot, but it's mostly social not ulterior motive based. So all types with Fe, maybe excluding IXTPs, may come of a bit like they're looking for some in and that makes you uncomfortable.

Overall, I don't think it's down to any type. The most manipulative person I met was an ESFP.
&gt; cold, calculating inner ~ OMG! DO YOU KNOW HOW COOL TAPEWORMS ARE! ~ mind of Ti/Fe

FTFY
It is partially silly, because personality tests test for personality traits, not intelligence. There are much better test to determine your intelligence then a personality test. Claims that any personality test is better at determining your intelligence is very weird. I'm starting to sound preachy...

Difference-not-hierarchy - yep, that is the point.&gt; Also immature ESFJs tend to be down with passive aggressive cattiness, shit talking about stuff that didn't even happen, constant attempts to destroy reputation,ad hominem accusations in what was supposed to be an impartial discussion...plus Si like, never forgets.

Yeah, but from what I heard - loads of immature/young ENTPs - especially being confused by their Ti-Fe act very alike to SFJs. Something like a vicious streak that tempers as a person matures. &gt;(and isn't the most TJ comment ever)

you forgot to mention *respect^TM*, I'll say 5/7 for TJ'ness

I think I had one - it wasn't well applied but it was very caricature ESFJ behaviour, and on the entp sub some people mentioned similar experience. But I think the origin is more confusion and weird non detachment ENTP gain later in life. I certainly don't think narcism, which is often slapped as a label on ENTPs, has much validation.Tertiary Fe people can get into very stereotypically bad Fe-dom behaviour, but it's compulsive in the worst meaning of the word. I never had an ESFJ friend who couldn't control some of Fe-herd compulsions. While I've seen  this lack of control in most tertiary-Fe when younger. Later that changes to 'whatever'.

&gt;Where is my IxTJ cold-evilness?!

idk, from my experience/observation TJs tend to be more sensitive then TPs, who are not less emotional but operate on two planes - Fe feelings and personal feelings. And those don't intermix as much as Te-Fi. I mean at first most TJs are *I'm logic, nothing will phase me* ~ *unless it's that one thing...* I think the offences are divided into two groups, and are communicated by TJ in different ways:

1) A mild offence or change that is required, which is often communicated by asking this dispassionately framed rhetorical questions, like: 'Don't you feel that leaving parts of soldering things on the floor makes it quite hard to move around?'. The thing is, it's not actually a real question, or so I gathered from answering them.

2) The heavy offence that happens when you cross the ~magic *read as invisible* line~, when TJ gets angry/sad and doesn't want to be appeased or talk things through. It's like trying to engage with ferocious cat with bare hands. Ime this is what earns me *'Now you're gonna explain to me why I shouldn't be angry, that's not how it works!'*. I think this is where the impression of childish Fi comes from, because under the polite and pleasant vibe TP tries to upkeep - each one thinks that if they acted in such a fashion as well then the fight would escalate ad infinitum. 

Tbh with the second offence I always leave them alone to cool down, since trying to lighten the mood is not taken very well. Plus for me most of the time TJs get upset/angry at some made up crap which I can't take seriously, sorry. All of whom I dated at least. 

Now, when it comes to TPs, and this is not only my experience, in relationship with TJs - it's usually that they're really bad at communicating negative emotions when they can't get a logical leverage on them, and TJs can be very dismissive because such communicates usually don't contain much emotional expression.

But to me TJ and TP are very different, TPs will notoriously have problems reaffirming the respect, and TJs give respect to most things they find of value. Both of the types have very different understanding of accepting a person, for TPs it's usually 'yes or no', but TJs can accept you while putting pressure for you to change ~ em, or better phrased expecting you to be driven into being a better version of yourself. Idk, I have like 7 years of observational backlog on few samples... We're like cats and dogs imo.yep, it's legit Ne-Ti meme now&gt; because the way they go through life is as an excited 5-year-old would.

This is one of the points of why I laugh at the idea that ENTPs are born entrepreneurs. Maybe some of us are, but I wouldn't post it as inherent quality.

I had a 26 years older then me ENTP MA tutor, we rarely spoke about the MA but hell, we had so much fun taking apart different electronic toys and playing with them... you just need to corner them so they can't escape&gt; Young Justice

love this show, love it so muchActually all function plan/envision in the present, I think just Ni/Ne users have harder time distinguishing the present and past/future in their mind.&gt; ISTJ would have inferior Ne, and that usually means a reluctance to change the status quo

keep in mind it's usually not the case with SJs that are your generation. SJs are usually masters in deciding which rules to break, either from conformity to authority with STJs, or to social rules SFJs. Of course not all of them, but this is typical from the ones I met. Think of them as people that are good at navigating whatever is in society.

&gt;"the accepted method" of doing things

the so called accepted method is the method they find correct/right, it's not anyone else's method nor is it necessarily socially accepted method.So you must have a hunch if you're using Ne or Ni, Te or Ti. Like INTPs and INTJs are nothing alike when you talk to them.oh, let's have ESFJ and we'll have all the Fe extroverts to em, Fe bully the person into submission.&gt;  My room is a disorganized mess, in fact I'm only organized when working (i.e planning out how to do things, scheduling when I get which assignment done, living my whole work life scheduled to the hour.)

You should consider but not base your decision on behaviour. What is important is why it happens, or what is the core of that behaviour - ie. I have really good planing skills but keeping to them is more of a learned reflex and knowing things will go awry if I decide to skip work for a week. Most people that actually work implement some form of organization. So why do you organize your work, but your room is disorganized?

All TJs have Te then Fi, none of them use Fe and Ti in their main stack. So you should look in the first go at all TJs - all profiles with XTXJ, then FPs - XFXP because you may also be one even if unlikely. 

Nah, the real people who start drooling over 'what was' and what could be~ and past deep inside are NPs. Si users approach past more naturally then NPs. Se people from what I find are the least sentimental, but that doesn't mean they'll have easier time accepting they have aged.

The biggest problem people have with ageing is the acceptance that it happens, and that is mostly up to personal view. Instead of viewing it as part of human experience, people think it's some kind of offence to them.Shame? It's not shame it's massive disaster and sea of tears of despair. It actually scrapped so much of useless timeline that loads of DC/Marvel universes try to include, and made coherent reality. Like really, this was one of more put together animated super hero shows, which actually touched on some semblance of psychological depth of characters that is not cringe worthy. Especially season two. Oh god, I forgot how hung up I'm on the fact it's discontinued. Buckets of tears now that the dam has been broken, wanna have them mailed. You'll get $rich$ from extracting all the salt in there.

Fuck, now I'm gonna go through all the fandom again, searching for clues what could have happen in season 3. Omg why can't I at least read fanfiction without cringing most of the time. I know why. But whyyy? Why can't they at least publish a comic or a novel that resolves the unfinished plot lines? Argh, fuck today...Tbh, it's one of the cast I can't pinpoint. He comes off as NTP in part one, but season 2 he's seriously flipping. Any idea?&gt;Have you had experience with Si grip?

I can't be sure but probably. But there are pretty common occurrences when you don't feed new information in your brain, that your Ti starts recalling all the bigger choices you've made in the past and dissecting them through Ne's what could have happen. Or you just don't feel that you're very in charge of your life, a lot of Ne-doms decisions are pretty opportunistic.look, it's nearly impossible he is a TP. He doesn't argue like one, he doesn't write like one. The closest he could be if he was flipping into some Ni loop with STP, but he doesn't show Ti or Fe. Of course it's only internet here, but you do get a common way of writing or expression in at least a bit. So yes he could be an INTP, but it's highly unlikely.I know one, omg two because we're full adults now. They're laid back unless they aggressively try to help you correct your logic but with kind intentions. Damn, it's so hard to type him, ISTP maybe?wow, this sounds kinky...&gt; people yelling at me gets me off

This is my physics fav duo&gt; My boss is ISTJ, after every workout he talks about his elbow or his shoulder

that's 50% of men, the other 50% don't complain even if they're in constant painI prefer TJ leader to TP leader. The best manager I worked with was an ISTJ, the only Te user in the team. She was brilliant, great at setting goals, delegating tasks, structuring work and understanding the various the skill set of her team. But that may vary from person to person. 
ENTP, got INTP. Accurate, although I also love my own type.
&gt; If failed, Kidnap him

That'd be too easy ;)

My call to act stem partly out of a kind of pity, since I knew him when he was still whole, way back when, and it makes the downfall even worse to witness. I'm the only one that he still opens up to, though rarely. 

Also, I dread how my father would take it if his brother didn't show to the funeral, and know for a fact that he would drag him out forcefully if he made any kind of an ass of himself there. Hell, I'd hold my half of him on the way out. But it would break both our hearts and I'd hate to.

But /r/relationships has convinced me not force the issue, that it's his battle to fight, his choice to drown his sorrows. We men like to climb mountains and slay dragons, but this isn't some grand quest, it's time to just let go. Accept that it's his choice, not ours, and that pretending otherwise just endangers everyone on some level, physically or emotionally.

Thanks for the support. On another day, this seems like good advice I'd try.Precisely, which at first seemed like it would inevitably mean he'd be there. But he doesn't have to. He also missed his father's funeral, so I guess this is just ... him. Grieving.Not at all.So there's this uncle of mine, pretty sure he's an INFJ gone sour. Had a factory job he hated, turned to booze, wrecked his marriage, his kids won't see him, his current gf is a pathological liar/hoarder, his health is so wrecked he has actual prescription morphine to keep his joints moving. And alcohol never truly stopped flowing. He isolated himself in a tiny non-village where no one will bother him while he drinks himself to death with a view to the woods he'd like to spend his time in, but never musters the gusto to. Self-loathing ad infinitum, the works.

On the other hand, grandma, his mom, was a beacon of pure light and hope. She was one of those old fashioned women who *loved* her family into shape and made a whole lot of us, beyond just blood, become upstanding, caring, world-improving people.

She died. We knew it was coming, she was almost 90 and sick and hurting. We were all relieved, to some degree, that her pain ended. Everyone took it hard nonetheless.

So now, 95% of the family, myself included, range from stubborn NT rationalists to absolutely pig-headed ISTJs. We all want to see him attend, we all want to share the last goodbye to grandma with him, we all want for him to have a clear head and be allowed to grieve gracefully. None of us seem to be gentle enough, I guess, to get that message through.

And he'll have none of it. The more anyone presses him, the more he bucks up and convinces himself of negative, spiraling thoughts about how we're all just throwing him in front of the bus since we won't see to his wants and feelings - after expressing none of them, then retreating to his place and drinking himself to tears and/or sleep.

I have 36 hours to put my ENTP logic and pride aside, get him sober, whip him into shape and save him from an entire family's resentment, which would probably outlast his inevitably short lifespan. He's still our uncle/brother/father though, and we'd still rather see him get back up.

I'm at a loss as to how to approach him without getting bounced off, how to get him to realize that he still has family, while he does. Any and all help would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.
What?Lol was that the secret Fi test?[yup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecns_W9q_s0)Kudos for self awareness. Age?Nice. I used to be pretty impulsive. Growing up aint so bad!So long as you're making progress man.  My 22 y/o INFP brother is still pretty idealistic. He's pretty much obsessed with politics, and extremely knowledgeable/pretty intellegent. He's becoming increasingly disenchanted as far as I can tell. And its not that I don't share of his views on most things. I just refrain from caring about that which I have no control.EXTP? Glib charm sounds like tert Fe

INTP. &gt; As I got older (college), it started to develop, but was used in an unhealthy way: I got really good at reading people, but didn't actually care about anybody; I became really manipulative, it just fed the wims of my Ne-Ti.
&gt;It was my mid twenties when it started to stand on it's own. I "grew a conscious" so to speak. Started to genuinely care about people, and actually felt somewhat of a responsibility for others. I now spend alot of my time using everything I've learned about socializing, relationships, and emotional control, to help others live better.

This jives with my experience. I used to be kind of sociopathic.leftist90 percent of the posts on this sub read as "fluff". I understand that misanthropes and contrarians are annoying in their own right (not calling out /u/trippin_daisies, just saying) , but "self adulation" isn't too far from the mark as far as I'm concerned. The cognitive functions *are* useful and interesting but people come to this sub to jerk each other off every day.Lol, INTJ friend is literally a food scientistkeep going, i'm almost thereOf course the guy in a superhero shirt is an ENTP. He came off as immature and egotistical IMO. To be fair, people don't turn to dating apps because of their massive social prowess.Does she not appear INTx?
My INTP brother has also been diagnosed with AS.Don't let those fuckers convince you against trusting your own mind. You cannot let that happen.diagnosed with ADHD at 6. intp brother with high functioning autismYou seem genuinely interested so I'll try to give you a legit answer.
As of yet, understanding and acquiring self-discipline.  I'm 25 and I've finally made progress.I wasn't born in the third world or anything but my family situation was a bit rough. I was put on ritalin and amphetamine as a toddler. That lasted for 10 years. Its something I wish I could change but I don't dwell on it.  

Dealt with addiction from 18-23. Opiates for a few years then I  had the good fortune of a hilariously toxic relationship which led to my eventual casual meth usage. Mostly snorted it but occasionally injected. I was shooting various opiates and doing some subutex as well. That lasted around six months. 

Eventually, it breached the gap towards being "not so casual". I found myself dealing with some psychosis. Fortunately, my then girlfriend of a year ran off with some dude. Pretty sure she had cheated on me multiple times by then but it doesn't even matter anymore. At this point, I had come up for air long enough to form a few logical thought processes IE "time to get away from this situation. I was 24 at that point.

Moved 100+ miles away. My soul was pretty much broken in half for a while. Only within the last several months have I acheived distance from the significate  cognitive deficits  I had created from the meth use. Dealt with some gnarly depression that lasted months (probably as a result of brain damage, mostly from sleep deprivation/malnutrition).  Also had to break free of a soul-warping lack of trust/paranoid ideation. I've been free from the cycle of addiction for a little under a year and a half. (not a fan of the disease model) I've had a job for over a year now. Just started classes at the community college in town. 

Recently I've been working out pretty heavily, I actually managed to put on 10 lbs in the last month. Right now I'm just trying to get my heart back in shape. As I get to know myself I'm becoming more acquainted with my various bodily processes. Its becoming apparent that I've put some miles on my self. I will say that after prolonged sobriety and much deliberate personal care, I have reclaimed my looks (I previously looked pretty rough and my ego has always been rooted in my appearance so it was pretty rough on my self esteem). As far as drugs go, some cannabis use and LSD is as far as I care to go. Psychedelic drugs have allowed me to confront myself and corner some serious personal growth. I make sure to exercise discipline and act with purpose in the times I choose to partake in these experiences.

So basically, "How to adult" aka using good judgement. Redefining what it means to take life seriously. I consider myself lucky to be alive at this point. Really 'appreciating' life by not treating my body poorly. Making informed decisions. Having a good relationship with myself. Having actual self respect. I was a shell not too long ago. My misfortunes have allowed me a radical perspective shift. I am possessed by a sense of duty, specifically the desire to further myself. 

I recognise that progress requires effort. A good relationship with one's self requires a minimum level of basic maintenance. Leading with extroverted intuition is kind of a task at times. Learning to exercise discretion in the case of my many various impulses. Also avoiding the trap of overthinking everything. Without my sense of freedom, life can seem unworth the effort at times. It's up to myself to maintain my quality of life. Everyone else is occupied with their own.

**TLDR** Addiction sucks.
I feel like you're talking about esfjs or infps. Just a guess. To answer your question, yeah. I think I would take some offense, especially depending on where the accusation came from. I also kind of take offense to the notion of objective morality being a thing. You're welcome, thanks for the opportunity to talk about myself. That's a tough question. I don't wanna be too broad but "responsibility" has been a strong theme. You have to create and facilitate your momentum as an individual. Do the things you need to do in order to be who you want to be. It's all on you. 

What you said about addiction jives with me. I'd like to think I've simply exhausted the potential of addictive drugs. IE they no longer have anything to offer me/I can clearly see that they push me further away from my path of self-realization. It would be nice had I achieved this clarity sooner, but such is life.Many sites list ENTP as being "over-represented for type A personalities"."Non-surface", no. Galloping, yes.

I wanna say XXtp just based off my gut. on second though this guy reminds me of  alot of my INFP brother. not that simple. organized religion is cultural cancerous. its pretty fucked up to indoctrinate small children but they all do it. apostasy is punishable by death in 14 countries. If one is born in the Middle East, he will likely identify as a Muslim, and were he to have been born in the U.S., he would have likely become a Christian.  arguably just a matter of chanceAye'You're joking, right?didn't downvote youelaborate for me thensure thingI do agree that that thread was a bit of a circlejerk.

giggity ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 'intellectually disabled' https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/mental-retardationI used to get ENFP for years. I have ***zero*** fi. just curious, what type do you test as?

The INTPs I know are *extremely* smart. You're putting your own spin on it. The stuff you quoted said nothing about either type being particularly good or bad. And your personal lack of objectivity points towards you more likely being an ISFJ anyway.armchair intution: ESTP

immediately Downvote for using the word cuck, and being a moron. I'm guessing you're also under the age of 20 but I can't actually fault you for that.eh, the universe is defined by causation. everything we do is interacting with something else. thus, any form of body language or actual conversation is technically 'manipulation'. it does not inherently carry moral weight, right or wrong. it just isNe (Pe) = ADHDA LARGE portion of them do though. Not saying I even think ADHD exists but I will tell you that I was diagnosed at 7.I am really into psychedelia. This extends to my musical tastes and interior decorations.INTPI'm reading PIHKAL and I'm picking up some heavy extraverted intuition from his notes on ALEPH-1. His weird ass metaphorical speech, excessive use of analogies remind me of my own writing. Granted he was tripping when he wrote them. But I'd bet he was a high level NE user. Specifically NTP. Anyone?
My job can be mundane sometimes (adult store salesperson) but I try to approach everything in life with my utmost intensity. I will absorb as much information about my job as I possibly can. When I have to clean something I'll often get bored and almost half ass it. To combat this I'll try to drink coffee or something before I go in, so I'm not a terrible employee. I occasionally procrastinate or put things off. When no one is around I absorb more product information or hang out on wikipedia and research random things related to my job. The only way I can enjoy a retail job is to be constantly researching. With school work I can be pretty similar. I try to approach it with intensity but sometimes bore myself. The only thing I can really do in that situation is inspire myself by absorbing something else. 

Organization? HAHAHAHAHHA! I have 4 different desks and a dresser in my room. I throw everything on one of those surfaces, and just ignore it. Amazingly when I need to find something it's always on top of one of those places so I don't have to look far. I'd describe my living space as cluttered, but not slovenly. If someone cleans my work space (because a well meaning person always eventually tries to) I can't find anything I need and my life descends into chaos until every surface in my bedroom is messy again. If someone needs me to be organized I can kick it into high gear and make everything look very organized for about .05 seconds and then throw everything back into the controlled chaos I live in. My mind is like a cacophony of everything, and my workspace reflects this. 

Managing my projects is a little more difficult because I have so many going simultaneously. I prefer to work on several different projects at once and bounce back and fourth between them as my interest increases or decreases. I'm bad at time management so I find that when I get a burst of inspiration I work through the night and work myself into exhaustion and then need to get a crap load of sleep. I tend to neglect myself when I get really inspired so I often have friends reminding me to feed myself when I am locked away in my apartment working on things. 

In spite of all of this people still think I have my life together, and dismiss all of these things as me just being eccentric. Well....here goes.

Type? ENTP

At what age did you start wearing makeup? I think I was 13 or 14. I started off with eyeliner and it was racoon eyes. 

How frequently do you wear it? Almost everyday if I am going to be out in public, unless I decide that I don't give a crap

How long does it typically take for you to finish a full face? At most 20 minutes. I refuse to wear anything other than eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, lipstick or lip gloss. I won't wear foundation because I hate it and I don't have patience. 

What's your favourite part of the routine? Being done. 

Least favourite? Accidentally getting mascara or eyeliner where it doesn't belong or messing up my wing. 

Favourite lip colour? Probably a clear gloss. 

Favourite eyeshadow? Urban Decay. 

Do you contour? No

Smoky, winged, or neither? Both, but I wing it more often than not. INFP. This is from personal experience though. At my old workplace there was an ENTJ who was a psychopath. This person would intentionally cause problems. They'd take on more projects then what they could reasonably handle, and then they'd turn around and dump the failing projects onto someone else essentially throwing them under the bus. There was another INTJ who was a sociopath. The INFP noticed immediately something was wrong and tried to warn everyone, and even cried, and everyone dismissed her as being too sensitive. 

When I was thrown under the bus by the ENTJ, I got irritated and less tolerant and was more critical and willing to shut them down. This. 
Sounds nice, though. Full alpha quadra except for three people, only two of which don't have Fe. Must be comfy.Pretty sure it was ChubbyWombats.I respect people's need for alone time, but ignored messages are just rude. At least say you're really busy this [time period] and will come back to them later. Never had any ghosting complaints.

Try discussing a similar system with your significant other, this will give them the alone time they need without feeling bad/guilty about hurting your feelings/neglecting you and will spare you lots of headaches.The problem with this is that it only works short-term - at some point your lies will come to light, so use it for people you'll likely never meet or will interact with again.

But then again, lies like "thinking about" are not required to have any follow-up - you might have changed your mind after all, so this type may work.It would be prudent to establish the seasonal traits in question before starting a discussion. Here's my shot, feel free to edit. Also stop hating on spring it's like an oasis after winter hardship.


* Spring = moody, new beginnings, first warmth

* Summer = hot, thunder, festivals, early fruits

* Autumn = harvest, scrunchy, chilly

* Winter = cold, gloomy, Christmas, breathtaking when sunny




**Seasons by functions**


Ne/Si - Spring and Autumn, changing seasons

&gt; Ne for Spring beginnings, Si for Autumn comfy


Se/Ni - Summer and Winter, brilliant expressions

&gt; Se for Summer overload, Ni for Winter gloomy-radiant important symbolism.


Te/Fi - Spring and Summer, weird and busy seasons

&gt; Fi for Spring irregularness and much needed warmth, Te for Summer workload


Fe/Ti - Autumn and Winter, joy and relaxation

&gt; Ti for Autumn quiet contemplation, Fe for Winter togetherness




**Types by seasons**


xSFJ - Autumn and Winter, togetherness in comfort

xNTP - Spring and Autumn, novel comtemplations

xNFJ - pure Winter, bearing the toughest season together

xSTP - Summer and Autumn, contemplations on brilliance

xNTJ - Swinter (also known as Wommer), bearing the workload for a vision

xSFP - Spring and Summer, irregular and irresistable

xSTJ - Summer and Autumn, work can be comfy

xNFP - pure Spring, necessary change

What traits would you consider admirable in an ENFP character?

Other have already called most ENFPs, I only have Haruhi Suzumiya to add to that.Surprised, but glad. The push for military conflict with Russia was getting stronger, Trump seems to favour negotiations. But then again, so did Obama. It's also hilarious that all the MSM shilling didn't make Hillary win. However this may turn out, I'm looking forward to the memes to come.You are unhappy because you firmly believe that a) having confidence and decisiveness are required make you happy and b) you will never attain them due to MBTI.

As for b), fake it till you make it. Limits by MBTI are mostly self-imposed. They are preferences, not hard-wired abilities with no room for improvement.

Now, about decisiveness I do not know, how do you think that will benefit you? Do you simply don't know what to do, what you want, or do you suffer from analysis paralysis? If the former, either go deep introspection or just try different stuff out and see what sticks. If the latter, accept that all our decisions are based on imperfect and biased understanding so either way, you're bound to be wrong. Pick what seems the best option right now. If multiple options seem equally favourable, throw a coin or something. I've once read somewhere (take this with a grain of salt) that as you throw the coin you'll realise which one you want. Never worked for me, but some swear by it. I bet on placebo.

Confidence-wise, yeah, can hardly go wrong there (unless entering narcissist territory). Why is yours impaired?Maybe you're not being assertive enough? Have generally low energy? It's kinda hard to tell without knowing you tbh. Why do these people think you're low-confidence?Okay, I give you Kyon, but Luffy is ESFP and Okabe ENTP.Definetly lyrics. That might be because I'm somewhat tone-deaf and have kindergarden level musical education, though, so the intricate parts escape me :(Why do you consider this a sign of Ni?Well, home maker and stay at home parent aren't really careers in the first place :DIt's supposed to be an All-in-One test, so naturally, there are questions not relevent to the MBTI type. The Xs are for when you're in the 50% range, which seems to be the case for you on most of the criteria... Kinda impressive.motiv type - MXHWVES

motiv+ type - mxHW|V|ES

jung type - ENTP

disorders - Antisocial, Narcisstic

enneagram - Type 9

carrers - business consultant, business owner, fashion merchandiserGetting that many similar numerals on a 0-100 scale is a feat not achieved by many. Like rolling all 3's on five dices. Perhaps not impactful, but impressive.Ah, interesting. I though the repeating questions were to make sure the answer on that question was the truly intended one, so they made multiple wordings to improve accuracy. Like, I would give 2/5 answer with this wording, but 4/5 with that one.So much this. I talked to my ISTJ friend about majors and asked how she picked hers. She said it was a no-brainer, she always knew she'd go there, because she liked it. Alternatives were quickly dismissed, because "No need for them if you know what you want."Aux-Te best Te. Though I'd probably prefer a Fe-user for personal stuff.The thought counts if the result is shitty, otherwise I don't care much.I learned that I prefer crash dieting to moderate dieting, although conventional wisdom says otherwise, it takes way less mental toll on me.

Also that money loss is a pretty good motivator.You must be mistyped, then.Please elaborate, we're all curious.Fe-doms due to their potential for drama. I usually like them well enough and we tend to tolerate each other, but their herd control can be scary :(That's sad to hear. ENTPs share and understand by the means of discussion, so that's the problem. The will to connect is there, but the means differ greatly :/Haha, I understand that some people don't like arguments on a cognitive level, but not intuitively... Kind of like when people are grossed out by the most delicious of foods. Tastes differ, I know, but how can they not love it?!

You and your husband sound [cute](http://polyaric.deviantart.com/art/INFP-and-ESTP-531783853) :DHm, don't know about particular types, but I'd wager strong Fe users would prefer Law, while strong Te users Chaos. But there are just way to much variables to me to make a valid prediction.

Myself, I'd probably prefer Chaos. Law is giving up your will, while Neutral seems like a room-temperature steak.

That's just the first impression, though, I've never actually played the games. (Except for Devil Survivor, does that count? I picked the Demon King ending there.)Don't, it's mostly copied from the corresponding wiki.Where did you get the statistics on that? I'd be curious to see if there's a function/quadra trend.

Well, yeah, it's a guess, not a 100% predictor. People will be people. There's an interesting [mesh](http://philosopherswheel.com/wheel&amp;MBTI.jpg) of philosophy and Jungian types, if you're [interested](http://philosopherswheel.com/mbti.html). There's even a [self-test](http://philosopherswheel.com/questionnaire.htm).Te are pretty strong-willed people, especially those with Se, so Chaos-born self-reliance seemed fitting. Fi cares about whatever it wants to care about, so God-imposed rules about what is good for humanity, you and in general also seem like a turn-off. So no trends besides the ones you mentioned?I really enjoy being grilled after presenations or in interviews. It gives me new perspectives on topics I'm interested in and allows me to present even more information and build connections between these on a fly.

More generally I enjoy being asked questions I didn't think of, these instances are just the ones this occurs more frequently.ESFP, judging by plans and impulsiveness. You browser order throws me off, though, always thought it's Si and Te related. Energy really suggests EP.Kindness and Diligence. Absolute perfection, here. No more people troubles and focus to finish your projects, what else could one ask for?

For sins, if I had to, Pride and Greed. Pride for similar effect as Kindness and Greed for the material. Honestly speaking, the angel's offer is better, it's morally fulfilling, while the devil covers the carnal plane.That seems a little harsh. What happened?Lol, you're joking, right?

"I hate these people, although I understand they usually don't mean harm, but how dare they be popular, social and overall different than me! Unacceptable, rawr!"I love your username, may I snuggle up to you?That's not a no!Rant on, buddy! Or is this the "Show me the good qualities" type of rant?Yeah, that was bad formulation on my part. It meant to imitate the tone of his speech.Hm, lemme try... ESFJs are great at creating a fun atmosphere, swaying a group in a certain direction, cheering you up when you're down, delivering the newest gossip, promoting teamwork and social cohersiveness (cohersity? -ivity? I don't know :( ).Why not? :'(When you think a certain way, it shows in your behaviour and ESFJs (people in general, really) pick up on that and treat you accordingly. This results in this back-and-forth hate you're currently experiencing. The good news is, it can be broken when either party shifts their behaviour. The bad news is, you can't remote control the other person as of yet, so it's up to you. Next time you think of how annoying ESFJs are, will yourself to think of their possible good qualities. After a while, it becomes a habit and the relationship should improve.Basically SJs? ESTJs are effective managers who really get shit done, ISTJs quietly keep the system working without bothering anyone, ISFJs are your loyal steady friends who just try to get people to get along. I really like Si-doms for the grounding effect they have. My ISTJ friend is great for making sure I get *something* done, while my ISFJ friend encourages to reach out to people I've given up on and never gives up on me either, even when I'm being a little shit. I really think socionics is onto something with their duals theory.I can be your doggy, woof woof :P (Kinda sorry for pestering you, but your username is too inviting to pass up on :'D)Maybe I identify as dog! What is this, anyway, speciesism?Great, so am I! Can I has snuggles now?Gross.IIRC we had a thread where some theorised that PoLR is the joke function - since one does not recognised its values it's being belittled in humour, ENTPs go all "Oh, you've hurt muh feelings, how could you? :P" while ISTPs are like "Yeah, mind controlling pink tutus sure are a great idea!"How did you figure out you were an INFP despite  these descriptions?This is more annoying than you'd think :(Can relate, but being one-on-one is very valuable in terms of bonding. The first time has high chances of being somewhat awkward, though.I feel dumb here, to be motivated to do what?Ah, that. Well, it's twofold - losing face (painful) and letting others down (also painful). And yeah, sure it's a chore when I don't wanna do it, but it would also feel like a chore by myself and the additional pain would increase the likes of a positive outcome here.But in a one-on-one setting it'll happen much faster. Also some people may not be too open in groups, so this is a rare chance to actually get to know them. Of course, the same people are unlikely to go to a one-on-one meetup, but life finds a way.I think there was a survey a while back where lots of introverts admitted to sometimes/never answer the door. (What an odd expression, "answer the door"...)It's a rational fear though, humans are social creatures, we survive in collectives. Without this protection, good luck.Funny, it's the opposite for me! Public speech like a pro, but horrible actor, can't let myself go here.Ikr?An online test said I was a pirate. Was I Se dom?Future and past eternal.I'd wager the chance of survival in a commune is bigger than by oneself.How so?As in, like a hermit? I'd probably be surprised but still open (before checking for obvious danger).

I find that knocks on door are like unopen boxes. Perhaps it's a present, maybe it's cookies, or, well, a bomb. Either way, I'm curious.That's true, but most people agree that a life-theatening situation is detrimental to one's happiness. Then again, you'd have to compare the relative pain of survival to living in a community, which, although there is the aforementioned tendecy, is individualistic in the end.Ah, now I see where you're coming from. Obviously, you should be able to do things yourself. However, if you divide the work with others, the result will be greater. Therefore, it is irrational to avoid the power collaboration brings.

Dependence &lt; independence &lt; interdependenceMan, that reads so sad :( I just don't have such negative expectations (so what if neighbours come, anyway?), nor do I mind someone just coming over on a whim. I guess I'm just not a protective of my home and ... gel better.

The way you wrote seems like you're being besieged in your castle, so I get how that would annoy anyone.Please explain INFP here, I can kinda see small town summoner, but why satyr and large spider?! Satyr seems more like a high Se type than anything. (Also dad weed grower, lol what?)Very objective indeed.I write on and off in my diary, mostly just good stuff that has or will happen, perhaps some encouragement to myself to do this or that. Recently started a bullet journal, which I so far found helpful, as it allows me to merge to-dos, personal stuff, information and random thoughts and doodles in one - just one! - notebook.

Edit: Almost forgot, I had a daily diary back in grade... 6~7 or so, which I had written in a secret code, so my parents couldn't read it. The containts were similar to my current diary, except I'd sometimes go and try to include "feelings" - diaries were supposed to have those, right? - which made me cringe after reading them on the next day, so I concluded this style was not for me.

So basically, the potential to keep a diary is in every type, but the content will vary. Feelings diaries, this-happened-today diaries, self-improvement diaries, scap books, etc.I'm not sure I understood your last paragraph correctly, are you saying that one has to look for value judgement when trying to discern a feeling type, because although such judgement is correlated with emotions, thinkers have those too?If anything, it makes interactions better, because you're able to understand other perspectives better, which in turn expands your own.Another ENTP with VOE-M here. Funny, looking at the descriptions, I would have thought VOE-C for ENTPs.That's so sweet and thoughtful of you! You're like a human Japanese toilet :D

When I'm excited I get really loud and gesticulate rather wildly, people mistake me for Italian.And this is why I vowed to never make decisions after 8pm. Mad things happen after 8pm ;_;I'm interested in details.Read exhausting books or (even better imo) play Tetris, Candy Crush or something equally dulling before sleep. Enjoy actually sleeping.My naturally happy-go-lucky self becomes broody and will talk about sad stuff.

I will only drink enough to get drunk once in a blue moon, because seeing barely coherent drunks as a child has those conditioning effects.Be amiable, don't expect to click with anyone, cherish it when you do. Try to see others' point of view, lots of discoveries will be made that way.

As for not being one with them... Fake it till you make it? I found it easy to just mirror the other people, channel your inner ESFJ or whatever. It's not a recipe for a life-long friendship but that's not what you're looking for anyway.doot dootJust what do you want to beat him in? Income, street fight, Scrabble?That's fine and dandy, but outhinking him in Scrabble requires a different skill set than for making more money than him (though there may be correlations). If you cannot decide on an area of your future dominance, I suggest general self-imorovent.The question remains what these natural consequences are. Is being shunned by your tribe a natural consequence, or is it the man-made morals of the tribe that cause this reaction, therefore hardly natural? If the latter, any reactive action towards the perceived crime is unnatural and we should not judge each other no matter what. But animals have society rules, too... Now what?

Man, you just can't win with Nietzsche.

To me, mercy is mitigating the punishment prescribed by the justice system in place on the fact that the perpetrator is sorry/pitiful/will have his life ruined. As least that's what some Big5 test told me after labelling me "merciless". My feelings were hurt that day :'(Solid reasoning.How do you feel about Ti? Te?&lt;3Technically

What about

It's possibleWhat each MBTI type is as a mirror/organ/bad hair day/cloud?Si: The usual. Will go away with enough brushing. Just like mamma used to do.

Se: Looks so cool, you try to keep it. You fail. You weren't cool enough.

Ni: This is not a bad hair day, it's a bad omen! Just stay at home today.

Ne: Try to make it workable by pulling this and gelling that... Now it's even more of a hot mess, but with a ribbon on top.

Ti: It's just different, not bad. That's a subjective judgement, anyway. This shape is totally possible with your hair.

Te: Use it strategically to gain cred with the artsy crowd. Undermine your "soulless dictator" reputation and gain even more minions.

Fi: A new hair, a new you! Think about what this means for your life, character and relationship with world.

Fe: This is the new trend now, everyone who disagrees is sooo from yesterday.Daydreams are sacred, why would you even bother introducing realism here? Mine involve time and space travel where I have to save the people from a danger only I know the answer to, having incredible jumping/flying/teleporting ability for fun and convenient travel, having conversations with people who may or may not exist on various topics and a myriad other things I can't be bothered to mention now.Picking the top three was easy, but then it got progressively harder. I feel like I covered everything, the bottom five kind of stem from the top five for me.

**1-3**

* Curiousity
* Creativity
* Kindness

**4-5**

* Wisdom
* Community

**6-10**

* Beauty
* Honesty
* Pleasure
* Adventure
* Humor&gt; that's not really inclined to confront others

This. They are generally not good at setting boundaries, so people  walk over them without noticing. And when the INFx had enough, they salto out of people's lives. Which is ridiculous, because you can't expect people to respect your boundaries without stating and defending them. People tend to cross invisible lines!I assume you're the one taking the test, too? It's gonna be biased either way.What is the reasoning behind that?

Also, how did your Si-Se combo expressed itself?Is this a recurring pattern with one (group of) ISFJ or is this lots of one-timers with different non-connected ISFJs?Nah, they mean ENTP-ISTJ and ENFP-ISFJ.What type are you?Huh. I reflected on it and it kiiinda seems to check out, I guess? I was a shy kid who did not like public performance. My dream was to be an artist because then I could sit and draw pictures of whatever I like all day. Or a zoo keeper so I can feed and pet animals for a living. Does that seem Si Fi? I don't know :|

Still, what is the logic behind this? I'd be REALLY grateful if you could throw me a link because my google fu fails me and I'm curious :(

&gt; (I even unironically loved Sonic as an adolescent and wanted to go fast)

Top kek. Look at it positively - you could be Chris-chan. Did you take up sprinting or something?This! I know a girl who loves astrophysics and chess. Now guess her type.

Surprise - it's ESFJ!Same here, except when I'm sitting together with a person lots more of inner monologue leaks through. I don't even know why, unconcious need of inclusion?Looks pretty round to me.I don't know about NFJs, but Socionics describes Si romance types as caretakers, taking care of physical needs of childlike Ne, so that might be that. What are NFJ counsellors like in comparison?Link shows page as empty, is this just me?Many thanks!I love this post.

I don't even perceive fakeness as such, because its just the person's way of dealing with X. And if that differs from their personality when dealing with Y, that's fine! How they approach X and Y is none of anyone's business.

I remember listening to the Personality lecture series by ... I'm inclined to say Pierce, but I'm afraid I'm mixing the guy up with Michael Pierce. Anyway. He presented all our habits and behaviours as separate personalities, the totality of which makes up the person. So I'd assume vastly disparate personalities may indicate either a loosely intergrated personality, or a non-integrated one, in which a person perceives themselves not acting like themselves, but has no control over it.Preach. It's like the search function does not exist :(First off - welcome! It sounds like you've yet to learn about the cognitive functions - Micheal Pierce's videos are highly recommended here, as well as his quadra and type portraits, in that order.

My first impression would be Fi dominant type, so either INFP or ISFP. Despite stereotypes, I've met plenty of perfectionists of these types. Otherwise, INFJ  would seem possible, too, but they are usually better at providing comfort than what you described.

Did you see the musical Elizabeth? Would you say it is similar to the Sissi trilogy?I second (third? ...multor!) ISTP.

Ti figures things out quickly without overcomplicating them, especially with Se, Ne may be lost in possibilities and exceptions.

Attitude towards other people just screams low Fe.

Lack of proper planning and occasional existential crises are typical for SPs, I'd wager even more so for STPs.

Also, though take this with a salt shaker, I've found Se-Ni users are great at impressions, usually full ones with posture and everything. The best voice actor I know is an ENFP, still.Yeah, same here. You cannot change what is done, but you can learn from it.Seconding what /u/lawdoodette said about serious vs silly.

You know those MBTI videos where people talk about group sessions? One of them had the "cup test" to demonstrate N-S differences. They placed a styrofoam cup on a stage and asked the audience to describe it. The sensors went to describe it in great detail - color, height (they even measured it), all that. While the intuitives said it's a styrofoam cup and then continued with their thoughts on the use of such cups, how it affects the environment, etc. Maybe try that, way easier to explain than quadras and stuff.How about something like "Man, you're so quiet I feel I didn't get to know you properly yet! [open ended question about their hobbies, opinions, etc]"Interesting, I thought people like being shown interest. Guess that doesn't go for everyone.

But how will you know I think the same if you never probe? :(

The hypotheticals are fun, but I found most people aren't too receptive, so I only go for them if I feel there's Ne somewhere. Which judging by your flair fits you, of course :D

...I wonder how to catch Se introverts?Ah, so you're basically hiding your power level, gotcha. I guess it's more or less the same for most people, hence the "I like x, y and z" usually including socially 'acceptable' interests only like travelling, reading, etc. It's good to get things rolling, but it too smalltalk-y for my tastes, I use it in unfamiliar group settings only.

What I'm trying to say is that I can relate keeping myself down in groups, but I usually don't care one-on-one. The reason for that is that individuals don't judge as harshly as a group and it's far easier to make them see why you like or think something.It really depends, I find. INFPs are most likely to be pushovers, but I think that's more due to their PolR Se, similar to INTPs in that regard. ISFPs are unlikely to initiate conflict but will have no qualms doing so if their values are overstepped. INFJs are kinda similar to the INFPs here, but where the INFP will be desperately wishing you did not do the thing, the INFJ will try to tell you (sometimes telepathically) to not do the thing. ISFJ are more robust here, I found, their upset is more obvious. Don't know about EFs, but there are probably parallels to the IFs.Hundreds of ideas, which - unlike a certain Fi user's - make sense, can communicate with people freely, leaves a lot of Si for the others. Creative, convincing, considerate.Kek, I like to rile up ISFJs by vividly describing different scenarios of whatever we are doing going terribly wrong. Ending with "But don't worry, the odds are in our favour!" (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧Wait, is that not basic human feeling of euphoria?That sounds really sad, can any Si-doms confirm?

I know only two, one ISFJ and one ISTJ. The first one might somewhat fit the description (especially that a., man :/), but the ISTJs does not seem to have any of those issues, at least from what I can tell. Well, maybe a tiny bit of b., but it's barely there.Dude, just stop and think for a second. Nothing has changed, not you functions, not your creative potential, your intelligence, nothing. The only thing changed is your self-perception. The one metaphorically cock-blocking you is not Si, but yourself! Which leads to the problems you described... Solution - stop thinking like that, and if you absolutely MUST, then change "I'm Si, I'm dumb and uncreative" to "I'm Si, so I'll work extra hard to be smart and creative" and harness the power of focused Si. Seriously, Si at work is no joke, their long-time achievability is second to maybe only Te.But contracts are for Js, you silly P!I'd guess people with same extraverted function, so you get circles of Te, Fe, Se and Ne respectively. The reasoning for this is that the extraverted function is our preferred method of world-engagement, so people with shared one tend so be on the same wavelength.Interesting, one ESFP I know tends to do this a lot. ...The other one doesn't.

Anyway, I'd like to second the ISFP typing, you basically sound like a textbook ISFP :DAfair, it was based on the answers provided by people already typed. Since it was (probably) online-based, I'd assume the test is most accurate for web-dwelling types already interested in the theory - which, I think was INs first and more general N second? So the test will be most accurate on those types due to sample size discrepancy.I got INTJ, probably because I don't like parties.Definetly A, for the same reasons others stated. B is workable, A a lost cause.Interesting, it's the complete opposite for me. I'm not gonna respect for their, but "tone management" is an understandable, we're trying to be polite here.- respect A for their bullshit -

Godammit, mobile...Ah, I see what you mean. I interpreted B as "to be touched with silk gloves", as opposed to the hedgehog mode of A.Please be so kind!ENTP

Ahead, but I'm not as much looking as being lost in thought.What fantasies?If stuck in a bad/counterproductive mood I make a playlist that progresses from sad/angry/whatever to happy and vigorous. What does that make me?Seriously, are you joking?The future noone wanted - today!Inreresting points, what biases do you see in the question, which distinctions should be addressed more?Or someone liked Pink Elephants on Parade and wanted a reason for the elephants to be pink. The reason them being watermelons.

Most likely someone was just having fun drawing fruits and animals tbh.How would that be calming? Sounds really distracting.Perhaps. If one's type is naturally focused on sensory information there is probably higher sensitivity to it.

Sounds do not distract me as much as quiet does. I can easily focus in a room full of talking people but eerie silence makes me jumpy.&gt; This is only personal experience, but I notice that, if I were to take a basic dichotomy MBTI test, my self-esteem and level of (in)security affects more than just my E v. I score. I score much more in the N category if I'm feeling disconnected from others and a bit jaded. Dunno if there's an actual correlation though.

This is very interesting, cause it's the total opposite for me. Once I took the test when feeling desolate and scored ISFJ,  so ymmv. Someone once presented the idea that in dire times, when we feel unable to cope with life the way we usually do (top two functions), we reach to our lower ones. Checks out for me, I guess.What did it say?Get outta my spacetime!Not if said room is shaped like 20-ended star! Or like four connected 5-ended ones. Or, more practically, put enough dividing screens into the room until a satisfactory number of corners has been created.What is your greatest goal in life and why?&gt;inevitability

Nah, you still have a 1/16 chance.

Either way, you've explained why it's inaccurate, but not why it's unethical. Same, except I dodn't actually take the test, just figured from the descriptions.But all the functions right!Russian trash popAll of them, potentially.Why would your boss lie?How does that work? You feel something and you ask others whether it's appropriate in that situation? I'm just asking because I don't see the point. What does it matter?&gt;  the two main actors hate each other's guts IRL.

Wat, no way. Didn't they best man each other's wedding or something?

Like what? Could you give some examples?That was eye-opening, thank you. I was under the impression that Fe-doms simply didn't care for thinking, but here you are trying to avoid your own biases, which is super humble and thoughtful. It's basically outsourced Ti! I wonder how other types outsource their inferior? Thanks again, it was really helpful!I see, thanks! I was just surprised, because I had the exact opposite impression. But then again, I've only started watching two months ago.I don't have heroes, I have people I admire for X. If the dark side does not relate to X, I don't really care emotionally - people will be people. If it's an artist who admitted to stealing money, whatever. If it's an artist who admitted to stealing all his art, then, yeah, he lost me.


For friends and family, different rules apply. Here I will call them out on it and help them to deal with it. If they won't, treat them as good acquaitances from now on.Must've been one loud book.Nah, she's strong in her beliefs that X exists, not because of a logical deduction, but because she *knows*. She is also very focused on her relationships, though not expressing it directly - see her friendship mural. I'd go with INFP.Could be anytype, really, I've seen this in ESFPs, INTPs and an xSFJ. It's a fairly mixed bag.Accurate.I had no imaginary friend (tried it once, felt silly and absurd), but I had a few toys I'd carry around - always one at a time. Still have them all (my siblings play with them) except for the doll I gave away to a neighbour kid and a plush alien I've lost on a plane (I'm so sorry Georgie, I'll always remember you!! ;_;).Did you try the Pokéwalker?Nah, those are ISFJs.My ISTJ friend recently noted how odd it was that I was an open-minded conservative and she a rather close-minded liberal. Also I appreciate her for her structuredness, she likes my ~~chaos~~ random adventures. I appreciate her hospitality, she the fact that I'm low-maintenance. Yin and yang, man.Sounds like an INFJ, to be honest, down to the desire for Se.How does Ne manifest for you?He couldn't leave it if he tried.Yesterday I had a Hawaii pizza with garlic shrimps and spinach extra. It was awesome, but I'll forever be known as a weirdo at work... (Though I guess the scrambled eggs topped with seeds and marmelade combo is to blame for that :/)FPs would be my guess, FiSi with low Te.TeThis was a genuinely interesting read, thank you. Especially the part about self-esteem and relationship security.I knew there was a reason I liked ISTJs.This is a too real of a joke.It sounds weird, but there might be some truth into it. I see the cognitive functions as layers of experience, with the differing types focusing on different layers. So, while we have an in-built preference toward certain layers, we may somewhat change it by concious effort (though if the effort is given up, the focus returns to its starting point).

Though I would argue that food deprivation would make our body more attuned to food out of biological necessity. I once didn't eat any carbs save for green veggies for a week and bread has never smelled as good to me as it did back then.

So I wouldn't say it changes you functions, but brings others in your focus.Is it like the Weasleys?Oldest child out of three with a huuuge gap of 12 years. Easily find common language with kids and resolve all kinds of conflict due to this.

I think having silblings allows you to mature faster because the older have to look out for the younger, the younger can watch the older and everyone learns negotiation skills.This can result in a hot-and-cold style, which is pretty disorienting.Agreed, I'd like a mix between the INTJ and ESTJ ones, please.My take on it, going purely by [aesthetics](https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite-list?favs=AHq1K0DdFJErCysNB1FR).

Also one I made [before](https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite-list?favs=AHFJDdFfCyK0J8JQEcCJ) I realised you cound have all the forns. So it's like a top20 minus the overlap.Why are you commenting on a 4 years old thread??The preferred problems section for SPs reads incredibly patronising. You could've writted 'unusual technical problems', 'creative expression of individuality', etc. You know, like *all the others* are written. Wtf is "Sometimes a girl's gotta bust into song!" even supposed to be?!Type expression changes as a person grows and matures, type doesn't. It's your core personality traits, why would they change (unless you've suffered severe trauma)?

MBTI Notes has [an excellent write-up](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/development) on growth through a type lens. Skip to "4 Ego Development Through Life" for an outline of the path and to "5 Ego Development Profiles" for each type's growth path.You're welcome! :)

Yeah, I mean people can also forget learned languages if you hit them hard enough on the head, but it's not a common experience.

I think it's like u/sunnycycle says, you might develop a different type mask as a coping mechanism, but still remain yourself deep within.[General advice on Fe](https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/development#fe), for actual examples I second "How to Win Friends and Influence People".Stay away from toxic people, they're already sucking your life energy. Some people just wanna be miserable, let them.What do you do when you discover you were wrong or there is a better way to do something?You don't need premium for this btwIxFPNow I feel mistyped, my response would be a Te/Ti/Se combo:

"Say you're playing Fire Emblem and you've got in a shitty situation. There's a boss in front of you and you've got two weapons - one has a 3% hit chance, the other 0%. Which one do you use? (3% obvs) Okay, so let's take a chance with the 3% then. Still better than 0% and you can always change your choice. But only as long as you live."

While tensing up to grab in case logic doesn't work. It's a meme. As far as I can tell, it mostly stems from failed S-N communication with S thinking N as a bullshit generator and N thinking S as dumb. Going too deep vs not going deep enough.

Funnily enough, in "Russian MBTI" (Socionics), Se is memed as the superior function. Se doms = Chads

Watching both sides is hilarious.Veronica Sawyer: Gives me strong EJ vibes, ExTJ specifically. "Planning your future, Veronica Sawyer. Going to Harvard (?) and marry a lawyer." 

Heather Chandler: ESFJ

Heather Duke: Looks like some kind of extrovert. ESFx, leaning towards ESFJ. 

Heather McNamara: ISFJ

Ram &amp; Kurt: Agreed on the ESxP for both, though I can barely tell them apart, so no idea on T/F. 

Jason-Dean: ISTP most likely. Not feeling the NP, though I could see a INTJ in deep despair, his "our love is God" gives me tertiary Fi vibes. 

Martha Dunstock: Barely typeable, Ne-using Feeler, I think. 

I'm typing by the musical, btw, so there may be some inconsistencies with the movie characters.What makes you think ENFJ for Merkel?&gt;cause this annoys Ns as a whole, and this pleases me.

Killer argument here, you got me convinced.Yeah, I can see your reasoning for Veronica, though everyone learns about themselves in their teens/early 20's so I'm not sure that's a good type predictor. Regardless, Fi does seem to be a theme with her, so we can agree on the axis at least.

The Te is probably what gave me the impression of an extrovert for Heather Duke. Introverts don't blatantly dominate like that from what I've gathered, so meltdown-induced Te-grip makes sense here. Although, again, each type is susceptible to having their head up their asses (teens especially lol), please don't stereotype like that.

It's always nice to meet a fellow fan in the wild :D What do you think about the teacher? NF is the best I can do with her :/
ENTP here. I always choose characters to give my team enemy location and general battlefield intel while identifying ally strengths/enemy weaknesses and relay to my team to secure the win.ENTP. Any role that lets me have control of the battlefield/enemy at all times and alert my allies of enemies. Snipers and rogues. High damage to a single target.Very interesting read, thanks!TeamNot focusing on a project until completionIt's funny because im going into Project Management and always have great ideas to solve complex problems but have a hard time creating and sticking to a plan.

Curious to see if there's a correlation.
Hello fellow ENTP! I think we try to seek out as many possible outcomes to a situation as possible so it is not as dire for us to make decisions immediately because we know we can probably find a solution to whatever comes up. I love INTJs but I've found they do get frustrated when you can't supply them with a satisfying answer or reasoning immediately. I would say the level of skepticism is the same, but the way it's handled is different."Half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we  have rushed through life trying to save." -Will RogersDittoENTP starfish (like a vampire) or freefall&gt; Dance floor at the club? Sulking in the corner because no one can hear me talking.

LOL this is why I stay outside at parties with loud music
From your description, I'm leaning a bit more towards xNTP. Remember, introversion isn't *always* attributed to avoiding social interaction -- it has far more to do with perception of the world. If you're an introvert, you internalize before focusing on the outside world. While on the other hand, an extrovert will look at the outside world and immediately either perceive or judge it, while their introverted secondary function will perceive or judge it consciously afterwards.

From your description, I am fairly certain of the following:

&gt; My room is a "disorganized mess"

&gt; I'm very oblivious to my surroundings.

&gt; I'm not great with details.

You are most likely Nx dominant or auxiliary. You probably have have a low-tier Si, because an Se user would probably *enjoy* material surprises. So that leaves me with an Ne/Si axis.

&gt; I'm terrible at expressing emotions when I do have to...

&gt; I do like messing with friends and poking fun at them/being silly when I get comfortable with them.

You have a low-stack Fx -- most likely Fe. So that leaves me with a Ti/Fe axis.

With all of that combined, I'm left with two axes; Ne/Si and Ti/Fe. This leaves two possibilities: INTP or ENTP. I'm going to leave it up to you to determine which one you are, but I hope that this helped you narrow it down. Remember: ENTP and INTP are ***far*** more closely related than xNTP and xNTJ will ever be. Anyway, if you have any more questions, I'd be happy to help!Personally, I see an "aha" moment as more of a Ti thing as they are more focused on understanding and solving problems. Users of Ti are interested in getting to the bottom of things, and when that final puzzle piece fits in, they have a very strong sense of gratification.

In reality, you can have an "aha" moment with any type. Whether it is an Ni or Si "aha" is determined by what you solved that lead to it. As an INTP (Ne/Si axis), we have more of an "aha" when we solve a problem that is concrete in nature, or if we find an alternative (auxiliary Ne) to a concrete topic (tertiary Si). On the other hand, an Ni/Se user may have an "aha" moment when they find a pattern in, for example, an opponents actions (Ni) that allows for a direct reaction (Se).

If you believe in socionics, I may can provide an explanation for your organization skills along with other things. Organization is usually seen as more of a Te thing, but if you look at your shadow functions as an ENTP, you see how it might fit. Take this quote for reference (credit to /u/Aurarus):

&gt; I even have a theory that your 6th function would really just be your second most used function (being in the same I/E attitude as your dominant) and that your auxiliary is just a very valued way of bringing it out to the real world. (Or bringing it in, if you're extroverted)

Your sixth function as an ENTP is Te, so you very well can have a certain propensity towards organization even if your four favored functions don't include it. This can be especially true if you happened to be raised in an environment that encouraged organization.

If you look at the seventh function -- AKA the Point of Least Resistance, or your sort of "pet peeve" -- as an INTP, you get Se. This would mean that you strongly dislike using Se and don't get along with people that do frequently. This might explain your rejection of materialistic surprises.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble. Keep in mind that socionics is still under quite a bit of controversy on the MBTI subreddit, so take those last few paragraphs with a pinch of salt. Nevertheless, I hope I provided some clarification!In letter preference tests, yes, it is very easy to think that they are very similar. But if you look at their functions, they are completely different. INTP has Ti Ne Si Fe and INTJ has Ni Te Fi Se. They don't share a single axis or function -- the only thing they share is relative preference of NT over SF. While they look quite similar, the two types are extremely different. Especially when compared with INTP and ENTP, which both share the four same functions.&gt; Then we will organize an annual summit of *Users of Ti^TM*

Lol, I think we might have a few copyright obstacles to overcome if we do eventually try to claim that trademark. Notably from a certain calculator company.

But in all seriousness, I'm sorry I never replied to your comment. I saw it like... as soon as you posted it, just never got around to replying. Thank you for your compliment of my analysis though! I would love to make it into a post -- and I definitely will if I ever get around to it!Alright, I feel like I have narrowed it down a bit from that post. I just have one question to narrow down what your Fx function is. Which of the following do you most relate to?

* A: My moral standpoints are mostly influenced by the views that are generally accepted in mainstream society. I try my best to make sure everyone feels included and welcomed before expressing my own viewpoints on a topic. If someone says something I disagree with, I am most likely to brush it off.

* B: My moral standpoints are fully my own and not influenced by any external structure. I am not afraid to stand up for a topic I am passionate about no matter how it affects the emotions of those around me. I can be quick to judge others at times based on their viewpoints. If someone says something I disagree with, I am most likely to confront them about it.Not necessarily. Some people are conflict-averse and more likely to sacrifice their own opinions for the sake of keeping a good atmosphere. And quite a few people are likely to base their views off of those in mainstream society to keep a welcoming, open-minded mindset.I kind of got that vibe from you in your first bullet point. Alright, let's go through the axes I got.

Your Fi/Te axis is pretty dang strong. You have strong moral conceptions, but by your description, you are not quite argumentative and social enough to be a Te dominant or auxiliary. Your Te is probably just there as a last resort to back up your Fi morality. I'm leaning towards Fi dominant on this.

You have a Se/Ni axis evidenced by your strong reaction to outside, concrete stimuli. You stated that you are also very "self-conscious," so that indicates a pretty strong Se. This came across pretty strongly in your writing style as well.

So in the end, I'm left with a Fi -&gt; Te axis and a Se -&gt; Ni axis. That leaves me with either Fi Se Ni Te or Se Fi Te Ni. I feel like you're a feeler before a sensor, so I'm  going to go with Fi Se Ni Te, which codes for ISFP.* I'm extremely cautious when I drive. I take the speed limit seriously and never feel comfortable going over it by more than a couple mph. Whether you feel like that indicates good or bad driving would depend on your own idea on what constitutes either description.

* I see driving as a necessity, but I don't enjoy it by any means. It stresses me out to no end, especially when people seem to be in such a rush that they look down upon the person who is actually obeying safety road regulations. As a whole, the road is too fast-paced for my liking.

* I'm a daydreamer in just about any part of my life. Driving is unfortunately no exception. I tend to go on autopilot when driving to a familiar place, and cruise control is a great thing to facilitate this.

* I very rarely have music playing while I'm driving, and if I do, it's only music I have heard before and enjoy.

* Not really, I'm pretty laid back when I drive. I only get mad when people do logically nonsensical things such as passing me up just to get stopped at the same red light or pass me up just to stop and turn in front of me.

* As far as I'm aware, INTP!The perceiving functions (Nx and Sx) are by far the hardest to detect. After a couple of months of study, it's still very fuzzy to me. Just think of the axes like this:

Ni/Se is focused on external, concrete goals and attributes and how they can be applied to an internal perception of reality. The Se makes them quite a bit more focused on appearance and social stature than the other axis, and the Ni makes them more focused on a pre-conceived perception of reality.

Si/Ne is focused on external, abstract possibilities and patterns that can be added to an almost fluid inner perception of reality. The Ne makes them very open-minded and more eccentric than other types. The Si makes them meticulous and detail oriented, but only to an end in which it can be applied to increase their perception of reality. They are not quite as focused on their social stance or appearance.Sorry if this reply is a bit late, but I'm fairly certain my mother is an ExFJ. I lean more towards Ni auxiliary at times because of how scatter-brained and how quick to jump to conclusions she can be at times. She will be mid-sentence and all of a sudden jump to something completely unrelated. We always tease her with the "squirrel!" thing from the movie Up because thats what it reminds us of. xD

Anyway, enough with the ramble, and onto the questions you asked.

* My mother was always my biggest cheerleader. She was definitely an activist mother, constantly trying to make sure we were happy. You could probably pretty easily call her overprotective or a "helicopter mom."

* The only challenge I really ever had with her was with her swiftness to jump to conclusions. She had to know the details of everything, and one small flaw could cause her to jump to a negative conclusion about it. And when she was convinced of something, good luck arguing against it. You wouldn't get very far if you could even get a word in.

* I mean, I'm only 18, so I'm still living with her for a couple of months before I head out for college this fall. She's been quite depressed over me leaving, even though I'm only going a couple of hours away. I guess her dominant Fe is giving her a sort of strengthened version of "empty nest syndrome." Nevertheless, I still look up to her as a caring, conscientous, loving mother who sacrifices so much to help my family. She is probably the reason my Fe is a bit stronger than many INTPs.

* The best thing is how she is so willing to sacrifice her own wants and needs to make us happy. She went back to work full time recently just to pay for more materialistic things for my family to enjoy.

* The difficulties presented with ENFJs mostly lie within the "everything could go wrong" mentality. I feel as if Ne favorers are more likely to be overprotective than many other types.

* Really, there's not much I could offer. ENFJs are natural parent types. Just make sure you guys focus on your own needs too, not just on your family's!Oh yeah, you bet I'm laughing at them. Maybe a bit of an evil eye too at their rearview mirror.

And I live in a smaller city in the US, so I only really ever drive on two lane roads. But yes, in the rare cases I do drive on bigger roads, I stay in the right lane unless I'm planning to turn soon.That's how me and the two other marching band captains successfully lead last year. I was more of the planner and advisor, while the other two were usually the ones to go out and put the plans in action.

That being said, INTPs do have the potential to simulate a Te leadership style because they're Tx dom, but it usually seems forced and/or overdone. I usually have no problem actually being an outspoken, harsh leader, but it almost always ends with me feeling really bad about it afterwards (probably inferior Fe kicking in).I think you're onto something here. Any time I've ever seen a multi-person leadership team, the Ti person is always the one in the background making sure things are getting done *effectively*. That's one of the biggest differentiations in Ti and Te leadership styles: effectiveness vs efficiency. 

In my experience, Te is usually the sort of "in your face" leader, the one that is not afraid to get their hands dirty to get things done quickly. A Te plan may not always produce the best results, but it will definitely have the best ratio of time:quality. They're usually great about thinking on their feet, which makes them appear more apt to be leaders.

On the other hand, Ti is all about making things effective. It's focused on producing the *best* results, no matter how long it takes. They aren't quite as good at reacting on the spot and making good judgements when forced to think on their feet, which is why they're usually better in the background where they're able to think things through for longer.

Now, which one is the better leader overall is completely subjective and depends on what the observer sees as the defining qualities of a leader. If you want an active leader that isn't afraid to speak out but sometimes can do so at the expense of the emotions of others, then a Te leader is probably preferrable. If you want a leader that can produce the most effective results but is not necessarily comfortable voicing their ideas or thinking on the spot, then a Ti leader is what you want.Martin Shkreli, if he is an INTJ, is an example of an ***extremely*** unhealthy one. With all of the things that have gone on in his life over the past few years, it's easy to see how he might be "in the grip" of his inferior Se function (or even worse than that as /u/jermofo said). He feels a need to show off his material and physical superiority because that's probably all he has left.

So if it doesn't resonate with you, good, that means you're a healthy version of your type. But this is a good way to see what can happen if your inferior function does ever take over.INTJ (high stress time + crap test result) -&gt; Completely and Utterly Clueless -&gt; INTP.

Mine was a pretty short journey, although it did require a complete change of all four of my functions xD.It's difficult to accurately type him when we don't know if he is just doing this as a troll or as a last resort mental breakdown kind of thing. If this is just a tease/troll, yeah, I can definitely see him being an ENTP. But that being said, whatever type he is, he's psychologically unhealthy. So I'm not sure he's a good person to use as an "inside the mind of" example for any type.Alright, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and agree with /u/stnapknah on ESTP. Let me break it down to give you a bit of explanation rather than just a straight answer.

Let's look at the first axis I saw: Se -&gt; Ni. I'm gonna go ahead and say you're Se dominant, too. Se dominant people tend to place quite a bit of importance on their social stance and they also need constant novelty or else they get bored. They can also be a bit averse to committment.

As for the second one, I was a bit conflicted. I can see Ti -&gt; Fe and I can see Fi -&gt; Te, and neither are very prominent over the other. I'm leaning more towards Ti -&gt; Fe because of your will to be different and also your inability to hide emotions. You said that your emotions may not run as deep as some other people's, so that makes sense that your Fx is tertiary rather than auxiliary.

So that leaves us with Se Ti Fe Ni, or in MBTI terms, ESTP!I've never paid attention to him all that much. But by what he has done recently (committing securities fraud, raising the price of life-saving drug by over 5000%, etc.), it is really hard to see him as anything but a self-absorbed, unhealthy person. I mean, you could say that anyone is humble in certain situations. Heck, even the most psychologically unhealthy people in history probably seemed "humble" at times, but that that doesn't negate all the things they did wrong by any stretch of the imagination.

But I digress, there may be a side to him that I'm overlooking. In my opinion, however, the "playing up for the media" alone makes him an attention-seeking, unhealthy person. I'm not going to sit here and argue about it though, especially when people don't know the correct use of the downvote button.I definitely detect a Fe -&gt; Ti axis, and you do seem to possess a small preference towards Si -&gt; Ne (although you do have some Se traits such as liking new physical experiences). Let me give you a couple of quote references for each axis.

Fe -&gt; Ti is a harmonizing axis. It usually seeks harmony before all, and thus it is more likely to dislike those with extreme ideas that go against the overall accepted views of society.

&gt; I'd be uncomfortable if they acted in a rude, selfish, or arrogant manner. Likewise, I'd be put off if they openly expressed bigoted or other extreme sorts of views.

&gt; But ultimately, it's their relationship and their call.

&gt; I'd be most comfortable hanging out with them in a group setting with my friends. If we share common interests or have a good platonic chemistry, I'd like to talk to them more in a one-on-one setting.

I think of Si -&gt; Ne as kind of a "prepared for anything" axis. Si plans (sometimes excessively) in advance because of Ne's instantaneous worst case scenario generation.

&gt; I make sure that I've packed sufficient clothing and toiletries (plus food and water) and that I've saved sufficient funds. Additionally, I make sure to bring my phone and charger, as well as my 3DS (or a book) for slow periods during the trip. And of course, I make sure to research the destination and make a list of what I want to visit and do while I'm there. It's crucial that whatever vehicle we're taking is up-to-par for the journey, as well.

&gt; If the car lets us down, we figure out what resources are nearby, as far as shops/gas stations/convenience stores are and sort things out. I'd make sure we bring Yellow Pages along for that, so we're not up shit creek if it happens somewhere with lousy reception.

So with those two axes taken into account, you appear to have either Si Fe Ti Ne or Fe Si Ne Ti, but I'm gonna stick more towards your introverted typing and go with the former. In MBTI terms, that means ISFJ!When I was younger, I definitely loved Pixar movies. I actually loved Ratatouille (and still do today). Up was too touching for me not to love, it was probably one of the only movies to actually bring me to tears. Inside Out, Wall-E, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, and Finding Nemo were pretty good movies, not my favorites though. I was never really a big fan of Cars.

I can see it having some corellation to the cognitive functions. I feel like Ratatouille appeals to Si -&gt; Ne, Cars to Se -&gt; Ni, Inside Out and Up to upper-stack Fx, and etc.While they may not be a perfect representation in all cases, the cognitive functions are the best we've got to type with at this point. Of course, they could be unified into concrete definitions to make them more palatable to newcomers to MBTI - especially the Px functions. That's a big problem with this kind typing; people are drawn towards the inaccurate dichotomies because they are simpler and provide a nice, concrete result that can be traced directly back to the 4-letter code. I'm not going to lie, ENTP is a lot less cumbersome of a result than Ne Ti Fe Si (plus Ni Te Fi Se when you add on socionics).

But the cool thing is, all you need to know is the first two cognitive functions in your stack, and the rest could be implied - right down role function. So if we changed the names from the current 4-letter code to just saying the first two functions (ENTP is NeTi, or ISFJ is SiFe), then we've got the problem of simplicity solved.

Now back to what I was originally talking about with the uniform, concrete definitions (sorry, Ne/Ti rambling again). A lot of what causes the typology to be dismissed is because it isn't consistent. Some people describe Te as the organized type, while others say its Si. Ne/Ni is a really vague distinction and often has really esoteric wording that make it nearly incomprehensible. Se is often mistaken for Ne because both are described as novelty-seeking functions. If we can reach a consensus as to the true defining factors of each function (I recommend doing some sort of subreddit-wide poll), then we've got the consistency problem solved.

And lastly, there are far too many people who equate behavior with tendency. Behavior should never be used to define a type, but rather it should be used as a description used *after* someone is typed. For example, laziness is a behavior, not a defining tendency of Ti. There are far too many people that say things like "I don't skydive, ride rollercoasters, or like sports, so I can't possibly use Se!" If we remove this stigma, not only will typing be more accurate, but it will remove a lot of the bias and ambiguity from the equation.

Anyway, sorry if this post is a bit long. I just felt the need to call out some of the inconsistencies with the current system. Hope it helped though!ENTP, Thunderbird, RavenclawWhen I talk about dichotomies, I'm talking about the I/E, N/S, T/F, P/J ones they use on tests like 16personalities. These dichotomies are often inconsistent and go against what Jung himself said about personalities. In these tests, for example, P/J is the organization axis - but if you look at the cognitive functions, there is no correllation. P/J in terms of cognitive functions just determines whether the perceiving or judging function is extraverted. You also have the S/N dichotomy that tries to paint a picture of SJ's as mindless worker bees. Basically, dichotomies *can* be accurate in their own way, but they are very superficial and go against the ideas Jung had about personality.

Edit (addition): There's also the problem of false-similarity. Some types that look similar are actually not similar at all when it comes to cognitive functions. For example, INTP is closer to ISFJ than it is to INTJ when you look at the underlying functions. INTP and INTJ share three letters, but don't share a single function. While INTP and ISFJ share one letter, but share all four cognitive functions.Another awesomely helpful post, peppermint! May I suggest, however, that you add a section that describes each function position? You could say something about how your dominant function comes so naturally that you don't even notice it, or you could talk about how the inferior function is what you admire but cannot embody. Since you also believe in socionics, you could also talk about the important positions such as the PoLR too! Either way, I know many people will find your post useful!Look at their functions. INTPs have Ti Ne Si Fe while ISFJs have Si Fe Ti Ne. That's four functions that match up, and thus that combination is described as very compatible. While on the other hand, INTJs have Ni Te Fi Se. Unless I'm missing something, INTPs and INTJs don't share a single function, and are often described as some of the least compatible types. On top of this, ISFJs and INTPs are both in the alpha quadra, while INTJ is gamma.I probably could've worded that better, but let me explain. The dichotomies are accurate to an extent in which they show preference of Nx/Sx and Tx/Fx, but that's really all they do. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but since it is very simple, it can lead to some preferences being painted in a better light than others. It explains why, for instance, we have a certain N and T bias here. Those are represented, probably unintentionally, in a better light than F and S. The dichotomies lend themselves to interpretations that are detrimental to the theory as a whole. S is painted as a dutiful "worker-bee" type, but in practice, this isn't universally true. I wasn't really trying to say the theory itself is wrong, just that the interpretation of the theory has become warped.

So, I didn't necessarily mean the dichotomies are inaccurate, but I don't find them to be quite as effective and in-depth as the cognitive functions are. And even in my original post, I stated clearly that I don't find the cognitive functions to be a perfect method either. Honestly, I think the functions and dichotomies are basically the same theory presented in different ways. The middle two dichotomies correllate directly to the preferred functions, and the first and last correllate directly to the order of the functions. I just think the functions give more depth to personality than just straight preferrence. After all, MBTI is just a theory, so I think it's healthy to have certain perspectives on how to improve and expand upon it.&gt; While they may not be a perfect representation in all cases, the cognitive functions are the best we've got to type with at this point.

Never once did I say that cognitive functions are a perfect method. And yes, you have a point on the flaws of them. I agree, I want to improve them too, or even move to a better theory as a whole. All I said is that they're the best we've got because no one has come forward with a better theory otherwise. Even that post you linked merely tore down a theory, but it didn't try to rebuild a better one. MBTI as a whole is a theory, one cannot claim to have all of the right answers. Each person has their own interpretation, and it is in this fluidity that I find MBTI to be fascinating.

Personally, I do find the cognitive functions to be needlessly restrictive. I see no logical explanation as to why one cannot have two introverted functions as their dominant/auxiliary pair. I just wish that we could organize a better theory instead of just tearing the current one down. After all, the best way to counteract a mindset is to present a better one in its place.Alright, thanks for the link. I will look through it. Maybe you're right, there may be a better theory in the dichotomies that we can all learn from in our exploration of MBTI. If we were on /r/changemyview, I would award you a delta right now. Because you've at least opened my mind a bit on the topic. :)I am fully aware of this, and never in my post did I make that claim. Ni-Te-Fi-Se is the socionic non-preferred functions - or the ones you hate using. While the bottom two of the first four are just repressed counterparts of the dominant and auxiliary.I'm fairly certain that I am an ENTP. For the most part, I'm attracted to people who are quirky, passionate, and willing to listen to my rants and ramblings while at least pretending to care.I originally, like many people, tested as an INTJ. But after a couple of months of research, I realized that Te didn't fit. When I first took the test, I was a member of the leadership team in my high school band which sort of forced me to use a fake Te. The thing is, it was obvious it was forced, and I always ended up feeling bad about it after the fact. I then realized that I didn't have Ni-Se either because of my lack of need for constant external stimulation and a lack of the sort of "brooding" nature that Ni gives off.

So, I switched to INTP. At first, I fit really well, but after a while of being on /r/intp, I realized it may not fit as well as I thought. I didn't fit in to the sort of reclusive curiosity and depth that dominant Ti gives off. After reading some more, I came across the idea that your dominant function is something you don't notice, you just use it. While your secondary function is something that you have to consciously work at using to keep your dominant in check.

So, even though I am a marginal social introvert, I switched to ENTP. I realized that my main function was always hungering for something new to take in. When not in an environment where I'm forced to focus, I am extremely easily distracted and I meander a ton. I can't remain focused on a YouTube video for more than two minutes before I'm pausing it to go do other things. If there isn't some sort of novelty in my situation, I lose interest and just check out. But let's go back to my social introversion. I realized that even though I'm a social introvert, when I know someone, I don't stop talking. I could talk, meandering from subject to subject, for hours. And while I know you can't type from sentence structure, I've looked back at my recent college admissions essays, and I overuse commas, perentheses, and dependent clauses ***far*** too much (you can probably even see it in this post). So all of this lead me to conclude that I am an ENTP 5w4, which I know is an unusual Enneagram result for my type, but it fits far better than the typical ENTP 7w8 does.I am an ENTP, but I live in the USA, so I wasn't quite as directly affected by the referendum as people in the UK. However, politics is one of my main interests, so I decided to stay up later to watch the results come in live. I can see the arguments on both sides of the debate as valid, so I didn't really have a stance. But while I was watching the results livestream on BBC, I realized something odd. I kept rooting for the underdog, or whoever was losing at the time. Overall, though, I had no strong opinion either way.

Looking back though, I realized that I may have supported the Remain campaign  if I were living in the UK. It probably would've come out better in the end for the UK and all of their allies (the USA included) for the UK to stay and help repair the EU rather than abandon it.The only things you're missing here are your middle two functions, which, from personal experience, are the hardest to pin down (I've been debating mine recently). Since you didn't ask for a full typing, I'm going to go ahead and assume you're Fi -&gt; Te with an Fi dominance. You definitely appear to have a preference for Se -&gt; Ni rather than Ne -&gt; Si, but the only person that can decide this is you. Ne and Se look very similar with the same sort of curiosity and need  for novelty. However, Ne looks for novelty in *abstract ideas* while Se looks for novelty in *physical things*. Your tendency to live in the moment while having a somewhat unimportant long term goal hints at a Se -&gt; Ni axis. Meanwhile, your lack of interest in the past shoots down Si.

However, I do have one other concern with your typing, mainly with this paragraph:

&gt; I'm highly impulsive and at times I act before I put full thoughts into the consequences to my own drawback. I like to work without a plan on the fly. Make things up as I go. I recognize routine is good for me but I have a hard time getting into one.

This describes Pe dominance, not Ji. A dominant extraverted perceiving function will see something and shoot out a response sometimes before the auxiliary judging function can even look at it. However, as I've said before, you're the only one that can truly make that call in the end. Hope I provided some clarification for you though!I wasn't doubting your judgements at all; I was just suggesting that you have a few traits of the EXFP types. You seem to fit in pretty well with Fi-Te, I just wasn't certain of their placements. In my opinion, you lean a *bit* more towards Se-Ni than Ne-Si, but I can also see Ne pretty well. Pe in general in your first two functions can be impulsive, but what you described was very impulsive - to the point where it gave me the vibe of Pe dominant. I'm going to leave my typing as ISFP, but remember, this choice is all up to you! :)I like your description of Ne and Se. That's always been a very fuzzy distinction for me. I appreciate your clarification, and I think OP could use your description as a way to distinguish it for themselves. I wasn't intending to be misleading with it, so thanks for the clarfication!Yeah, I couldn't participate because of that, I've seen you too much on /r/entp xDSince you used peppermint-kiss's new questionnaire, I'll be partially using her key to help me type you. 

&gt; Respect authenticity and treating others with respect

&gt; I only tend to disagree with things that hurt other people

&gt; I get to hear different points of view and understand how that person feels about different things

Fe-Ti is by far the strongest axis I see in you, but you appear to be somewhat introverted, so let's move that Fe to the auxiliary. This axis is concerned with keeping harmony while assuring that everyone feels accepted in a group.

&gt; Manipulative people really irritate me

&gt; I can jump from one topic to the next but occasionally fixate on something for prolonged periods of time

&gt; I'd really like to travel. I've been trapped in the same place for a long time and I really want to see what else is out there

You indicate a moderate preferrence for Si-Ne over Se-Ni. You want to experience things based on their subjective value with Ne, and you base your conversations, ideas, and more off of your experience with Si.

With these axes taken into account, we have either Si-Fe-Ti-Ne (ISFJ) or Fe-Si-Ne-Ti (ESFJ). The only problem I see is that your Fe is so strong that its hard for me to not put it as your dominant. So, while I'm leaning towards ESFJ, it's up to you to decide whether you think you're E or I. I hope that I provided some help for you, good luck in your journey to find your type!I classify Fe as a sort of "nurturing" function. People who have it are usually concerned mostly with the emotions of those around them. They preserve harmony by sometimes sacrificing their own opinions for the sake of preserving harmony. Just to give you a bit of concrete reference, I tallied Fe statements ***ten times***  on my analysis, while the second place one was Ne with only five. Let me give you a few quotes from your post that came across as very Fe.

&gt; I respect authenticity and treating others with respect

&gt; Insensitivity is something else that annoys me

&gt; Sometimes I'll think about trying to understand other people and my interactions with them

&gt; People have their own reasons for doing things and it's important they're respected, even if it's not the most logical decision

&gt; I try to think of the affects on other people

So, to me, you seem like a very strong Fe user. That leaves us with ESFJ if we take the other preferences into account!&gt; I read your first post properly and edited my comment since your examples there made me pretty sure

Yeah, I noticed, I just thought I was going crazy xD

Your inferior function is something you strive to be, but cannot attain because you wouldn't be satisfied with that lifestyle. Your tertiary is sort of your "underlying motive," a goal that underlies most of your decisions, but it is something you aren't very proficient with, and thus need help with. Ask yourself which of the following you most relate with:

* I admire those who can logically deduce anything and sort of detach from a situation to figure it out, but I know that I could probably never enjoy doing it. I have a goal to experience many new things and ideas, but I cannot do it effectively without the help of someone more adventurous than me. (this is Ti inferior with Ne tertiary)

* I admire those who constantly try new things and experience new ideas, but I know I could never enjoy that sort of lifestyle. I have a goal to understand many things about life and existence in depth, but I sometimes struggle comprehending these things without the help of someone more logically deductive. (this is Ne inferior with Ti tertiary)Yeah, I should've probably worded that better. The inferior is something you could never attain because you wouldn't be happy with it, not because you can't do it. I'll fix it, thank you!Then you appear to have Fe-Si-Ne-Ti, or in other words, ESFJ! Glad I could help you out :DIn a way, yes, it is the order they act in, but each function can act vastly differently depending on which position it's in. I think /u/peppermint-kiss sums it up pretty well in one of her more recent posts. I'll paste her quote in here for you to analyze:

&gt; Which function can you not turn off - you almost can't help but see the world through this lens at all times? That would be your dominant function. Another way to identify it is that it's one of the functions you're interested in 'for its own sake'. For example, an Se-dom would like experiencing things, being in charge, and/or competing against others just because it's fun and interesting, not necessarily for any particular purpose or goal.

&gt; Your auxiliary (2nd) function is one that you find very easy to use, but that you generally use in service of your dominant function, and is also possible to 'switch off' when necessary. For example, an Se-aux would not find it challenging to explore and experience things, take charge, or compete, but they would mostly only be interested in doing so in service of their other functions - discovering themselves, defending themselves, or standing up for their beliefs (Fi-dom), for example.

&gt; Your tertiary function is a little harder to access, but it's one that you especially notice when it's triggered by an outside force or inspired by another person. It's often called the 'child' function because it's relatively simple and rudimentary, and also fun to use. I'm an Se-tert actually, and though I tend to be relatively low energy and chill, I can be very competitive and proactive when the situation calls for it, and I tend to enjoy these opportunities occasionally, but I'll likely never be as skillful at it I would if I had Se up higher in my stack. Additionally, I'm unlikely to seek out a lot of opportunities to explore, compete, etc., but I generally take advantage of the opportunity when someone or something presents it to me as an option.

&gt; Finally, your inferior (4th) function is one the you are more likely to avoid or resist when you're younger, and also may be a little sensitive to criticism about, but as you mature you become more confident and comfortable using it. You tend to admire people who use it well and enjoy spending time around them, although you can find it tiring to try to use it for extended periods of time. This is the part of you that you often feel the most urge to develop - you constantly feel a pull to be "more like" this function. For example, someone with inferior Se would admire decisive and situationally savvy people, be attracted to them (often romantically), and often feel the drive to "put their dreams into action" and "stand up for themselves" more - but find it exhausting to be in situations that are too overwhelming to the senses or physically demanding for long. You would also feel quite sensitive/hurt if someone said something like "You have a lot of plans, but you never actually do anything" or "You're such a pushover." Conversely, if someone complimented you on this function, it would likely make you feel particularly warm and fuzzy.

So for you, you're deciding basically where Se and Ti go in your favored block. Ask yourself which comes most naturally to you, this would be your dominant. Then ask yourself which one you use to accompany that dominant function in your everyday life. Then bang, you've got your typing!I would agree with that conclusion. You could also think of it in terms of how the auxiliary function *helps* the dominant. So an ISTP might do something not just if it makes sense, but mainly if it helps him achieve a higher Ti understanding of the world around him.I don't see an option on here for negative income. Oh the joys of being a college student. xDWhen I was younger, I was curious about everything. My parents always tell me about how many questions I used to ask, and how many times they wanted to tape my mouth shut because of it. I was using the computer by age two (mostly things like MS Paint, Kid Pix, and Blaster). I would always like to imagine new worlds by scribbling a shape on paper and pretending that they were continents. Then I'd go back and imagine what that place would be like. I would never stick to one creation though, I literally have an entire journal full of different places I thought up. I was extremely sensitive -- if someone was in any sort of physical or emotional pain, I'd want to help them. As I've aged, however, I've definitely changed a bit. I'm less emotional, less introverted, and generally more intellectually independent.

EDIT (adding sibling): My sister tests as ESFP consistently. When she was younger, she had to constantly be doing something. She couldn't sit at home for more than five minutes before saying she was bored. She is still somewhat like that today; she is constantly hanging out with one of her friends.The ENTP one doesn't fit for me. I'm Catholic, but I'm pretty liberal in my religious beliefs. Definitely not a Bible beater about it -- I just keep my beliefs to myself. I never really bring them up unless someone asks, and it doesn't affect my political leanings either.

Of course, I know this isn't meant to be a catch-all. I just thought I'd give you a contrasting data point. :PAs far as I know, most kids *only* have their dominant function developed until they're at least a teenager (depending on their maturity level, it could take until age 18). So if you observe them well enough, you might be able to pick out which of the 8 functions they use as their dominant. But of course, that leaves you with two possibilities that may not even be accurate because of how irrational kids can be. They may change a bit with age as their other functions develop, and this transition might even make you realize that their dominant isn't what you thought it was at all.I kind of just ignore them because I know a lot of them don't fit. Sure, I'm laid back, but I'm not lazy. I may get distracted pretty easily, but it doesn't make me unfocused -- I can focus pretty well when it is necessary or beneficial to do so. The lack of ambition thing is an absolute non-fit for me. I've had ambitions of going to medical school for years, and I've worked tirelessly to achieve that.

I think a lot of these stereotypes have to do with the whole tendency to describe tendencies as behaviors. You might have the *tendency* to be a certain way, but your *behavior* doesn't have to match -- and sometimes it's healthier if it doesn't!Any personality theory can be analogized as attempting to draw dark lines over a lot of gray area. Even though you fit into a certain section of this division, it doesn't mean you aren't still in a gray area. You, like everyone, are an individual --  a concept that can never perfectly fit into a rigid definition. If we wanted to create a perfect personality theory, we would need a theory that had 7.125 billion (and counting) types. Of course, that amount  isn't very helpful. So, take my advice, don't use your type as a perfect definition that you must fit into. All your type does is show you what general area of the complex spectrum of human conscience that you fit into. It claims nothing more.Caffeine doesn't really have a huge positive effect on me. I just get severe headaches if I don't have it. Heck, according to 23andMe, caffeine consumption is in my DNA. They estimated that my genes make me crave caffeine far more than the average. I hate coffee, however, and I gave up sodas two years ago. So, my only viable source of caffeine now is tea.

As for the alcohol, I refuse to drink it (not just because I'm underage). I've had some pretty bad issues in the past with family members and alcoholism. So I kind of made a pact when I was about fifteen to never put my children at risk of having the same experience -- and thus, I refuse to drink.ENTP, currently an undergraduate in Pre-Medicine! My dream job is actually in politics, but in my opinion, there's nothing worse than a career politician. So that's something I'll probably do on the side or later in life.I was in the band program, so I kinda got put into the "band nerd" stereotype by default (even though it didn't always fit the best). I was a 4.0 student in many Advanced Placement and honors classes. Band took up most of my time, but I was a member of many service clubs (and even the president of one my senior year). I was popular in a sense that everyone knew me, and I was at least acquaintances with just about everyone in my class. But I wasn't much into partying or doing the typical "popular" things.ISTJs have Fi as their tertiary function, which is often defined as either the "underlying motive" function or the "favored but inept" function. ISTJs often have deeply held moral beliefs, and their Fi goal can be to spread those consistent morals to their entire life (and sometimes to those around them with Te). Since it is their tertiary function, however, it isn't naturally their focus. And thus, they require some help at times in defining what they stand for (which may lead them to become increasingly active in some sort of organized value system such as religion or political ideology).

Also, according to the socionic description of tertiary Fi, they want to have sort of "discrete" bonds between those around them. They want the relationships and bonds to exist, but they want it to be less out in the open and more just mutually understood. They usually need help establishing these bonds because they aren't as adept at using their Fx function as many others.While it isn't a perfect way to distinguish between Si and Ni dominant, I always look at which direction in time the person looks to naturally. If they naturally focus on the past, there's a good chance they're Si dominant. On the other hand, if they focus more on the future (and worry quite a bit about it), there's a good chance they're Ni dominant. Those who have Si in their stack often have better memories for detail than those with any sort of Nx function high in their stack.

You could also look at your method of working through problems. Si -&gt; Ne would look at the solution as A=B=C=D=E, and would make sure every part of the equation makes sense before moving on. Ni -&gt; Se would prefer to just say that A=E and be done with it. Ni is more efficient, but lacks a sort of finesse that Si brings.I would mostly agree with the first example, but the math example is more of a Te/Ti thing. A lot of people call Ni the "worldview" function, while Si is more of a "looking back" function. They are both very stubborn, but for vastly different reasons. Ni views everything from the lens of their strict worldview, while Si views everything from the lens of hindsight -- how what they are seeing relates to what they've experienced in the past.

They are both as likely to be rigid and stubborn in an argument. However, an Si dominant might use a stance more based on tradition than an Ni might. Ni will use a stance that may not be as decipherable to bystanders because the evidence comes completely from their own worldview.

EDIT: Edited to improve Si description without Ne presence. Thanks /u/relativezen!Right, probably shouldn't have just limited it to religion alone. Thanks!Thanks for the suggestion. I edited my original comment to (hopefully) remove my Ne bias. :) A major factor of the Ni function is that they form their own view of the world that is often separate from their real-life experiences. While on the other hand, Si's view is based nearly entirely on their past sensations. A person with Si is very much more likely to strive to create environments that are orderly and sensationally pleasing. While a person with Ni's worldview is often so separated from reality that they don't require such sensations to feel satisfied. A person with Si is likely to argue "that's how its always been, so let's not change it," while Ni is not afraid to completely tear down theories and rules because they conflict with their own personal perspective on the problem.

I hope I'm making sense on this. These functions are some of the hardest to detect, so it's extremely difficult to give concrete examples of them. Nevertheless, if you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer. :)I already know, but I just wanted to compliment on how friendly and happy you look. It's just as I expected based on how sweet you are on here. :PWell, the only decent pictures I have are my senior pictures (Which were about 6 months ago. Yes, I know I'm young.). 

EDIT: Since someone guessed correctly, I have removed the photo for privacy reasons. :)Man I suck at discerning types based on looks. My first instinct is ISTP. I could be *very* wrong though.Not quite! 2/4 letters correct! :)Nope, getting colder, lol.Ding! Congrats!My first instinct is INFP. But as I've said before, I suck at discerning personality from looks.While MBTI and Socionics are related, they have some subtle differences that may change their meanings. If you find someone that would like to be typed socionically (which, personally, I view as more accurate), then yes, Renin dichotomies are probably a good way to do so as long as you back it up with some functional analysis too.

That test was very accurate when I just took it, but I do notice one problem with that particular program. One mismatched Renin dichotomy completely grays out a type, when we know that no one usually perfectly fits into a type. If it gave percentages instead of an all or nothing response, I feel it could be more accurate.Hmm, alright. I'm gonna stick with introvert because that picture shows a more reserved look. So maybe INFJ?The best one to make the final choice is you. If you think you have Si-Ne and Te-Fi, then yes, you'd probably be ISTJ! :)Thirding this (is that a word?). I like the colors because they give life to the subreddit, but color is more useful if it has meaning behind it.When I am finding where I stand on any issue, I refuse to let any prior moral or logical conception of the issue influence me. Like a lot of Pe dominants, I am supportive of any policy that avoids excessive use of authority, as too much authority stifles free thought and individualism. When increase or decrease of authority isn't a critical part of the issue, I take a more compromising stance -- trying to find common ground and eliminating any extreme stances.

I'm not sure if it's a result of having Fi as my PoLR or not, but I absolutely cannot stand when people are so adamant about their political beliefs that they see no fault in them and can't handle having them questioned. I see people who act like their political stance is the "be all, end all" of politics as arrogant and pretentious. People on social media who block those they disagree with instead of allowing for meaningful debate to take place are counter-productive to any free society. Personally, I see flaws in every belief, and I have a strong urge to point them out to people. Because of this, I normally take a centrist, compromising stance on most issues. I am genuinely curious to know why people believe the way they do, but I'm reluctant to ask because so many of them resort straight to the defensive as if I've just insulted their mother. I find myself angry at both sides of an issue as they blindly (as many Reddit users would put it) circlejerk their own ideas while not meaningfully debating anything.Have you ever read the book *Into the Wild* by Jon Krakauer? You sound exactly like the main character of it xDI think somewhere around Asheville, North Carolina might suit most of your location standards. It's one of the most progressive cities in the south. It is right in the middle of the wooded Blue Ridge Mountains in the Appalachians, and there are quite a few mountain trails near there. But depending on your idea of "major city," it may not be big enough for you. I'm from Louisiana, so my standards of population size are quite low. xDENTP Male!

I adore Mediterranean-style houses with stucco exteriors and non-square room plans. My dream home wouldn't be too large, but it'd be open-plan with high ceilings. I'm not much of an interior decorator, so I don't really care that much about the inside furnishings as long as they somewhat match.

Location is much more important to me. I was born in Louisiana and have spent the entirety of my life there (but that's gonna change soon as I go off to college in the fall). Honestly, I can't wait to leave this state. I have been wanting to move to a bigger, less hot, and less humid city and state for a long time now. I've been looking quite a bit on the southern and middle East Coast where you're not far from the mountains or the beach and the economy is actually thriving. Also, somewhere that isn't constantly battered by severe thunderstorms, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and etc. would be much more preferrable.I think it is a very ENTP thing to constantly doubt your type (Ne-Ti loop constantly sees differing possibilities and wants absolute precision, which personality theory just cannot offer). I've been researching a lot about my own typing recently, and only in the past week or so have I become somewhat confident in ENTP. Typing by comments is extremely difficult; I just tried to go through yours and couldn't figure even a single function axis with absolute certainty. There are many reasons for this difficulty. For one, conversational text only shows one dimension of a multi-dimensioned personality structure. We don't get your demeanor, tone, or anything that could normally be used for typing -- and that's why we don't use it that often on this subreddit. That being said, the only real function axis I could vaguely get a view of in your history is Ti-Fe or Fe-Ti (I can't really tell which order).

Since I recently went through the same process of self-typing, let me give you a few tips based on how I did it. First, look at the Socionic quadras and Renin dichotomies. Ask people who know you well about your attitude during a conversation:

* Are you more democratic (everyone's opinion is equal and no one dominates a conversation) or aristocratic (certain opinions are more important depending on the social or intellectual stance of the speaker)?

* When speaking your mind, are you more asking (phrasing most parts of your speech as questions to get others to speak) or declaring (phrasing most parts of your speech as statements to get your point across efficiently)?

* When making a decision are you decisive (ready to reach a result as quickly as possible) or judicious (wanting to take in every bit of info before taking any stance)? 

* When debating, are you more yielding (willing and open to making compromises) or obstinate (more interested in preserving your own values)?

Once you have your rough quadra(s), look back at your past in your development. What were you like when you were younger? This can help you find your dominant function. Also, look at yourself now. What do you feel is your natural, unconscious function (this is your dominant)? And how do you go about building upon this dominant natural state (this is your auxiliary)? Once you find this, look at the Socionic subtypes of each remaining type you're considering. Find which one fits you best, and ask others to pick which one they think fits best. Then there you go, you should have your typing!

I hope this long post proves to be helpful to you. If you still find yourself unsure after looking into it more, then just shoot a message to one of the veterans of this subreddit (I personally messaged peppermint-kiss asking her to type me). Most of them will be happy to help if you provide enough information!I am an ENTP instrumentalist and amateur music composer. For the most part, I just open Sibelius (music composition program), toss a couple notes on the page, adjust and expand them to make a consistent melody, and work from there. My composition is really sporadic at times and can take place over the course of days, weeks, and (sometimes) months. I usually have a quite a few melodies jotted down at first and attempt to stitch them together using some (sometimes shaky) transitions when making the final product.ENTP, Biology on the Pre-Medicine track! Probably not a typical major for my type, but I like the challenge. :D

EDIT: My minor is probably a little more typical -- political science.From what little I know about him, I think he's more Ti-Fe. If you look at his Wikipedia page, there's a section on his leadership style. His employees called him things like "detail-oriented" and "micro-managing." Which, in my experience, hints at a Ti-Si loop. It still isn't quite clear though. Maybe once he gets more into the spotlight, we can get a better picture.There are lots of definitions for it, but I find that the depth vs. breadth distinction is the most helpful.

**Extraverted functions are focused on breadth of experience**, so Se is focused on the breadth of sensations. They focus on the current broad sensations and the exhilaration of the moment. This is why Se is known as the "here and now" function. It's grounded in the raw reality of the moment without regard to its connections to any other timeframe. However, Se can be insatiable as it constantly seeks novel sensations.

**On the other hand, introverted functions focus on the depth of experience.** Likewise, Si is focused on appreciating and conserving very specific (and sometimes indescribable) sensations. This is why Si is the "retrospective" function. It's kind of like they have a filing system for all of their past sensations, and they know how to avoid the bad sensations and seek the good. However, this can also lead to them being less adventurous than Se users because that Si filing system makes for a very rigid comfort zone.

That's my basic understanding of the sensory functions. Hope it helps you!Oh man, where do I start? Let's start with organization.

I'm only really organized when I have to be. When I was applying to college this past year, I was organized (spreadsheets and all). When I was leading my high school band last year, I was organized. So I can be organized when I need to be, but otherwise things are kind of just placed where I last used them (I lose things a lot because of this).

For my projects as a student, I do much better with a deadline. Without a deadline, I'll procrastinate until the day I die. I prefer to just wait until a burst of energy occurs and finish the project right then in one fell swoop. I usually can produce pretty great quality work even in that short of time, but sometimes it's obviously rushed.

Outside of my student projects, I have a ton of unfinished projects just sitting around on my Google Drive and my hard drive. Different methods for reforming the US congressional system, worldbuilding projects, music composition projects, etc. I have too many projects. It's not that I couldn't finish any of them, I just sort of lost interest in a lot of them. I'll be in the middle of a project, think of something else, and move to that idea instead. So I just have these sort of halfway done projects sitting on my computer which look like really good ideas when I look back at them (and some are so bad that I'm *glad* I abandoned them), but I just can't find the energy or motivation to finish any of them. For me, starting a project is far easier than finishing it.Thanks, I really appreciate it! I might sit down soon and try to perfect all of my function descriptions using that depth vs. breadth distinction. Seems like a lot of work though, lol.&gt; TPs will do this often, even to the point of displaying what I call the "Ti freeze", wherein the person briefly exits out of the conversation, eyes up right, mouth hanging open, hands frozen in place.

I do this an absolute *ton*. My family always says it makes me look like I'm reading some sort of book or something up there. I never really notice that I do it until someone points it out, though.I have a feeling that my tertiary Fe would slap me in the face if I ever confronted someone like that, lol.

That's not to say that I'm not critical though. I once smack talked my school district's former superintendent to my friends when he was standing about five feet behind me. My friend was like "dude, shush, he's right there!" I didn't care though -- a man that stubborn, authoritarian, and purposefully oblivious to public opinion deserves no place in government.I got ENTP. Looks like I'm my own preferred type love match!

But one problem on the "where to find them" section:

&gt; Or, just look for them waiting in line for the latest Apple gadget at the mall.

I wouldn't be found dead at a mall on my own volition -- much less for an Apple gadget, lol.1) ENTP; about 80% sure

2) 18

3) Mom is ENFJ and Dad is ISTJ

4) Student; Biology/Pre-Medicine with a minor in Political Science

5) Nope

6) I don't have any children, but I'd probably like to have two maybe eventually.

7) Nope

8) Nope

9) House of Cards, Man in the High Castle, Shark Tank; I don't really know why I like them, I just do. xD

10) Yes, I am a confirmed Roman Catholic. I go to church probably once or so a month. I'm fairly liberal in my beliefs and my religion and politics do not mix at all.

11) You can survive! We believe in you and your ESTJ-ness!As far as I'm aware, you have to go through the sacrament of Confirmation to be considered "officially" Catholic. Baptism and/or communion is usually enough for someone to be considered a member of the religion though.Not as bad as ENTP-ness!&gt; 1. What is your MBTI type?

ENTP!

&gt; 2. What is your instinctual subtype?

Self Preservation, last time I took the test.

EDIT: I just took it again and got Social. Well, I don't know at this point, lol.

EDIT 2: Reading the descriptions, 5w4 so/sp fits me best.

&gt; 3. What do you know about your "lower two" functions? (Look on the sidebar if you don't know what these are. For example, "INTP Ti Ne Si Fe). How do you relate to them? What is your experience with them? How has your relation to them changed over time?

Well, for Fe, I can often see how it represents a major motivator for many of my decisions and ambitions. I like being liked, and I try to remain on good terms with everyone I meet. My goal in life is to be admired by many. For Si, I do value security and maintenance of predictability. But for one, I suck at creating it without outside force, and two, I don't really enjoy it. It's sort of a fallback for me when all else fails.

&gt; thx fam

yw famI second this. He seems to have that Fi will for a genuine expression of himself and his opinions. Probably not organized and succinct enough to have higher Te, so Fi dominant seems viable. I'm thinking IxFP too.

OP, I like your originality with this type me thread -- definitely breaks up the monotony some of the typical text threads.At that point, it all comes down to where those functions fall. In order to find that out though, you'll need to know the general definitions of each position in the function stack. Let me give you a quick rundown:

**Dominant** - Basically your natural state. The first function that developed in your childhood. You hardly notice yourself using this function, except it decides basically how you operate your life.

**Auxiliary** - You might be inclined to mistake this for your dominant because it is the one you notice yourself using most. It is a conscious "tool" function that you use to make your dominant more effective.

**Tertiary** - Your "valued but inept" or "goal" function. You value using this function, and a lot of times you don't notice yourself using it. Problem is, you suck at using it sometimes. So you might need help getting it across at times. It also can be a major player in how you make choices.

**Inferior** - You value this function and admire those who can use it effectively, but you don't like using it for it's own sake. It is a function that you might like being complimented on most since it is so weak.

&gt; do enneagram results/personal interests and motivations often blur the hard line between types?

Absolutely they can. But really, if you use it as a subtype with priority given to the MBTI type, it can help a lot and account for some of the intra-type differences.I think parts of it are good, but some parts just make no sense. Certain things in it make it seem less like typology and more like astrology. I *do* like the shadow functions and subtyping, and I incorporate those into my understanding of MBTI. But a lot of things in there are far too much to swallow, especially for beginners.This is extremely interesting. I've been trying to type my friend who is a huge gamer as well. I was leaning towards ISTP, and this observation fit him extremely well. We used to have a sort of gamer/DnD hangout spot about a mile from our school, and he would go there almost *every day* that he didn't have band rehearsal, and he would stay for hours. He plays tons of Overwatch and adores DnD.

This makes me curious as well what kind of games other ENTPs like. My favorite game by far is Civilization. Any game that has a mix of strategy and creative designing (city builders, Prison Architect, etc.) are usually huge favorites. I enjoy some roleplaying games as well such as Skyrim, but I usually have to mod them like crazy to keep a sense of novelty.I haven't bought it because I haven't had time to do much of any gaming lately. I'm preparing to go off to college in the fall, so applications and the like have been taking up most of my time (and money) this past year. But yes, it definitely does interest me, and I would love to play it!Well, the simplest way I can think of to differentiate Ti vs. Te and Fi vs. Fe is a combination of the breadth/depth and objective/subjective definitions.

**Ti is a combination of depth and subjective thinking.** It will study things in depth (usually beyond what is necessary) if it appeals to their subjective interests. Ti adjusts its own internal conception of the world when new information comes in. It seeks to understand for reasons that do not always have a practical effect on the world. Ti is "deconstructive," meaning it constantly seeks to break things down to analyse each part it sees.

**Te is a combination of breadth and objective thinking.** It is focused on amassing knowledge on a wide variety of topics in order to manipulate the world around them. Te is practical, grounded in the objective needs of the reality one lives in. Usually, Te will not study any topic beyond what is necessary to be proficient at it. It is constructive; it tries to build the most efficient, practical system it can with the knowledge it has.

**Fi is a combination of depth and subjective feeling.** It is primarily concerned with the more abstract elements of emotion such as individuality, self-expression, and an internalized ethical code. Fi tends to fiercely defend these elements, and is often inclined to want others to do so as well. Often, the feelings Fi users have are specific to them alone, and they don't often have the ability to express them openly. For this reason, Fi is more inclined towards "low key" relationships. It isn't much for open expression of feelings and would much prefer that relationships be mutually understood rather than out in the open.

**Fe is a combination of breadth and objective feeling.** It looks outside for the emotional atmosphere that a situation has. Does everyone seem content? Does everyone feel appreciated and welcomed? Fe users (especially ego-block Fe) vehemently oppose anything that threatens to create a negative atmosphere. They prefer open expression of sentiments within their groups and relationships. Fe is a "breadth" function because it sacrifices the deeper feelings of individuals for the preservation of a positive group atmosphere.

That's my basic understanding of the judging functions. I hope it helps you! :)It depends on who you ask. If the person you're asking bases at least part of their understanding of personality on Socionics and function models, then they will say ENFP and ISTJ are some of the closest related types there are. In Socionics, there are four groups of types called "quadra," and there are four types in each. All types in a quadra share the same set of functions -- just in a different order. The Delta Quadra contains xNFPs and xSTJs, who all share the Ne-Si and Te-Fi axis. In Socionics, ENFPs and ISTJs are known as "duals," which is the pair that is most likely to produce the most personal growth because one type brings out and compensates for the repressed qualities the other.Libertarian - INTP (or ENTP, still debating which one fits more)Alright, just shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to elaborate! I should probably clarify that I'm not a full on libertarian. I'm socially libertarian, but economically moderate (fairly progressive relative to where I live). Libertarian was just the closest one-word ideology to that :PI think the theory of duality is less of a natural attraction thing and more of a stability and growth thing. By many standards, duals are opposites, but not polar opposites. They value the same traits, it's just that one dual is better at using the traits the other is weakest at. It is probably natural to feel repulsed by your dual at first until you get to know them because they bring out the parts of you that you are not confident in exposing. But once you get to know them, you realize that they help you improve the parts of your personality that are lacking. And thus, you both grow as a result.&gt; do you think the we the rational types value freedom more or do we value correctness more?

I don't personally think *all* of the NT types will have the same view on that. From what I've observed, those that have extraverted perception functions within their first two stack positions are much more likely to be socially libertarian. Pe &gt; Pi is non-imposing -- it has the mentality of "live and let live." That's not to say that Pi &gt; Pe can't have this as well. If their Pi worldview fits into that "live and let live" mentality, then it's absolutely possible.

In the mind of an Ne and Ti user, nothing is ever absolutely "correct." So a value for correctness doesn't really fit for xNTPs in my opinion. For a Ni and Te user, however, their value for correctness lies directly in their introverted intuition.

What all NT types *do* have is a lack of direct ego-block influence by morality (Fi). A person that doesn't really value any sort of arbitrary, personal morality isn't likely to have any justification for social conservatism unless their logic leads them to the conclusion that the system is favorable (which isn't very common).

&gt; I also think that we have to be atleast somewhat economically progressive because wealth distribution really improves overall quality of life in society

That's a sign of tertiary Fe -- a goal for as much harmony and positivity as possible. I'd hypothesize that a Te user would be more likely to prefer a more meritocratic system (such as laissez-faire capitalism). Te has that sort of "manipulating the world to achieve goals" idea, and the idea of economic success is a great goal to aim at.

Anyway, sorry for the ramble! I hope that my (probably overly-generalized) hypotheses help you! :)I've always been curious about how anarchy and left wing economics could really mix. I'm not attacking the theory, just curious. It's always seemed like a contradiction to me -- kind of like a Schrödinger's government; it simultaneously exists and doesn't exist. Would you mind explaining how it works?
Haha, right? It definitely has its challenges, and we tend to go in phases. One of the main aids is we've been friends for 10 years and lived together for 5, so we regard each other more as sisters.Hmm, that is very interesting. I think that sounds very possible for me to be a 7w8. And yes, I sometimes forget that I really enjoy my job, which allows me to read and research in depth on a topic for a few hours and then move on. Thank you!Damn I love that.
What makes you think I'm not an ENTP?That's awesome, thank you so much!  :) I'm glad! -KailaHmm. I have struggled with it, but I find looking at an emotion wheel extremely helpful https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/75/1c/2c/751c2ce6d4d7ae60062dd8a8b0e2aff9.jpg Oh I thought my flair showed up. I'm an ENTP lol So you are unsure of half of your initial statement and think you can identify the rest of my type based on, like you said, one hour of me in an environment where I am trying to get an introvert to feel emotionally safe and have fun so he can open up. Meredith and I emphasize constantly that our podcast is not fact based, it's about exploration of the self and others. I also think there is a lot to be said for how being socialized as a woman and attending therapy can soften and change an ENTP. My full-time job is as a journalist. However, based on your desire to make reductive statements to a stranger on the internet and then say I likely won't understand them anyway, you're definitely an ENTP. Yes :)She's allowed to feel how she wants. You don't have to take it personally. I like them! But I think it's partially because I respect that they don't speak in facts or concepts. I listen to ISFPs as they speak to me through their art or emotions. They can be very caring and also very fun! They do have extroverted sensing, after all. Such amazing taste.ENTPs are fucking rude, and I really try not to be / am grateful to have an ISFJ mother and ENFP father, have been socialized as a woman, and went to therapy. They also tend to just bullshit around with ideas but never get anything done, and I'm grateful to have a great full-time job with mentors and leaders who help me develop my extroverted intuition into a skill that actually gets shit done. Exactly hahaha. There is no way for anyone on this thread to really know what happened since we're only getting it through his lens. People don't like you, it's not that big of a deal. The end! I don't really care for your analysis of me. I think it's very self-righteous of you to try to tell me, a stranger, who I am. I understand that redditors do this all the time (please type me!!!) but I never participate in them for this reason. Also, you are the definition of mansplaining. 

I don't know you and you mean nothing to me, and I am not keen on arguing with strangers of the internet. Bye! I would say that is objectively true. I do hate ISTJs but it's because I find them profoundly dullCall me sometimeHahaha omg hey Kayla, of course your username is 1800dadjokes hahahahYour bottom two questions have their spectrums flipped, so you will likely get inaccurate measures for those. Both should be never on the left.May I guess that you are an ENFPENTP: Social 4.14, Language 3.86, Self 3.71Oh just that you're trying to connect disparate abstract ideas on a topic that is very squishy, unproven and emotion driven. INFP?Interesting!Read this as Ron Swanson and was like duhAn ISTJ libertarian? Nope. He is a master craftsman who wants to be left alone without anyone else's rules imposed on him. Textbook ISTP. ISTJs are rule followers and martyrs to the extreme. ENTP that would happily be an ENFJ. They are so charming and effective. As for introvert... INTP probably? The less charming version of current myself hahahaA lot of the in-depth MBTI projects I see online are done by ENTPs (like Personality Hacker which is also an ENFP), but I think overall I would say Diplomats. My roommate and I host a podcast on MBTI called When Myers Met Briggs and honestly I would say like 75% of our listeners are diplomats. https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test

http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.aspWhy trick me when you can just say you want people to join the groupThank you! I did not. I don't actually chat much in forums but I'll look again. ENFP boredom and ISTJ frustrationYou wouldn't be wrong! hahahThank you for listening! We don't generally talk about axes because the conversation can be so abstract and convoluted. I think our differences/entp-estp differences are very obvious. An ENTP wants to talk at length about theoretical what ifs, what could be, if this then that, and why. Science, politics, fiction and other abstractions. An ESFP or an ESTP wants to actually do things. They want to perform or work with their body, or talk about tangible things like exercise, people, etc.What's your type?Imagine that :)YesI would not be surprised if someone thought I was an introvert when I am around very loud extroverts, because I have no desire to compete with them. 

I also get extremely stressed out by public displays of emotion (crying during a speech, slam poetry) so I will just have nothing to give socially. Ideal response is to just vanish from the room hahaah 

Lastly, I feel intro if I'm faced with a decision or something that kind of shakes my world view, which I think is me having to use Introverted Thinking. Gotta go in my mental filing cabinets and rearrange lolWhat do you mean in the colloquial sense?This is a fair point and I'm not sure how to process it!I hate the concept of "loops." It is such a Reddit overanalysis. People have traumas that affect them deeply, but they can be changed with therapy. I wish Redditors would talk about trauma, vulnerability, authenticity, therapy, scientifically valid means for growth and healing, etc. I wish the response to every "loop" conversation was "find a therapist and do some CBT."I like my type, especially as I age and work on my self awareness and development. But for years I have said if I could be another type I would be an ENFJ.What a fun pair! I have one close INTJ friend but now she lives across the country, and she's not the best on the phone :(Yeah I actually kind of hate being on the phone haha. It's a necessary evil I guessThey're amazing! So kind and warm and charming, and they get so much done. Agree. I've kept a planner every year since third grade and it IS my bible. I don't set fake due dates because I know they're fake and I won't do them, I do put the actual due dates so I can see and prioritize things. I also have a To Do list I've looked at every day since I started my job 5 years ago. Otherwise I just forget literally everything.

I think the key is to find out how you work best and capitalize on that. ENTPs work best when they have many projects running concurrently, because they can focus well for a few hours and then should pause that project as soon as they get bored and move on to the next. Hi! I'm a woman. And yeah, I totally agree with you. It's odd because although I am fond of and have patience for ISFJs, I can't say I've ever liked an ISTJ before Franny. She totally illustrated what you're talking about. Three lady ENTPs in one place together? I am mindblownAn ISTP sharing a photo of his dog lol of course, I love itLady ENTP - both photos are about a year old because I think they represent me extremely well - lately when I see photos of me I don't think I look as much like "myself"

http://imgur.com/a/hBng8I don't think I have met one irl either! It makes me sad. I did recently meet another ENTP irl for the first time in like a year and it was such a delight. Nothing like looking into a soul mirror.

And yes, totally know what you mean about turning on the charm around certain introverts. It's our job! Hahah. I'm dating an INFJ - we *can* find each other! I thought about posting a couple's pic since I bet ppl would like it but ten i was like wait - my infj probably would not like that haharudeHahah, thank you.yas queenI think you are talking about INTJs on Reddit, which 1. are like never actually INTJ 2. by nature are more likely to useless because they are spending so much time on Reddit. The INTJs I know could never be bothered to talk online for fun. They are highly effective and brilliant people. I would imagine that's related to self esteem more than anythingThat's so interesting! I think that's very common. I would say most people want to be or think they are intuitives, even if only because the test always skews N. That's great that you figured out your actual type. Loops don't exist. See a therapist! Or pursue self-reflection work. Maybe start by watching Brene Brown's TED Talks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7oIdk, I'm dating one a cutie one and he's the bomb. My first bf was also an INFJ. So there's your anecdotal evidence Was gonna reply "same" and then saw it's my e-friend! Ayyyy. Minus ENFPs, just stab meBeyond E-I compatibility, also manic pixie dream girl stereotypes and the male gazePosts like this are why people hate Myers BriggsHey buddy! I'll post here from ENTP consistency. I'm IESARC. At first I thought this test was going very boringly asking me the same things over and over. But I think the results are accurate. "You preferred 'Investigative' the most, followed by 'Enterprising' and 'Social'." 100% true. 

I am pretty happy in my career as a journalist but now that I've been in the field for about 5 years I regularly wish I had considered my personality and skills and just majored in something else that still fit them. I think I could be a clinical psychologist, a consultant, really any kind of analyst that spends a fair amount of the workday around people and I think I would be just as happy. So I wish I had encountered this when I was younger. Agree. They express the self that others want them to be in order to succeed.Agree. Little to no barrier here.Exactly. Also would say ENTPs are more charming or at least less awkward, they often love to party or at least be out, and enjoy controlling party or scene dynamics. We also enjoy positing the what ifs or maybes whereas an INTP is all "um, actually..."Also was wondering thisThanks for listening! :)Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I’m ENTP and she’s ESFP. Lately we’ve been interviewing people as a way to catalog types so others can get to know and identify that type.

Sawyer Bland is a 17-year-old INTP who attends an arts high school, loves math, and performs on stage as an actor regularly. We talk with him about what it's like to be a teenage Analyst (with an ENFP mother), and let's just say, it's very analytical.

Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I’m ENTP and she’s ESFP. 

We wanted to figure out our Enneagram and like, that shit is scressful. Here's our first foray into Enneagram and what we think about how it relates to MBTI. We definitely only scratch the surface, so what do you think about Enneagram?

Hi! My best friend and I make this podcast and love sharing our episodes with /r/mbti because some amazing conversations come out of it. We talked with an ISTP who specializes in natural stone restoration and woodworking (imagine that lol) and he was surprisingly willing to talk about being a hopeless romantic, his preference for sadness opposed to happiness, and his interest in kink, fetish and BDSM. I hope you listen and let me know what you think!

Does walking around the city playing Pokemon Go count?WE CAN'T ALL BE THE SAME. THAT WOULD SUCK.Ti-dom. Not just INTP.I play. I don't obsess over it.

I'm an ENTP in the Mystic Team. I would have been more fire/red if the game came out when I was 5. I was more mentally hot back then. I prefer cooling down these days, so the ice/blue vibe started suiting me more.Trump has Ti, and is better as an ESTP jock.

Pence would be an ISFJ which would be a functional mirror.Bernie Sanders has Ni and not Si. He'd thus be ISFP.It is true that there are many famous Orthodox Jewish rabbis that are ISTJ, but that's because it's just easy being an introvert in some communities. The first real, Orhtodox Rabbi to teach my Judaism was ISTJ. He still teachers me, and he helped edit my blog that talked about Judaism.

Another reason why Judaism works with Thinking is because we're against using JUST emotions to make moral decisions. Therefor, we don't NEED Fe-dominant people like the Pope (and some past Popes too) to sustain our belief. And since we don't have many missionaries, we don't need to emotionally appeal to other cultures.

Remember, that FUNCTIONS MATTER JUST AS MUCH AS "TYPE", so it's not weird to see an ENTP or INFP that's involved in Judaism either.About half the INTJs I know are involved in a religion. Mostly Christianity or Islam. I know some that are Atheists, but those are just the "atheist nerd" stereotype.Napoleon (who was ENTJ) may have been a Deist.When it comes to religion and politics, you have to take into account situational differences.I mean, I figured that Trump picked someone who's the opposite of him. So yes, he picked in introvert. But what type of Introvert?
It looks like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/XgXVcXE.gif)[The Alignment Test](http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html)
Not precisely.

&amp;nbsp;

As many MBTI sources will inform you: ENTPs tend to value their dime-a-dozen opinions being valid/correct **over** who they crush on the path to the truth.

&amp;nbsp;

Although we have Fe; it's later in our chain, which apparently makes us heartless monsters in relation to our opinions and debates.

&amp;nbsp;

^(But don't quote me on this)**Ne**
&amp;nbsp;

Dank Meme Generator which runs on pure Ti-based Fuel
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


**Ti**
&amp;nbsp;

Fuel (See above)
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


**Fe**
&amp;nbsp;

Filters for not completely ruining friendships. YMMV.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


**Si**
&amp;nbsp;

Wait....*I'm drowning?* **WHEN DID I EVEN JUMP IN THIS POOL?!**

One of the types most likely to offend...  
Yet, also one of the types that *most likely doesn't want to offend others.*

&amp;nbsp;

I swear we're not assholes. We just talk before Fe has a chance to restrain us.I can confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, we **ENTPs** are the most honest of the MBTI types and would never stoop so low as to **lie or manipulate anyone**.♫ A little nonsense, now and then, is relished by the wisest men ♫As an ENTP who's currently close friends with an ISFP, I second this statement.  
&amp;nbsp;  
True, you "S" types (specially ISFPs) are about as easy to understand as Chinese Typography through a mirror, underwater...in french class, but we ENTPs love the challenge! A mature ENTP should be more than capable of overcoming differences and learning from "S" types.As an Ne main myself, I would be more than happy to elaborate on the absolutely wonderful burden Ne is.  
&amp;nbsp;  
When a new opportunity arises, thousands of connections and possibilities immediately flood our heads in the blink of an eye. *Have I seen this before? Is it like something I've heard or read about?* When you constantly think in abstraction, so many things can be similar, it's absolutely mind-boggling. This proves to be a tremendous pro as you can use these connections however you'd like. Are you a feeler, who wants to use these connections to further your progression towards your inner values? You can do that. Are you a thinker, who want's to use these connections to plot out logical scenarios to certain circumstances you find yourself in? Yeah, why not. Are you an ENTP, who will immediately crunch down every possible joke you can make about a certain situation, regardless of sensitivity, tact or appropriateness? **Damn, fucking right.**  
&amp;nbsp;  
However, there is a main con to Ne dependence. It's incredibly easy to become unfocused. Again, *everytime* a *new* opportunity presents itself, you get the connection boner described above, and therefore whatever you were working on is now old (and boring). This tendency lends us the reputation of being scatter brains who can't finish anything. This con is not crippling, though, as working in a group atmosphere or partnering with someone who values focus and dedication towards one goal will ensure a truly great and innovative result.Just you wait buddy. Regardless of our emotional tolerance or ability to bottle in and "keep cool", our blatant disregard towards acknowledging our emotional needs **will eventually boil over**, causing cataclysmic levels of pathetic wallowing, dwarfing even the most childish episodes you may have seen in any other type.&gt;I don't know if this is enough to say he does things unconventionally but he ran downstairs to grab a bunch of buckets of water to put out a fire when we had a fire extinguisher two feet from the fire  
  
&amp;nbsp;
Definitely ENTP.True. Though, I do like to think that allowing the fire to continue burning while trying to find the most comically entertaining way of solving the problem is definitely the ENTP way. The only other way he'd be more ENTP is if he skipped the buckets all together and went for water balloons or super soakers.Is it the dank memes? It's probably the dank memes...The **Mastur** de**baters** VideoGameDunkey: ENTP ^(*BAYBEEE*)ENTP Circlejerk is best Circlejerk*Looks like the P stands for Procrastinate.*  
**AMIRITE GIES?!**I think any human being carries the capacity to lie, regardless of their MBTI type. It would be unfair to label a single type as more prone to lying than others. 

The only known exception to this rule, of course, being ENTP types. They are well known for their true and never-deceiving nature.^^^Hahahahah Again, this may not be a type thing. This sounds like it's more of an issue with the maturity of your friend. At that age, it's very common to fabricate stories to seek the approval of others, regardless of type. Not trashing your friend btw, it's a pretty common trait at that age and many people grow out of it and become excellent human beings/friends.

The only known exception to this rule, yet again, being ENTP types.
These noble individuals are truthful from the second they emerge from the womb.Not even a Ti-ny bit?Right? I bet they're soooOOoo arrogant, they probably reference themselves in the third-person.\&gt;tfw not using E²=(mc²)²+(pc)²  
pleb :\^)I think Ne makes us terrible *physical* risk takers tbh.  
&amp;nbsp;  
If you really get down to thinking about it, there are *so* many things that can go wrong in any given scenario.  
Why risk physical damage, something that will haunt you for the remainder of your life, when you could just play it safe?  
&amp;nbsp;   
I think people get the misimpression we're risk takers because once we make a conclusion on how a given scenario will pan out: **we're all-in**, as if it already happened.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Examples:**  
1. We invested heavily in that stock because our personal research concluded the odds of it succeeding were so high it basically already happened in our eyes.  
2. We ate that 3-week-old Chinese food because sure we *may* get sick, but Chinese food is delicious and Crohn's disease is very treatable; so we'll be fine.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Edit: On the subject of "Am I being mistyped or is this an uncommon characteristic of ENTPs?", risk-taking is certainly not the tipping point of defining ENTP traits. It's probably more important to consider whether your thought process is lead by internally meditating on scenarios and rationalizing them into a few, very possible outcomes; or whether you micro-process billions of semi-possible logical outcomes every second, ^(effectively stopping) ^^any ^^posiblity ^^of ^^comprehending ^^all ^^possible ^^^outcomes... ^^^too ^^^many ^^^timelines ^^^^send ^^^^helpMBTI tends to dictate: Introverts become drained in social activities, where-as extroverts become re-invigorated.  

&amp;nbsp;

As an extrovert myself, I can confirm in social atmospheres I feel energized (like I'm sucking the life out of my introverted friends with each laugh and smile I draw from them). However, there is a difference between **group socializing** and **one-on-one socializing.** Socializing with one person alone tends to have the exact opposite effect, draining my energy and effectively paralyzing me into a borderline comatose state.

&amp;nbsp;

Do other extroverts suffer from one-on-one social drain, while also retaining the ability to gather energy from groups?  
Hahaha, if I were ENTP we would clash, given that I get along best with Fi types I think ESTJ is the only thing that makes real sense :PHah, I might as well be, after I wrote all this, it was like I'm fucking high - plants grow out of the ground! She sounds like E3. I know a girl just like that, but she's an ENFJ type and her Fe is really obvious.

I can give you some names; picklelicker, autopumpkin, chuffeur, ichinipple. I used to give my friends nicknames, one of them I called powerade, another was onbu after a monkey.

I am So or Sp I think.&gt; EIE-ENFj but MBTI ENFJ kind of.. makes me shudder lol.

o.o why?

&gt; Since you seem Fe PoLR, do you think you might be IxTJ? ISTJ 7 might sound really unlikely but E1 grows to E7. E1 might also be why you thought you were E3, as they can be easily mixed up.

The main thing I felt that 3 explained was my tendency to think that I am good at everything, and aspiring to be something grand, always wanting to be someone else to the point where I don't know what I really want. Like, when I finish uni, I want to be so many things, a doctor, and entrepreneur, and engineer, I want to go back to study maths and physics, I want to do research, I want to write books, I want to be involved in politics, a musician, both piano and violin, I want to go to Japan, Korea and Europe.

I thought maybe I just want all of these things because they are respectable, or I want prestige or recognition and swap when I'm not getting it, but I think it's just that I like everything. If people were to say that science is for filthy nerds and engineering is more respectable so you should swap, it wouldn't bother me at all, no matter who said it, what makes me want to do engineering is when I see someone building a steam engine, or doing electronics I get all excited and I want to do it too. 

I watched Pawn Sacrifice the other day and it takes everything in my power to not run out and buy a chess board, and go nuts learning chess strategy, join a club, play it online and trying to master the game, totally living and breathing it. Then I remind myself... dude you have to learn chemistry, not all of that other shit, and the only thing that reassures me is the thought that after the semester I could do all of these other things, or maybe I could slip things in between study if I work hard enough.

I looked into IxTJ on the same line of reasoning, but I think I'm more preoccupied with the external than the internal. I know a few ESTJs, they seem more grounded than me, they are gregarious and playful but stoic and realistic, but they are older than me so maybe it's just corruption by the internet. I'm also pretty sure that if I told the ISTJs I know that I am the same type as them they would think that's a joke lol, especially the E1s. I get into arguments with the 6s a lot because they are worried about all of the negative outcomes and its like I'm a threat to them or something. I think all of the ESTJs I know are E8s, we always talk news and politics, but they are tougher and more serious than me, they always think we should be preparing for WWIII right now. I get along very well with ESFP 7s but I'm more rational than they are, less empathetic. 

&gt; I could see you as SO-first - you have this very friendly and pleasant vibe!

haha, I'm glad that's the case.Yeah, when I think ENFJ, I think the 2nd kind, probably because socionics. I see ESFJ as the first, but I would guess it also depends quite a lot on other factors. 

But yeah, socionics descriptions of the functions are quite different from that of jungs, at least as far as I can tell. Te is the same, Ni is not for instance. The only thing is, I don't know any source that says 'these socionics function definitions are THE correct ones', they're probably similar to mbti's where nobody knows which ones are the right ones.

&gt; shame (2, 3, 4)/ anxiety (5, 6, 7) / anger (8, 9, 1)

I'm far from anger. I'm still working on identifying the other two. ESTJ or something.

Delta Quadra ftw. INFPs, especially the smart kind. ISTJs because I like tsundere types. ENFPs so we can search for raptors in the attic. ESTJs because solidarity.I looked into it too, I think she's a little like Steven Colbert, it's all persona, there's almost no point in typing her.Yeah I just randomly came across a vid on [polr Fe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGvbJqlucx8&amp;feature=youtu.be), it doesn't seem much like me, I'd have to be in a pretty bad mood to be like that which is quite rare. I do use some Fe, I do appreciate Fe users, it's just not my style, especially in terms of morals.

Fi doms I can be too harsh with when I take issues/jokes a little too far I think, it's pretty rare though. ESFP I could almost never offend, they know my jokes straight away.Yeah, my closest friends have always been NFPs and SFPs as well, it's just I like to push things a little, tease and play games.What's it like as a 1?? One of my best friends was ISTJ 1, he was great, he just struggled to let loose a lot of the time, but I admired his diligence so much, he was like an unshakable pillar, and a good friend.Yeah, that's basically what I feel like, I can look at ENTPs and relate to them a lot, but there's something different, like even when I have tried to explain Ne on /r/ENTP it is different than theirs, I figured that it is smothered in Te.I see a lot of Fe types describing it like this, particularly in terms of an aura.

And when I feel stuff, I don't know how to describe it, or I typically describe it wrong.&gt;  Is that not a normal human thing O__o?

haha, nope, you're a robot that has discovered free will.

So, is there an *absolute zero anger*, or is it kind of like temperature where you can't get to zero because you're always in equilibrium with the outside world?lol, I can keep up the silly stories for days, but yeah creative brainstorming the Ne doms beat me. Like when learning camerawork stuff, their ideas for a sequence were superior to mine, and I had an ENTP idea's guy in one project who pretty much came up with the most out of nowhere stuff possible... he was like Steven Spielberg, only if he was an alcoholic &gt;.&gt;What makes them angry, and what makes you angry? 

It takes a hell of a lot to get me mad, moreso than I find other people, even an INFP I know gets angrier than me, I think she's a 9, so maybe I know what you're talking about :PWhat is depth?Yep, this INFP is definitely 9. I hear stories about her losing her cool and going ballistic when getting triggered by certain things and she really doesn't seem like someone who would ever get angry or care, and just like you said she really doesn't like judgement. I should stop pushing her buttons (I wanted to test her Fi/morals lol), I'd rather not have someone explode on me X_X

I like to think of that passion as a simmering anger, but yeah it's not really anywhere near the same level as 'anger', I actually find it enjoyable.You're probably doing it right. I would think it would be a bigger problem if you were completely ignoring any and all feelings until it gets to breaking point. I think [these descriptions](http://www.celebritytypes.com/infographic/cognitive-functions-at-a-glance.php) might be a good starting point, though the language they use is still fairly convoluted. It's basically a rabbit hole from there. You should probably watch Michael Pierces youtube videos. Type Tips (youtube) is a more socionics based series if that's what you're after.

Socionics is the same kind of stuff, but takes a different approach. They use cognitive function, but their letter systems are different. eg. for introverts, the p and j are switched, but extroverted types are the same as the mbti equivalents (ENTP = ENTp, INTP = INTj). Main thing that everyone takes from socionics is actually the quadras, which sorts types based on which cognitive functions they are most comfortable with, alphas are the INTPs, ENTP, ISFJs and ESFJs for example. 

If you start to get on top of things, you gotta start reading Jung's Psychological types which can be found online for free. haha, I would have recommended EJArendee too, but the spiteful jackass took all of his videos down.Tell me about some of the ideas that you have, things that you've pieced together. idk really, but I ruled out E3, read a tonne about the enneagram, I think I get it. [Its all in here mostly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4lth6p/er_is_this_actually_ni/)It's probably just google catering for your preferences, but yeah, tsundere because they are ice cold, even when they like you. They'd probably play a mean game of poker.hahahahaha, I wouldn't actually be surprised considering the guys I've seen on them, more ape than man maybe.Then it would be between PoLR Si and Ni right? I'll look into that at some point. I don't think I can relate to tert. Se as much as tert. Ne. I am 26. One of my old friends was an ESFJ. I liked her a lot, people used to say we were like a married couple, super positive, like we'd go and get marshmallows and hot chocolate and make the epic memes :D. I like Fe types, but I think there's more mutual understanding with the Fi types :P

On the other side of Fe, I feel like I have to tell them to be more rational, I feel like doctor phil with them sometimes, they can drive me nuts. Fi types seem to absorb my thinking, they become more like me the longer I know them.It works both ways. I've been thinking about this. If you asked me to come up with the same kind of theories than ENTPs and INTPs do, I'd struggle. I'd say their thoughts come from left of center, often wildly speculative, yet they often seem to pull the cloth out from underneath my table.If I had to pick a wing it would be 6, I'm goofy as balls :P

Thankyou for all the info :)

I'm pretty sure one of my brothers is 7w8 sp, and yeah definitely has that goal seeking and realistic side, it's quite interesting.Business Relations, but I don't know, I felt like we were closer than it says, but I wouldn't say we connected on a deep level.

&gt; Partners are able to provide each other with an abundance of useful information and assistance

This is how INTPs are to me, describes it fairly well I think.&gt; Well, I did read a book connecting quantam theory with buddhism so I may be biased.

Whoa. That's totally insane.

Have you looked at ESTP? You remind me of flux and kbnation, but it's because they have an 8 wing too. I like the idea of describing 8 as lust, 7w8 seems very Se like to me.

I don't think I have that 8 kind of spirit. I know a couple 8w9s, and 7w8s, I don't have that 8 energy.Isn't it more about the function than the ability though, maybe you're putting it on a pedestal? Se is more about seeing the world how it really is, which is what it seemed like you were homing in on when you were taking about QM.&gt; Had to stalk you some more ;DDdd

lmao

I'd say 731 makes more sense. Surprisingly I think the 741 was close too. Idk though, it's kind of crazy when there's tritype, wings and integ/disintegration going on at the same time. Those descriptions are pretty fun though.&gt; it adds a more "realist" flavor to you, even if you're an Ne type.

Yeah, this is what I find most interesting. I have seen it with other ENTPs, and I have always wondered if they are mistyped or if it is an 8 wing or something.

I know the theory fairly well, I just like to make sure that my rational is correct. I reason that being a statistical anomaly indicates that something is not right, so I'm looking to see if someone can prove me wrong and point out something that I've missed or information that I have misunderstood, I had a guess that it might have been Si/Ni, but it seems that I did understand it correctly, same with Ne. 

The only type I don't have much experience with is probably E2.yah, I don't want to buy any of the books because I feel like its not real, and I'd be better off buying psychology books. I had a look at one of Helen Palmers books, but I haven't read all that much of it. There's excerpts of Naranjo's Character Neurosis online, those are quite comprehensive. Only time things have ever gotten heated in my life seem to be when my autonomy is at stake. I have fought with bosses when they tell me what to do and I don't agree with it (both of them were fired later, they were shit, I couldn't comprehend how someone could have decided to hire them in the first place, they were conned imo), I have fought with coworkers who want to push me around so they can get what they want, or similarly I have been hugely put off when I was told that my employers were teaching me "how to diligently follow their instructions like a robot" rather than how to actually operate a machine so I can do my job. I don't get fuming mad, but I certainly don't budge, and I often refuse to let it go, I actually find it fun arguing like that. When I'm talking to the police, I am very friendly, but I have to bite my tongue, I have a tendency to be a complete smartass.

When I get frustrated, I think I avoid conflict, I try to keep things positive, I'm not ever going to blow up on people, that just doesn't happen. Oddly, I think I have trouble sharing negative feelings, or bad news, when I have, people think I'm joking, I really don't want to show that vulnerability. I once had someone tell me to stop smiling while they were yelling at me, I didn't lash out, I just left the next day, I don't deserve to be treated like that, I don't want to deal with it afterward either, and it feels so good when I get away from it all, it's like a statement, 'Fuck you', and then I feel that 'I'm in control now, everything will be so much better off this way, that person is stupid and toxic'. That's only ever happened twice.

Its probably partly the need for control as well, I don't want to lash out and make things dramatic, and I know that if I lose my cool I get irrational. I spent years when I was little dealing with irrational anger from both of my parents who were quitting smoking, it would be hell, nothing they said would make sense. I could not comprehend it, there was no reasoning with them, it was like they wanted me to just stand there and take it, and if I walk away they would be fuming because I'm 'sulking off', if I say anything it's 'don't you dare argue with me', there was no escape.ESTx 8 would win, if there's an ESTP and an ESTJ, TP would probably win given the nature of the challenges.I am between ENxP and ESTJ, I feel like Ne is really important to me, a big part of who I am, but everything else points straight at ESTJ, and when I look back at that Ne its far more full of Si than I realise, it is childish, not like that of an actual Ne dom other people can see that more easily than I can. The other two options are contradictory, how can I be ENTP when I relate to the Te-Fi axis? How can I be ENFP if I'm so sure that I'm a T type? The ENFPs have so much stronger Fi than me as well. The system may be very subjective, but when you take it outside of your head and put it in the real world, everything should fall in place.The way I interpret it is that I ran away from pain/anxiety and then just pretend like its a good outcome, instead of facing what is in front of me, that advice for E7 'to not flee from all pain/conflict because sometimes it  is beneficial to you' actually seems like it would work for me. My conception is that E8 would be more likely to bulldoze that kind of person, not run away. I thought it was like that of E5 or E7. Walking away to get control of a situation is something I have seen 5s do, they extort more out using their withdrawal as a threat to make people see how much they are worth. I can relate to some extent.

After I escape its like interloping or something, like I get idealistic and full of energy and unrealistic dreams, like I'm going to start a whole new life better than the last. From what I have read about 7 it fits, they even mention the tendency to belittle their perception of whoever wronged them to protect the ego, thats what I seem to do, I think that might be the connection to E1 as well. And to paint every situation as 'okay' or 'great' no matter what, that almost defines me. 

I woke up once came out to the living room and this guy was hacking my mothers computer, he had convinced her that he was from telstra, he had her install a desktop control program and told her he was protecting the computer from a hacker and he had started going through online bank accounts and emails asking her to fill in his details. As soon as I got there I said to him *'WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THIS COMPUTER?!* and I told him to stop right now. There was so much panic from my mother, almost like he'd been let in through the front door and she was too nice to stop him, but more than anything, I found it exhilarating, the whole situation was fun, like  I have read about these social engineers before and how they get what they want, the whole situation was like a game to me and I'm going to win. It was *awesome*, my dad is an 8w9 and he certainly didn't feel the same sentiment, faaar from it, he was mad as fuck.

The thing that is odd is that I don't see it as anxiety or fear, when I see 6s the anxiety can be huge! I think I get anxious about responsibilities sometimes, but it melts away when I start to do other things I used to be addicted to games because of this, it was extremely hard to beat that reaction, I cant go near them anymore. It all seems consistent with 5 or 7 to me. I look at 8 and I can't relate to any of it, the 8s I know have a different energy than me, far more tough minded. 1 as well, unless I am completely delusional or something.Psychopathy. Ban him, *do not play with psychopaths*. A lot of people don't seem to understand what this means. Also it's relation to the sins (avarice, gluttony, lust etc.), I don't think that is the right way to assess motivations and psychology in general. Like, there are no legitimate enneagram scholars, but there are plenty in psychology. When I go through each type as well, it almost feels like I could twist any one of them to fit because of their wording and the nature of it all, it's like a different rationalization for the same behavior. The main thing that I like is that it gets us to think about these things more deeply. At this point I'm thinking I should call it done and get back to work XD Thankyou for the offer though, very generousHonestly if there's anything that triggers me, its religion in general. I've thrown away books as soon as they start talking bible quotes. Its more 5 like than 6; Psychology is likely worth my time moreso than Enneagram, as much as I love them both, I can't do everything - narrow down, focus. Like 5. Question is then is it growth, or stress? 5? 7 up 5? 8 down to 5? I think it's growth. I literally have 28 different professions I want to master, not even including this stuff, each one will take 10000 hours, if I keep going the way I am, I'll be dead before I accomplish anything, I'm not exactly focused, more of a fox than an echidna.

&gt; Sixes, however, have a heightened sense of responsibility and do not allow themselves to “goof off” until all of their obligations have been met. Sevens, for better or for worse, are far more spontaneous, and resist having too many expectations placed on them. They want to be free to come and go as they please, and find the Six’s persistent sense of commitment potentially limiting and dull.

Resisting expectations is far more like me. I hate being asked when I'm going to show up to an event or if I'm going to drop by some place and say hi, because it sets up an obligation, I'll be there when I feel like it. I am autonomous, independent.

&gt;  Sixes tend to react to their anxiety by fretting and becoming more anxious.

I've seen them do this, it's almost like a panic attack. It's never happened to me. 

&gt; Sevens, by contrast are extremely optimistic, and react to anxiety by looking for enjoyable distractions.

This on the other hand does happen, when the going gets tough, I get going. 

I think I have made up my mind at this point though. I'm either 5 or 7, and ~~I'm not nihilistic, intense, dark or focused like 5~~ nevermind. I think 5 can be like me, just looking at Oliver Sacks. I will go with 5.Haha, The enneagram is the confusing one, and yeah, typing over the internet is hard. At least I'm pretty much dead certain that I'm a head type. My energy is more anxiety than anger/frustration. And 6 is not right. 

So if I suppose that five is right: Under stress, ie. a situation that causes anxiety, I become like 7 scattered, idealistic, optimistic. Normally intense, focused and cerebral. When conquering anxiety I become lusty, in control, confrontational. 

As for 7: When stresses, becomes critical and self righteous. When normal, scattered and optimistic. When conquering anxiety becomes more focused, cerebral. 

I think that 5 makes sense. Dark, nihilistic and intense doesn't seem right to me, I avoid dark, I like bizarre and eccentric things though, that is fun. observing myself sounds just as weird. The main thing I see is that the healthy sides of 5 and 7 seem similarly full of wonderlust with the world ie. Oliver Sacks 5 (assuming this typing is correct) and Richard Feynman 7, they say 5s master one area, but Sacks is a freaking polyglot, as much as Feynman. Both are unusual/can be quirky. Both fell in love with science and the world at a young age. 

My guess is that E5 is written about Ti dominant types and that I am a happy ISTJ E5 so that is in love with the world. That makes more sense than ESTJ + 7. I'd say Sacks is very similar to myself actually, I should have seen that before, though he was more fearful and anxious than me.BUILD THE WALLGood luck when you reach the Se doms, if you don't get naked, you're doing it wrong.

Oh yeah, and the ESTJs I know love growing roses for some reason. I personally like sunflowers, I find roses lame.I suppose the difference is that ESFJ wont brag about it, the ENTJ will.I think the Fi genuineness and empathy is looked on very well by the introverted types in society, predominantly by the Si doms, the only thing is they are reserved and keep their judgement to themselves.omg, that's exactly like one of my friends, there's always a kind of "however... if that's what you want to do it..." or "I have always found that it's actually not quite so simple..." I don't know if I can really describe it accurately, it's like she's talking to herself but directing it at me.What stops me from harassing you right now is empathy among other things; finding conflict painful, knowing that it is pointless, that it is shameful. Remove these barriers, combine them with a motivation, and you get the average troll, basically the psychopath type. It's like the child that drowns kittens in a garbage bin, perhaps its just a game to them, an interesting experiment, they might do it for the thrill. Similarly you have other kinds; some need to feel in control and get that feeling by dominating other people, attacking their ego, preying on their weaknesses. Some need to convince you that they are everything you desire, and then when they have you under control, they destroy you - they prey on codependents.

It's hard to see the warning signs for some of them because they can appear to be very normal. The only clue will be their history of behavior. On reddit, you can probably use karma as a guide, if they don't seem to care about the disapproval of the public, that's one less barrier.

In terms of MBTI? Probably not that much correlation, thinkers maybe more likely though. Enneagram wise, there are various connections to psychopathy, E5s Schizoid qualities like you mention. E3, E4s through narcissism, though probably less likely to be internet trolls, more likely to seduce people irl. E8s antisocial qualities. Generally these kind of things occur at very low health levels, not that common.Yeah, and I am still suspicious about the ESTJ part. I think I will leave it until I am sure, but lining myself up against the people I type irl, Ne dom would seem more appropriate.

7 is right. ExplicitInformant helped me rule out 5, and then 1. Most obvious case for 7 was when I quit uni just before finishing it because I felt like I would be trapped, my life would be over and I would be working 12 hours a day for someone else's agenda for money I don't need. That would be my nightmare, I came to realise later that life doesn't end there, it begins, there are so many things I can do, I could learn physics, build machines, write books, work in other countries, start my own projects, I would be free. I can be who I want to be. What originally made me realise that was reading Feynman, it was like waking up from being a zombie with nothing left to live for. My list writing and plans are definitely to quell anxiety too, so that I can sit still and avoid that feeling that I am missing something better that makes me unfocused and incapable. What abstract conversations are you aiming for? I typically find the ISFJs want to talk about deep and real topics, which I believe INFPs are quite adept at carrying. ESFJs are super fun, I can't see them not caring about something that you've shown them is important to you.I think most of it would come from school, where peoples worst behaviour is the norm.Gintoki is more of an E, the rest seem fine. Haru from Stein's Gate could be ISTP but w/e

Could add Hikigaya from Oregairu and Ruri from Nisekoi. ESFJ/ENTP?? ESFJ more likely.

Ali seems like an interesting guy too, ESTP E3 I'd guess.Ahh, soulless Fe then, I'll go with ENTPSeems NFJ like to me.

&gt; But primarily I work from the basis that all people are fundamentally the same, we were all children once and are all still a little confused about the world, all trying to understand it, searching for happiness and meaning, all a little lost some times

This is exactly what Michael Pierce used to describe Fe at one point.Likes weird things: Ne, Ti "Whale tapeworms are cool!"

Is actually weird: Fi "I am me!!" + Ni "I have the spirit of a wolf"

Fe wants to be weird, they tell you how weird they are, and because they've told everyone, they become normal.

Se is too cool to give a shit about weird

Si and Te on the next level: "you are weird", they seek immunity by controlling the playing field.They are as big as you arm and as long as a firehose, its like a giant snake living parasitically inside the gut of a whale.You have Ni?Sometimes people think they are weird, other-times they think they are badasses.Creativity requires a purpose, an environment, preconceptions and skill. If you think of an artist and their blank canvas, it is a completely variable process; they can use a different canvas, brushes, colors, emotions, memories, influences, techniques.

I think one aspect of mbti that might affect the creative process quite heavily would be I/E. The extrovert might take many influences from outside of themselves and combine them, the introvert might take a handful and reinterpret them through their own lens. That might be hard to narrow down into functions, but I might as well try: 

* Ti strips an influence down into fundamental elements and reconstructing it anew. 
* Si takes an influence and paint how it subjectively feels.
* Ni tries to represent an abstract concept like life. 
* Fi focuses on what they value the most from their influences and reinterpret in that way.
* Te is your classical engineer, takes a problem and creates a solution.
* Se types usually seem to be quite adept at photography, I think they are well suited to exploring the parts of life that we overlook.
* Ne usually combines two subjects that you'd never think would work.
* Fe wants to reflect the external atmosphere. I'd say people in similar Quadras have fairly similar behavior.Yeah, ENTP+ESFJ is also extremely fun, even without common interests we can talk bs for days, they are similarly excitable, good vibes all around. ISFJs I have struggled to connect with, like I cant pierce their boundaries, might take some persistence. 

I have seen ISTPs and ENFJs together too, its like ying and yang.Manipulative ENTP is like Rick from Rick and Morty, lots of bullshit and tricks to get what they want, bit smoozie too ime. eg. telling people they are "totally great! keep going! (lol)". Same with ESTP, commonly depicted as the conman/salesman, comes straight from the tert. Fe. Most of both types are not that manipulative though.

ESFJ manipulation probably comes more from lower levels of E2, factious and proud, much like Cersei Lannister (GoT). ENFJ can be much of the same. 

ETJs do it as well, but similar to what was said in this thread, everybody lies.Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised with that, I have thought it myself.How do you distinguish any of this from ENTP? Your description of Ni as "possibilities" and thinking 30-40 years into the future is pretty broadly applicable. Zooming in on a single point of data may relate to Se-Ni, but it really depends on what you're actually talking about. "That's just one of my perspectives" seems more like Ne to me, but maybe it applies to both?

You say INTJs are not judgemental, but that is not how I experience a lot of them to be. Enneagram 1 is somewhat common for that type, it is possibly the most Te oriented enneagram type there is, and they are known for having very high standards for themselves and others. 

Take Elon Musk as an example, what I think to be INTJ E1; he is extremely critical of his own workers, he is a predominantly globally focused visionary with rather impractical ideas, takes huge risks to realize his goals, puts his money where his mouth is because that's what he *ought* to do. His biggest problem is that he's always trashing the people he works with, looks over their code, tells them they are completely inefficient, says they could do that job in 1 day and when they don't believe it, he'll do it himself to prove it. He fired his secretary because she didn't seem to be 'worth' anything, she was actually looking after people's emotions after he blows up on them, he has zero value for that. He works 80 hours a week and he expects other people to be able to live up to that same work ethic. I don't mean to paint a bad picture, I'm a huge fan of him, that is a handful of things he struggles with.

Another common enneagram type for the INTJ is E5, they are still intense, withdrawn, detached and nihilistic. These INTJs are more similar to INTP, probably a lot less judgemental for the reasons you give: they don't care that much, they might not even take care of their own personal hygiene, room is a mess etc. because they are pretty much detached from the whole world, a walking brain, but again that's not really like what you describe.I think both of your examples of judgement stem from the same root. Think about what it means to judge someone in general, whether it is performance or orientation it is a comparison between what is and what is not, and it is usually based on an ideal, which may be aligned with empirical logic (as with Te) or a gut feeling.

But like rofevil said you probably mean to say that INTJs favor detached criticism, rather than emotional judgement? 

Well, anyway, good job making that video. It takes guts to do it. Are you following Socionics? From what I can tell you're using their structural theory. You're reading Jung right? imo, his explanations of the functions are by far superior to any that I have seen elsewhere.1. bring it up when it actually becomes relevant. eg. when your friend is clashing with a new group of people. 

2. when someone talks about something really characteristic of a certain type.

3. Type people in terms of game of thrones characters (lol), eg. you are like eddard stark, she is like arya etc.Pretty sure you're in the alpha quadra and statistically you are more likely to be a sensor. You have strong Ne because you're a funny goof, so you must be ESFJ with really strong Ti. You only seem so much like a Ti + Ne type because you're clinging onto it too much.not funny? oooohhhh, you must be ISTP then :}The two types are really similar actually they both use Ti and Fe and they're both sensors, everybody mistypes like that dw, ignore the stereotypes, thinkers can feel and feelers can think.&gt; (The opposite of a dealbreaker)

DealmakersAhhh, this sounds like a Freudian reaction to my probing, you reject thinking and feeling because you are in competition with your father for your mother's love. I believe it also shows that you have an anal fixation, meaning that in your psychosexual development, your toilet training was improper, likely too strict and in reaction to this you have become a rulebreaker, the ESTP subtype, with strong compensation by the libido.The only bedtime stories in my childhood were told by the incessant rattling of an M42 machine gun. I grew up in the Vietnam war under communism, and now our lord and savior Bernie Sanders is here to bring back my faith, praise be.I'm far from an Se type XDYeah. I don't think it's tert. Ne.&gt; Reading what people of your type have to say and talking to others is one of the best metrics I think. There's an ease of understanding and communication. Although values may not always line up, it's pretty helpful to type. 

Yeah, that's what I've done, I tried to put myself in the context of other people. And yes, it has typically been invisible, I can see it now, I mean look at how I write:

&gt; Ahhh, this sounds like a Freudian reaction to my probing, you reject thinking and feeling because you are in competition with your father for your mother's love.

M42 is a nebulae btw. Always branching, reality is a springboard for my imagination. Of the ESTJs I know, they don't see the world this way.

And this is what my analysis is like:

&gt; I think both of your examples of judgement stem from the same root. Think about what it means to judge someone in general, whether it is performance or sexual orientation it is a comparison between what is and what is not, and it is usually based on an ideal, which may be aligned with empirical logic (as with Te) or a gut feeling.

I do think it is Ti, it feels like stripping away all of the bullshit, reducing it down to its core and extrapolating. We got this

=)we're just having a thing

 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯No I'm legitimately cool, it comes naturally to meI'm not your dad, I'm a real boybut he can m8 like a broYou'd have to ask them why, maybe they've found some interesting studies. The psychology textbook I have says that the only reason it is not used is because psychologists have far more reliable tests and theory that they can make life affecting decisions based on. ENTP

I took a fair while to learn how to drive, the only chance I had to practice was during lessons, my parents put pressure on me to pass my learners, but they would never give me a chance to actually practice. After I could drive freely, I became better but still meh. I used to be pretty bad, took corners too fast, failed to pay attention to signs, ultra conservative give way skills (which helped me pass the tests at least). I used to daydream a lot too, the speedo was my worst nightmare, too fast, too slow...

I don't really enjoy driving. I listen to science/history audiobooks wherever I drive, either that or I sing, I really like learning lyrics. I would die without something to distract me. I have become magnitudes more alert than when I was younger, better at controlling the vehicle, better under pressure, less reckless and more attentive. I even managed to drive my dad's Van into the city, the thing is a monster, it's like a small truck.

My kryptonite in terms of offenses has been paying rego on time, and the occasional speeding ticket, though I don't think I'll be getting either of them ever again. I've never been in a crash. I don't road rage at all.Yeah, the more I have thought about it, the only types she could be are ENFP or ESFP, those two are both quite similar, but I think ENFP is more fitting.Seems way more like ENTJ.I thought he was more like ESFP.The main youtube channels I pay attention to are Sci-show (Hank Green tested as ENFP, seems to fit I think), VSauce (Michael seems pretty likely to be ENTP), Periodic Videos (professor is... idk? xNTP?).

I was watching The Young Turks fairly regularly; Cenk ESTP, Ana ESTJ, Hannah from Thinktank is ExFP, I can't figure out Idarola's type though, maybe he's an introvert. The tobie maguire spiderman is very much INFP, other iterations are very different. Cartoon one seems like INTP, Garfield's is probably ISFP, he always plays ISFP characters.Maybe. I have heard INFJ, but that seems wrong, he seems more like a T type.I expected something like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRNKxAy049w)hah! I love Billy Talent I used to play their songs on guitar, my fav is [Diamond on a Landmine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqITR9QrdcI)Sounds about right, I suspect beta is the lord of the dank memes.Oh yeah, and I remember Deftones now, main song I liked was [Diamond Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qksTlo_1Tpw), I never got into their other stuff for some reason.ESTJ - Aggron:

Aggron claims an entire mountain as its own territory. It mercilessly beats up anything that violates its environment. This Pokémon vigilantly patrols its territory at all times... If it's mountain is ravaged by a landslide or a fire, this Pokémon will haul topsoil to the area, plant trees, and beautifully restore its own territory.

ISTJ - Conkeldurr:

It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago. Rather than rely on force, they master moves that utilize the centrifugal force of spinning concrete.

ENFP - Togekiss:

As everyone knows, it visits peaceful regions, bringing them gifts of kindness and sweet blessings... It shares many blessings with people who respect one another's rights and avoid needless strife.



INFP - Gallade (M)/Gardevoir (F):

Gallade: Because it can sense what its foe is thinking, its attacks burst out first, fast, and fierce. A master of courtesy and swordsmanship, it fights using extending swords on its elbows.



Gardevoir: Gardevoir has the ability to read the future. If it senses impending danger to its Trainer, this Pokémon is said to unleash its psychokinetic energy at full power. Gardevoir has the psychokinetic power to distort the dimensions and create a small black hole. This Pokémon will try to protect its Trainer even at the risk of its own life.



ESTP - Charizard:

Charizard flies around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself.



ISTP - Greninja:

It appears and vanishes with a ninja’s grace. It toys with its enemies using swift movements, while slicing them with throwing stars of sharpest water.



ENFJ - Blissey:

Blissey senses sadness with its fluffy coat of fur. If it does so, this Pokémon will rush over to a sad person, no matter how far away, to share a Lucky Egg that brings a smile to any face.



INFJ - Absol:

Absol has the ability to foretell the coming of natural disasters. It lives in a harsh, rugged mountain environment.



INFJ (Alternative): Lucario:

By catching the aura emanating from others, it can read their thoughts and movements... By reading the auras of all things it can tell how others are feeling from over half a mile away.



ESFP - Blaziken:

In battle, Blaziken blows out intense flames from its wrists and attacks foes courageously. The stronger the foe, the more intensely this Pokémon’s wrists burn.



ISFP - Lopunny

Extremely cautious, it quickly bounds off when it senses danger. The ears appear to be delicate. If they are touched roughly, it kicks with its graceful legs.



ENTJ - Bisharp:

This pitiless Pokémon commands a group of Pawniard to hound prey into immobility. It then moves in to finish the prey off.



INTJ - Metagross:

Metagross is the result of two Metang achieving fusion. When hunting, this Pokémon pins the prey to the ground under its massive body. It then eats the helpless victim using the large mouth on its stomach.



ESFJ - Goodra:

This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime.



ISFJ - Arcanine:

It's proud and regal appearance has captured the hearts of people since long ago... Its magnificent bark conveys a sense of majesty. Anyone hearing it can't help but grovel before it.



ENTP - Gengar:

Sometimes, on a dark night, your shadow thrown by a streetlight will suddenly and startlingly overtake you. It is actually a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow.



INTP - Alakazam:

Alakazam's brain continually grows, making its head far too heavy to support with its neck. This Pokémon holds its head up using its psychokinetic power instead.enneagram type 5I have a softspot for lighthearted anime if it can make me smile and laugh it gets a thumbs up, I've pretty much almost seen everything that's ever come out. I like comedy in general as well, I watch Futurama, Family Guy, How I met your mother, Scrubs, Rick and Morty etc.

I avoid dark shows, but I make some exceptions (eg. even GoT had me considering dropping it after certain scenes). I dislike anything like Fight Club or Die Hard, total snore-fest, or those 'we do drugs and get fucked up and die' type shows (but sometimes they can be good, like Hangover and Superbad). I like to watch movies that have educational value, like Awakenings or Killing Fields. I do like shows with that nostalgic element to them, like Jumanji, Disney Movies, Space Jam.I don't really stalk enough people to know, but just from interacting with different subs;

The ESTPs around here are very fun, I like positive peoples.

INTPs are worth following, usually have interesting ideas, sometimes hard to interact with. Same with ISTP.

ENTPs have certain modes that they switch between, one where they want to correct every word you write with zero hard feelings and another which is more like *goof-mode engaged* ily guys

r/INTJ is serious business. Don't even try to smile because that would be a sign of contempt. I feel like they come from a different planet than me for the most part.

With INFPs it usually feels like they're holding back something. Rather welcoming and good vibey.

ENFPs don't seem to hang around r/MBTI, but on /r/ENFP they are somewhat of a mixed bag (read as: bipolar, totally the best followed by a spoonful of -_-'), sometimes a little bit egotistic, as with the other Pe doms.

ENTJs are pretty chummy, good mix of seriousness and chill.

INFJ has literally downvoted every comment I ever made in r/INFJ, I think I know why, but I can only really guess. The INFJs on r/mbti are really awesome though. I often get a confusing sense that they want to fight, but they don't really want to fight.

ISTJs are quite alright, give a quiet little house vibe, alongside ISTP, I'd say they are the most sane types.

There's always glaring exceptions to these though, mostly from the people who don't really 'act' like any specific type and those with different enneagram types than the most common ones.Guns or swords? your callbig mistake, I have lanky long arms you wont even reach me with that valerian steel :Pthat's k, I'm already undead, the rest of the whitewalkers will avenge my poofy arm.ESFJ, reminds me of a guy I knew; quite practical, hard working, dedicated to social cohesion, nice and positive.I can't really say whether or not this works, but since you struggle between T and F, chances are they are your middle functions (3rd and 4th) rather than dominant/inferior. I'd guess that the accuracy of that really depends on how well you understand yourself though.Do you think he has tert Se? He certainly seems like a guardian type to me. This sounds like a rant to me. It seems to me like ESFPs are way more turbulent when they are close to you and younger, my bro was the kind of kid who pulled a knife out of the cupboard to show how serious he was at that age, but now in his 20s, he is far more mature in every single respect.CritSrc told me you remind him of me, I can confirm lmao. You're an Enthusiast no? Sounds to me like you're mostly motivated by what is most pleasurable, rather than say; what other people require from you, what makes you competent, security or any other such thing. One thing that I have found with ENTP is that it is somewhat of a contradictory type, kind of confusing to understand - it is a thinker type, but dominant in intuition and balanced by tertiary Fe. It makes ENTPs seem very all over the place, one moment they are highly analytical, pathological assholes, the next they are warm fuzzy hippies and everyone's best friend. In contrast to the xNFP, a thinker will find it easier to list reason why they do the things that they do, eg. what clothes you wear, what courses you pick. 

Most ENFPs will literally throw on all sorts of clothing from their wardrobe that they bought on a feeling - they know what is truly them. This is the same for the INFP, maybe a little less spontaneously, but their focus is on aligning themselves with their personal values. The Fi types I know are usually against certain morals based on feeling values eg. 'I do not like marijuana because the people who smoke it are assholes and bogans, but the people who are mature that smoke are not bad' In comparison to the TP types who may struggle with making an argument from such sentiments and might prefer something like 'smoking pot is fine, it is not harmful to your health so who gives a shit?' The TJ types as far as I know also have some of the Fi, it is not unusual to see them argue based on what is 'good' or 'bad'. One thing to note is that for the NTPs, nothing is held sacred, Fi is not their strongest trait which leads to them often getting into trouble for 'violating' other people's sensibilities. eg. questioning why we don't eat human flesh. The NTP is usually willing to consider such a question in order to get to the truth, however dark it is, and it has historically gotten them into trouble with the moral guardians of society.

&gt; Sometimes it is semi-awake processing things and thoughts.

Sounds like you could be overanalyzing, that is something I have been lapsing into recently, I will have something that MUST be solved that my brain will sit there indulgently chewing on it, endlessly searching for a solution, trying to break concepts into their constituent pieces to arrive at an overarching truth.

&gt; Other random things that occured to me during my first year was my inability to read academical texts, which is really annoying.

I never read them either for the first couple of years. I am doing that this time, it is far superior, what convinced me to do it was Elon Musk - he never even went to lectures, he learns everything from textbooks because it is far more efficient and it is usually a superior source. Also, if you have time to spare, try opening random chapters for fun and purely out of your own interest, that will probably help to get comfortable with the author's style and keep you focused.

Regarding the Ne vs Si inferior question, I have found this fairly difficult to distinguish as well. The reason I know that my Ne is dominant is because it is what I am continually searching for, the links and branches between every piece of information I receive. eg. connecting game of thrones to the war of roses, which is followed by the Tudors and then a time where my direct descendants of England mined tin. Through all of these connections, I see the metal itself, when I look at tin I do not see a soft metal in front of me, but everything it is connected to and all of the abstractions it can take, it is like a flow of images that take preference over reality. 

Si on the other hand is an internalized impression of the metal, a collection of what the user has experienced with the metal, how it feels, how the properties affect them, they orientate themselves through this subjective feeling and they seek it out. This is why an Si type is considered more stable, they find comfort in those impressions, the Ne type on the other hand does not, once something is experienced it might even be entirely discarded. eg. The Ne dom will figure out the best study method, discover how well it works, project what they will accomplish if they stick to it for a year and then abandon it for a different method - that is inferior Si. For the inferior Ne type, the way they know is the way that is most comfortable and they will stick to it, sometimes to a fault. When a type has Ne or Si as their 2nd and 3rd functions these problems will not be as clear, instead the divide will be between thinking and feeling, one of them preferred too strongly. &gt; I have got the advantage of having a study which does not require so much reading. Many times I have resolved problems by reading random articles online that are written better or simply watching videos! Never underestimate the power of a 3 minute video compared to a 45 minute lecture.

Lol, that is very true. I find that Youtube is probably almost as useful as wikipedia sometimes. 

What is CS like in comparison to Mathematics? I think even in maths you can benefit hugely from reading up on the theory, but like you seem to suggest, putting it into practice is the better way to learn it.

&gt; Something that I'm really glad of is that you have an easy to read writing style. Also the occasional example really helps clearning things up. Now, time to react!

It's a pet peeve of mine when I read a personality profile or functional description and they do not actually relate it to reality, how can you ever know if it holds any truth if it can't be applied to anything? Einstein thought this way as well, he would reject any idea that could not be represented by something tangible in reality, like a clock or a gear. Most people type him as an xNTP (My opinion is ENTP).

&gt; This is indeed really hard. Especially compared with the INTP. It is really hard to spot the differences between the two (as somebody who has no background what so ever in mbti). I've read countless articles, and the one time I think, ooh, this ENTP thing matches me pretty well. And other times I think the INTP thing matches me. It's hard. Also thinking about what's the more dominant of Fi/Ne and Si/Te... It's hard :)

This is what I'm talking about here, you can read all of these articles and actually come out with nothing tangible at all, that's how you know they are full of shit. You will probably find it easier to figure out if you interrogate a Ti dom and an Ne dom, or find youtube examples of them and analyze their behavior. A good example of INTP would be Richard Dawkins, you can see fairly easily how he uses Ti, it is crystal clear when he does it. An Ne dom would be Richard Feynman, or maybe Steve Wozniak. The two are different in behavior, but they do have similarities.

&gt; Again, thanks for taking the time to read and trying to help me out &lt;3

No problem, it was just compulsive word vomit lmao.You know I'm right :P&gt; That's the struggle I have with mathematics as well. Cool, but what has it to do with real life? Why is this theorem useful? What is its place in the bigger picture? That's also why Linear Algebra is more appealing to me (theory is used in computer graphics to draw amazing things to your screen) than Analysis (wut...) It's just way more practical.

Do you prefer to learn the practical applications so that you can use it in a practical sense, or so that you can connect the theory together and have the potential for practical application? Sounds like more of the latter, fitting it into it's big picture... Like when I learn maths, I try to accumulate all of the connections between it, it's history, the application, the implications, the links to other theories. I struggled to stay interested in theoretical maths when I did it because I never made those connections, it's just like what you said, none of it had any connection to anything else, it's confined to it's purely theoretical laws and rules and designed to investigate a completely arbitrary hypothetical situation with seemingly no relation to anything other than itself.

INFP doesn't seem right to me, you seem more heady and analytical than the kind that is focused on their inner personal values. A good test would probably be to figure out what kind of morals you believe in and how you reason them, or investigate how you come to make decisions. Yeah, you'll just have to stew on it. I would deduce that you're one of the ENxP types, but maybe that might change with your understanding of yourself.In the case of Jon, I think there is confusion between Fi values and enneagram 1's motivation to be considered 'good', a fear of being corrupt, which is common for the TJ types. The way I see Jon is that he can't stomach being seen as evil, or defective, which is why he willingly runs out beyond the gate to fight alone, because he would not be able to face himself otherwise. Its why he tried so hard to rigidly uphold his oath. He is always doing what is most 'right', or what 'ought' to be done. ISFP is not a rule abiding type, you can see the difference with Potter and his Fi, Potter aligns himself with his own personal values, the rules do no matter to him, it's not about a personal sense of values, which is subtly different than the more Te/E1 like values of doing what is most right. imo, Jon is an ISTJ E1, and in every single way imaginable he is exactly like an ISTJ E1 that I grew up with.

And I'm glad you change Cersei to ESFJ, she is a lower level E2, factitious and prideful, common for the ESFJ type, completely unheard of for ENTJ.I change it the most. I think I just like to see how far the theory stretches before it breaks and gives way. There are so many uncertainties; How 'strong' is a tertiary/inferior function? Which functional description is the right one? What is function strength and how do you know when you've measured it objectively? What would it mean if you could not actually 'see' your dominant with your mind's eye, and everything you think you know is back to front? What if Kiersey was right in every way? What if I am different than a normal person of my type? What if I could find a way to prove that the entire theory is false and that I fit every type I try on? 

Sure, it's confusing and unstable, but I come to understand more by cycling through the types. I suspect I'm on my final lap, because I am oddly at peace with the current one, no theories tacked on, no 'aha!' moment, it was more of an ultimatum without as much internal conflict involved. And the enneagram type is hard to argue, feels more objective than MBTI, like there is evidence that nails it down and I can recognize it, even right now, it's like... 'oh hello!' Whereas MBTI type is like... 'hmm, where did you go buddy?' .... well, looks like I should go to a psychologist and make sure that I'm sane lolI agree, the Myer's Briggs Type indicator is rubbish. Jung's theory on cognitive functions has a standing, but it is somewhat ethereal, it's like a reflection in the pond that disappears when you touch the water. It's not really super useful, but from what I can't tell, it doesn't seem to be invalid. I have started steering away from it, because like they said there is not much you can really gleam from the theory, though it is quite fun to speculate over. I find you can do more with other theories, and psychologists find that as well.I had typed him ISTJ, but I don't really remember why. The main thing I recall was when he killed the dire-wolf in front of Bran. He knew it was unfair, but he did it because that is life. I think it is an E8 attitude, he seems a little similar to the Hound in some ways, but less jaded.

Just a showerthought; jaquen doesn't have a type. :}I don't think I have seen him using Ti or Fe, and he seems like a Delta type to me. Are you typing him from the book or the show?Yeah, you need a whole bunch of letters like mine to indicate true intellect :D

The scientific skepticism is what brought us to this age, to say that MBTI is true because it feels true without even being able to test it would be regressive. I'd guess that most people involved in MBTI are completely aware of this, but there will always be people that think with their feels XDHaha, I have also looked at NTJ types, but never touched. hm, that does throw a spanner into the works, I'll have to ponder on that lol.In one of the recent episodes too, Littlefinger said he has an image in his head of himself upon the iron throne, with Sanza at his side. It seemed to me very much like an indication of Ni.If you look at how EJArendee went down, he would have been just fine if the voices in his head were friendly.What makes you interested in government, lies and propaganda? Is it because it is a fun distraction to think about, or is it more serious? Do you think they are a threat to you? I can't really see E9 in this, it sounds more like you are interested in conflicts than someone who avoids it. 9 minimizes things that upset them. 

Are the visions something you would actually come to bring about, or are they just tantalizing ideas and plans? Do your plans change every few months, or have they been around for a lifetime?

Do you get obsessive over formulating conspiracy and analysis? 

When you play Civ, is it more serious, or do you frequently start a new campaign where you're going to do everything different this time around and see how it goes? Kind of like trolling? I've never played Civ, so forgive me if I have no idea what the game is actually like XD One thing that I notice about my own playing of strategy games and such, is that I have trouble sticking to the main mission, and typically a lot of time goofing about doing weird shit and seeing how far it can be taken, like I will build only one kind of unit and see how it goes, or see if I can get away with spending an entire game of LoL in the enemy jungle with Nunu. (I'm only a part time troll though, winning and mastery are very fun).

It might be worth looking deeply into how inferior Se manifests.

draw a picture :DI bet she's actually an extrovert lol.I think it's more of a system where you get let off with a warning depending on the nature and intention behind the offense.INFJs system of forgiveness.lmao! I would gold you if I could XD¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯For Ti-Fe, at the end of the day; nothing is sacred, everything must be broken down into it's constituent pieces and explored. For Fi-Te, the prioritized focus is more on individual personal value, what is felt personally to be right or wrong. 

On the surface the ExFP is Te like in nature and can come across as tough minded until they are pushed into showing their priority for Fi, and ExTP can be Fe like on the surface, appearing diplomatic and friendly until pushed into revealing a higher priority for Ti."According to experts"... lmao


I'm pretty sure that it's Te, far moreso than Ni that gets them there.

ESTJ is often seen at the top of the money making statistics as well, I wouldn't be surprised if they were higher than ENTJ in other statistics given the role that cooperation and stability plays in business. The last chart I saw they were even too.

Also, I think they could have grouped the chart in better ways that Kiersey's 4 groups.They may be on top here, it probably comes at a price. - According to my parents, somewhat social, loved daycare and playing with friends, was never trouble because I'd go off and occupy myself.
- Played shittones of games, grew up in a shop with an arcade and video rental, so I was playing streetfighter, mortal kombat, metal slug and watching 1990s everything. Come to think of it, all of the movies and games I ever watched and loved were violent, and the parts I loved the most were the freakiest, I remember them as fantastical voyages to another dimension. I get crazy nostalgia watching [Super Mario Bros (1993)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQy-eJALZI0), [Mortal Kombat (1995)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVoEhO8stu0#t=185) and Street Fighter (1994) with Van Damme.
- I liked dinosaurs *a lot*, I'd go into the backyard looking for fossils, bless Steven Spielberg for the divine creation of Jurassic Park and ET. I liked Gremlins and Jaws too. And Candyman was fascinating.
- At school, I didn't really care all that much about it, sometimes it was fun. I got pretty decent grades in everything because I wasn't a menace and I did my work. 
- I didn't like sports much, not bizarre enough to satisfy my interest. I liked learning about China and Egypt, but not much else.
- The only kids I would hang out with with were ones that shared the same imagination, there weren't that many. Most kids liked trucks, cars, tractors, firetrucks, army soldiers and sports while I ignored anything I considered mundane. The stuff I found interesting was like deep sea construction and [gigantic mining equipment](http://www.losapos.com/pics/06/openpit12.jpg) because I imagined they were doing crazy shit like drilling holes to the center of the earth, and building underwater buildings.
- I'd always get lost whenever we'd go out as a family because I'd start wandering off on my own looking at things.
- I lost just about every single thing I ever owned. I'd forget jumpers, shoes, rackets, yoyos, balls - absolutely anything that I had to actually carry with me.
- Wasn't really emotional, sulky when I didn't get what I had in mind, but no outbursts.

I realize now that I over the years I have come to take more interest in mundane things, I think it's because I approach them from a different angle, looking more carefully into the inner workings of everything I encounter.ENTP

I think it will be a great thing in the long term. The current repercussion is just backlash from the EU who fear an unravelling of the union. Negative effects of the EU on their economy were shown when Greece went under, if they had their own currency the would have had more options to manage it without needing huge bailouts. I also like that despite what all of the politicians wanted, the will of the people took precedence, it shows that they have a true democracy and not just white lie politics.

I saw all of the bullshit about how it was a bad idea on tv, but nobody seemed to be giving both sides of the story. I see the economy crashing as complete nonsense and I figure there has to be a political reason for it falling. So I had a quick investigation into it to find an answer that makes a lick of sense.I'm Jealous, all I found was supposedly part of a sheep's bone. I thought space was cool, but did not get enough exposure to it to love it like I do now. The only space movie I saw was Event Horizon lololol.ESFP

edit: The ISTP suggestion makes zero sense &gt;.&gt;

Ti dominant... when has she ever even used Ti? She always thinks impulsively, instinctively and on the fly, it's Se backed up by Fi, the decisions behind her actions stem from her internal values: 

- Killing the people who deserve it because they are 'bad'. 
- To become "no one" conflicted with her Fi. She could not forget who she is.
- She didn't kill Tywin because he showed her that he wasn't a scumbag, unlike everyone else she has killed. 
- Didn't kill the actor because it wasn't justifiable, lots of inner conflict as to whether it is right or wrong.

Every event in her storyline is made to tell you that she is an ESFP lol, from the very moment she threw Joffrey's sword into the lake and tried to hide the direwolf from the guards.Caffeine - makes me able to work/focus, but it's not necessarily the caffeine that does it, just the placebo.

Alcohol - It does nothing for me, I get a better buzz without it than with it.She's not reflective, doesn't really think before she acts, more in the moment and adventurous, not scared to get her hands dirty. I think tert Te would fit her better than inferior too. I could accept ISFP as well, hard to say since her Fi seems to be a pretty big feature. She also seems like a 7w8 (some suggest 8w7) enneagram wise, more common for ESFP.Worst of all, its infectious, and now I've caught it too. Okay, so get this. There are a few ways to define extroversion. In the common sense, it is exactly how you say - a spectrum that you can move along over time. It's a level of sensitivity to the environment. Many people who start out introverted as babies, balance out later in life, many extreme extroverted children quieten, some people fluctuate. With this definition, there is ambiversion and that is a category where 60% of people roughly fall. 

Jungian Extroversion is it's own concept, and is defined by your orientation towards the external world; do you focus on your interaction with the object, or do you focus on the interaction with your own thoughts and feelings towards the object? This is how the cognitive functions themselves are orientated. It is debatable whether preferences for these functions change over time though, I think Jung saw his own type as a continuum.

&gt; Let's not forget type theory was created by two women who had no knowledge on psychology.

Yes, the *type indicator* was created by people who wanted to make profit off of pop-psychology fads, that is why it was introduced to business - despite that being the last thing anyone who understands Jung's theory would wish to apply it to. I also do not think this theory is worth all that much; there is no objectivity within it, very little to base anything on other than anecdotal evidence and theory. *But*... if it wasn't fun to think about, I wouldn't be here.Jaime is ESTP.ENTP

I stare straight ahead, looking past my eyes, I typically have books in my ears, or things that I'm pondering on, both of which I see as images imposed over the top of reality. On the odd occasion, I'll stare at something that I have taken curiosity in, like monarch butterflies, the stars, plants I can identify.ENFP, ESFJ. Because they are sweet and goofy, ENFPs are on the same wavelength, ESFJs are just super cute. Both love to play. My bro is an ESFP dating an INFP, they are amazingly well suited, a lot of romanticising. They share some weaknesses though, but his Se helps balance it a little.Yeah, does seem like a Se type 3 of some sorts[Okarin!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5myhlkiumM)ENTP, I try to make tasks fun. I also record what I do into a speadsheet, and remind myself that success builds up over time. Typically if I start a timer, the work will follow. I allow myself to explore as well. I don't seem to respond to deadlines, I find it hard to panic about them, I'm just more efficient when I am enthused.Jack of all trades -&gt; Enneagram 7 (The enthusiast)

People are suggesting ExTP, which makes sense, but 7 also correlates to the ExFP types. I'm sure everyone knows of ESFPs who are very skilled with their hands, and there have certainly been ENFP authors who dabble in everything.

As far as I can tell, IxTPs tend to be more focused - it would be interesting to see whether this is always the case or not. Using myself as an example, all I have ever wanted to be is a polymath, I have a huge spreadsheet of different hobbies and skills that I pick up and record how much time I invest into them - cycling through all of the sciences and arts. I am yet to master any one of them, but it certainly helps that there are many connections between them.

edit: Most of the famous INTPs seem modest in their interests, usually with a dominant field that they invest into.

**INTPs:**

* Kant: Philosophy &amp; astronomy
* Dawkins: Biology &amp; Religion
* Friedman: Economics

**ENTPs:**

* Benjamin Franklin: "A renowned polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat." -wikipedia
* Feynman: Bongos, Lockpicking, Physics, Electronics, Art, Writing, Portuguese, Japanese, Spanish, Chemistry, Biology. He would also visit lectures on other topics at his university and pose them questions to gleam information from them.
* Von Neuman: Toys/gadgets, Mathematics, pretty much all of the sciences, developed computing.

There are some ENTPs who appear to specialize somewhat, like Heisenburg and maybe Bertrand Russel, but many of the ENTPs are almost excessively scattered in comparison. The only quizzical part is when you look online and /r/INTP users are saying that they have a million different hobbies...hah! You actually came to mind when I was thinking of Fe type expressions and emotes, same with peppermint. Do you feel like that kind of expression is looked down upon online?Yeah, I typically see the same. Most of those types are usually E4 or 5, both of which are negative in their own way. 5 being negative about the external world, having a feeling that it is oppressive or restrictive, 4s just notoriously swim in their melancholy. I'm not sure how it relates to I/E though, it could actually be that I/E types are the same, and that I/E is an expression of their respective enneagram type motivations. Seems like the only glaring exception to this is the online presence of ENFP E4s, which I am yet to find an example of irl - if that exists then I'm totally wrong XPWhat about things like irritation, impatience or anger? What takes higher priority, the expression, or the social atmosphere? Does politeness factor into it?&gt; That's not "backwards" though.

Yes, it's only 'backwards' relative to my original thought.

&gt; There is meaning in what exactly people say and how they say it, no matter how much people want to deny it. People who say there is no emotion in their words are either robots, they're lying, or they simply can't recognize it themselves. 

I think so too, there is emotional meaning in most of what we say. I think sometimes though, there is a difference between the emotions conjured by the words, and the actual feeling behind them - which is what I think EJ was actually trying to say, though maybe he didn't understand it himself.

Like in one of the current /r/mbti threads we talk about introverts being negative. There is obviously a bad feeling around being called negative, but it is intended to be neutral. I don't think there is a way to say it that is neutral. irl, it is easy to express neutrality, but there is no neutral word that takes the same meaning. Maybe over time, due to the prevalence of text, we'll actually find new words being created to fill those kinds of gaps.not since I was 8 years old...??Those enneagram types are withdrawing in nature, it comes down to the motivation.I know this is supposed to be about what you'd dislike, but ESFJ would be really fun imo, every single one I have met has an uncanny knack for sampling foods, and it seems sooooo enjoyable for them.&gt; I think it can come across as a lack of confidence, along with constant use of 'lol' and 'haha'.

Seems to me like it's a bit like cultural differences between gestures (like a smile in russia) because everyone probably has their own personal interpretation of these kind of things.Just compare her powergames to Olenna Tyrell. Olenna has a no bullshit 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' style, while Cersei revels in creating and manipulating emotional turmoil, she stabs them in the heart.Yeah, most of mathematics seems really appealing to Ti types: to take reality, create a model of it and bring it back into the real world basically defines the function.

Physics has usually had a lot of ENTPs but really they tend to be mathematicians who choose to apply their models to multiple different aspects of reality rather than build them into abstraction (makes sense for Ne dominance, no?). They don't really choose to be physicists, they're usually just playing with whatever is interesting.

Programming/comp sci has always been thought to be xSTP like too, and the people I have known to be into it are usually STPs.I recently swapped from Chem and Environmental science to Physics, Maths and Astrophysics. I'm actually thoroughly enjoying all three, I think I like them even more than I did Chem.Does Si represent Silicon?I SiI think you're confusing the name of this subreddit with the meaning. It is really just a personality hub for everything. What is the point in that kind of segregation? This community is not big enough to spread it thin.I had typed her ENTP as well.I play everything.Taken me longer, and I will never be convinced. I think the whole theory is a mess. I could say I am an INFJ and you would never prove otherwise.I like to talk about things and events, rather than people I steer well clear of emotional content or anything dark, but motivations and goals are awesome, I like to share things that I have learned that I feel have improved my outlook - though I usually only share these things with people I'm a little closer to. I typically like to share whatever it is that I find exciting, sometimes I will drop what I'm doing to find the nearest person to pester, I can't really contain myself, it annoys me when people are too busy/cranky to chat with me. If there's anything I look for in others, it's curiosity, ability to bounce off of topics, lightheartedness and propensity to be silly and imaginative. Ask for proof =&gt; There is none =&gt; Therefore you are whicheverone you think fits, or even neither of the two. Also, I think the difference between INTP and INFP are misunderstood, especially for guys. INFP guys are more INTP-like than you'd think, very quiet, intense and cerebral. Their quirks are different however, INFP is usually sharper, somewhat aristocratic and passionate, the INTPs are more of an oddity, they have a weird mix of caring but not caring, feeling but unfeeling, they usually have a taste for dispassionate criticism.And what's your type?

* Do you typically pay attention to how you're feeling, and how other people are feeling, the emotions on their face and in their gestures?

* Do you express the feelings that you have through your body language? Do you hide them? Is it 'natural' to you, or learned?

---

I find that I have only ever known how to express a handful of emotions, typically either neutral, serious (fake - people expect me to be serious, I am never actually serious :3), confident (probably looks like arrogance...) or child-like enthusiasm/cheekiness. I don't think any of these come across as strongly as they could. When socializing, I generally express the last two. I never placed much importance on emotion or expression at all (I focus on the content of my words) and it's only now that I realize how powerful and dynamic it can actually be - it has suddenly captured my full interest and I'm suddenly seeing interactions from a completely different (almost magical) perspective - it helps to look at charts like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg), which is something I have seen /r/INFP reference before.

I admittedly realized this while watching [Huni's expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4lGh3uVeqM#t=103) and thinking about cultural differences and similarities between east and west. Not too long ago, he could barely speak English, he would go on stage for interviews and he wouldn't understand a single question, yet he has always been huni, you could not mistake it. I also noted this with respect to the Japanese language. I have been reading *Through the looking glass*, and it explains that a lot Japanese communication is not explicitly expressed. The language has the tools to say exactly what you mean outright, but the culture has historically refrained from using them, and instead they often express themselves vaguely and focus on reading into people's expressions and context. For example, they wont outright say *no*, they agree and expect you to read into the way they say it. Clearly however, this is a one size fits all description of the culture, and from what I can tell, this generation is not equivalent to the last - but the idea here seems important to me.

I think it's fairly obvious that the internet/text has a large influence on this. It could also explain why we don't find all that many Fe dominant types here, if such expression is indeed concretely linked to the function. Emotes probably indicate quite a lot too of course. When I first started writing on forums, I was told to stop using so many emotes - though I think what people meant is that you shouldn't use emotes online that you do actually not use irl. So another question I think would be appropriate to ask is whether your emotes online line up with reality or not - in my case, they don't, I should be using more than I am! I feel like they are typically frowned upon, but I think it's just that half of the internet is autistic.

Perhaps I'm missing something here. On the internet, a lot of us seem to do things backwards and read emotions into words, and we learn to write our words with respect to their emotional association. I'd actually suspect this has to do with Fi-Te vs Ti-Fe styles of communication - or it could be T vs F in general. One of the stories that EJArendee (rip) typically shared was his distaste for Fi dominant types, who read emotion into the words he uses, when he all he really ever means is strictly their logical definition. Incidentally he did seem like the kind of person you could read - as Michael Pierce was saying in one of his videos, he was an entertainer of sorts.

I totally didn't really intend to get this sidetracked &gt;.&gt;I have music on most of the time, but preferably without lyrics, I do not like it when I notice the sound of silence and it seems to help most when I'm fidgety and restless. If what I'm doing is engaging enough (like challenging problem solving) I'll turn the music off.
Same. I always am doing one, if not two things...You've been going in depth on these responses! I've been looking at them all the way from the top.  I'm about to hopefully date a female INFP....So that's kinda coolExactly! (The joke part) I can make jokes for everything!
Jokes make everyone happy, and then it's like,

 uh... "how do you deal with confrontation" = I make a joke. 
"how do you deal with conversation = I make a joke.
"How do you deal with stress" = I make a joke.

I make jokes.. Can I live!?I just find Reddit topics while I'm at work.. Who actually sits for 7 hours straight?Just my 6 cents.. I seem to have a lot of ENFP friends. well, 3... but these are people that are down to do whatever. I seem to enjoy Long term dating INFx's. But short term is Exxx, cause I really don't care. (At least didn't used to care) I live near UVA.... time for a visit...Means the opinion is worth more. This thread makes me Feel again.
Well, It adds to the small amount of feelings I've recently found.HeartBreaking - You hurt me beyond repair. That's something I can't risk again. 

HeartWarming - My Close friend, I'm not really sure what he is.
"You've taught me a lot and you don't even realize it. There are still things I haven't told you about."
I was just thinking about how they correlate. But I guess I'll look into it more. I mean, why not?
&gt; Knowing that you are INTP or INFP doesnt matter unless you understand what it means.

This is insightful, I'll take that and tell that to my friends when it comers to talking about MBTI...Very informative as an ENTP that bumps heads with xSFx types. Thanks! And much kudos.25/yo Chinese American Born, went to school @ UCI for some data for some context. Here's the data:

1. ENTP who has INTP roommate. One of best friends and sounding boards, 3 years and counting &lt;3

2. ISTJ became best friend after living together 3.5 years &lt;3

3. ISFP did allright, cleaned together but he did more. He's one of my longest standing friends since 7th grade, and we appreciate each other even though we live in 10 minutes away from each other.

4. Currently suspect immature ISFx type that butt heads with all existing roommates. Clashed but now finally after 4+ years we're no bullshit since we've gotten over our egos realizing we're just being immature and bratty. I think he has to be an ISFJ... well. I don't know the difference. ISFx types are least understood in my book.


5. INTJ best friend was a classic hermit. He did his thing and kept to himself even things that annoyed him, good friend.as an ENTP I'm pretty fortunate to think my Fe is pretty good at keeping me from being a typical a-hole. I'm very agreeable but I have to share my thoughts as well.

I'm 25. Background. Socially inept in HS. Slight change senior year. Still awkward in college, got a lot better senior year, able to talk to anyone 2.5 years out of college. Now whenever I address problems, I always factor in the human element and I think I'm pretty sensibly sensitive as an ENTP for where I'm at my age.

Can probe me for more details but I'd say... yeah 23-25+?&gt; ISFJ has left a few passive-aggressive post-it notes when one of us forgot to buy toilet paper/washing-up liquid because "I was the one who bought it last time"

1. Typical ISFJ wanting to be appreciated, getting upset when not. Not meant with malice. ENTP here, that should be enough to prove that statement :)


2. I found it amusing that the ESFP was had her stuff strewn around the house. Fits the "stereotype" #mbtihumor


3. ISFJ's utterly don't click with me ... I'm curious if that's a trend with other NT types and ISFJ's. 


4. Interesting! Thanks for sharing.
I just started at university, and on one of our first days, she just catched my eye like nobody ever did. Even among all those traditionally beautiful girls, the girl with short hair and brown eyes somehow managed to stand out. 

We had a few talks within the first week, and I never felt so connected to a person so fast, our second conversation lasted for 2 hours without it ever going into a "filler" topic. We shared so many laughs that day, that I wouldn't be surprised if we had started dancing in the middle of a university hallway!

I will invite her out next monday. She made the choice of location easy, as she hinted toward something she might want to try.All NT's are pretty closely related, so the results does make sense :)I know it is only anecdotal evidence, but I know 3 INTP's and 2 ENTP's very well, and I am personally also an ENTP. What strikes me is, that the people I know of the respective types possess 2 vastly different types of nihilism. Let me explain.
2 of the INTP's I know are philosophical pessimists, and when they combine that philosophy (that they believe hardships in life outweigh the good or luxuries) with nihilism, they find life to be bitter. The 3rd INTP I know, is definitely an absurdist. 

But us ENTP's... We just roll with the punches, and let the good times roll!/u/mirrorconspiracies perfectly describes Ne and Ti. In recent years, I've begun to develop Fe, ENTP's 3rd function. This has helped me a lot in strengthening my relationships with people, and being able to start new ones. I think it started when I developed a better sense of self-awareness, where I became aware of the times I might come across as a bit crazy or kind of an asshole, hah!

But damn, I don't think I will ever come in touch with Si. Now on to read Feynman's physics lectures, even though I study economics. Fe is a journey, make it your adventure! It will be awesome, trust me. Also, I think Si may just stay hidden, staying idly by until I by accident have f'ed up big time because of my lack of structure, then it will maybe save me from myself, haha. I just hope it will stay in my shadow :PMy closest friend is also an ENTP, we naturally became friends because of our way of thinking and our interests. All the ideas coming up in our conversations are just marvelous. Never met any other person with such an insatiable hunger for knowledge.

There is also an INTP, although we are not close anymore due to him travelling far away for educational purposes, we've gone through a lot of rough patches together. Lots of philosophical discussions came out of it, and also conflicts, but of the constructive kind. Exactly. I can see how people come up with INTJ, because a lot of people seem to neglect the coginitive functions, either out of ignorance or impatience. But looking at House's eccentric demeanor, he is the archetypical genius ENTP. From his goofing around in the office, over his interactions with Wilson, to his sharpwitted sarcasm, he almost fills the spectrum of ENTP-ness. Ne driven by a huge bank of information, will create such eccentricity, to great entertainment for the external audiences, but not so much to his immediate audience... Can you please explain to me why you think BBC's Sherlock is an INTJ? I neither agree nor disagree with you, I am just curious. This character is the first I have watched for a long time (watched the BBC series twice), but where I still struggle with typing the character, always being able to attribute singular behavioural aspects to both ENTP and INTJ. Truly a complex character they have made, his erratic behaviour not rendering it particularly easy either.22, INFJ. I tend to quickly fall for (infatuation) with ENXP's, but it always decayed, rather than turn into love.Almost alarming how it confirms my belief that I write like an introvert. I typically test as an ENFP or sometimes ENTP, but I know from asking myself from deep inside that I am an ENFP. I use writing as a form of introspection, so it is not often that I do it, and therefore it reflects my introverted side. 

INFP when I input my work of fiction, which is characterized by deep values hidden beneath an abstract veil. This type of writing is quite natural to me.

INTJ when I input my reports from university, which does not surprise me. I am very analytical when it comes to people's behaviour. However, it takes me quite some time to write like this.

Both are androgynous, almost perfectly so. I try to beautify my texts, whether they are for art or for work. Usually my choice of words gets a comment from teachers, both for good and (not so) bad. Haha, tell me about it! I got friendzoned twice out of nowhere by people I simply thought of as "friends to hang out with". I can't even imagine how confused I must have looked.Dirk Gently from Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency as ENFP. I've seen people type him as ENFP, but no way. He is very empathetic, and none of his actions are rooted in pure reason. 
Furthermore, he is quite the enthusiast with just about anything, while ENTP's have a hard find enthusing beyond intellectual or artistic purposes.I am neither scared by anyone, nor do I dislike anyone, I just only get energized by socializing, and it is a specific brand of socializing. I want to get to know people on a personal level, enthuse about what makes them tick, explore ideas, and share knowledge. 

That is why it was difficult to find out that I am, in fact, an extrovert; I prefer solitude to superficial conversation, but I prefer deep conversations to any other social scenario (or lack thereof). 

Another layer of complexity stems from the fact that I have to spend time studying a lot, to be able to fuel novel conversations, and be able to go deep on most topics. It may seem like I spend a lot of time alone, and maybe I do, but the end-goal is to have a deep connection with someone, or some.ENFP: Really depends, can be either as stated, or like the ESTP description. 

Can confirm the INFJ, ESFJ, ENTJ and ISTJ, as some of my closest friends are of those types.

To elaborate, my INFJ friend kicked me out of her house by asking if I wanted a ride home.

The ENTJ usually rants about everything that exists while not sleep-deprived; rants about all sorts of things that doesn't exist when sleep-deprived.

ESFJ, first time she could actually focus for 15 minutes without sparking a conversation while studying for exams. Still super sweet though. 

ISTJ, only time I heard him sound like an ENTJ.I would normally agree, but most people are forgetting that feeling as a function has no correlation with emotion. Both thinking and feeling are decision making functions, and they essentially only differ in terms of impartiality, directness (being blunt) and whether or not they use formal logics in their arguments. 

I'd say feeling is more like water or air, as feeling is about considering others, and preserving harmony.
INFP is probably the most difficult for me. I just CANNOT connect with the idealism and the feeling. It frustrates me to no end. Maybe because I've had experiences with unhealthy INFP's. But to me it's like, they have an introversion to not tell you about their idealism and expectation, but the feeling to make them hurt when somehow you don't live up to that ideal. And then the lack of planning capacity to even make that ideal a reality. 

But that was one bad INFP probably. But he was AWFUL. Like, how do you even function? Expect, but do not plan for your ideal situation, then do nothing to achieve it and tell no one that you expect something from them? Just...what...?.??


I betcha not all INFP's are like that. I bet y'all are probably pretty great. You just had like, a bad candidate. 

I am in love with ISFJ's, though, even if they're my opposite. We get on so well it's not even funny. You guys are beautiful, you little lurking wallflowers. I feel like that's less type related and more just having a dick for a roommate

Unless you're being hypothetical. Then that person is still a dick, probably&gt;  I might just decide fuck you, if you want it done your way, you're doing most of the work.

Coming from the perspective of someone(the ENTP) that does that, it's not always having it done 'my way'. I'm 110% open to input, but if nothing is said, then I can't do much for you. I'll step into projects taking lead because I usually don't see anyone else wanting to step up and direct. And that's all it is - everyone has equal right to their ideas and what they want to do. But how I process things so that I know what I need to do is by getting everyone and everything organized in my head. There's no rudeness intended, and that 'fuck you' attitude throws everything off, because I legit do not know what's wrong if I'm not told "hey, chill". In that way, without communication, it's kind of doomed to fail. Oh, micromanaging is different. There's a big difference between giving someone a function and trusting them with it and then giving someone a function then telling them how to do every little step of a job that you gave THEM to do. Yeah, then like, step the fuck off. I hate that too, that is awful. I'm not that big a planner, but my head needs to know what's going on to get the big picture in order to do my work. Verbal-Linguistic Intelligence...probably just what you'd expect for a pretty straight-line ENTP. I feel like I don't really 'register' insults really? I mean, direct, 'screw you' or 'you're stupid' or anything like that. My brain kind of goes "Okay, and...?"
  
If I am offended by anything, it's usually not an insult or meant as such, I more take it as a challenge, as in "Oh, really, you think you're going to do that in MY arena? Okay, game on."I'll second the ENTP part, I usually really just don't hear you. 1. Tony Stark (really cliche, I know. But I can relate hard.)
2. King Schultz (Django) - Relate to his general 'fuck it' attitude, but also his character flaws. 
3. Hades (Hercules) - Me when I'm having a shit time/in a bad mood.
Haha, too analytical?How many semesters have you been in college?As far as Ne and N preference go, I have always had the weird ability to tie a conversation together without trying. The conversation meanders through topic after topic and as the end nears, I unify all the topics by identifying some theme that runs through every single one - I think this is an Ne thing. As far as pacing goes, I've actually been working to break my sentences apart lately toward making them more linear.

As far as concepts and principles go, I work in research and definitely prefer them. A friend once told me I'm the most intellectual person he's ever met in person. I'd imagine that was hyperbole and speaks mostly to my tendency to endlessly, and probably exhaustingly, poke holes in, or analyze everything I hear.

For example...
Friend: "I'm so tired."
Me: "I've been thinking a lot about that lately. I've been wondering how much of getting tired as we get older is part of the aging process, versus how much of it is succumbing to tiredness because it seems more acceptable to be tired."You're so sweet! Thanks for your time and kind words. I suppose what's up next is I find something else to obsess over. ;)So spot on. Holy crap. I've thought exactly the same thing.In my experience...

Fe: everything said about this one is true. Emotionally expressive. Sometimes calculatingly so. They try to bring you onto their feeling wavelength, and you feel good. Afterwards you feel strange, like you've been duped. 

Se: expressive, but with a sharpness. 

Te: pointed or punctuated. 

Ne: expressive, though not emotionally so. Gets more expressive and excited, and talks faster as connections are made. Less piercing than Se. Less good at ensuring it's heard properly.

That's all for now.ENTP here. The Ti user does well to learn when accuracy is essential versus luxurious, and to quiet himself in the latter case. But he need not be taken so seriously.

It should also be noted that Ti doms often *like* being wrong. They may formulate an argument afterward to continue a debate, but they are likely to enjoy having to respect a different point of view and regroup.My boss is an ENFJ and I've left so many meetings with her thinking, "That was a nice meeting. Why does something feel wrong that I can't place?" And I certainly can't say that's all ENFJs; I also know a couple that are wonderfully kind, authentic, introspective folks whom I respect considerably. But I do think there's that potential to use dom Fe for a nefarious, personal agenda.I agree with ISTJ. I'd say it's evident that Sheldon is governed by introverted sensing, as he is dominated by a desire for the comfort of the familiar. For example, he has a specific living room seat that he uses exclusively. He also has great respect for conventional societal standards, such as those found in a university, around the superiority of certain fields and types of degree. His directive, orderly approach to problem solving supports Te. Third position Fi could be supported by Sheldon's apparent lack of emotion, except as it pertains to his mother. Finally, Sheldon Land and imaginative, nerdy interests like comic books and Star Wars could represent an outlet for inferior Ne.This is all well said. I would just add to it by saying the theory is clearly not hard fast or precise and has room for refinement. In this case as in most in life there is wisdom in an open mind. It is just important to be clear about that - I hope you are. People come into this with varyious levels of certainty, implying various levels of readiness to critical think when told unabashedly one point of view.Seriously. INFJs love INFPs. You have been drive by untyped. I think s/he is a sociopath.drive by sociopathedOne thing that I think happens is creating a Subreddit based on a personality type implicitly establishes norms that are consistent with that type. As a result community members exaggerate or emphasize those traits to fit in and probably have very non-INFP aspects of their life outside of Reddit.The ant thing made me think ENFP because you were so sensitive to the ants' pain, which sounds like a potentially introverted feeling thing, but that could also be an INFJ thing, I'm not sure. In fact, it does seem like INFJ could fit well. But I do have a couple clarifying questions if you're interested in playing.

1. I'd like to hear about how you take in information. Do you most often... 
a) perceive individual objects in the environment which bring about associations with your past knowledge or experiences, and continually seek novel ideas or experiences,
b) get overall, big picture impressions and compare those to prior impressions, 
c) perceive objects themselves including their physical properties such as appearance, and continually seek novel physical stimuli to perceive,
d) or pay attention to the way your own body feels, comparing current sensations to past ones?

2. I'd like to hear about how you make decisions. Do you most commonly...
a) take into account who's in the room and whether they are in harmony ("the correct decision is the one that makes everyone feel comfortable, warm, and happy"),
b) consider a personal set of values developed from your own experience and make decisions based on how you would feel in a given situation ("the correct decision is what's right, and it doesn't matter how it makes other people feel"),
c) analyze external data objectively and impose order on your environment ("the correct decision yields the most efficient path to a goal, as supported by objective data, such as comes from a research study or an expert"),
d) establish what is true and logically consistent ("the correct decision is one that is rooted in truth as assessed by personally defined logical consistency")?

Feel free to expand on your answers! The long-form instruments don't work well, so I shouldn't suppose my two questions will fare any better. Question, what kind of bear is best?I agree about the sharing emotions things too. Given the concern of extroverted feeling with interpersonal harmony, Fe users may just as well conceal their feelings as share them. Also, ENFPs are introverted among extroverts, and times of isolated introspection are common among this type. I agree with you: everything suggests ENFP except introverted intuition. Can you talk about your experiences with both Ni and Ne? To me, the long list of possibilities you considered already looks like Ne, so I'd be curious about your relationship to both. Do you use Ne and Ni often? Does it stress or tire you out to use one or the other? Do you feel like you *live* in one?

For example, as an ENTP, the natural state of my mind is to be entertaining many possibilities, going from thought to thought and topic to topic without staying on any one for very long. Introverted thinking enters here and there to ask and analyze if something is true. I'll go with that for a little bit, but I don't always follow these analyses to completion. Before long I'd like to be thinking about something new. Extroverted feeling, my third function, is a switch I can turn on as needed, and it's intriguing, but it's not a preferred state for me. Finally, introverted sensing is my downfall. I hate routine things. I get sick and it takes me hours to figure it out because I don't understand how sick or not sick is supposed to feel. Do you think you can put your functions into boxes like these ones?

First function: There's no switch; this is always on.
Second function: This is switched on frequently, and it's useful and enjoyable, but is not necessarily used for terribly long.
Third function: This can also be turned on and is maybe intriguing because it's different and new, but is used even less often, and is not a preferred state.
Fourth function: This is the switch you almost never flip on, because you strongly dislike the involved activities, but really should use it more. Because you don't, it represents all of your downfalls.How about taking a stab at answering these questions?

Most Universally Unlikeable: ESTJ

Most Universally Misunderstood: Probably very many types, but I'll just say ENXP, as I think dom Ne is a confusing thing to others.

Most Universally Socially Unaware: This is a tough one as I think it varies fairly independently of type and tends to have a couple different meanings. From my experience, if we define this as being oblivious to other people's motivations and reactions, I would have to say ESFP. The one I know well is very likable and fits into many groups well, but pays no attention to other people's reactions, and really can't begin to guess their motivations.

Most Universally Funny: ENTP

Most Universally Serious: IXTJ

Most Universally Focused: IXTJ

Most Universally Unfocused: ENFPYou make great points, and I think you have to remember a couple things. First, the functions are squishy to begin with. While we might prefer thinking of functions as discrete entities whose use is mutually exclusive, I presume they are, more realistically, all active to some degree. 

Regarding your comment about finding examples of each function, I think it's a good point to acknowledge how much we do engage in all of the functions. However, I think calling these examples metaphors for the functions isn't quite right. I would say they are loosely observable symptoms of invisible theorized processes. If we take the theory as true, these behaviors are our supporting data.

I would reiterate that the theory is squishy (as many are), but once you get into it many real world observations appear very intriguingly consistent with Jung's framework. I think it works best to identify your axes between Ne/Si vs. Ni/Se as well as Fi/Te vs. Ti/Fe. Once you've done that, you have your four functions and just need to put them in order. For me it was easiest to identify my first and last, as the first is kind of a default mental function and the last tends to be your downfall.Oh, oops, Reddit on the phone is hard. :) 

If you watch Michael Pierce's ENTP video he gives an awesome description of Ne/Si vs. Ni/Se. If you're struggling that could be an indication of strong Ne. I think Ne users may particularly struggle with typing because we so automatically generate alternate explanations. So, we think our type is one way, briefly feel content, and then automatically produce evidence to the contrary. The Ni-doms I know are not like that. If they suggest a possibility, there's often one, and it's often considered correct. In fact, I think that's one reason I've worked well with my boss, who is an Ni-aux. She sends me a basic plan, and I refine it, because I see the myriad ways it could go wrong. She's great at saying, "This project needs to do this." I tend to identify all the ways people will screw it up and preempt those errors.Hey! I love all the work you have done here and wanted to add my own two cents. I should begin with the disclaimer that I have read a little bit of Jung but not all the subsequent theories in depth; I've just heard ramblings and will comment on those.

First I would start by saying there are a number of tools like MBTI/Jungian types which have a little bit of utility in and out of work and have at least some validity. See below: 

1. Tools like MBTI are helpful ways to match a correct behavior to activities. For example, going to have a brainstorming meeting? Cognitive functions give a useful framework for communicating the type of participation you'd like. (There are better ones for this type of use, but go with me. Or don't. :) ) You can tell participants this is going to be an Ne-heavy meeting, and because it's brainstorming, we should avoid Ti/Te critical thinking for now. 

2. When there are differences and disagreements, MBTI gives you context. If you're a dom-Fe user and usually are very warm in temperament, but you encounter someone using cold reasoning, and doing so a little brashly, you can reason that this isn't a sign of disrespect coming from the other person. It's Te. Attention is thereby called to the notion that there isn't a correct way of being; there are many ways of being.

3. I think differences such as this one are real. It's very evident that some people value warmth and welcoming highly, others value these things too but don't prefer to be the ones carrying them out, and others still find this all a waste of time. However well the function theories work, function *preferences* are observable, if a bit squishy.

Segue into problems with function theories, imo, because they is real (feel free to rebud if I've missed something):

1. *The ordering of the function preferences*: Unless there are theoretical explanations out there I have not attended to, it seems to me totally arbitrary that functions need to alternate by attitude. For example, you can't have an ENTP who is Ne-Fe-Ti-Si. This would be out of balance and represents some kind of loop. But what's the theoretical explanation or evidence that we do or should have any kind of balance? Consistency seems to be at the root of it, but I'm not sure I'm sold on consistency as a rationale for this.

2. *Loops*: That, of course, brings me to the dreaded topic of the loop. The reality is that you *can* find people who seem to prefer an ordering like Ne-Fe-Ti-Si, and the theory should meet its doom here, but thank goodness for the concept of the loop, the theory lives on. For if you're in Ne-Fe-Ti-Si, we say you're in a loop. You're out of balance. The problem here is that in this move the theory defies the principle of falsifiability. If the theory suggests 16 cognitive function preference orders, Ne-Fe-Ti-Si is a seventeenth, and disconfirms the theory. However, the loop, more like loophole, allows functions theory to circumvent disconfirmation. "You did see that function order, but that person was unhealthy and out of balance. If he was true to himself, he'd be Ne-Ti-Fe-Si." Thus no hypothetical evidence could disprove the theory, and it is not falsifiable. And what's the problem with that? It means you can say whatever you want is true, and as long as you install a loophole, your assertion can still be considered legitimate theory. 

3. *Jungian language*: I agree with OP in that Jung wrote in beautiful, idiosyncratic abstractions which only he himself could likely interpret with much accuracy. (And I would wager there were passages even he later found unintelligible.) If Jung prioritized contributions to legitimate theory over self-indulgent, cryptic yammering, it would be key to use precise, operationalized language.

*Do functions exist?*: Perhaps these are best thought of as descriptive classifications rather than underlying processes which operate in a given preference order. Like I said before, it is clear to me through observation that many of the functions exist. I think the theory is at its finest when used as a tool to classify these observations, but it really seems to find trouble when we apply preference orders too rigidly to any person. That's when we have to start conjuring loophole explanations like loops and "Ne can mimic Fe". I love all your work on this. I can see you're putting a ton of thought into it, and good thought. I really, really like the way you're thinking through this, but I do wish for a way to preserve the cognitive functions. 

That's not to say the associated theory is devoid of issues. On the contrary, the discussion in your prior post helped me to understand clearly what I see as the two basic problems of functions theory. First, as you point out, the functions totally lack concrete definitions. And if we honor the work of one person's observations too highly, we don't take into account that person's own subjectivity. Second, the idea that there are only sixteen orders seems to bring the theory to oblivion pretty quickly. As another user pointed out, if we observe Se and Fe, ESTP seems like a good bet, but an arbitrary choice, nay an inaccurate one, if Fe seems more prominent than Ti.

But before dispensing with the functions altogether--because I do think they are interesting, and more interesting than the big 5--maybe they need to modified. Given one last chance. I'd suggest:

1. Concretize them and operationalize their definitions. Are they thoughts? Where do they live? Focus on the empirical. If there is a way to observe a function systematically, cool. If not, functions probably have to go.

2. Allow flexibility that goes beyond the 16 types. Indeed we need to be skeptical of our ability to perceive and understand the world objectively. However, this approach shouldn't lessen our critique of abstract theories that don't hold up to empirical evidence. The alternative would be taking any random person's abstract theories at face value. We could take Tolkien's Lord of the Rings at face value just as well as Jungian theory, but we don't because while we have not observed wizards in action, many of us have witnessed what we believe to be extraverted thinking, for example. Therefore, empiricism is why you don't reject Jung outright. In the same vein, when the theory falls apart as we try squeezing people into function order boxes that don't quite fit, that's a good juncture to part ways with that aspect of the framework.&gt; The other thing I would say is that type theory, at least as conceived by Jungians, is subjective. Jung used Ti and he created a Ti theory.

The thing I don't understand about this is, Jung clearly used empirical observations. He worked with patients and derived typology theory on the basis of observing them. Sure, his work represents a "subjective Ti theory" that is specific to him, but it also did not come out of thin air, which is why it interests us at all. That said, why would we suppress our own Ti and take his at face value, given that he did not even do that? When we find aspects of the theory that don't quite seem to fit with reality, why would we honor unsupported abstractions rather than attempt revision toward a closer depiction of truth? (I'm not arguing denounce the functions, but I would certainly rethink the categories.)Ok, then I'm with you.I think what you experienced could be Ti-Ne.I would say I see blurs like others have said. If the character is a child I see a short blur. If it's a tree I see a tall, brown blur. I'm too lazy to put the details of the character's appearance together in my head, and probably check out a little while they're discussed. Though sometimes I am a tool and become the insight patrol, waiting impatiently for someone to say something significant. "Bah, that's not insightful. Not that either. Bah! Oooooo. I see what you did there, Treebeard."I agree with the other respondent here! Not having Te implies that planning and organizing may not be a preference. Unfortunately all that means is you have to do something you dislike when it's called for. I don't like it either, but I think the key is simply making time for it. Set aside a given time, possibly each morning, to think through your to do list and prioritize. I bet you can already do that well enough but just need to dedicate yourself to it consistently.I don't know about most talkative, but I can tell you Ne-doms can be extremely chatty. Put two of them in a room together and what you have is a situation where no one is capable of ending a conversation. Unless one finds the other boring.I love that you did this.Yep! I think other types are more outgoing than ENTPs and maybe more likely to be in conversation, but if we are in conversation, we tend to have a million things to say. For realskies. ENTP here!

* People who find a ton of random things insulting

* People who let emotional sensitivities get in the way of conversations about what's truthful, and what's the best approach, or people who won't entertain a given possibility because they simply don't like it

* People who say they're entitled to their opinion when you disagree with them

* People who are overly sassy, aggressive, and domineering (When they try to lure me into intense confrontation the friendship often ends. I just don't deal with this stuff.)

* This one is hard to describe without a little bit of a scenario. A person makes an argument that seems totally idiotic to me. I feel like I can't find a way to rebut without saying something that will be perceived as an attack on their identity. I am quiet, either resigned to silence or still puzzling over how to state my case without causing some grave offense, and the person smugly responds about how they've won the argument. That person is a person who irritates me.my dreamsShit should always be discounted.I think ENTPs would be a great candidate for mimicry and shape shifting!Thank you. That's all I needed."Why would there be a reason?" seems like a hypocritical question.Well, that was lovely.Your logic defies itself. You are wonderful.I always say there's an inner dialogue rather than monologue which I listen to. So, there must be three people total because I end up having to decide which person inside my head I agree with; I must constitute a third person. Basically, one person typically says something outlandish, exaggerates, uses hyperbole. He might say, "This is the best lasagna I've ever had." The second person corrects him: "No, you've had at least three lasagnas that are better than this." The third person, the decision maker who communicates with the world, who is me, though they all must be me, mediates: "Actually it's probably only two lasagnas that have been better than this. There's no denying this is a standout." But sometimes the decision maker is distracted because he's looking around at his surroundings, though not paying attention to anything in particular. Thus the outlandish person and the correcting person often just bicker at length without structure, jumping from topic to topic.ESFP for realskies maybe. 

My ex-boyfriend was ESFP, and he once told me (only about 10% in jest) he wished there would be parades about him. It was cute and real.What am I good at if not complaining?Yep! Entitled is a weird word, but I'll accept that everyone can have an opinion. That allowance does not, however, grant that every opinion you take has a degree of rightness. Thus if I tell you your opinion is wrong, I am not taking a right away from you; you're simply allowed to hold an opinion that is wrong, just as I am allowed to hold an opinion that your opinion is wrong.Mom is INFP, and Dad ISFJ I think.  I'm an ENTP and naturally connect with my mom better because she appreciates extraverted intuition. My dad is funny because he's very fake nice. He will say something nice to my face and his actually opinion to my mother later.  Say if I cooked something, he'll tell me he really liked the food. The next day he'll tell my mom he didn't think it was good. The next day my mom will tell me what he said and we'll both have a little chuckle.Thank you for your answer. Very interesting. Could you describe your morals a little? And what's the connection between the morals and being hurt? Totally understand if that's too personal.I will have to take you up on that, thank you.Really fascinating and informative explanation. Thank you.I especially like the points in your last paragraph. I will say with NFs and reading people, one thing I've observed is confirmation bias. I have one INFJ friend who remembers very well the instances where his intuitions have been correct, but pays no attention to the countless times he's mapped motivations onto others that have no connection to their experience but actually reflect his own insecurities.Thank you. I was particularly looking for the Fi inner monologue, so this was interesting to read.Very interesting. I'm sitting in the lobby of my work building right now, and it's interesting to think of the people passing through having secret pain. I'm sure many do.This is great. Thanks.I think this is well said. It's human nature to want to have a niche thing you can do particularly well, and it makes sense that someone's chosen niche may accord with their function preferences. All people have SSS.Ooh, the citation typo thing is real. I don't know how many times I've argued with my INTP friend and made some irrelevant factual mistake--I can't remember facts; I am so tired!--and he's denounced my whole argument on that basis. Then I change the subject because explaining why my factual mistake is irrelevant to my argument seems too tedious. Then he claims victory. Then I eat a cookie, hopefully.Separate from typology, I'm with you about being bothered by the "I'm so alternative" mentality. I can think of at least two ways this is hypocritical. 

1. It often involves rejecting the mainstream to join a different stream.

2. The entire concept of mainstream versus alternative fails to acknowledge the individuality of everybody involved except the person opting into the latter group.I'm with you, I think Ne can be an active agent in a lot of dark spirals in the ENTP's mind. Ne may imagine not what will happen, but myriad ways things can go wrong, and then live in those possibilities, as if they were real. And I too have dealt with anxiety.I don't think Ne is particularly associated with any given mood; it can be a very happy or sad function depending on the state of mind. In fact, I could see the Ne-dom being more inclined toward anxiety or depression as a result of feeling a little bit like a weirdo. Given this circumstance, Ne doesn't make the user happier; rather, given an unhappy or anxious state of mind, Ne conjures myriad ways the apocalypse could happen, and then forces the user to live in all of them. First, I'm srs, I got distracted by other posts; I should have put my comment by those. Second, I like and agree with your posts and I think I operate pretty similarly.I love this guy. That's the dream.Easygoing and approachable. People on the bus take one look at me and think, "This is the guy I'm gonna tell my shit to." Major life struggles. Book ideas. I have a concussion and was wrongfully accused of a felony. Here's a list of suburbs surrounding this city. This should be good. 

I'm ENTP, and I think Trump can largely be explained by cognitive dissonance theory. He's a guy who's got a view of himself that he wants to maintain, and he's going to reject any source of evidence that appears contrary to that view. That is, until the source provides different, more appealing info; then suddenly it's a winner. I think most people work a little bit like this--granting  desires governance over perceptions--but Trump seems such an extreme case.I may want to complicate this a little: I think it depends on how you define small talk. If you're thinking of asking and telling about what you did last weekend, I think a lot of people find that boring. However, even at that, I think some people derive more satisfaction from showing interest in this than others. If you're thinking of small talk as more of surface level topics like favorite restaurants, movies, countries, etc., I think there are some real differences in how much people enjoy this. I've observed that some people can do this for quite awhile without tiring, and others find it pretty boring.That's very interesting! A cool perspective on two fairly different types.*"Basically..."*
This started off as joke inside my head which I borrowed from some show or something. Eventually I forgot the source of it but started saying it out loud. I realize it's been a lot lately, so I've been trying to curb it. I've also been trying to figure out where it came from.

*"I wonder if..."*
This is my polite way of offering critique, e.g., "I wonder if you'd want to consider doing it way x instead."

*"I don't know..."*
I especially say this when I do know, but have analyzed myself into uncertainty. This is why I give bad directions. My directional knowledge is fine, but I communicate it in uncertain, open-ended terms. "You could take a left by the park--I think that's on 1st street, but I might be wrong--and if you miss it it doesn't totally matter because it's the same distance as turning left on 2nd street. So, it really comes down to whether you want to see the park, which, as I said, may not be there."

*"Honestly..."*
I'm usually babbling, so I say this to let people know it's a good time to start listening. It's gonna be told like it is real soon.

*"Oh my goodness"*
I speak crude and prude.

I say more things than this, I'm sure.Thank you. This isn't my thread, but you gave the correct response. Especially when you said "no intellect", but also the mention of having that in common with many Americans.I think you're absolutely right.This is somewhat close to my experience: I think I'm best at cognitive empathy. I tend to have mental maps of people I know in regard to what they like and how they react to various things. So, I am thinking things along the lines of, "This bothers this person because of this" or "If this is said this person will react like this because of this." Then I hear someone say something that I know to be a trigger for someone else and think, "Well, that's going to be a whoopsie."Hahahaha. Interestingly, when it comes to reading others in the moment, I'm very auditory, because if I'm trying to think, body language cues will distract me, but I really tend to be sensitive to subtle changes in speaking tone.

What you said struck me as more related to sociopathy than narcissism. It's very silly, though. Let your heart, not Reddit, tell you whether you're a sociopath, and if you are, go get help; or don't, because you're probably better off than the rest of us in some ways, and I don't believe there's any treatment that works! So, just go take advantage of people because what else can you do?

(But no, I wouldn't have thought to point out a personality disorder. You sound like every ENTJ I've ever met, and I tend to enjoy you people a lot.)Did you get a dumb person function stack?In earnest, I thought your comments were well said. I couldn't help making the joke. :)

Also, I love ENFJs and their brains. Can be very smart. And a lot of times that cryptic Ni doesn't make any sense to me, which is all the more enjoyable.I think one reason for this misconception can be differences in opinion about what's the appropriate function to use in a given situation. If you think your dominant function is the appropriate one, and someone uses another, it can be tempting to call that person dumb. For example, a Ti user could be talking about a theory, and an Fi user could comment on the moral implications of that framework. The Ti user might think, "What an idiot. That has no bearing on the explanatory power of the theory." Meanwhile, the Fi user may be a skilled logician, and this possibility is missed by the person who dismisses his intellect on said basis.Me: ENTP

Ex-boyfriend, turned good friend: ESFP

It's kind of INFP party up in here.I think healthy ENTPs annoy people as much as they would like to be annoyed. :)Agreed! My mom is INFP, and her Ne makes her almost as funny as me.I love this post. Particularly the discussion about living in a crowd of people talking and having to find the people saying the right things. Also the part about getting better at understanding which memories and facts are connected together and how. As a 28 yo ENTP, I connected with much of that.I'm not sure if my internal monologue (I call it an internal dialogue) manifests in exactly the same way, but thanks to Ne, I understand the notion of many people talking at once. I've kind of been guessing that a difference between ENTPs and INTPs is that with the latter, the topic of analysis remains relatively consistent, at least for a little bit, whereas with the former there are many jumps between analytical topics. I used to know an ESFP/INTJ couple, so... if you put them in a room together I imagine the activities would be fighting and then sex. Of course, this observation comes from dating the ESFP before the INTJ did. I found him to be very interested in fighting with me, and I doubt he gave that up because he was dating a different guy.I think I'd try to get the ISFJ to admit something mean.I think the key value of typology is for us to have understanding when others act and communicate differently than we would. If someone acts one way and our expectation is something else, we don't have to write them off as an asshole. Instead we can realize that what we thought was the truly correct response to a situation was actually our relative preference. For example, you can imagine a situation where an ENFJ and an ENTJ are working on a project together. Without knowledge of typology, conflict could emerge because the ENFJ perceives the ENTJ as unduly directive and confrontational. The ENFJ might react negatively, assuming that they have been unfairly judged by the ENTJ. On the other hand, the ENFJ with knowledge of typology might have a moment of pause to recognize, "Extraverted feeling is my preferred manner of communicating, but it's not necessarily the only correct one. It appears this ENTJ is using extraverted thinking, and I don't assume they mean any harm. They simply value a direct tone over a warm one."This is good.I'm with you up until the Te-Si rant, because I think your comments there misrepresent Te vs. Ti. I do not think the Ti user insists just on creating new ways of thinking, but rather this person means to arrive at a deep *understanding* of truth. As a result, the Ti user has an internal warehouse of what's true and logical to her/him, and continually evaluates new information to see how it fits into this warehouse. Thus, the Pythagorean Theorem would likely be counted as logical and accepted; it wouldn't be rejected on the basis that the Ti user didn't think of it himself. Similarly, if the workout plan sounds reasonable to the Ti user, then s/he will likely follow it.

Looping back to "following a process" vs. "being an independent thinker", I think the latter doesn't necessarily mean overturning established systems on a regular basis in favor of novelty. Rather, I think it's all about evaluating elements of the status quo for their logic and efficiency. I think what ends up happening is many current practices remain intact after this test because there's not always a dramatically better alternative. Thus, an independent thinker doesn't change everything, but identifies systems that *are* broken, and proposes that they undergo change.

Edit: I just wanted to add that I don't think "following a process" vs. "being an independent thinker" have anything to do with Te vs. Ti. I know a Te-dom who, bothered by inefficiency, has gone to very odd lengths to make things run smoothly. I think Si vs. Ni could potentially play a role, with the former potentially having a more conservative attitude toward adopting new systems. Nevertheless, I think independent thinking goes beyond cognitive functions, such that even the open-minded Si user recognizes and appreciates an improved process.I think the positive is having a lens to identify your strengths and weaknesses. A negative is being pigeonholed into feeling like you have to "develop" yourself in accordance with the functions associated with your type. I'd personally rather see you develop outside of that framework, based on your own goals and what you think will make you happy, or at least while using several different approaches. Another negative is the potential to let your type designation impact the way you act.

Foods for thought. I don't think knowing is big deal either way, provided you don't let it become so.You know, for a while there I was convinced of ENTP as my type. I think that's partly because I wasn't doing very well emotionally, and partly because I really admire Ne-Ti and Ti-Ne. I think it also had to do with consistently being able to identify with Ne-Si. But that typing also found support in other people's appraisals: I am often viewed as a cold logician (not a mean one, though). But others can't see what I seldom share, which is the fantasy world in which I live. I actually knew of that disparity a long time ago, and then seemed to forget for about two years. It was as though the appraisals became the reality. Anyway, I've been toying with INFP (which is actually how I typed every time for quite a while on the tests, not that it matters) because recently I do feel like I connect with introverted feeling in the sense of being driven by a perception of attraction and repulsion, and having a strange inner world that is somehow connected to that perception.

So, there you go. No, I'm not 100% certain. :)Agreed. It's pretty awesome.

Edit above: often -&gt; awesomeIt would probably be about the nature/existence of the afterlife. If avoiding being too big a bastard means eternal comfort, I might do a bit more coasting for the next sixty or so years.Here's one more way of thinking about it. I've heard that the dominant function is the one that is just about always on, whereas other functions operate by switches that can be flipped on and off, and may be more contextual in their use. 

For example, for me:

* I think introverted feeling is almost always present, aided by extraverted intuition. 

* I like introverted thinking and can use it comfortably, but I tend to be driven to apply it in localized contexts. It helps me to understand the structure behind an essay or that of a sentence, to the extent that I need to, but there's not a huge amount of contexts where I'm flipping that switch on.

* Similarly, Si is my third function, and I do tend to remember details and compare them to present information, sometimes surprisingly very well, but I am not always doing this intentionally. Sometimes it is more sporadic.

* Ni, I realize, I just don't do very much. Ne steals the show.

Can you identify this for you? Are some usually on while others are more contextual in application?What are some of the Fe things you do that she considers disingenuous? * **Money skills.** Don't get me wrong, I can sit down and craft a budget that is completely fine, but sticking to it is a 24/7 cognitive drain. It's a daily, hourly fight against impulses to be whimsical.

* **Confrontation skills.** I can often stand up for myself, and if I can't, I remove myself from the situation. In that sense, I don't exactly feel like I'm a pushover. However, I collapse in on myself in the most pathetic way whenever anybody even slightly aggresses toward me. A part of me wishes I were better in these situations; another part doesn't appreciate them, finds them unnecessary, and is satisfied not engaging with them.I've been thinking of dreams as what happens when the right brain is given the steering wheel and the left is allowed to sleep. The right brain whirls through associations, desires, and fears--things that we might ordinarily think of while awake--but without the structure of a conscious left brain. Thus, our dreams mirror conscious reality in their content, but everything is messy and muddled together.

In that sense, I can believe the functions would manifest in dreams, insofar as the desires and anxieties they conjure in consciousness are mirrored when we go to sleep. For example, the conscious INFP may simultaneously wish for and dread the structure of improved extraverted thinking. There may be resultant anxiety about this shortcoming of the INFP, and that may appear in dreams in one form or another, probably with less structure than when we consider it in consciousness.I haven't had the experience of working with bosses like you've described, but I can tell you what comes to my mind. This idea was triggered by your mentioning getting the bosses to think the incorrect decision was something they realized. I wonder if you can take that one step further. Rather than simply point out the fact proving the boss's decision incorrect, can you ask them how to approach the task, *in light of* that fact? For example, you might say, "I'm happy to do that. Can I ask a clarification question about it? I know that *Fact X* is true. Being that as it may, what do you think might be the best approach to work around that?" That way, you don't appear to be avoiding responsibilities, making excuses, or questioning the boss's judgment, but you still give the them that chance to reconsider their decision.So, three thoughts that come to mind that could hopefully be helpful food for thought. 

* First off, what you described is vaguely similar to what I've read about the development of ENFPs. From what I hear, they start off adventurous, with Ne being the main developed function, but get much shyer in the teenage years when Fi begins to develop. You said you were a classic ENFP until about age 7, and then were more depressive. To me it seems possible that as a child you looked like an ENFP because you were driven by your lead function: Ne. After age 7, Fi kicked in and was consistent with some of the depressive symptoms you mentioned. Based on that possibility, you might consider ENFP.

* Second, ISFJs would differ notably from ENFPs being that the former are on the Fe-Ti axis whereas the latter are on the Fi-Te axis. Perhaps you could identify which axis speaks to you more. Are you driven by more of a sense of personal attraction and repulsion, or is it more so a desire to harmonize with others?

* Third, ISFJs and ENFPs have the key difference of dominant versus inferior Si. ISFJs may be found comparing present sensations to past ones, whereas ENFPs are drawn to novel experiences. Are you drawn to one or the other of these more? This can be an easy one to figure out for myself. By and large, my first function is where I am happy and comfortable, and the fourth one brings considerable dread, as it is the one I am always avoiding because I don't like it, and I suffer the consequences of that. (That's inferior Te. It's a constant struggle to impose structure on my life. I have to go quite against my nature and overcome a lot of resistance to do things like living according to a budget.)

I can say if you're going through anxiety or depression that can certainly muddle these judgments up, and that may make these decisions hard. That's certainly happened to me.My mother and I are INFPs who get along extremely well. Though I will say I have moments where she gets caught up in her Ne play-land and I think, "Goodness, this is exhausting. Oh my gosh, this is how I am to other people. I'm so sorry. No, wait, I'm funny."According to typology, being stuck between ENTJ and ENFP doesn't quite work. Since ENFP and ENTJ do share Te-Fi, it may be helpful to think about intuition. You may know that introverted intuition, which the ENTJ uses, is convergent and tries to find one main, overarching idea; in this sense Ni is concerned with what most likely *will* be. On the other hand, divergent extraverted intuition tries to incorporate many possible ideas and can be good at simultaneously holding multiple perspectives on the same issue. Extraverted intuition users think about the many things that *may* be, sometimes without regard for the likelihood of any individual possibility. Extraverted intuition users also tend to be drawn to novel experiences they can draw meaning from. 

For example, for an ENTJ, think of Paris from Gilmore Girls (if you're familiar). Her thought process is often along the lines of, "Thing X *will* happen; therefore I must do thing Y." On the flip side, Lorelei, who is more of an ENFP, lives in a world of unlikely possibilities: "Well, thing A *could* happen (and sometimes it really is quite an absurd possibility), but thing B could happen also, so I don't know what to do."

Hope that helps!* Te: hard for me to miss the directness of this type

* Fe: hard for me to miss the warm communication style of this type

* Ne: easy to hear how they can never end a conversation because everything said makes them think of another idea

* Se: harder for me, but what I tend to notice is Se individuals not looking for subtext all the time, and just generally speaking loudly enough to be noticed

* Si: Not terribly hard for me - this is the coworker whom I ask to help with something, forget I've asked, and then days later they come over to remind me and ask when I'd like the help.

* Ni: This one's pretty challenging, but what I can pick up on are the Ni user's intense focus, and how they seem a little jarred in conversation when too disparate an idea is introduced. 

* Ti: Difficult unless I know the person well - it comes through in their deliberateness. 

* Fi: Hard for me to spot in others because it is individualized and quiet. Sometimes it is apparent in a person's resistance to and disdain for conformity. If you can get a sense of this, the Fi user's need for authenticity is apparent, but I believe it can be subtle. While this need may always be present, it isn't necessarily always demonstrative. I also see Fi in the way some people have family as their highest value, but otherwise don't really care to interact with people. I can only speak about my ex. ;) He was ESFP, and I am INFP.

**ESFP criticized me for:**

* Being too whimsical

* Talking about theory too much

* Being difficult to read

* Being messy

* Being a clown

**I criticized ESFP for:**

* Being uninterested or unable to observe any motive or other aspect of my personality beyond what's apparent in the immediate moment; then after he did observed these things sometimes and even admitted being impressed by them, forgetting everything he'd seen.

* Maintaining certain views, for example, some pertaining to body image and standards, that I found obviously morally reprehensible

* Trying to fit in when it didn't really seem to suit him

* Being too concerned about material possessions and aspirations, as well as status symbols deemed important by society

* Obsessing over travel to the degree that it became like a currency, without seeming to learn anything interesting from it

* saying "as well too" (it's redundant) :PI have an INFJ friend who believes he has the same kind of perception of other people's minds. What he actually does sometimes is come to an opinion of how things are, and then refuse to hear any other possibilities. Hey! I think it can be helpful to move away from type stereotypes and characterizations. Rather, you may want to consider the differences between introverted thinking and introverted feeling to see if one seems more preferable to you. 

As I understand it, dominant introverted thinking puts one on a lifelong quest to achieve logical consistency. It is a desire for knowledge and making sense of things. In the context of an argument, it focuses less on facts and intuitive morality and more on whether the arguments being employed make sense. For this reason, I think dominant introverted thinking users can have very well thought out principles (almost like an Fi user) that are hard to dispute because of their sound logical backing. For example, I have an INTP friend who is a libertarian. It's not because he lacks empathy; it's because based on the rules set out in the constitution, he believes libertarianism is the most logically consistent party. On a different note, the introverted thinker may buck certain societal conventions, and that's likely because they are perceived as illogical or a source of indifference.

Now my understanding of introverted feeling is that it values a personal feeling of rightness over logical consistency. An inner compass of personal preferences manifests as a sense of identify which the individual feels obligated to honor. In the context of an argument, this feeling of moral responsibility outweighs logic. While the introverted thinker may point out the unfairness of taking money from the rich to give to the poor--maybe this is considered as theft and undue governmental influence--the introverted feeler may be unmoved by a potential logical argument to this effect, but rather linger over the seeming wrongfulness of human suffering. Similar to the Ti user, the Fi user may buck societal conventions, but for different reasons. The Fi user is driven to honor that compass of personal preferences, and thereby their identity, and that leads to aversion when it comes to following disliked traditions.

I hope that helps!I would...

a) consider whether INTP is an accurate representation of you. If you find the type unappealing, maybe it's because it's not in alignment with your preferences. I would think that while an INTP might wish to be more socially graceful, they would still value and derive pleasure from using introverted thinking. If that's not a source of happiness or pride for you, it seems a different type may be your preference.

b) avoid being pigeonholed by a type or type description. Don't consider your alleged type as an indication of your destiny so much as a reflection of how you like to use your mind. If you value empathy, be empathetic. If you can be empathetic and logical, maybe you could be a super person. If you want to play a sport, but worry that the INTPs' Se-PolR precludes this, do it anyway, and badly if you must. But still do it - because you'd like to.So you'd say you wouldn't care if things are logically consistent? When your friends talk to you, maybe about their problems, what kind of feedback do you tend to give?Have you read up on the cognitive functions and all of that? I'm not sure how you came to believe yourself to be an INTP, but I just don't think you are one. The thing is, typology is all about preferences. If you don't prefer logical consistency, which is the hallmark of the dominant function of the INTP, you're not an INTP. I strongly think you must be another type. Why is this a postMight be a person thing.That is definitely an odd situation. Another poster made a distinction between "excusing" and "understanding" which I think is important. MBTI should be used to understand others' behavior. If a person acts in a way that seems weird to us, we can understand the behavior through the lens of their functions. We can say, "Oh, that's weird for me, but not them." In doing this we do expose the relativity of perceptions regarding "normal", and we realize what we think is normal is neither universal nor morally correct. So, when we think about "excusing" a person's behavior, that seems a little less applicable. If there's no universally normal, morally correct way of being, there's no incorrect behavior to excuse anybody from. However, this observation does not change our needs as people. What you need may not be universal or have a moral basis, but you still need it. So, if a behavior is problematic for you, by all means call it out--but do so because it gets in the way of your needs, not because it appears abnormal.I think I have more do's than don'ts. As an INFP, I'm inclined to think an INFP character would engage in a pathological amount of self-reflection. Their inner monologue would oscillate between thoughts of the past, such as self-contradictory things they can't believe they did, and the future, with a focus on whether their life is meaningful and happy. Given a moment's downtime, the INFP mind quickly meanders to these places. As far as don'ts, I offer none. I think the deviations from type-based stereotypes are the elements that will move your characters from caricatures to authentic beings.I could definitely list the bad experiences I've had with various types, but I don't think any type should be allowed a monopoly on being an uninteresting piece of shit. Boring me is a choice each individual makes of their own malice.I agree with others who have called out immaturity. An immature Fi type may ramble on and on about their problems as if they held some special significance, while an immature Te type may maintain the annoying belief nobody is as competent as they are. But I've met Fi types who don't make everything about them and Te types who are pretty self-aware and openminded. It all comes down to the person using the functions--being a shithead can be expressed through any combination of function axes.Few sounds really bother me except excessive smacking while eating. I have a friend who does it, I've already called him out on it, he still does it, and I want to wring his neck when I hear it. &gt; But +1 to ESFJ's; this guy is a perfect example of how S types are more than capable of "N" shit and arne't barred or walled off from a world of "intellectualism" or some shit like that
&gt; Though N types have a WHOLE DIFFERENT and more nuanced approach- more imbued with their own character, in their approach to intellectualist shit

This was interesting. Can you say more about it? 

Edit: especially N's having more nuanced approached to intellect more imbued in their characterAll signs point to... INTP!I have had scotch. I accept the comment graciously. Also, when did you change back to ENFP?Eccch, I may have mixed you up with someone else. Anyway, I have always loved your screen name.Yeah, I agree. I was thinking about how those who reject labels remain subject to the predispositions that lead to applying them. In that way, as you point out, labels and hypocrisy are inevitably ubiquitous, and it does seem draining to condemn everyone who uses them.Absolutely, but my post was intended more as observation than condemnation. There's a number of questions on the test that are very contextual and hard for me to answer, too.

* "In small groups, do you do a little or a lot of the talking?" *It depends on the group of people and what they're talking about and how comfortable I feel.*

* "It's frustrating when people don't consider: the facts/others' feelings." *At work, I am consistently irritated by people's unwillingness to consider the facts. In certain friend groups, I ask myself, "Has the word empathy literally not come up in your lifetime?"*

* "You rely more on your: emotional strength/force of will." *I don't have either.*To understand my inner world, picture this. You're in a dark cave with thick fog moving throughout. There's a quiet, distant voice mumbling incoherent, inconsequential nonsense. Every once in a while, you become very conscious of the mumbling, and this makes you wonder, "What the heck is this voice talking about?" So, you ask. The voice replies, "Oh, that was nothing. It's all nothing. Have to fill the void somehow, you know?" You think about it. "I guess so," you reply. Then the voice recedes into the background once more.Oooo, now there are multiple ENTPs and they'll have to compete for a space in the Jungian typorgy. Dad: ISFJ

Mom: INFP

Sister: ESTJ

Me: INFPI have a friend like that.Gather five people with distinctively different penmanship. Different slant. Different loopiness. Randomly choose letters from each and put them together into one combined penmanship. That is the best approximation of mine.He speaks exactly like that.That's really cute.Very interesting. The overarching answer to this thread seems to be "not necessarily".  hahaha&gt; Sometimes the most efficient way to do things is to take into account everybody's wants and needs. Sometimes the most harmonious way to do things is to be efficient 😁

I really like this point. 

I wouldn't think there's any imperative that Te and Fe would have to clash (they're just functions), though I wondered if there could be a predisposition for it. It was more so I saw some dom Fe and Te users clash, and it made sense through the lens of the functions, so I wondered if this played out in anybody's experience. It's been fun to see that I am wrong.

Also, I didn't down-vote you. I am just now returning to Reddit.

**Edit: In fact, have an upvote.**lol. Perfect.Haidt's research actually showed differences in in moral foundations across party lines, such that loyalty, respect, and purity are lower for liberals.It's all in *The Righteous Mind* by Johnathan Haidt. I love that book. If you go read it, please message me and talk to me about it.INFP...

1. Intellection
2. Input
3. Strategy
4. Individuation 
5. ConnectednessIf I can go ahead and insert my two cents--which is what Reddit's all about, so I shouldn't ask permission--I see the terms "morals" and "values" a lot, and I prefer "values". From my own understanding, Fi is a network of images of what I like and who I'd like to be. If I see someone yelling quite aggressively and harshly and it seems unfair to me, especially if it's toward me, I will think, "I don't like that." I will therefore try to avoid doing it. Alternatively, I might see some movie portrayal of a wise but absentminded professor and like it. Later I'll delight when a moment arises in which I feel that portrayal applies to me. Over time, these perceptions and responses of attraction or repulsion accumulate, leading to a vision of how I'd like to live my life. Thus, there can be a moral component because there is a sense of appropriateness in how to act, yet that is not whole of it. Being an absentminded professor is not morally correct; it's just charming. So, I really think that the term values (despite its connotations associated with morals) more adequately encompasses Fi judgments than morals.

Now, if I'm understanding things right, Ti does a similar thing to Fi, in terms of making an observation, incorporating that into an internal framework, and later on checking new data for its fit into the system. But with Ti, the system is not the accumulation of perceptions of attraction and repulsion over time. It is the accumulation of conceptual information. For lack of being able to think of anything at all, a Ti person might make an observation that all rabbits are yellow. Then someone might tell the Ti person they saw a green rabbit. Now the Ti person faces a crisis where something has to be false: either this person's observation or their own theory regarding all rabbits being yellow. That is the nature of Ti, I believe. Hi everyone, I’m a 28-year-old guy, and I have struggled with typing myself quite a bit. I understand the functions, and even the function axes :O (thanks to the glorious Michael Pierce), but I am guessing one function in particular is keeping me from certainty. (Extroverted intuition.) I've probably just over-thought all of this. Sorry this is a little long.

First, I would say I’m certain I have Ne-Si. I identify with pretty much every aspect of extroverted intuition. My mind is a web of word-associative nonsense. I am always thinking things over, considering “What if it’s this? But wait. What if it’s the opposite of this? Obviously, it’s not that. We’re already certain about that.” (Think of Dr. House: “What if the rash isn’t a rash?” I’ve heard he’s an INTJ, but I believe that sort of thinking is the NP’s MO.) As far as Si goes, I’ve become pretty certain I have a body, though I’m not accustomed to paying attention to it. This makes things a little scary when I get sick. Because I’m not in the habit of consciously perceiving the physical experiences of my body, when I do get sick, I think the physical sensations represent the tone of my actual thoughts and experiences, and basically that the world is over. Eventually I remind myself: No, everything seems gloomy because you have a headache.

As far as Fi-Te or Te-Fi goes, I’m not sure I fall on this axis. The first thing I would point out in this regard is I am not a planner. I can make things efficient if I need to, but in my day to day life, it’s not a priority, and my conscience is not insulted by this. I can’t really identify with high-position Fi either. I think Jung described Fi as something along the lines of an unconscious image of how the world should be that the user chases after. I have no desire to live beautifully, and I have no complex moral system. My moral code is more along the lines of just do your thing and don’t be a dick. That said, sometimes I do feel tugged at by a dream of being a professor, but I check myself with serious questions about whether I would enjoy what the work of a professor actually entails.

Regarding Ti-Fe, I think I can identify with this axis. For me, if I am imposing this axis on my life correctly, it manifests as…acquiescing despite having other thoughts. I tend to have criticisms of certain mainstream ways of thinking that I like sharing with my friends. I think I’m usually pretty good at guessing what other people’s reactions are going to be, and if they’re not looking for a debate, I tend not to bring one to them. On the other hand, my devil’s advocate has learned, in some cases, to ask questions instead of asserting a point of view, and I think this can be as effective as debating. In any case, I tend to think of myself as having approximately three layers. (There are probably more, but I am aware of these ones, or at least these ones are relevant to this discussion.) There is an outer layer of friendly, albeit sometimes a little shy, politeness which new acquaintances, and to some degree, coworkers see. There is a layer beneath that which good friends see that consists of my actual thoughts about the world—the things I don’t say to people I think might be offended. Even deeper, there is a layer of actual caring, which I think tends to be fairly implicitly clear to people who know me. 

On a somewhat related note, I’ve always had trouble with the idea of giving Christmas gifts. It seems especially silly in my family, where each individual generates a list, which is circulated among everybody else. If I wanted the things on my list, I could just buy them for myself, but I haven’t since I’d rather save the money. It would seem better if it was thoughtful gifts only—“I saw this and thought of you”—but who can time thoughtful gifts for Christmas? Maybe you would just buy the gift at an earlier time; in that case, kudos to you if you can wait until Christmas to give it. All of this said, I usually play along because… who cares? The children will be happy with their redundant toys *because* they asked for them, and that’s what it’s about. ;)

Regarding a dominant function, I have to lean toward extroverted intuition. I do not choose to question and second guess everything I think – this is just what happens when I stop exerting force on my consciousness. As far as extroversion goes, socially speaking, while I am not exceedingly outgoing, social situations don’t really drain me – if and only if – I get to converse in the way that I prefer, which usually means discussing and questioning ideas, as well as cracking jokes. 

It may be clear I already have an idea in my head about what type applies to me, but I was hoping you all could give a read and see if there are areas where I didn’t think about this correctly. Hi everyone, well, it's been a journey, but I've recently come out as an ENTP. Against my nature, I am comfortable codifying myself as such, but the one problem is: I don't know how to add flair to my name. But I've been afraid to ask. I thought people might say, "If you can't figure that out, you must not be ENTP." But now that I feel I've settled into my ENTP identity, I'm ready to take whatever backlash this post incurs. Also, I just thought this would be funnier than a Google search.Hey, all you Fi peoples. As an ENTP, Fi is a little bit of a mystery to me. I think I've seen it in action before, but it's hard to be sure. Do you mind telling me what your experiences using Fi are like? What are you doing and thinking about when Fi is directly engaged?We yell at everybody who pigeonholes us into any kind of label and then we generalize everybody from the same label as though they were also offenders. And that goes on inevitably. And that's about it. That's our full capacity. 

Edit: This is why I tend to be a supporter of hypocrisy. Just seems sad to hate everybody. I have an ESFJ coworker, with whom I work really well, but I notice they have a hard time getting along with people with dominant Te. The take-charge, no-bullshit approach of the ENTJ seems to come across as disregard and a threat to the authority of the ESFJ. Meanwhile, no one else has really had issues getting along with the ENTJ. So, I'm just wondering if anybody else has noticed a similar Fe/Te clash.
My understanding of it is that as an introverted function, its qualities are intrinsic. It seems to sort everything through the context of what is relevant to the user's experience and life. Not just in the past but overall in the person's life. I get the impression that there's an emphasis on understanding what's metaphorically close to home and that the experiences surrounding their life are worth defending through Te (hence the finely controlled lives of the ISTJ's) or through Fe (hence the stereotype of ISFJ's taking care of the people around them).

From my own experience, I think it's worth noting that as the opposite of Ne, Si has a much closer definition of context and what is relevant.I am fairly argumentative.


I don't actually think it's a tendency towards arguing, it's just the way I think. My own thoughts and worldviews are subject to even more constant challenging and reevaluating than the people I argue with have to deal with.The problem is that the functions tend to be inconsistently defined. If we know that Ne is the opposite of Si, then the definitions of Ne and Si should reflect that.

But people have a tendency to only understand the functions they use, so the other functions get lazy stereotypes.Ti is more likely, I think.I don't think it's really a matter of what type can have this view.  It's more about how the view was formed.

The Te users I know tend to rail against incompetence and ineffectiveness. This reads more like a complaint that other people are irrational and inconsistent, which are the big Ti no-nos.Fi can easily be confused with Fe, because they both can have similar values and they both can lead to "caring about harmony". But Fi tends to believe certain views and things have inherent value (ie justice or self-worth) while Fe tends to be more reactionary (value is changed through moral interaction).

Ti and Te though don't look anything alike. And even if the stereotypes are wrong, ENTP's are defined by their use of Ti. If you tend to think in terms of Te, odds are you're some other type.

Do some reading on the function axes. There's some good explanations of why Fe and Te don't coexist.I've been toying with the idea that low Si may manifest as uncertainty of personal identity as well. Which explains why the personality of Ne users seems to be in a constant state of flux.If you look at the (lazy) stereotypes for Si users of "tradition" and "memory" they're both tied to personally significant ways of life for the user. And then the stereotypes of procrastination for Ne users seems to be because we shirk relevant and important here and now responsibilities (Si) for the most far off and interesting thing (Ne) to do instead.
&amp;nbsp;

The pattern I've noticed in Si users is that whether or not they're decided on something like a major, they seem to know what their life is going to look like, and anything that is immediately relevant to their life is treated as important. Ne users thrive on making connections, and for me at least, the connections feel more powerful and interesting when the topics are more unfamiliar and farther away from personal significance.
&amp;nbsp;

Like I said, I was just toying with the idea.I was thinking INFP originally, but I don't see any clear Ne indicators. The dominant Fi and inferior Te are apparent, but I think the poster could just as easily be ISFP with just this information.The problem with being a borderline type is that INTJ's and ENTJ's are high Te users, so they place a lot of value on control and effective and measurable execution of their ideas.

ENTP's are much more concerned with interesting new ideas (Ne) that make logical sense (Ti) and are famous for their lack of execution on projects.All cognitive functions are inner thought process inside people's head. And I've seen long winded posts from other types before. Here I wouldn't interpret it beyond high Fi authenticity.I'm not a dominant Fe user, but I disagree. Fi places a lot of value on authentic moral decisions. Fe is more reactionary, with more flexible concerns like consequences and group expectation and reaction.

A lot of times, I think you'll see Fi users put a bigger emphasis on honest and sincere decisions, because I think Fi focuses on manifestations of self worth.https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4tx9b5/se_a_better_fucking_explanation/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

This is a good explanation of Se. As the opposite of Ni, Se users have a tendency to see things as they are, rather than interpreting everything. I think a low Ni user might be reluctant to accept interpretations over face value.

I might have a little trouble separating Ne from my overall type, but it deals with interconnected ideas. Ne generally likes novelty, and it resembles an ever expanding and adapting worldview.

If that doesn't help, the less reliable dichotomy between S and N is that (please don't hate me sensors) sensing deals with the concrete, the things that have happened and the things that are, and intuition deals with abstract connections of ideas. It should be fairly apparent if you just look at the types of conversations you like to have with people.

Ultimately though, this is more a tool for self awareness, and you may just have to figure it out on your own.It's not really a "my word vs your word" anyway. Fi and Fe have to follow their definitions or they're not really that function anyway.

There's a lot of debate over the actual definitions, but I think Fi is the value judgements of actions, people, and things as having intrinsic moral value. And Fe as having extrinsic moral value.
  

Edit: Also, I don't think Fe places an emphasis on authentic moral decisions, which is why Fe appears kind of shallow and people pleasing to some people.Close. High Ne always goes with low Si, and high Se goes with low Ni. And your comment sounds like Ne, which supports you being an INFP.

Which would make your function stack: Fi Ne Si Te. You can do some more research into the functions if you're curious or still uncertain.I think you might have that wrong. The ISTP's, who use Ti and Se are notoriously the most blunt and least flowery writers.It's not so much how they write, but what they talk about and how they talk about it.Find me the people who say that and I'll argue with them instead.

MBTI only works if each category is well defined. Do some research into introverted vs extroverted functions, and you'll see the difference.&gt;you did not define a definition that is exclusive to each function (Fi, Fe)

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Fi is the value judgements of actions, people, and things as having intrinsic moral value. And Fe as having extrinsic moral value.It's not a matter of what either person can do. The point is Fi does things because they view those actions as having their own intrinsic moral value, so they can't very well see the right thing to do and then not do it. So yes, Fi users can value group harmony, but they act on the value not the moral environment.

But Fe doesn't think like that. It's difficult to describe to Fi users, because they can't imagine any other way to deal with values.

Also, noone in that thread you linked differed from the definitions I gave. You should go back and read it too, because it has some good descriptions of how Fe deals with things, with the added benefit of being from dom/aux Fe users.I'm an NT not an NF, and this is why I hate arguing with Fi users, because they think arguments are about proving people wrong instead of about finding the truth.

Ultimately, you're latching on to a single phrasing of a definition that I've since rephrased and reworded many times in an effort to answer the question of the thread.I think the feel correctly, think independently statement is a bit oversimplified.

Think of it this way, Fi users think things have inherent moral value, so they need to be able to quantifiably prove its worth outwardly. If I have moral worth (Fi), then my logical qualities should measurably match up. (Te)

Ti focuses not necessarily on independent thought, but that logic should be inherently consistent and rational. And if your reasoning is consistent, then you will adapt your behavior and act in ways that will outwardly react to the moral situation. (Fe)

Or maybe I've just needlessly complicated this.I was having difficult making this call between an ISTJ and an INTJ. Ask them about their life goals, and you can see if they match Si or Ni. The person I was testing valued financial security, which I considered to be a much more concrete goal than most Ni goals.

And for the record, have you met any ISTJ's? Because they prove the whole "only N's are future oriented" thing wrong.I think if people actually understood what the types meant, they would be satisfied in their own type. ENTP's value NeTi things, and what do you know, ENTP's are equipped with the NeTi mindset to do those things. Each type has exactly the right mindset to feed into the thought processes that type uses. If an ISTJ was upset that they weren't good at ENFJ things, would they really be an ISTJ?High Ne's strength is a constantly adapting and expanding worldview. It's perfect for what EXNP's value, which is understanding and exploring, with a side of fast talking. It's less perfect for the practical, which ENXP's value much less, if at all. But making Ne valuable to other types would require some creativity, which is more a personality trait than a type trait.The goal isn't to convince anyone. The goal is to help them understand MBTI, in order that they might help us understand MBTI better.

If we let people choose their type unchallenged, noone's understanding of MBTI will ever improve, and we'll have a ton of mistyped people spreading inconsistent definitions of the functions.

Wait...all of that is already happening.Yes. We must feed this glorious Ti monstrosity.I felt it made it much easier. Too easy even. My Ne was feeding on information everywhere, to the point that when I took tests, I could usually tell what the answer was by the way the question was worded. And I'm great at math, which helped.

Side note, I think the reason people struggle with Calculus is because it requires a complete and mastered understanding of algebra.Socionics or typology...Meh. There's only so much you can take from other theorists, especially given this isn't really that empirically great.

I take the cognitive functions from the theories, and try to improve the definitions to be more consistent and accurate, and then work from there to understand how other people might think differently than me.

And they're called COGNITIVE functions. Any behavioural interpretation is already off base.I've been toying with the idea that (Yes, ideas are toys. Get over it.) the extravert's dominant function may be where they lack awareness of other people's boundaries. Se as the extraverts who try to force people to get out there and do things (experiential boundaries). Ne as the extraverts who don't realize that other people's ideas and beliefs aren't their personal playground (Who am I kidding? That's exactly what other people are for.)(idea boundaries). Te as the people who make other people's decisions for them "in their best interest", and essentially think for them (thinking boundaries). And Fe as the people who have a tendency towards emotional manipulation and extraction (feeling boundaries).The way introverts feel when overwhelmed by interaction, is essentially how the extraverts feel without it. For some of us, when we keep bugging you to do stuff, it's because stagnation is hell.I think you might be an ENFP for several reasons. Firstly, because ENTP's don't typically relate to Fi at all. Part of the ENTP mindset is that nothing is personal.

Also, the way your posts are worded also makes me think Fi. You talk in terms of what you identify with and what you relate to, which are Fi concerns. And then you worry that your judgement is clouded, which sounds like an Fi worry about self worth, founded on the Te concern of being effective.Fi follows its own system of logic that can't be conventionally reasoned with. It's like Ti, the only way to change Ti's mind is for it to come to the conclusion on its own using Ti.

I always pictured the parts in stories where someone experienced a turn of events where their reasoning suddenly became obvious to them. You can't tell the Fi user that they're wrong, they have to show themselves using Fi why they're wrong.Yeah, I think this is definitely a high Ne low Si thing. I've been known to avoid people because I felt they had too strong of an idea of who I was, and I didn't feel like being that person at other's demand.Is that not the same thing as appealing to the person's Fi in order to reach a compromise?Fair enough. But working from the poster's assumption that the person can't be reasoned with, I think appealing to Fi would be the way to go.Fe seems likely, but your reasons for not being Fi could maybe be Ne with Fi.How to describe Ne... In my experience at least, I'd point out a few things. An eclectic breadth of hobbies that to me seem interconnected through abstract themes. Tendency to get bored with just doing things for their own sake, especially if I feel I've exhausted its potential for ideas. Flight of ideas that builds momentum the longer I talk. A tendency to spontaneously pick up and drop new hobbies, theories, and people.

That might vary by person though. I'd probably define Ne more concisely as an interconnected network of ideas that is constantly evolving and shifting and expanding.

If dom Ne seems overwhelming to you, it's possible you place a higher emphasis on Si, Ne's opposite.It's hard to say. If you ask what Si is, you'll get a different answer from each person.

I think it's probably the intrinsic value of an experience or lifestyle both in the past and the future, which the user is usually protective of.

You may or may not get a better definition from actual Si users, but you can at least see if you relate by checking out the ISFJ subreddit.Ni users typically value depth of understanding, they don't typically see the point in exploring outside their own specialized strengths, and they dislike speaking up about topics they don't feel they understand fully.

Ne users typically value breadth of understanding, and don't see the point in specializing, especially where that requires learning overly specific details that are useless, or worse, boring. They may speak up in any issue they deem interesting. There's lots of overlap between their interests, so they may approach a topic feeling qualified because they understand different topics which are actually quite similar. Since the goal is to explore, not to defend or protect an existing idea, they don't feel reluctant to engage in unfamiliar ideas.I think a lot of the confusion is because everyone talks about types in terms of behavior. So there's already a lot of behavioral information out there on the functions, so I thought it would be better to clarify it with function definitions.

The function pairs work as a sort of yin-yang, where the two form a single whole. So the dominant isn't repressing the inferior, it's just taking up a larger part of a functional whole. So, yeah, more or less a weighting of preferences.Some things can be understood theoretically, and some things can only be experienced. So the distinction I'm drawing is not between theoretical and practical, but between theoretical and experiential.

Intuitives place the emphasis on understanding with less need for experiencing, and sensors place the emphasis on experiencing with less need for theoretical understanding or interpretation. (I'm not saying that sensors don't understand, just that experiental understanding is different than theoretical understanding.)

Or at least, those are the definitions I'm asking for feedback on.I'd tie rational understanding to T or more specifically Ti. Rationality fits the more active role that the judging functions have.

But theoretical understanding I would call a framework of perception. I think it's a good fit for intuition. Everyone always says that intuition is about possibilities, which almost seems like it must be a mistranslation. I think intuition is about implications, not in the sense of being aware of the future, but in the sense of being aware of the meanings or ideas that underly experience.The Ni users I have noticed put a lot of confidence in their interpretations. But if you think that's not accurate, perhaps it would be better to say that the interpretation itself is not valued, but that the act of interpretation is valued as the ideal way for the Ni user to navigate the world.Yes, thinking of rebuttals hours later is the universal human experience function, abbreviated as Hu.I ran out of synonyms, so I said understanding.

I get that Jung came up with these functions, but the definitions are flawed, and they've only been further confused since. My goal here is to create improved definitions that can be relied on with certainty. The problem with basing functions on behavioral observations is that there's no clear line on what is personality and what is cognition.The definitions of functions are flawed if there's no system to them. Se must be a reflection of Ni. Ne of Si. Fe of Ti. Te of Fi.

If you're just defining the functions based on observed behavior, anything can be a function, and we can't build an accurate understanding of function interactions.Understanding is a poor word to use there I admit. Do you have a better one? And I was referring to T as judging what is rational. Perceiving can be understood as the format new information is understood in. If Se sees things as they appear, then it suggests that Ni views things in the context of the interpretation in this case.

If that's not clear, how would you improve these definitions?Even before I realized I was an extravert, I had an easier time with strangers. I guess tert Fe didn't like to deal with already established social mechanics, and inf Si didn't like dealing with an already established identity.

Strangers have no expectation of who you're supposed to be or how you're supposed to act, so I could just be and act however I liked in that moment, which made interactions easier.

Pure Fe use is draining with anyone though.If you look for reasons not to trust people, you're going to find them.Anyone can and will find good reasons to be less than honest with each other. Maybe you should trust that they'll be who they are, instead of trusting that they'll do what you deem honest.Bored Se users are more concerned with doing things and making things happen for the experience itself, which can seem like Ne if you don't know what you're looking for. But Ne is looking for abstract idea content to feed on, so their criteria for what is interesting are different than that of Se users. Find the common theme that connects her interests and determine whether she is jumping between hobbies for the sake of trying everything, or if she's getting bored because she's gotten all the idea food she can out of the hobby.

Side note, I don't think I've ever heard Ne described as impulsive.Low Fe doesn't necessarily equal weak Fe. Low Fe users may be just as affected by Fe as high Fe users, they just might have less control over Fe. They might resent the hold it has over them because they value Ti. Aux Ti- Tert Fe usually has an easier time reconciling the two functions. Have you considered IxTP?In a sense, yes. But there would need to actually be adventure and self discovery. Ne requires connections between ideas, so the ideas can't necessarily just be pretended into existence.I haven't played in a while, but I would think ISTP. I get the sense that he's a Ti thinker hidden behind all the subtlety of an Se jackhammer.Seconded. Or is it thirded now?...

People say that your tertiary function doesn't develop until past adulthood, but I also had Fe troubles in primary school and some of secondary school.Saul's our ENTP champion!It's hard to give a good description of Si, but I'll give it a try using some of Michael Pierce's descriptions. He describes judging types as being more lenient towards their inner world (Pi) and more aggressive towards the external world (Je). And perceiving types as being more aggressive toward the inner (Ji) and more lenient toward the outer (Pe)

In my words, I think the introverted function is like the desired standard of the type. So judgers try to shape the world to their inner perception, and perceivers try to adapt their behavior to their inner standard.

So the ISFP is going to be somewhat lenient towards the world, judging with a personal moral standard that they hold themselves to and must express authentically.

The ISFJ is going to have an idea of what their life should look like, and is going to approach the world with the goal of carving out their place in it. Any obstacles from the world are going to be met with defensiveness, which I think is why Si users get the stereotype of tradition and rule following. They may or may not be ambitious, it's more like the Si users know what they want, and the Fi users know who they are.

Hopefully I haven't made this more confusing.So much Fi here it hurts.

It's kinda funny...Fi hates apathy, and Ti pretty much requires it.I took the 16 personalities test and got INTP one time and INTJ another. I read the descriptions and they seemed off. On a whim, I looked at the ENTP description and knew immediately that it was me.

This led to me learning about the difference between cognitive and social extraversion, which led me to the functions.INTP's use introverted thinking, which focuses on rationality and consistency based logic, and extraverted feeling (with much less emphasis than thinking) which is a reactionary value system with emphasis on group expectation and reaction.

INFP's use introverted feeling, which focuses on things like self worth and expression, along with the inherent moral worth of certain ideas and actions and people. To a lesser extent, they use extraverted thinking, which focuses on empirical and result based logic with things like measurability, effectiveness, efficiency, and source credibility.

Don't let the names fool you, thinkers still feel, and feelers still think. The difference lies in whether values or logic are the preferred decision making criteria.The tertiary might help. Do you relate to Ti or Fi more?Ne in its purest form. It brings tears to my eyes. You're almost certainly some type of XNXP, my guess is INTP or ENTP. ENTP's are notorious bullshitters.

Aside...The only problem with Ne, is the purer it becomes, the more obvious it is that the user is bullshitting.Second aside...Ne isn't random. Notice how he ties together seemingly disparate topics and metaphors as he navigates the point he's trying to make. Nothing random about it.I almost didn't read it because it was so long haha. But I recognized Ne just from the title of the post, and figured I should read your Ne rant if I expect other people to listen to my Ne rants.

You should narrow it down further. Do you place a greater emphasis on rational consideration or interesting ideas?Their questions have too much overlap between the extraverted and introverted forms of each function. It's a decent starting point though.I think groups of feelers have the potential to work really well together or clash terribly, and groups of thinkers have the potential to work really well together or clash terribly. The biggest problems are probably mixed groups though.Extravert:
Gets energy from the external world
Drives conversation because noone else will
Confident AND intelligent
Loves whatever the fuck they want to
Purposeful
Your dad's name IS Craig

Introvert:
Doesn't have the energy to do the things they enjoy
Complains about people who only talk about themselves, yet refuses to contribute to conversation themselves
Nobody knows how intelligent they are because they avoid every opportunity to show it
Actually lumbering
Calls my dad "dad"
Proves interesting for two minutes, then drops off the face of the earth mid conversation because they have poor manners, and then proceeds to only send you bad internet jokes

FTFYOn a more serious note, I love books, and I've yet to find anyone, introvert or otherwise, who actually likes reading.I don't see anything that says ENTP. Possible I guess, but I don't see any information that points towards ENTP.

I see Se, and either Fi or Ti, depending on why he dislikes disingenuous people.If anyone's seen Better Call Saul, I always thought of that scene where his brother tells him it's not about the money, and Saul goes "of course it's about the money!" Like he can't understand why people would make decisions that don't make sense.

That's Ti, everything, decisions and concepts and the world,  must make consistent rational sense.And this quote here (in response to being pressured to not give up on being a lawyer) seemed like a big Ti moment.

"The fallacy of sunk cost… It’s what gamblers do. They throw good money after bad thinking they can turn their luck around. It’s like, “I’ve already spent this much money or time… whatever. I got to keep going!” No, there’s no reward at the end of this game."I think Fi deals with the standard sense of self worth, and apparently ENTPs and ESTPs completely devalue Fi (polr or something like that). So it's possible that they may seem the most confident because they don't view their own self worth conventionally.Is it possible to be confident and objective? Haha.Instead of describing Fe as fake and people pleasing, maybe realize that Fe considers the needs of other people, and uses a value system that checks what effects actions have on both the user and everyone else. Fe adapts to what is good for people, instead of clinging to moral principles just for the sake of being principled.It certainly doesn't help.Honestly, we're not very similar. Go check out the ENTP subreddit and the ENFP subreddit. Night and day. I've heard ENFP's commenting on how "cold" the ENTP reddit is, and the ENFP reddit is way too "warm" for my tastes.I agree with both your points. But for the sake of getting people to stop saying facts and emotions, I glossed over it.

Plus Ti isn't facts, and I've seen TP's going around talking about how much they value the facts.Facts are too broad a category in general. And when people start saying they value facts, it makes me think they're a feeler. I don't use facts because I value them, I do it because it makes sense.I don't think it requires emotional reaction. Ethical judgements can be anything as convoluted as what the right way to interact in relationships is, to something as simple as "food is good, because being alive is good".

I don't think we could ever have true motivation to do even the simplest of things without feeling, and most of us don't wake up thinking "I'm going to eat because it makes me happy".

Ethical judgements are more straightforward and much more common than emotional reactions.Glad you understood it. Ne doesn't do linear responses well.Text messages between my INTJ friend and I are usually us carrying on three different conversations at once. It probably looks insane.I'm presenting a theory on the perceiving functions, with the hopes of getting feedback on it from the people who actually use these functions. But first, some background.

There's a lot of confusion and miscommunication regarding the cognitive functions, especially the perceiving functions, and even more especially Si. Given that MBTI may not meet empirical standards, I propose a rationalist or categorical approach. The confusion can be resolved if we come up with proper definitions for the functions. If we come up with fundamentally true definitions of the functions, then our understanding of MBTI behavior should rationally follow in the same way that all bachelors are unmarried and Socrates is mortal.

You may have noticed me mentioning the need for improved definitions around the reddit, and I've been working on refining the definitions to be more consistent across the board. I'm reasonably sure I have the judging definitions down. Fi judges things, people, and actions as having intrinsic moral value and performs a sort of value logic based on this. Te judges things on their extrinsic "thinking" traits, with an emphasis on measurable effectiveness, efficiency, control, and progress. Ti judges things based on the intrinsic properties of logic, rationality and consistency. Fe judges things based on extrinsic value, such as interpersonal interactions and more reactionary judgements based on observable moral effects on both oneself and others.

Sidetrack aside, these definitions I am reasonably satisfied with, but since consistency is an important quality for a system based on definitions, it is problematic that the definitons of the perceiving functions don't match the neat format of intrinsic and extrinsic properties that you see in the judging functions. So I came up with these definitions after encountering the philosophical concept of qualia.

TLDR;

Qualia is a concept of certain qualities which cannot be simply understood, they must be experienced. This is the divide between sensing and intuition I am positing, one based on experience and one based on theory (or understanding).

Se-Ni. So Ni users emphasize the importance of clarity of perception. But Se users must as well... So my definitions are that Ni focuses on the intrinsic value (not to be confused with the ethical values of feeling) of the interpretive understanding, with emphasis on a purity of vision, seeing things totally in the context of implication. Se, as its opposite, lets call the extrinsic properties of experience. Seeing things without the burden of interpretation, and seeing purely on the basis of how experienced events interact at face value.

Ne-Si seem more concerned with context. Ne would be the extrinsic properties of understanding, how ideas interconnect and expand to new connections and new ideas. Si would be the intrinsic property of experience. Focusing, the value of an experience for its own sake, with less emphasis on connecting ideas and the unfamiliar, but with the goal of putting everything in context in terms of the user's essential experience, in much the same way that Ni users seek to put the world in context in terms of their interpretation of it.

Anyway, if this is to work, I need feedback on these definitions, and possibly some help wording them to be more clear.

Thanks.So with all the questions about type uncertainty, I thought it'd be interesting to ask the people who are certain.

When did you recognize what type you were? How did you decide? How did you recognize the functions in yourself?Thinking does not equate to valuing the facts. It is impersonal logic, and for that matter, there are two types. Te which is empirical, and concerned with what can be measured and proved (and improved). Ti is rational (as opposed to empirical) using consistency based logic to move from true statement to true conclusion. Facts aren't the defining feature of either of them.

And being a feeling type has nothing to do with emotions. Feeling is an ethical value system where certain things are deemed "good". Emotions are chemical changes in your body. Emotions are not related to a kind of decision making where values dominate.

So please stop calling T vs F: facts vs emotions. It's not true. Anyone can use facts or emotions. Thinking is about being logical, which is distinct from fact orientedness. And feeling is about value judgements.

That is all.Imagine a sea of islands. Infinite islands, really. Each of them within a reasonable distance of a variable amount of islands. Bear with me here.

Now the ENXP wants to travel from island to island in as many different paths as possible. The more islands bordering the island they're currently on, the better. Now the ENXP may be travelling for the novelty and adventure, but they need a purpose for their adventure. So let's say they're categorists. Each island could be understood individually, but for a better picture of the sea, each island should be understood in relation to the others. The ENTP is using Ti to understand the rational causal relationships between the islands, and the ENFP is using Fi to understand possibly the "goodness" of the islands, or the beauty, or the personal or moral significance.

Now the ISXJ is there for a different reason. They are the colonists and civilizationists (is that a word?). Some of the islands are safer than others, some have more resources, and some are in ideal locations. Now the ISXJ is figuring out all of this, the ideal place to begin settling, as well as the other islands they might need access to, and islands that may prove necessary should trouble strike. The ISTJ uses Te to optimize their settlement to be the most efficient possible. The ISFJ uses Fe to smooth interactions between settlers, forge community bonds, and promote group cooperation.

You may have noticed we're missing something important for island traversal. Bridges.

So the Ne user needs to travel between the islands as much as possible, and the Si needs to be able to travel to important islands as often as possible. So we need bridges. And we have a limited amount of supplies for bridges.

Now the Ne user needs to traverse many many islands very quickly, so he just throws down a log from one island to the next. Building a massive bridge will take time, time that he doesn't have. Then he reaches a point where he runs out of supplies. So what does the Ne user do? He burns bridges. He goes back and picks up the logs he left behind, and if he still needs some he goes and steals them from the giant overkill monstrosity of a bridge the Si users have been building.

How does the Ne user decide? With the tertiary function. Now the ENTP knows that Fe has been supporting his travels, recognizing that his work is vital to the community. But the ENTP isn't totally comfortable with Fe, and he doesn't plan on visiting that often, so he goes and deconstructs the Si bridge for supplies or burns the bridge for energy (though in reality he just wants to make sure he can't get to the evil Si lair).

The ENFP knows that Te is supporting him, recognizing that his work is important for optimal efficiency in the city, but the ENFP isn't comfortable with the dehumanizing nature of Te, so he deconstructs and or burns the Si bridge.

Our Si users still need bridges too. The Si user doesn't need to explore, they need to establish their civilization. So they build the best bridges possible (built to last) to the locations they need to reach, with lower quality bridges for dangerous or useless islands. They also need walls to protect them from dangers, and gates should they ever need to leave. All of the things a civilization needs if it intends to last.

Now there are other people out there outside of civilization. The ISFJ recognizes the Ti rational importance of questioning the status quo, but that kind of contradiction is potentially dangerous to the community, so they build walls to keep it out, and gates so that any Ne access is on their own terms. The ISTJ recognizes the importance of Fi moral dissent to prevent them from becoming evil robot corporations, but at the same time, they don't want to be overthrown by anarchists, so they build walls and gates, and invent bureaucracy so that any Ne access is on their own terms.

Hopefully, that metaphor wasn't too long and convoluted to understand, ~~but just convoluted enough so that I don't get Si hate mail.~~I always like to start off these posts with some background. Firstly, I've seen a picture painted of young ENTP's as these arrogant pricks with no regard for the effect of what they say on others. And I don't think this is accurate, but it could just be I'm a weird case. Anyway, this might not address that particular qualm, but it should highlight what I think PoLR Fi actually looks like.

Secondly, I was thinking of Shawn Spencer as an ENTP, and this example came to mind when trying to highlight his Ti use, when it occurred to me that this was more an indication of PoLR Fi.

PoLR Fi

So the example here is the episode of Psych where Juliet finds out Shawn is lying about being psychic. Instead of addressing the issue, Shawn spends the episode by creating an alternate reality in his mind where Juliet didn't find out, and everything is fine between them. When the episode ends, and you expect them to make up, Shawn puts his foot in his mouth because he thinks that the consequences of his actions are the issue, and not the fact that he lied.

Shawn cannot understand that his actions were inherently wrong (lack of Fi). He is basically sorry he got caught, and feels remorse for the external effects (the ruining of the relationship) (Fe use) but not for the action itself.

PoLR Fi

So this one is a little less developed because I just wanted an example to parallel my Psych example, but I think it holds up.

Season 2 of Daredevil, when Matt and Foggy have their falling out. Foggy calls Matt out for his vigilantism, pointing out the negative consequences it's having on the people and lives around him. Matt understands that hurting the people he cares about is wrong, but he also can't stop being a vigilante. He makes it clear that he can't just sit by and do nothing (Fi use), no matter what the consequences are. Doing the right thing is more important to him than the effect his actions have on others (lack of Fe). Notice how this directly inverts Shawn's motivations.


Anyway, that's it. Hopefully this helps us understand the EXTP's and the IXTJ's, while also giving us a clearer picture of Fe and Fi in isolation. Let me know if you have any questions or issues with my description.
ENTP with bipolar disorder, possible schizotypy

I follow an account on tumblr who seems to think there could be a link between certain personality disorders and personality types. And the wikipedia page for Schizotypal Personality Disorder claims that people with StPD tend to be INTPs. You might be interested in that.

EDIT: It seems like there are multiple INTPs on here that claim to be schizotypal, so there legit could be some correlation going on here. If anybody finds research on that outside of wikipedia, send me a link. I'd also be interested in hearing from ENTPs with schizotypy of some sort.Well... I have bipolar II, so I'm prone to what my therapist calls "hypomania." If you look up the definition of hypomania, its description sounds a lot like Ne: enthusiastic, a heavy flow of ideas, talking quickly, excitable. Any time I mention to my therapist that I feel "confident" or like I'm "in my normal personality" she swears it's actually hypomania. But whatever, man. Maybe "hypomania" is my "normal"

I do know that when I take the mbti test while depressed, I almost always score as an INFP, even tho I virtually never use Fi.
&gt;Like nothing is immediately true or false

Pretty much. Until you sit down and weed out the possibilities, everything that can be, truly is. The small sample of data points we work with (Si) and the heavy pruning of Ti (in my case) bring it back down to the "real world". So I tend to perceive the ideal world or the system as a whole, I just need anchors here and there to make sure the curve's a best fit for that data. &gt;There's barely any posts on there even remotely related to mbti in general! 

And that's why I like it!

Edit: Ah come on people, let's not downvote him just because we disagree.ENTP - BASc and MASc Mechanical Engineering, looking to add a PhD to that list... It seems I'm bound to stay in school for a while more. lolTo discuss all of these interests with people who understand the way we approach the world. To discover new hobbies and be presented with new interesting material to pour over and analyse. Most of these "unrelated" topics allow for debating interesting ideas. Honestly the 'type me' posts and the 'I don't understand the functions' posts get boring as hell once you've got a grasp on the functions. MBTI isn't an infinite source of knowledge, there is very little left to learn after a few months, so r/entp is just a community of like minded individuals who'll answer MBTI questions and give advice once in a while.How is talking about what ENTPs like doing and talking about things ENTPs like to discuss not talking about ENTPs?Go on r/entp and talk about greek philosophy and you'll most likely get people discussing whatever it was you brought up. The point is, ENTPs talk about almost anything and it's totally not surprising to see the exact same behaviour in the sub.Serious question: Other than 'just do it', which is how I approach being productive, what other solutions would you offer people? 

I don't think people like having a bunch of unfinished projects. I mean, I shelf lots of things which aren'tcompleted, but completing them wasn't really my goal when I set off either. It's just part of the process 

But I'll agree, I don't like it when people hide their failures behind the ENTP stereotype, which seems to happen fairly often. In high school I took the test but I believed it was a bunch of hocus and answered to be INTJ, my professor pointed out there was no way I was introverted but honestly growing up compared to the other kids I felt like an introvert. So I retook the test and I think I either got ENTJ or P, skimmed over the descriptions and just thought the test was too generic. 

So flash forward 10 years and I just stumbled on the test, took it with honesty this time and typed as ENTP. I then learned about the cognitive functions and they really explained how I processed information and reacted to it. And no-one's stopping them, which is why I fail to see the problem. You want to talk mbti then ask mbti related questions. Be the change you want to see, no?But that same post gets upvoted. Just looking at the last week's worth of post (around 50-60 posts) there are 4 with less than 5 comments and most posts have 20 plus comments. Honestly if you don't care about a subject don't read it, but chances are the ENTP posting is trying to find that one other ENTP that's also into it.I think the ENTP sub tends to attract a few assholes who identify as ENTP because they argue and like to argue...Just look at the side bar, almost all of what you'd actually want to know about MBTI is linked there. Why go over the same story 50 times a week? Or should we keep discussing the same subject day in day out without progress just to keep the circlejerk going? There's no rule that disallows off topic posts, so I really don't get what's the point in limiting the scope of a forum community of people who tend to love varied and often unrelated things. &gt;It's because there's other forums for that!

What if I don't care to just talk about a subject but in fact I'm looking to talk about that subject to other like minded individuals? 

&gt;MBTI is a theory and there's an endless amount of questions to it, it's not like there's only 50 questions that can be asked on it. 

Oh come on, there's 8 functions, 16 arrangements of 4 functions and like 4 loops per type but since half the types are just E/I flipped they share the same loops.

That's nowhere near infinite, that's very clearly in the finite realm. 

&gt;Its an ENTP sub, again like I said before, when I get on an ENTP sub, I want to talk ENTP and MBTI, 

You seem very concerned that things should follow their labels. Do you separate your peas from your potatoes so that they don't mix in your plate?

&gt;The sidebar doesn't have all the answers, I mean come on! Not everything you need to know about MBTI is on there. Are you crazy?

It does have the answers to most of the basic questions, and like I said, nothing prevents you from starting the discussion you whish to have. Maybe the fact 90% of the stuff that's posted is unrelated to mbti because that's what 90% of the participants care for.&gt;None of your points even cancel out mine. 

I'm sorry but it's the other way around, you've only repeated yourself over and over, that the sub has a label and people should stick to it. Whereas I've presented to you various points of views, different angles and possibilities.

&gt;You still can't address the fact that it's an ENTP sub and it was created to discuss ENTP and MBTI,

That's like, your opinion, man. 

There's nothing in the rules of that sub that says its users can't post whatever they're interested in. 

&gt;so you for some reason attempt to insult me by that little peas crack of yours, good one! 

Thanks, I'll just point out you're the one who's been calling me crazy for simply disagreeing with you.

&gt;It's weird to see an Ne Dom think that a theory is "finite",

It isn't weird that a Ne-Ti user would get bored from a concept he's grasped. It's a vast subject applicable to the whole of human experience, but it's barely got any variation. Don't get me wrong there's plenty of theory crafting that can be done via mbti, but the average posts doesn't even come close to advance theory crafting. 

&gt;most of us believe in endless possibilities, especially with theories.

ENFPs are more prone to believing in endless possibilities, Ti has a tendency to cut out and severely prune the tree of possibilities.

&gt;If you think there's only 50, then you don't understand how theories work. 

One truly understands a theory when he can simplify it to its purest and most condensed form. At that level of abstraction you can easily have families of questions which all have the same answer. So yeah there's a fixed number of basic questions.

&gt;You are crazy if you think there's only a certain small amount. 

There you go again.

&gt;Yes it is technically finite, but not one that we are even close to reaching in numbers. 

And then you contradict yourself...

Maybe it's just this small sample and because we're discussing a preference that's having an effect, but your arguments seem to be Te heavy in their construction. 

&gt;That sidebar has basic questions like you said, so what about more complex questions? You just set yourself up right there. 

Ehhhh no, they can just ask em. lol

I never said we didn't discuss mbti when it creeps up. I'm just saying all subjects are welcomed.

&gt;Most people I know on MBTI subs on here know the basics, but they enjoy getting into the complex stuff, so basically that sidebar is almost useless for the majority of us who already know the basics.  

Well judging by how many 'type me' threads there are here where people have no idea about functions, or how often it comes up in specific type subs that someone asks questions which clearly shows they don't know the basics, I'd have to posit that you only know a few people who theorise that way and are applying that perspective as a blanket statement.Believe it or not I was enjoying writing these rebuttals. I mean the creativity of your argument was lacking, but it was entertaining enough to pass time while nursing my hangover.

&gt;EDIT: you argue like an ESTJ

That supposed to be an insult? 

Bah since you're not going to reply I just bid you good night! :)Well what's your argument for being Fe dominant? Same question for being a Te dom. 

Just one possibility, if you feel you may be feeling dominant have you considered something like ENFP? In that case you'd have Ne-Fi which can sometimes act as Fe and then a well developed Te. I mean without having more info that's only conjecture.For sports, I like analysing and then deconstructing my opponent's style with counters.

In a real fight, dirty, vicious and unrelenting. I'm bigger than most, and if I bring someone down I can use my size to control them.Can't help but wonder why people are downvoting this. This is exactly what these two functions are in an animalistic sense. Se is attuned to the environment and to gather all the details. Having a propensity for enjoying the physical aspects of a hunt is a major bonus. Si on the other hand is the function that gathers outcomes and evaluates them in terms of the risks involved. It litterally is the "let's ration our food because we know winters are long" function.Bahaha that's a really good explanation.I'm not a girl but if you have questions about ENTPs shoot.Ah, that explains it. Smooth talking comes from practice more than it being an innate trait in ENTPs. Ti-Fe values accuracy and truth more than being considerate of how people feel about it. Not sure what you mean by conflicting balance. In IxTP, Ti is highest in stack and they repress Fe. Well they're close to each other in the stack, but not really that close in the thought process. That's why ENTPs will debate ad nauseum and question everything. As Fe develops when they mature it mostly shows up as dropping an argument they know has no point. Or they'll drop it because, well having friends is more fun than having everyone pissed off at you.

It's more a tempering of the primary Ne-Ti behaviour with a Fe-Si judgement based on prior experiences.

My mom's ISFJ, so the difference really comes in as conflict avoidance. She'll avoid conflict in the first place, whereas I'll only drop an argument to maintain the peace if I value said peace.It's not really muddled together.... Ne-Ti is how we process the world, when that's not enough we fall back onto Fe-Si, but that feel unnatural and draining, especially in immature ENTPs. Well assuming you are indeed an ISFJ, Ti developing would be this questioning of things that don't make sense. Ti's good at finding flaws in things and hates when something can't stand up to scrutiny. It would also show up in you being more comfortable holding your ground if you really think there is a problem, because you've grown surer of your thought process.

Edit: The other way to differentiate between the two types is the Ne-Si divide. ENTPs value novelty, chaos and resist planning to maintain flexibility, our motto is: "I'll just wing it." Whereas an ISFJ prefers security, order and resist deviating from the plan for an unknown quantity.Because it's a reassuring story that takes away people's existencial dread. It gives a purpose to this meaningless existence and that makes it easier to accept.

Edit: word orderThe question of whether or not a god exists is pointless, it can't be answered. So I don't bother with it. There are better things I can do in life than to worry about pointless things. Apatheism is the label of that stance, I guess it's technically a subset of Agnosticism, which is often by default an Atheist stance... 

Short answer, no.Most NTPs I've met I got along great with.Just need an ENTP to barge in and start talking. That's basically what happens with my 2 INTP friends.I have a better understanding of what is normal for me and what really is normal for others. I know in more certain terms in which situations I shine and thrive and where I stagnate. It's allowed me to see what a healthy me should look like and some tools to reach/maintain it. An emotional response that indicates the importance of a person in my life. Lol I think I can't hide it when I despise someone. It just shows right through. I'm pretty sure it's a TP problem in general. Team sports, preferably one with explosive outbursts and even better if it's got a fair dose of physicality. Love me some hockey!

Barring that, I'll go swimming.Milkman, it's the only reasonable answer!And spacial!We shine in the night!/end thread. I'm empathetic, I fake sympathy. What do you think an operation is?I really don't get where the male ENTP sterotype of the aggressive cocksure playboy guy comes from. I know a few male ENTPs, myself included, who are all super relaxed, passionate about their interest but in an engaging sort of way rather than in an aggressive way. Most seem a bit awkward or ill at ease in large groups and rather just find someone on the side to chat with. As much as the stereotype has us as playboys, most are just completely oblivious that they're being seen as flirty. 

Maybe it's just the ENTPs I've met, but they all tend to meet the distracted professor stereotype rather than the playboy crooner.Other than having my tissues expand and my mucous membranes boil away?That's essentially the difference between Fe and Fi.
I'll start; ENTP: We want to understand.As an ENTP I have to point out the logical flaws here. It's a circle. It has no corners. 
And I would just sit on my flag, watch people screw each other over, and jump up as there were only the last 10% left.For any Ne doms my absolute nr. 1 advice is to be alert in class. I surfed through all the way up thru middle school just listening, making connections and remembering from class. I always did good in school, and almost always when I was stuck on a test I was able to remember something my teacher said, and spin off from there. 

Also in Uni I've had great healp from this. Go to class, every single day, be alert and try making connections about everything you learn.I literally have no idea why people want to be ENTPs either. I am an ENTP, but once I read the descriptions I felt like all the stereotypes is that we are rude and cold :P 
Honestly tho, it's much more to us than that..Honestly dude, I think you have mistyped yourself as an INTP, you sound like and ENTP. 
Now hear me out, cuz I can relate to a lot you have written here from my childhood. 

I was socially awkward but usually had no idea what I did wrong. 
It was about age 15-16 I realize this was a fact and I wanted to change it. By studying others behaviour and analyzing my own, I was able to pinpoint what parts of my behaviour was not socially acceptable and change it. 
Being able to do this is not actually common for INTPs, they have Fe as their 4th function and ENTPs have it as their 3rd. This tiny differance often makes ENTPs more adapt to social understanding. Though most ENTPs also feel different and not very happy about small talk. We wanna discuss the universe and why the moon landing might be fake. 

ENTPs are also known as the most introvert extraverts. And personally I have been prone to have depressions. Often because I have felt very different from my peers, and struggling to make real connections with people around me. 

It's hard to say what type you are, but try looking into it.I'd like to try and make a chart to understand each type, with one sentence that describes your type best. Try to refrain from long sentences with a lot of adjectives. 
It would be cool if we would be able to find a one sentence referance point for newbies to MBTI.
Formatting please.Someone can link something about shadow functional stack ?

I'm too lazy to search for something to link to OP. Thanks in advance ! =)ENTP, My best friend for over a decade is an ESTP.

I monologue, because I can't usually keep up with my own brain, he knows how to slow down his pace to be able to parse what's happening.

I space out and daydream while thinking, he remains aware and sharp, while listening to my ramblings.

I play games that ask for symbolic sensitivity : sandboxes, enigma based games, contemplative games.

He plays more reflex based and skill based games : shooting games a bit. Mostly MMORPGs, because he also enjoy reading about the historic context and mundane quest details like I do.

We used to play fast paced versus games, together. He usually have the better on me, because I couldn't analyse his patterns on the go as quickly as he could. Better reflexes, and sharper in the moment awareness.

He's more responsible and grounded than I am, even though I used to be able to predict things better than he did on the long run, as I base myself on some symbolics he didn't notice sometimes. He's able to understand where I came from, even though he couldn't see it, and same of me.

We end up trusting each other on our strengths on that : I trust his first impression, He trusts my symbolic pattern recognition.How old your SO is ?

I'm 24.

ExTP tend to be really drawn by videogames, because the mental obstacles of those games are more suited to our thinking than what's happen in real life. Especially for ENTPs.

I love this kind of coincidence. =)

I was thinking about telling you to show him this thread, but I remembered how addicted to Reddit I am ...

I felt at home when ending up on /r/entp the first time.

Just go saying hi there : we're really welcoming arbeit a bit mischievous.Just show him. We're curious by nature. If he act like if he isn't interested I see only two reason for that :

 * He's biased about Reddit. He thinks he knows what it is, but ignore parts that are interesting : puns, memes, the community.

 * He knows all that is needed to be known, but don't care because he uses another website for that. My guess are 4chan and 9gag. 

Get him off 9gag is easy : they steal Reddit's content. If he's a 9gagger, he unknowingly browse Reddit in fact, more or less.

But we take some of our content from 4chan. I don't go their, because it's a shithole, but people find raw diamond in all that shit. I have no idea how to seduce 4channers.How did you archived to remain 5 years with a reclusive stone ?

Seems pretty clear to me he knows nothing about making compromises.

Unless you have a good reason to bear all that, just say him goodbye. It feels like you're going anywhere, here.

(And, no, inferior Fe will just be annoying at best. Being a regular reader of this sub, I know how desperately clueless INTPs are about ethics.)Ironic.

The concept of an ENTP who don't notice that his Facebook feed isn't a ginormous pile of crap is alien to me.

So I can infer he's 0 about popculture ?

How explaining why I'm cyberdependant to someone who don't want to understand how a computer works, and what the fuck is Internet ?

It's light years from where I stand. I can't make a bridge for meeting him.

Fed by the SJ western culture. Girl, he's in a bad situation, for the little I can imagine.Believe. I'm just no Mulder, here.

Meeting needs is some kind of priority to me in an intimate relationship.

Seems still hugely unbalanced to me.Tell him that you couple's integrity is in peril if he don't care more about it.

Tell him you're tired compomizing alone, and he needs to learn about ethics.

Tell him it's totally an ultimatum, and that's what happens when someone's needs aren't met.It bugs me you say your SO shrugs off introspection.

I don't understand. It's a really intimate moment to partake.Fair enough.

But it means two things : 

 * You aren't confident enough in him to tell him that.

 * You aren't confident in yourself enough to want to get that sorted out.

You can ask him to be gentle. You'll eventually get issues with that. You'll eventually need feedback.

I repeat myself. I already made this point a couple of hours back to someone else. Boring. Repetitive.Nothing to argue against that.The fact you got both your ethics an your couple integrity in check ?

I was merely tying : we just talked to each other in an other thread.

I knew you were pretty much in check already : you got me questionning my ENTPness. I didn't happenned to me in ages.

It says a lot, tbh.Nope ?

Was tired. I remember what I tried to say but it's so screwed up I can't fix it. I'll let it that way.

I said I wanted feels and not be informed.

I'm not a machine.Thank you !ISTP.How about NeTi ?I know. I just wanted a prompt for discussion, as nothing really caught my attention in your OP.

Scatter brained ?

Reading you are an ISFJ reminded me ISFJ/ENTP socionics's dual pairing.

I remember the concept of quadrants. It may interest you about complementarity.

I have really nothing to say here.

Your monolithic and straightforward writing let me no grip.

I came here just because I want to learn more about ISFJs, but I feel a bit out of place.I'm pretty sure you're an ISFJ.

I think I would have took as a challenge to make you aware of your mistyping if I was believed you weren't an ISFJ.

I see you Si backed up by your Fe.

All in place.

That's why I have no grip, too.I call Fe and Fi introverted/extroverted ethics.

I really don't think it has only to do with emotions.

I think as a thinker you would have harder time to het back on rails when thongs get awry, for example.

I believe I may have hard time sorting my values and and act on clear principles, or take care of my mental integrity as a Fe user, for instance.What about the relevancy ?

It was about intertype complementarity, right ?

II think I've missed something, but I don't see what.I used to be an excellent tactician, taking advantage of contextual ressources efficiently, and a bad strategist, not being able to maintain an effort coherent really long.

I think the difference remain here.

INTPs are strategists, ENTPs tacticians.You're lucky !

I, for one, like to be a good opponent.&gt; Tactics are constantly changing and being updated contextually and require updates regularly, therefore also requiring more concentration over time.

But works better with bursts of atention than followed up attention.

I's not meant to win a whole war. Just a few battles.

&gt;wherein you develop a strategy over time and it informs your decisions without necessarily being consistently updated unless it proves to be ineffective.

I personally need to update my strategies quite frequently.

That's why i don't set up one very often.

&gt;anecdotally as a true blue ENTP I've always found "strategy" games much more entertaining than "tactics" games.

But you're better at tactical games, right ?

Especially one that allow rapid strategic changes and lots of room for creativity.

&gt;That may mean nothing, though, as there's always the possibility of a misnomer.

Yeah. I don't think Japanese Tactical RPGs are really games that involve tactic, as I've described it here, for example.

Game/video game genre naming is a huge mess to me.&gt; tactical games are games like Halo and Gears of War.

Minecraft seem more tactical to me.

Globally most action RPGs seem tactical too.

I just hate first person shooters. Reflex based when I have a really slow reaction time, is not something really comfortable.&gt; Minecraft is virtual Legos. 

Not in survival.

You need to fight before being able to do any intendance.

&gt;Assassins Creed has a bit of both.

I prefer free running and randomly slaughter any guard I meet. =)

I didn't played since AC2.

&gt;Good for the teenagers.

The kind of game I'm get taught life by 13 years olds.

That's why I play games I need to get really extensive knowledge, and need nearly no eye hand coordination. It puts me back to my place in the circle of life, teaching 13 years olds about the importance of intendance and preparation.
They just feel the need to say they are calm enough, but can reach their limits if pushed.

I was about to bet INTP, too.That's what I said. =)I have no idea how one could reach that conclusion with another reasoning.

I really wished you were providing a different reasoning.Ne Fe agenda. We can end up as manipulative narcissists.

Even more dangerous considering we can give an impression of cluelesness when we're in fact pretty masterful. Ne. With a dash of Si nostalgia.I used to really hate Ti, but I really liked the way you described it.

Really interesting. 

I'm wondering about X-posting it on /r/ENTP, both because the guys there are curious enough to care (Ne dom obligates.), and because we have a couple of home INTJs there.Ne, only when we're energized, and Fe is really more structure and order focused.

When you understand we mostly use our Fe to pick up on social cues to not make fool of ourselves, and know if a bit of foolishness is relevant, you understand quickly Fe is not childlike at all, when an ENTP focus hard on it.

That, and do you know what a bored ENTP looks like ? It's the best moment to see our Ti when our Ne is disengaged like that. The best moment to see we aren't only playful jocks.
I don't remember the shadow roles well. I remember the 7th is the vulnerable. I remember how I struggle with my Fi.

I'm knowledgeable enough in typology to have in mind it's about preferences. So yeah we have the all 8 function.

We're supposed to be the shadow of each other. I used to be really depressed and stressed younger, acting like a shitty version of INTJs.

I think I have experience of what thinking like an INTJ is like, but it never be as eloquent as how you did putted it there.

X-post on the way !&gt; ENTP Ne is never disengaged.

It's necessary. We end up annoying people if we don't.

Ti and Fe can drive a bit in the meanwhile. It asks fo quite some work but we can pass as normal enough in Si focused environnements.

&gt; Also, ENTPs as jocks? What strange planet are you living on?

You just described ENTPs as childlike entertainers. I call that being a playful jock.

It doesn't really matter because I was trying to explain we usually have another side.&gt; Personne peu éteindre leur fonction principal, ils seraient laisser avec la capacité mentale de quelqu'un un quart de leur âge.

Only the half. Ti can take the lead.

And it's more than enough to be manipulative.

Especially when you are in your 40's. A 20 years old TI can really handle a 30 year old Fi or make believe a 30 year old Si things that don't exist.

That, and using Ne for framework analysis and instant flaw finding.

A ENTP who settle himself for manipulation is a juggernaugt successfully disguised in a big crappy cargo.

&gt;90% of the entertaining that ENTPs do is accidental

Naaaaah. It only looks accidental.

&gt;by definition they are hella Ne with only a dash of Fe. 

Will you be able to tell the difference with an ENTP who hides a devellopped Fe, looking childlike, from your by the book genuinly childish ENTP (that I'm not even sure they exist past 17-18 years old …)

&gt;I called them children, because the way they go through life is as an excited 5-year-old would.

I don't go through life like a 5 years old.  I go through life like an adult who see how foolish and shallow our culture is, and decided to call his inner 5 years old to bring a bit of entertainement.

It doesn't clearly mean I'm irresponsible and unthoughtful. Just that I ended up make you think I am, because you don't seem able to see through the cardboard disguise it is, so I just prefer to tell you you're right.

Imagine now someone put actual effort in this disguise. That's my whole argumentation here.I'm clearly not an ESxJ. It's obvious.

I'm 24.

I've set fluid definitions just to see how you get your mind around this kind of things.

Aaaaaaaand you don't. It's the book or nothing. Disappointing. 

I feel like I'm wasting my time trying to get your eyes off the thousands of pages you read on MBTI.

I read a lot, too. Enough to know you don't find everything written. Enough to be reminded it's needed to experience things to have a good grasp of it, and have the right tools to get through, instead of remaining stuck on the stereotypes.&gt; They don't get any more conniving or masterminding, not really.

I don't say we did I said we could, witch you were highly skeptical because you seem to hold a really rigid mind frame about that.

I believe such rigid mind frames are born from studying and not confronting beliefs to experience. I can be wrong about that.

&gt;The suave entrepreneur or the devil's advocate are ENTP stereotypes, and bad ones.

Of course I was talking of those stereotypes. I was talking about them as stereotypes, when you take your really rigid typing as granted.

I don't even want to tell you about what changes I made to the Jungian theory. How you speak your ideas makes me think you'll deem them as garbage without second thought.

Like I feel like you're doing with my argumentation as a whole. I need you to give a second though, but I'm running out of patience.

&gt;I'm talking about the nature of dominant Ne, which is to chase novelty first and everything else is secondary.

Nope. We have deeper reason than running after novelty like dogs run after cans attached to cars.

Once you've understood these principle you'll understand that we can perfectly settle for comfort and routine, decide to keep our bullshit for ourselves or even passing as someone adult and civilized, without feeling alienated or annoyed.

&gt;I'm also saying you can't turn off your dominant function and if you insist that you can, then it's probably not your dominant.

I didn't said turn off. I just say put it more in the background for a while.

I'm not even sure you're aware cognition is just a part of one's thinking, or that MBTI is far more fluid than what you describe, because it's about **preferences**.

Read me carefully because I think I'll put less and less care for getting my point across, unless you show me you've understood what I'm trying to convey.
And 5 ENTPs are the Master Race.

Bow before your Craplords of dank memes.ENTP + something something autism spectrum ?

He reminds me of myself ...How about his social life ? =)&gt; he is not so hopeless after all.

Me neither …

I had a few friends back in the day.

I can even attend events social events. With not too much problem.

&gt;That's all I can say about him.

You're telling us here you don't know him very well with that.

You know what he wants to de but not really where he came from, or how he lives the trivial part of his life.

Just how he is when he's with you, more or less.

That's not enough to type him accurately, really confirm or dismiss my intuition for sure enough or tell really anything relevant about him, for that matter.

I can't help you.

I've seen some others tell the same here.&gt; (shame on me, I think I'll go to hell for this, heaven is overrated, eh?)

Me neither. I'm an infidel, worshipping chaos.

&gt;he's pretty much honest to almost everything but he can't do smalk talk much 

Autistic people are known to be loyal.

I am because I follow people's will, without being able to fully grasp their intent.

It's hard for everyone, but especially harder to me, not paying attention to the cues they may give about that.

Think small talk as a bundle of social codes. Really poor in meaning from the linguistic standpoint.

Now imagine someone who uses linguistic mastery to crack the code. It's like hurting your knee on furniture a dozen times in a row. I can do small talk, as I was given some keys for it, but I'll never ever enjoy it, remembering my first attempts.

&gt;unless he is not familiar with the topic

Like every one, or you just both end up discussing a very very very few topics.

I don't say he have no conversation, just really competent only in very specific areas.

&gt; except politics or social problems

Hahaha. I should have bet on that. =D

&gt;When he solves a main problem, he goes to another, until he solves that one too.

Relentlessly but one after the other. With that slow earthy might.

Sharp eye, but slow uncoordinated hand.

&gt;Same goes to his project work.

I know that too well too.

I have shit 6 month late to deliver. I don't do it, because I reach my limits doing it. I'm not wired for that.

&gt;uncertainty (when it comes to decisions) 

Witch comes from a chronical lack of awareness on this area ?

&gt; and laziness which he tries to solve.

Hahaha.

Tell him laziness can't be solved. If it's a trait, like most people refer to when using this world, you'll be like that until the day you die. It's a sentence for life. it's written in your genes and on your skin.

If not, with I think it more realistically be, it's a lack.

 * A lack of motivation. It's about purpose. Nothing to do with technic. Most people have to face that sooner or later, and noone is prepared, as I vaguely implied a bit above : it's mistaken for laziness, when we just don't know what to do.

 * A lack of competency, not to mistaken with a lack of technical mastery. Remember it can't be compensated by working twice as much. There's sometimes workarounds about that, but considering in this case we could talk about a lack of mirror neurons and the biological neuronal wiring that goes with, he needs help about that.

 Because I need help about that.&gt;Thank you, I shall continue to save my energy for next week then.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

As you wish. I'm more about balance, but it's not my life.Hanzo's backstory is accompanied with a nice symbolic tale. I bet for intuitive.

Maybe INFJ.&gt;Aaand now I’m getting off topic.

Screams Ne Dom. =D

ENxP. I bet on feeler, at this point.

&gt;Everything else can be figured out later. (or I can just leave up to someone to else to properly organize :P)

Bwhahaha. Definitely Ne Dom. XD

Too smart for our own good.

&gt;Crazy animal might try to attack the car for some reason?

You're aware it has basically no chance to happen ?

It's more the other way around that s likely : the car crushing an innocent deer who tried to get on the other side of the road at the worst moment.

No animal is dumb enough to attack a metallic monster that is at least twice as bigger and twice as heavier than them, without telling nothing about the nonsensical speed comparison.

&gt;I’d also probably size them up and make sure they’re treating my friend or sibling well.

It amuses me. The ol' protective big brother trope.

I'm not really concerned about my little sister : she can punish the fool better than I would ever be able to.

&gt;resisting the urge to argue with them.

And that insidious little voice in your head that tries to seduce you in giving in. 

Only Ne doms have such inner fights.

&gt;PDA

What is that ?

&gt;Also third wheeling.

It's always awkward as hell. Bonus point if one of the to others is you ex. Epic awkwardness if both are your ex.

&gt;Aka, I’d probably say something a bit blunt/harsh and apologise immediately afterwards. Because I’m awkward like that.

Not sure if awkward and smoochy ENTP or awkward and blunt ENFP.

ENFP ?Te dom vs Ni dom.

Socially introverted ENTJ is concerned by efficiency over symbolic but struggle with anything people related, and socially extroverted INTJ is concerned by symbolic meaning, but can ditch that for the sake of the quality of their relationships.

I don't really know 7w8 type profile. [I'm not really into Pokemon.](https://xkcd.com/178/)Car 1 - Ram 0

It reminds me cynic jokes I have about the Paris-Dakkar Race.

I'm not sure anything exist to wash the bloodstains on their bull bars.I think so.

It's a reference to XKCD. I love the comic and I often find funny having a catchphrase to condescendingly dismiss anything.

It's more of a meme than a real intentional effort from my part.&gt; I saw it and was like "Heyyyy. This guy."

Sometimes it's more "Ugh … This guy agaaaaain …"

What I do is more called echolalia than a real deep reference, because I often lack of understanding about the context of both the situation I'm in and the initial context of what I'm referencing.

I don't really care if I'm out of context, sometimes. I love so much making out of the blue references like that.I made myself sure I was knowledgeable enough about the biggest fandom of the Internet, and I try to keep myself up to date. Ne helps a lot.

I'm a meme master. I know they are both social doors and keys for places around the internet an for some IRL social circles.

I said I was usually unsure of what I talk about. Not that I had no idea.&gt; Which is?

Typo. Forgot a "s".

&gt;It's like the internet has made up a language for itself.

It's just there is place where such codes are left for anyone to take their.

But there is the same thin IRL.

&gt;And that there are rivalries between them.

Not everywhere. I flee from this kind of conflicts.

&gt;Using a meme IRL is usually a gamble, but it's great when it pays off.

I prefer using private jokes and shared social codes.

I use memes only if they are from a shared social space. I want nobody feel excluded because of my jokes, as I've been excluded that way before.

I know how painful it is.

&gt;I was just thinking about how if I reference BBCs Sherlock for example, and then it turns out that I'm not an honest-to-God Cumberbitch, I'm in trouble.

You met radical fans.

I know places people explain such codes for everyone to feel included.

It's the same place I said there were no regional conflict.

But it means watching an animated serie intended for 5 year old girls.My guess on ENFJ.

I don't really recall any thinker focussing that much on relationships. So feeler is pretty obvious to me.

You see people as more than their types, but accurately type them.

You're not lazy, you just seem to focus a lot on team effort and coordination, making alone work pretty tedious to yourself.

You fit well in hierarchies, but struggle a bit in interpersonal contacts. That's what makes me tell you're an intuitive.

You see the principles and the movements behind what happens, but loose focus on practical details. That's how you could write your descriptions that concisely.
&gt; (unless they are already predisposed to liking me).

It's called having bad social skills.

I think I know how it feels like pretty well. Don't fear too much.

Nobody can deal with the shit our society became.

&gt;Do those hesitancies make sense and do you have any insight about them?

Yup.

I gave insight for the first, and I have in store for the second, too.


/!\ TVTropes /!\


I really see Fe as this [hammy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam) mask you described.

I can be theatrical, too when I need to make a presentation, or get a point across, as a finishing move.

I promote positivity that way, usually, whereas I just bluntly prompt how I feel where I don't wear as much social filters, like on Reddit.

I don't take time to measure the effects of my loud promotions. I'm not good to do so, anyway.

I feel like you were just told it wasn't something right to do when you're really competent in that. &gt; not the hyper specifics that you're ticking off.

What is those ?

&gt;What is an ENFJ?

Someone who prefer to use their extroverted ethics to understand their surroundings, and back it up with their introverted intuition.

More or less. That's my definition, but I need yours.

&gt;Every ENFJ I've known or seen has been a person who could encourage action towards a specific direct by using emotions or someone who could unify people through common wants.

They are adept of matching people by their shared values and motivate them by their personal needs.

They know well how a group work but are less potent with fewer people.

You may be an exception, if you struggle as much as you said for social matters. You like doing so, but you'll need to put extra effort to pull the same than other ENFJs, for example.

I may be projecting about that, so keep your grain of salt for this specific point.

&gt; If these sorts of things don't manifest, what even makes someone an ENFJ?

Cognitive preferences. That's all MBTI is about, to me.
Not being able to act the way you prefer don't mean you think otherwise.

Or maybe I just mistaken.

&gt; Hyper specific logic that could be bent in completely different directions and still be valid?

Not logic. Intuition.

Laser guided intellectual shortcuts. Mental paths following symbolic association and abstract principles.

It couldn't care less about logic. It's right as long as the principles apply. And most of the time, they do.

You may not be as sharp as INxJs to see when it applies and when not anymore, but still can perceive blurry limits.

All that is that way to you only if I'm correct.
&gt;  but then you have to break down what extroverted ethics and introverted intuition mean, and what it means to lead with those functions.

Yup. Role and function.

Dominant Fe : 

Nuanced and fine perception of other people's value system, belief system, wants, needs, insecurities and area of control/responsibility and intimacy. A natural affinity for learning any skills related to such perception. A potency to foresee synergies between people in a group, and deduce group dynamics. Good at influencing efficiently and unnoticeably such dynamics. Usually a blind spot about all that for self, as it's Fi's domain. But Fe doms still have a good unconscious grasp of Fi.

Auxiliary Ni : 

Manages memories and knowledge according to symbolic and abstract similarity. Ni is an efficient and quick thinking, as long as no concrete specifics are asked. Ni don't manage factoids, as they have nearly to no symbolic and abstract value. Ni is great at deducing underlying structures and mechanics. Supporting dom Fe,  aux Ni take care of the the social dynamics and synergies, sparing Fe a bit.

Tertiary Se : 

Childish awareness of the immediate surroundings. Focused on aesthetic pleasure and visual balance, along Dom Fe, instead of the pragmatic and sharp feature awareness of Se doms. ENFJ's ter Se is the concrete pendant to their feature peacemaker strength.

But they can easily be mislead by it, pursuing mistakingly some search of beauty or physical pleasure when their competencies are needed.

Inferior TI :

ENFJs find little value about the formal logical construction of their knowledge. It usually goes against their peacemaker role, preventing them from acting when needed and breaking the social balance in which they putted heart and care, even though they are sometimes impressed by people who show clear-sightedness and take time to work on their understanding : key features of Ti dom/aux.

Feeeew. Finished.

I hope you can relate.
You even don't like that ?

You're just not good ?

I gave you the standard by function breakdown. It's normal you don't fit all of it : no one can.

What I'm trying to do is to find a "good enough" match.
Te ? ENTJ ?

Nah. Most ENTJs just stare at me blankly when I talk about all that. You do have some kind of understanding, despite not being able to act on it.

I think it's time I tell you my secret weapon of typing : I'm autistic.

It also mean I nearly have no cognitive empathy, and a huge emotional empathy, AKA I really know what you described as social incompetency.

I see things, but no one believe me or understand me when I talk my mind.

I had to put my whole cognition back on rails by myself, before expecting anything from anyone. I did it.

But my cognitive balance is still a bit off, according to my personal preferences and needs. I'm typable, but I'm clearly not a textbook case.

Why would you be a textbook case ?

Why you came here in the first place ?You summed all the details I based my intuition on. Impressive.

Nice outlook with the dynamics under MBTI's scope.Thanks ! =D&gt; but at the end of the day if the textbook says XYZ and XYZ aren't true I feel like I have my answer.

I'm telling you nothing works like that.

You must be more than a textbook case, because else, you're a freak of nature to me.

&gt;I'm looking for insight

I have the intuition you search for more than just a couple of insight. You're too invested for just that.

&gt;I really do appreciate everything you're saying and doing.

And only tell me nothing fits you the whole process. I can adjust nothing if you don't give me pointers.

Maybe you appreciate it, but I haven't done yet what I came for : making you a complete typing assessment.

I've done between a third and a half. I really need your feedback to finish it just right.


I want you to tell me what fits to you and what don't fits to you.

I want to give you the most accurate profile I can. For that I need to adjust the function stack, see if no swap apply, and make sure you're typable. 

Anything that help me to do any of these is fine to me.Before anything : I'm a french native speaker.

Your use of french word out of context hurt my brain hard. Some words are correct, other are … Ugh.

It reminds me of Quebec, somehow.

I need sleep to parse your four temperament ensemble concepts, pass by the names, and integrate it.

It's a Ni thing. My Ne will have hard time in this kind of things.

I'll dismantle it with my Ti. It's less effort, but take me more time.

See you in a couple of hours !Back !

So we have : 

Coup d'état : Warriors ?

Savoir-faire : Expert of intendance and concrete delivery. Our xSTJ majority.

Je-ne-sais-quoi : A part of your description remained in my mind, "in touch with the unspeakable nature of life" Our feelers, mostly.

Avant-garde : Innovators. people at the edge of human knowledge, who strive daily expanding it. Our NT Prometheans. We know how to play with fire.

Your comparisons states you have low "savoir faire".

It means either inferior Si or Se.

I bet for Se, meaning you're more of an INFJ (Dom Ni, Aux Fe, Ter Ti and Inf Se.)

Where ENFJs are always in movement peacemakers, INFJs are more of quiet counselors. They have a shaper eye, but loose their concentration more easily.

Tertiary Ti is linked to brooding introspection, for witch you definitely match, in hindsight of our conversation.

I really find INFJ fitting. My big sister is an INFJ, and I'm a /r/infj's subscriber.

I think they're more in touch with what it means to be a INFJ than me, anyway. =)

Why not ask them directly ?You're an INFJ ?

Tell them about ethics. Tell them it's the air you breathe, so you need them to make an effort to give you air. Not just room to breathe, but even what to breathe.

But I think it would be easier to find an intuitive friend. Best is a NF friend, on the other hand Rationals (Like me !) can be good enough to you, too.&gt; why'd you think I was an INFJ?

The social anxiety I mistaken for introversion. You hide it well, so I though it was your habits.

&gt;These xSTJs are my sisters so nothing I can do about that lol.

You can just give up on having a deep meaningful relationship with them. That's the way you'll suffer the less.

But maybe you'll want to work on that instead.

Anyway, what you're talking about is beyond the scope of MBTI. It's a deep misunderstanding, rooted in everyone's mind.

If you know how to deconstruct it painlessly, you have your solution. But I don't see it.&gt; They're my family and you only have one.

Your friends are the family you choose.

My family gave me an ultimatum 3 years ago : 

 * I spend each day of my life searching for work

 * I leave them.

I chose to leave them.

Don't feel tied. Sometimes you're simply aren't.

&gt;The thing I want to change is how empty I feel about them

You can't if they give nothing to you emotionally speaking.

Some people just can't.

&gt;how ungrateful for what they have given me 

You're grateful : you acknowledged they given you some things.

Truth is, it seem to be more a mean to blackmail you emotionally than heartfelt support.

Run away. Reclaim your freedom.

Then they'll eventually understand they needed you all along.

And you, you needed something else.

&gt;I was wondering if mbti had any answers.

MBTI has no answers at all.

Jungian typology has no answers for that.

&gt;This whole post in truth was a bit of a rant while seeking solutions.

I read it well then. I've seen the sadness and pain behind your words.

It was faint. I thought I was mistaken.Maybe you'll have to change from professional.

Just testing the dichotomies seems pointless.&gt; but more about collecting information from the present.

Loads and loads. And taking time to parse that all in depth.

That's why Ne doms are seen as shallow and empty headed : it's true to some extent. We act before having reassembled all the needed factual data. I see it as throwing dices.

But Si doms don't do such thing : you have a huge and reliable anecdotal memory to take decisions.

Most of the anecdotes I have don't even concern me. That's pretty dangerous if I used that for taking decisions.You're an INFJ.

Check reliable Si and Ni description online. You're mistaking one for the the other.

An ISFJ would have been so sure about their type. They wouldn't feel the need to ramble about that.

Or even been called repeatedly they aren't ISFJs in the first place.Make the difference between Ni dom and Si dom.

Or Se inferior and Ne inferior, but it's harder.

You can try to find the patterns among types of the same quadrant, here :

 * Alpha (&amp;alpha;) quadrant for ISFJ (ESFJ, INTP and my very own type)

 * Beta (&amp;beta;) quadrant for INFJ (ENFJ, ISTP and ESTP)

They all share the same functions, so that can probably help.

For specifics, INFJs are usually attracted by trendy things and ideas. They have a bit chaotic thinking and are head in the clouds. Dreamy. They struggle in aggressive and quickly changing environments.

ISFJs are reliable and dedicated. They are more akin to ISTJ than INFJs, so you have chances to find them in high responsibility roles that asks for practical skills and good eye-hand coordination. They don't avoid difficult environments as much as INFJs, but will quickly dash out if the meet someone who take intellectual sparring as a game. Their dedication render them pretty serious, in contrast of ENxPs laid back and Epicurean demeanor.I have bought a d7. I need a couple more, I think, for that metaphor.

We use dice cup. So much to throw, but we're equipped.

What I like the best isn't once the dices stops but when I make them roll in the cup, wondering if I should throw right now or wait a bit more. 

Si doms use coins, instead …

&amp;emsp;

&amp;emsp;

&amp;emsp;

&amp;emsp;

&amp;emsp;

… to pay for things !



&gt; But I've read several descriptions of Si and Ni online.

Then ask INFJs and ISFJs.

And if you remain convinced, it's about beliefs and values.

I use to give ethical advice, but I have no idea about that.

Can you try that before ? I'll do my best if it fails. It will give me time to think about it.

Ethics. It's something rooted in your world view, and this world view is mostly made of your ethics.

But ask others, before.

I'll tell you more about that if I need to : I'll be really clumsy and obscure about it anyway, so I really prefer to have a point for explaining you that.

For know I think it will just needlessly cloud your mind.I know. It doesn't matter.

You got what's important that is …

##ASKING OTHER INFJs AND ISFJs ABOUT YOUR TYPE !Yup.

Eventually difference between Ni/Si.

You can add "why I'm so convinced of my type ?" if the rest isn't enough.There is lots of mistypes everywhere.

I wouldn't fear that too much : you learn more retyping yourself than remaining sure of your type the rest of your life.Ne dom. I do physical activity only for basic health purposes.

I'm interested in sports only for tactics. I follow the news for no sport.

I'm skeptical about the idea someone achieve to get me interested and invested in practicing any sport.


\*Roll eyes*

Care to explain where it came from ?&gt; I'm very calm when things are blowing up around me, but I freak out if someone next to me seems kind of annoyed lol.

Or inversely unnaturally joyful considering a dark context ?

Chances are it's an ENTP thing : anticipating a bit too much and finding ironic details.

I think this alarm thing you describe would make anyone tense.

It reminds me what I could read on /r/talesfromtechsupport : a guy who tried to dry his laptop in a microwave oven. =D

If the fire is due to such fail, you can bet your ass it will become my new private joke, along with fire puns, of course. And unless there were no arm. I love irony, but I have a minimum of respect for dead people.

&gt; "holds up spork" moment.

What's that ?

&gt; Just trying to describe how I feel about that kind of thing.

I'm not offended or anything. I know I'm rather unkind ad insensitive in this kind of situation.

I just never got called on because of the social norms.

&gt;But I thrive in crisis and emergencies and quick-thinking situations.

Interesting. So do I.

&gt; Betas in general are known to "create" crises (although I would call it "bringing problems to a head") because we feel so comfortable handling them.

Yeah. So in a rush we forget to take a wider scope. I feel like the alpha quadrant is really nerdy by essence. That burning passion really cloud us in our judgements.&gt; t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m

Now I remember !

This shit is antic. =D

&gt;it's really hard to identify precisely why that style of humor or attitude is considered cringey

My guess is it don't fill the social codes. It don't fit to social norms.

&gt;that's how I feel when people talk about "not respecting the dead" or when my ENTP student declared that he thought oligarchy was probably the best form of government lol

I'm worse : I think no government is acceptable. =)

It's not cringey not respecting the dead, in the Internet culture. IRL, I try to shut up, but people who know me well know I have an awful joke in mind, if they pay attention.

&gt;to force us to question our values and assumptions.

That's really Ne that is about that. We know some norms lead nowhere nice or comfortable, so we undermine anyone's faith in these norms. It's a hard and ungrateful job, but I think enlightened people's face really worth the hard work.

&gt;especially when they're...'self-aware', I would say.

I don't know if I'm self aware, but I do my best to respect myself and stand for what I love and am.

I don't really worry if I'm cringey at times : it means I've found something to fight.
&gt;  Manipulation is much more Te. 

Totally. But I agree only because I really hate Te.

&gt;You could be an ENTJ.

I'm not blind about ethics. I have a friend I typed as an ENTJ : similar goals and outlooks, different methods.

I wish I were a better communicator, so I could share my ideas and get feedback more easily.

Not use it as a way to seduce and dominate others, AKA getting results no matter what happen.

I was told I could be an INFP yesterday. Get you shit together, and type me on my Reddit history, too, people.

I haven't rerolled my account since my very first post ever on Reddit Just for that purpose. I'm stalkable. So go for it.It's usually people of the hatebase who post this kind of articles.

I was about to tell you to play inside the mixer …You're useful. Just not recognized at your correct value, our thankless fellow intuitive and thinkers.

It comes from an old inferiority complex intuitives has. We see things, but we're powerless.

I personally really wished to be an ISFJ : I wouldn't struggle with rules and self esteem as I do, as I would just follow the flow.

I'm tired to deal with complexity. My mind isn't even wired for this purpose.

I'm not dedicated. I switch from interest to project to a new other idea I had, like an OCD goldfish, and it's 3 second attention span. 

You are thorough and dedicated. Make you proud of yourself, with this gifts, in the name of those who can't. Please.Because we're the master race ?That what I read on /r/ISFJ, anyway.

And I have no mean to tell them otherwise, and be believed.Hahaha. You should have fucked us instead. =DTechnically, it's a violent genocide followed by a suicide … =')ENFP, ENTP, ESTJ. #UnsolvedNarcissisticŒdipusEdition

INFP, ISFJ, Nobody. I'm a pacifist.

INTJ, INTP, ENTJ. For my Rational bros and sis.

ESFJ ISFJ INTP. &amp;alpha; quadrant.


If it ever happens …

\#SingleAndAsFreeAsTheAirI love it already. A biologist's word for a stupid concept.

That's perfect.And have nearly no means to differenciate your identity from something else strike me like inferior Fe, too.ISFJs hate phonyness, too, apparently. Maybe ESFJs, too.

I'm personnally loud, even if quieter than what other ENTPs can display occasionnally.

INTPs hate people. So quiet.

Not sure about Fi users. Not enough data.

I wouldn't say loudness is a Fe trait. Fe is about harmony.

Only ExTPs are loud because we use Fe to promote. Not to fit in or suffer from.

So either Fe dom/aux or Fe inf to me. I lean far more on Fe inf.Phoniness = loudness ?I'm not sure phoniness has to do with MBTI.

I think only Narcissists are phony enough to be noticed a such.

Or the really dumb people on the reality shows.The cheschire cat grin. =D

Even though my expression is darker when alone, you quickly see it on my face when in good company.

ISTPs have the Se hawk eye. Vigilant.

ESTPs look contented before looking vigilant.

ESTP.

You don't know how to format your OP. #ShallowAndStupidAnswer

You don't go in any tengent in your writing which is a key feature of Ne.

You're thourought and practical in your descriptions. No metaphors.

Confidence in what people told you, without questionning the peinciples behind at all.Sceptical eyebow raise ?

It's just specific to ExTPs, but it don't happen that often.Bing wary don't mean you're able to tell with other tools than the confidence in the other you have.

Which can mean you're less critic if it comes from a friend and let nothing pass if it comes from a complete stranger.

That's ironic, because my point here is self defeating : if I'm right, it means you'll never listen to me because I'm a complete stranger.

I somehow hope to be wrong about that, in fact.I have no point here then. Not enough data.Fellow ENTP Aspie, here.

It's horrible.

It's like I was never meant to get energy flowing through my mind and body. Nothing I can do, no new idea to ponder.

Hard work to do anything really basic.

I have no idea how you can even get moving with fibromyalgia in top of that. That must be a terrifying miracle.

Your username is in french, so I was wondering ...U speak french ?So you should know /r/french and may know /r/france ...

I'm a french native speaker !Abandonment and bulling aren't insignificant …

The whole point of Feelers's ethics is to take in account all this kind of thing, that doesn't follow logic at all.

Don't hesitate to ask Fi doms about that !I think I've seen you on /r/entp, as an ENTP … I'm not sure.

Uh. My mistake, then.I'd say Fi dom.

Not sure if sensor or intuitive.

IxFP, so to speak.

You're more driven alone than the whole INTP sub. It tells me that you got quite an awareness of what motivates you, purpose and meaning, which rings definietly Fi to me.

Also, you have no idea what Ti and Te are. =D (Edit : From an inner perspective. Reread it, and thougt it was a pretty spot on description from a Fi external point of view : vague but really meaningful.)

I'd randomly bet INFP, but I'm biased towards intuitives.Discord.

Dr House, sometimes.

Dexter.

I have a bad self image.I'd like to make you a better answer, but my computer can't stand the temperature.

I'm on my phone which makes things considerably harder.

Unless you can wait a dozen of hours ?&gt; Common buddy you're making this subreddit look bad. :P

I don't know how to understand that. I'm annoyed by the shallowness of that, and wondering if you weren't sarcastic about it anyway, without being able to clearly tell.

&gt;No way is she an Fi dom or an INTP

She didn't called me on my Fi dom thought. I guess she don't mind.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Not all feelers are bubbly caretakers.

ISFJs are a good example of that. And INFJs will be able to tell you about their unusual fascinations.

Though, I didn't felt the need to go on FP subs, because of this stereotype.Things that may take me years to "so much it never be processed until I die."

I already have a couple of things I given up ever heal.

I have no idea how bad it can be for Te or Ti doms. Sheer and complete neglect ?&gt;I would do anything to see the world through her eyes.

Be careful what you wish for.

Fi isn't about only parsing emotions. It's the kind of bullshit I tend to read on /r/intp about feelers.

It's ethics. It's about managing your integrity, beliefs and values.No problem ! =)That's what I'm talking about.

I don't understand what you want me to do with what you tell me about.

It's really intimate.It sounds like you try to think abiut things that are managed while with your gf.

I have no advice for you on that.

Only human matters need that much ethics. Meh. You didn't read me. \*Shrugs*Hum let's think …

INFJ ? Like the last two times you asked us between INFJ and ISFJ ? 

If Fi, IxFP is a fairly good pick.Don't force it.

You really need to get your emotional flow on it's and your feets, before anything else.

I think I remember I already gave you such advice.

"Fake it till be it" is a valid advice only when you'll have your anxiety in check.

Once there you'll know if you need a social facade or not.They are similar enough for you to be accepted, saying you don't know yet either you are.

Hence the "IxFP" notation.

Again, your anxiety really mess up the typing process in other thing.

No reassurance I can give you will help you. You need to find the origin of your fear. It's a belief that is limiting you. Find it, replace it and you'll probably feel better.

I know it's not easy, and I can't really much help you on that.Narcissistic, so not typable ?

Honestly there isn't much I can use, here. Considering I talk about a personality disorder ...

No.I'm not surprised. OP seem to know being typed by the community is better than the tests.

But mbti/jungian typology has limits. That's all.I think "a bit" is quite an euphemism considering your OP.

There is minor useful typing elements (1-5% Drowned among the rest, so to speak. They are too much of a minority to have any relevancy.) and about 85-80% of your post are elements fitting to descriptions and traits of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). I consider the rest as non semantic elements. (structural/syntax articulation elements, and social markers. meaningless junk. And I see more of that than typing elements.)

Of course, it's only how I read it. I can perfectly be biased.

I have no motivation to make you a more specific breakdown. i don't think it'll change really much.

That's all I can provide you.You agree there is some worry to have, if someone has no other trait is significantly displayed, right ?

Meh. Like if I knew, anyway.
&gt; There's no debate lol.

Enjoy your downvotes, then ?

There is debate. It's not because you don't want it to happen that it doesn't exist.It reminds me the *rigidity of thinking* of most people here when talking about MBTI, as a conceptual framework.

Innovations are put aside, critics are shut down and discussions go *in circles*.

One of the arguments in the video is that MBTI is *constantly evolving*, but by the professionals.

The community here just seem to replicate it as a *dogma*, *preaching* the good word to anybody who's willing to hear.

I *used to be* someone who's willing to hear.
Considering what /u/BlueOtterSocks said, I think it's unlikely.

You would have it easier running after ENxPs and INxPs.He said "it's OBVIOUSLY bullshit and there were no debate." X)

So …

&amp;#9744; NOT TOLD

&amp;#9745; TOLDI think if you want deeply curious people, search for Ne instead of Si.

We remain in the alpha quadrant, so …

 * INTPs with developed Si are smoother and tidier. They developed it as a sense of aesthetic beauty and are more incarnated and in the moment.

 * ENTPs with developed Si are more focused, purposeful and contemplative. (it happens in their late 50s/early 70s.) Most younger ENTPs like me are restless, unfocused, impulsive and unresponsive to the impressionist and immediate side of their surroundings, because of this lack of Si.

 * ISFJs are calm and contemplative, mindful of their past experience and careful about their surroundings. All that is really incompatible with the in-depth understanding of underlying symbolics that Ne provides, because they are already mindful. Even though it's hard for ISFJs to acknowledge that symbolic understanding, those who developed their Ne are able to trust other people's insights, and grasp what fit and what don't, according to principles, akin to how tertiary Ne types do.

 * ESFJs have usually a decent grasp of symbolics and underlying principles of events around them. They can develop it up to an auxiliary level of competency, and be on the par with younger INxPs

Something like that.

I should do the delta quadrant, too (ENFP, INFP, ESTJ and ISTJ), but I think I haven't enough data for a reliable description.+1 for ESTP. I don't see the nerdy vibe of bookworms ENTPs.Yeah. Me neither. I prefer read long winded stories filled with memes and inside jokes on Reddit. 

But I guess you prefer something more concrete, and less … futile.What's your favourite memes ?I don't know grandma memes.

Pokemon memes are shallow.

I love really old memes like AllYourBase or Dolan. Those who survived and have a story.You seemed really interested in OP's past …

Is there some kind of reason to that ?&gt; I can't exactly say it without hard proof 

You're talking to a Ne dom. I couldn't care less about proof if you are able to state the principles behind your words.

&gt;I'll just say that "past" is a weird word to use since things are obviously still going on

Not obvious to me. You may be more aware of some subtle flaws in his intellectual integrity or about his ethical mindset than I am.

I just see a Redditor really happy to shitpost around.

\#YouSeeAFutureCausedByHim.

\#YouSeeAPathNotMeantToBe&gt; Eh, I'm not gonna stirr up drama. 

I thought it was too late … =)

&gt;And that is A-OK.

Not if I missed something. And I'm pretty prideful of my judgement.

I won't tease you more. I guess I'm not meant to learn what you have in mind.I fear becoming a man in a suit. I hate this guys.

I don't want to give up on my ideals to end like a puppet.

But it seems I'm not strong enough. Being driven and pragmatic is power. My knowledge worth nothing it seems.Barbarian berseker glass canon, with a two handed sword.

Ironically, the less intelligence it ask to play the happier I am.

Ambidextry for two two handed weapons is a must have, to me.It's a biological preference.

Nothing to do with choice.

But it doesn't mean we have no bearing on it neither.I found myself enjoying this kind of balancing, when I'm not too badly punished for my errors, and when I'm allowed making a modular build.+1 for Fi-Se

OP have severe anxiety. It screws up any typing, but he/she refuses to acknowledge it.
They don't get credit because they are already overpowered. Favored by natural selection.

It makes me really jealous.

So I call their down to earth thinking "dumb", the huge amount of material property, "shallow materialism", the social intelligence and warmth, "Fake smiling" and their constant planning, "intellectual rigidity".

My father seem to be an ESTJ. He taught me the world was ugly and violent. And he was right.

He just left me that legacy of violence he inherited from his mother.

I don't know what to do other than throw myself on berserker mode about Te/ESTJs.

Please, people, CMV.No. It's how you make sense of your surroundings, which mostly have to do with hardcoded path in your brain.

The basic cues are taken care of by common and billion years old paths, more complex and recent reaction are your own and have been learned.

But MBTI is about deep and basic thinking preferences.&gt;  from the moment I was born, I was already confirmed to be an INFJ (implying I'm an INFJ now, which I am from my POV)?

You're an INFJ *mostly* because you pick up ethical data and process it in an intuitive way more easily than any other way of thinking.

But preferences change during a life. Multiple times, and on the long run.

If it wasn't the case, I would still be untypable, and wouldn't be able to pick up written social cues like I do at all : I'm autistic.

&gt;but is this what people who are into it most commonly believe?

Most people don't pick up the nuance of neurology.

You're not only who you were when you were born. You grew up. You learned.

All that have an influence. But the main soil you made your garden on is made of neurons, that are made of proteins, that are encoded in your DNA that was under natural selection over bilions of years.

It's biological design.

We can build furrow on our soil in an other way than it used to be, it's jut harder to do. That's why we just follow the landscape. Doing otherwise means fight against ourselves.

I know that too well.

I'm the only Ne dom I know.

I know two ISTJs. One is boring and can't deal with his nevrosis, and the other is fine, but have hard time to get me.

I like Se users. My best friend is an ESTP.

I know no Fi user, but I thik I'll like you guys.

I don't know really much people. I think Si users don't remain really long in my life : they quckly get tired of my shit.

And Te users go away when they see I'm off their charts and don't plan fitting at all. I give them headaches just the way I think and act, it seems.Why INTP for Ne-&gt;Si when you took a Si dom for Si-&gt;Te ?Now I assume it's just an INTP phenomenom, as I didn't seen it on /r/ENTP or in myself. Well done.

Function roles have a meaning. You can't just brush it off with the back of your hand like that.Which is not what the op describes.

That and be careful about that black and white thinking.

You woud quickly end up in trouble if I wasn't writing at 01:00 am. I'm not in the mood playing tricks.Back. No need of coffee. It clouds my mind, makes me addict and even more restless than I already am.

I was trying to tell you that the roles change the way a function is used, that the synergy between pairs had an influence you may have overlooked.ENTP - Math / General sciences

I gave up in my first year of college, now I do some edutainment as a volunteer in town.

Hopefully, I'm making some administrative procedures for them to pay me a bit for that.

I can't see myself as a seller or a burger flipper.That's looks like well seen to me.&gt; I can really relate to is nostalgia, which is often considered to be an erroneous trait associated with Si.

I think it's a good indicator of high Si.&gt; I'm an ESTJ majoring in Music Composition/Filmscoring.

Noice ! Really unusual for a Te dom.

I'm sure you can be awesome in profiling. I have no idea what it means to be that guy who wave a stick, though.My missing semicolons still hunt me in my dreams. (I used to make basic programs in C/C++)&gt; Polemology

The science of the war ? That sounds really interesting.\*Singing*

It's a mystery, Anthropology !Nope. Inf is more some kind of restlessness, and ter more some vague contempt.

Nostalgia is too complicated to me. =PThere is posibilities in the intelligence and the millitary.

Or you can make yourself known and be a trusted philosopher.That's all I had in mind ...

Maybe teacher ?I thought musicians were able to take care of themselves just fine, when it's about music …

So music isn't really about emotion , but more about technic ?Huh ...

The "no emotion" part disturbs me.

I has nothing to do with MBTI.

Feeling should have been named ethics.I'm not sure I have this trait.

It disturbs be because it's about emotional empathy, which is a really important skill to deploy, to me.

I think cognitive empathy have far more to do with MBTI.Can I put a troll one liner, please ? =DSo …

Team Valor are a brunch of brainless barbarians !

=P&gt; I'm called "crazy" and "obsessed".

Hum. You didn't listened to the feedback I (and others I guess) gave you.

/u/quiteafewfireflies's advice is heartfelt and sound. Why not just follow it ?

You can still MP someone of confidence when you feel better, to check if you can handle being here. I can do that.

It's just I'm not particularly tactful. 

Do however you want. The ball is in your yard.

&gt;  Do you people really expect a 3-paragraph to every response that I get?

Yup. At least 3 sentences. =)

We need to know how you feel, more seriously.

And what you're showing here isn't made to reassure us about your emotional health.

You need a break.Thank you, you Valor teamer.

That's why the team Instinct is the best anyway. =)LolI'm still wondering. I believe in Socionics, so I answer ISFJ, by the book, so to speak.

I have literally 0 experience in dating, so it complicates things a bit.

I'd say INFP, just to mock the ENT-INFJ OTP.

I think I need a lot of Fi in my life, more than even more mechanic and pragmatic management.

NinjEdit : Didn't took the test linked. Brb.

ENFP. I forgot I was a huge sapiosexual. I know Sensors can be smart, but from experience, Si users are never able to keep up, and Se users can somewhat keep up; It's me who can't keep up with their physical strength.

I like bubbly ENFPs.That's so stereotypical it's hilarious. =D

I know you guys aren't that narcissistic. But you're insanely good at making everyone believe you are. [](/pinkieooh)Ooooooooh …That's surprising to me. I feel like ESTJs are the type that is more prone to misestimate us than to idolizes us.

I don't understand …It reminds me "The sickest Joke of MBTI" description.

Something like "We were cool before being cool was cool". Ultimate hipster.

I'm jealous of your pragmatism and your thoroughness, I think.It's the same for me. But I don't see the condescending side look.

There is some people on this planet who aren't wired to be socially competent, and I'm one of those. And it has nothing to do with MBTI.&gt; I bet you're awesome when people get to know you.

Yeah, on the other hand, why try to be awesome, when nobody come to witness you ?

I just given up, and settled being just a mere shadow even for my few loved ones. 

&gt;because she never gave them a chance

Heh.

But what happened for her to become your friend ?

&gt;I know you a little better and it takes longer than just a few days for that to happen. Sigh.

That mostly what makes me give up. Nobody tries to know others more in depth, as they think they already do, and I, myself, am limited by my biology, despite being willing to. 

I'm usually amused by irony, but I find it cruel. &gt;As long as your intentions are good and you listen to other people and accept them, you've already met the requirements to be a decent person.

Being decent fed no one.

Being decent protected no one from being manipulated, hurt, or worse.

Even though, mankind is overall well meaning, some people taught me the path to hell is paved with good intentions.

I'm not even sure I still mean well, anyway.

&gt; it's not a race.

What it is if it's not the survival of the fittest ?

I've been taught I was a nature's mistake. I've come to some balance in my life that somewhat proves that's not the case, but rare are the people who take that as such. And I'm one of those who don't.

It's a race against myself. I must show I'm more than the basement dweller I've mostly become, and my words aren't enough.

Terribly Te-Si. ESTJ, to me.

And stop that piano on the background. It just annoys me. I know it's a try to sadden me on his character, but I don't like having my hand twisted to make me adhere to something.Huh-huh. Not cry, just that nostalgic sadness.

It's a subliminal association. A manipulation technical. Sooo big nope.?

I don't see the relevancy.I know the meme. Why using it here ? Sadness wasn't really was I was talking about, was it ?

I begin to think I'm just being dense, here.Those feels. Those rare pepe.

Not sure if the ESTP one is gross or brillant.Ne. The answer is Ne.Wat ?Still don't get it.Ooooh.

[](/goodjob)I could never have guessed. And it defeated all the purpose of my first comment. Well done.[](/trixiesmug)Alpha. Was there ever any doubt ?


Statistics say Delta, but I don't believe in meaningless numbers.Why ? INTJs may not know it better than ISTJs themselves.

Is /r/ISTJ empty/dead ?Huh. Intuitive biais.

I'm really biased. This thing is like all those stains that don't go away once you washed you clothes. It seems it's comfortably installed in my mind, right in my blind spot, out of sight.

\*Sigh*

I think we should just let ISTJs answer.Yeah. I took a look.Your own quadrant the last ? Why ?&gt; And leave our TJ Overlords to actually deal with the hassle and bureaucracy of the stupid empire they built. I'll probably just be a professor or something.

Sounds nice to my ears, too.

But you know this Empire we live on won't last for very long anymore. We must do something to anticipate, right ?Naaaaah. Deltas are really the master race. Just look at the statistics. I'm pretty sure y'all weigh for nearly a third of the population.

Natural selection has spoken.&gt;  these fuckers were on a delivery run for these nuclear WMDs to destroy the alpha, gamma and delta quadrants

And who designed those ? \*Smirking contemptuously* That's what I thought. ENTPs would end up like Axiom's people in Wall-E. Really technologically advanced, and well … 

Needless to say there's no police there : law is automatically enforced.

I think it would be like some technological dictature.

Maybe from divine right. Like some Emperor-God. Not because we really belive in, but more because just the idea is amusing, until, it's not anymore and we can't make it back.&gt;a foresty utopia like elves

-
&gt;&gt;People who eat only veggies,   
Obviously they won't make any good neighbors.


And that would hilariously fail. =D

In reflection, that sounds like aggressive proselytism …

Are those factions religious fanatics ?I type him "Narcissistic Idiot."

I think the character is really bad, because no one sane whould have acted like he did.He's a narcissistic idiot. Problem solved. =)

I think he's bad of a man precisely in the same way I think Light is a bad character. Too much broasting for nothing and not enough thinking/doing.

The irony is … I feel like america need a narcissistic idiot, like him, so now you'll know what it is and not be confused anymore about who someone is and who they want you to believe they are.

It's something that is learned only the hard way it seems.You're an ESTJ, right ?\*Has chills running all the length of my spine*

I have a pretty bad history on my closest ESTJ doing the "right" thing. Brr.

I can't just read that in an other way than "I'll do what I think is right and you'll shut up"

What your fanfics are about ?&gt;Umm... sorry if my joke flew over, but I'm kinda not ESTJ.

Half flew over. I was just trying to guess. I failed, so no biggie.

I don't know why it was supposed to be funny, though …

&gt;yes our experience with ESTJ has similarities

Let's better not dig into that more, then, I guess.

Let's say it's for the sake of ur perfectly fine and well adjusted ESTJs around there, right ?

&gt;my fanfics are scifi or fantasy short stories.

More specifically ? It's like 80% of all ever written fanfics.

I was asking you about why you write when chances are there is someone who wrote that already ? What makes your fanfics unique ?

I can handle ultra specific. I'll ask google if I don't know.

No, I say ESTPs live underground, and mine for precious ores day and drink beer the night. The send one of them (his name was Gurdil) who could run fast and travel very far (making a pun in french, making that sentence meaning the complete opposite) 

He built his hut on the edge of INFJ's country. A puffy forest inhabited by sylvan elves.

You know the rest about people who eat only veggies.

They told him "You aren't welcome", while throwing him rocks. He seen that all was lost he escaped following a river.

In the end he came back to the mine, to never come out again.

---

It's the translation of an old dwarf song named "My ancestor Gurdil" ("Mon ancêtre Gurdil" in the original version. It's made my someone named "Pen of Chaos". They made a couple of audio series that really worth listening if you can understand french.)
That Si you describe is Ni.

Si is good at semi immediate factual planification whereas Ni is best at long term planification. If I would really have to choose a type for him, INTJ is the first that come to my mind.

Either you're a ISTJ deluded about what Si is, or an INTJ deluded about being one.

I find that pretty funny.Comme back when you'll be 20, bro.

You're description are just made of what you read, tied together. It  sounds shallow to me.

Fe isn't about feelings. It's projected ethics.

You keep using quotation marks by lack of better words. I advise you to take each of your quoted expressions and come back with the word or expression that covey the best what you have in mind.

You'll never reach a final conclusion, as MBTI isn't made for that, in my opinion. 

You'll have the choice : keep researching for the sake of it, or give up, and put your mind on something else.

(4w5 is an eneagram type and wing. A tritype is well, the primary type, the wing and a third one. You need three numbers for a tritype. INFJ is the best candidate for 4w5, I think. But I can't believe you're a 5.)It's dwarves who are actually totally xenophobic. The rest of the story is more or less that dwarf going everywhere and be a prick to everyone. (He massacre a human bar owner with a stool, because he didn't wanted t sell him beer, to give you an idea.)

I think he was up to dig everywhere for Mithril, as he didn't knew where it was exactly.

I'd say being thrown rocks on is fair enough.

Elves are painted as attractive golden haired shallow idiots in this realm. I don't think you really enjoy be one of those.

It's more or less a parody of heroic fantasy stories. Really well written, considering how nonsensical and somehow trivial the whole story is.

The catchphrases became memes on their own.&gt; which is not true at all

What I read :

&gt;YOU'RE TELLIN' LIES !!! LIES I SAY !

-

&gt;I dont know essentially what Ni is but 

But what ? I don't really need to read the rest, right ?

&gt;I dont know about Ni users but I do know a lot of Si users

Which makes you prejudiced and unable to juge fairly. =)

&gt;Very black and white view of life and this is what I see light doing.

Thinking the world in a black and white fashion isn't being an ESTJ. (or a Te dom, for that matter)

It's being an idiot.

&gt; (Which is Si fyi)

Naaaaaah …

It's Ni.

&gt;Which applies to what I think Si is.

Factoids. I don't care. 

You're sacrificing underlying principles for the sake of specific occurrences, and it amuses me.

I don't care about specific data. You'll need to bring the principles, if you want to convince me.
Did that a wile ago already. Maybe another time before that. I'll just make minimal answers, so I'll be able to make consistently the same from no on.

INTJ, mumbling crap in the shadow

ENTP, buffet &lt;-&gt; dancefloor. More food than dance.

EFs, dancefloor.

IF, discussing near the buffet.

INTP, music.

ESTJ, Talking with IFs, bored but stays by duty.

ISTJ, talking with IFs, but genuinely like the conversation.

ESTP, dancing, duh.

ISTP, remain near the buffet. Is entitled to lots of food because has cooked.

ENTJ, Troll IFs. Should be ENTP, but had did that the last time, so agreed with ENTJ they would swap each party, so the IPs don't know who's the troll before being trolled. More dance than food, but food anyway.You're a Fi inferior, if I believe your fair.¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯I can live with you believing to the letter what's written/ take frome face value what you've seen. Can you ?&gt;I mean this one's pretty obvious. Obnoxious cockiness mixed with the tendency to never follow through on one's plans makes for a dastardly disgusting concoction.

I think what's worse is our spirit of contradiction. We're good willed but we can't help but choose to fill the role of the jerk a bit too easily. It makes even loved ones rightfully distressed and confused.

I'm tired to be the antagonist. But that the only way I know making myself sure everyone shines plentifully : by letting them the room to do so. And by dimming my own light. #HumbleBraggingButNotReally #SorryNotSorryI'm not sure it's true. I think you know how to enjoy those blurry and indistinct moments just appreciating things how they are.

I'm kinda jealous of that. I'm restless when I have nothing to do, and it happens often because I'm not as driven as I know introverts like you can be.I would have voted being shadowy trashtalkers. I know INTJs to be particularly sharp tongued.

It's always a pleasure to have an INTJ debate buddy, because you're usually of those rare people who care getting through our mountains of bullshit.

I just appreciate that so much I think it could make me able to bear any downside.Ne doms are butterflies. Little and fragiles insects with a liking for bright lights and a severe serving of ADD.

I've come to think it was funnier than annoying or something.That sound enticing to me. It means when you'll be out of your researches, you'll be fully with him. Quality over quantity.

I think I'm not the only one who dig that, other than xNTPs. It means your day can be made by one person, too, on the other hand. You still want to cut it off knowing that ?

All my days are huge piles of meh, making me question my own sensivity. I've been called a psychopath in the past because of that.

I guess there is a middle ground. But what you feel is real. Don't neglect yourself. You'll find the meaning of all those later.&gt;  I never have something snappy to say.

More than snappy, like xNTPs used to do, it more like so cleaver, you find out about the real crap only thinking back about it.

And you say to yourself "Oh shit, he/she really knew what I was talking about. He/She really got me !"

It's really subtle and insidious.

It's the exact opposite of the Ne shallow quick wit we used to throw around thinking we're armor piercing.

What you guys do is really armor piercing, but we find out only when we drop the armor, seeing the underclothes stained in blood.

Like ninja blows.

Like short and sharp elven daggers against our heavy and broad claymores. Same role, opposite approach.[ And we have really much to compensate for.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompensatingForSomething)Ahaha. Thanks ! Seems I was inspired.

I'm really happy you were looking for it. I do that more for recognition than fake internet points.I'm a bad multitasker, so it contribute more to my misery than my happiness.

I often end up stressed because I have nothing to do, so I default chatting with strangers, and earn some social skill with hard work.

Seems I found some kind of balance the couple of last months. I have spikes of loneliness in times an others, but my subjective happiness rating is the best it ever been.

I'm grateful about my life being somewhat easy.No ENTP sound ans sane of mind, anyway. =D
Enneagram, maybe?ENTP, M, 24.

16personnalities test is pretty bad, imo.None, because all are part bullshit somehow.

It's our duty as MBTI enthusiasts to build our own understanding by comparing, synthetysing and nuancing a maximum number if approches on Jungian typology, MBTI, socionics, and even Big 5 and Enneagram.

That's a correct journalist work. That's the best way to be as unbiaised as possible, imo.I recommand autotyping based on a conceptual understanding of MBTI. Cross testing with the community or best accuracy.

There's a test that is designed on cognitive functions instead of directly the dichotomies. I don't remember it's name. It's the only online automated test I deem as good enough.
ENFP.

Too young to display your Fi obviously enough. Give time to yourself and you'll see.I was thinking of another one specifically. I think I would have remembered celebrity types.

Else, I was talking about this kind of test indeed. But that was just a way to give a practical answer.

The point I was trying to make is those test are not good. Neither accurate or reliable.Test their Intuition with obscure reference and mind games.

We're lazy but sharp. It means we'll cut through all the shit and take a direct path.

Expect no one to give you the answer you have in mind : our clearsightedness make us able to see things beyond appearances. A well thought answer backed up with some link to the context and that makes sense symbolically is a good enough to me.

Also, who need to "weed out" entps ? Our sub has already a really efficient social filter for that, and we aren't enough IRL for this to be relevant.

~~Your discourse make sense only in the light of some emotional trauma of yours, I suppose.~~

Also, I'm willing to be tested with your thing. I'm probably a Fi user. I need that sorted out.Why ?

People identify to types, want it or not. You can't just manage that like data in a database. That don't works like that.

Human beings learn with trial and error, and some aren't even able to learn about some fields. Let just them make their mistakes. They won't believe you even if you tell them precisely how wrong they are, anyway.Mixed up conversations. My mistake.

I had a point elsewhere that ressemble a bit and carried it up here. My apologies, OP.An Apache Attack Helicopter ?There's so much dirty jokes that lies there, just waiting a willing mouth to pass through. Like liquid nirvana.

The possibilities are endless. I just can't choose.You aren't a special snoflake identifying yourself sexually as an attack helicopter.

You need to be more creative than that.&gt; I experience Fi as a compass or a guide for navigating life.

Driven. That's what I think too.

&gt;That's an extreme example but the principle is there.

Kinda ironic to see a sensor talking about underlying principles. You have my upvote, as I find your comment really accurate and complete.

Don't let the intuitive bias take the better of you as it did to me.I think Extraverted function tend to be more shallow than their introverted counterpart.

While extraverts react quicker and need less time to ponder, those shortcuts can lead to more error of judgement.

Even Ne as I see as an epitome of clear-sightedness and depth of thinking already led me on following symbolics that make me ashamed out of how shallow they are.

On the other hand, I'm sure I will find more symbolic intelligence on /r/INTJ or /r/INFJ than on /r/ENTP. Introverts don't have time to shitpost.

I suppose it's the same for Fe/Fi and Se/Si.

It reminds me a thread I made on /r/ISFJ. They shown me the door, because I expressed myself in a tad too aggressive/negative way. They knew what I was talking about, they just couldn't answer me because of how needlessly noisy I am.

I can drive through such noise because I use the mental shortcuts I talked about earlier, but ISFJ are used to evaluate all what is said both broadly and in depth before taking a strong decision, instead. It was interferences that were took as meaningful to them.

---

PS : Mods, I'd like a ENxP flair, please.Shit happens. Tomorrow is a better day.

One day you'll deliver us the best shitpost ever written on this sub. Just keep training.Thinker is obvious to me. I'd say judger, as percievers's are usually far less orderly.

I bet Ni dom. Movements are more about efficiency than the beauty of the result. You seem you just want to be readable, for the minimal effort.

---

[Here is mine, just for the debate](http://imgur.com/TQMnK0D)Ne ?

I've read a bit about graphology, and observed how I write myself.

Think of it as a movement and not just symbols on paper. It's like observing footprints to tell how you walk. It's easier because the choice of pen screw less the result than the choice of shoe. I used a Bic Crystal, on the message I uploaded in my previous comment.

Everything is a clue : spacing, kerning, lines, angles, etc …
&gt;What do you consider yourself in a religious sense : 

Discordian. Yes, really.

&gt;Are you Gnostic or Agnostic :

Gnostic.

&gt;What are the reasons for you being (A discordian) : 

I'm a being of chaos to put is as simply as I can. I believe more in a kind of balance more than a real concept of god. And I like to change my swears about god with the name of a goddess. Either Eris or Celestia, if the latter can be considered as such.

&gt;Is religion important to you:

Not that much. My stance is more about mocking people totally rigid and invested in their religious belief than being practicing or even really religious myself. Something something gold apple, worm, if you will.

&gt;Have you ever changed your belief in your life: 

I used to be vaguely agnostic. I don't see passing on the gnostic side as a huge change of stance, so I think my answer is no.

I like joking saying I was a discordian before knowing about discordianism, because it's technically true.

&gt;Have you ever argued for your religion or against: 

My religious choices are mostly meant so I can argue against both of the main sides, with the real advantage of not being of bad faith at any moment.

As you said it quite crudely, OP, it would have been a waste of Ne to not do so as an ENTP.

&gt;If you do argue what arguments to you tend to stick too :

My argument are mostly based on the Socratic method. The more logical and consistency seeking my opponent is, the hardest they have with my arguments.

I build ethic based arguments with logic. It makes things that sound really demented/paradoxical, when a simple mindset shift makes things bearable again.

But my hugely negative karma breakdown is enough proof for anybody that I'm not as successful as I wished.

&gt;How do you feel about religion : 

I'm openminded, mostly. I like easten religions. I find the weastern ones I know a bit close-minded.

The concept of dogma give me chills just saying it's name. It's too rigid and blind to me to be anywhere form acceptable.

In day to day, I'm on live and let live. I seldom launch a religious debate by myself. I need to read the sacred writings/books before I can formulate good arguments.

I just end up debating a bit too Euphoric™ atheists.\*Sigh*

Because you're enlightened by your own intelligence.Narcissistic idiots ?Skype is dead. Use /r/Discordapp !&gt; I've always used Skype tho!

Sweet ! I used to use MSN, so let's use it instead ! It was great with it's 90's ugly emoticons I didn't even used back then !

Skype is a relic of the past, already. Owned by Microsoft : it's a mark of shame.

Huh. Glorious indeed. But these times are long gone.

I feel like even IRC have been forgotten.

It's about time to be the same for Discord.

That's just the circle of life.INTJ, then.

I thought Ti-Fe, but I'm not sure.

I see thinking dominant.I feel like you like some technical field. It weights far more than prefering checking grammar and be a math nerd, imo.

I wouln't have be Fi at all. I don't know.

Maybe I'm just as thinker biased as the other here.

I neglected "marking your own path". I made that filter because of ethical crap I read when prospecting for a job. Seems I use it as default filter.

The "questioning authority" rung my Ti bell, but that's intuitives who are really mistrustful about that. Ni more than Ne.

I have no idea. I was about to write my thought about each function but I thought you wouldn't read it. I was about to be really boring.

Like if I was more capable than you to type you, anyway.We already know you well around /r/ENTP …

\*Shrug*

Why this anyway ?Good enough, I guess. I'm a party pooper this days, so I guess I'd better just go away. I have nothing to ask you.Who knows either, anyway ?&gt;Thats interesting cause isn't Discord usually used for gaming?

It's meant that way.

But I personally don't use it for that at all. It really replaced Skype for me.

&gt;ooVoo or however is spelt took the one up when it came to competition with Skype

I'll take a look.Ne -&gt; Minecraft mods and advanced building tools/ Factorio / Warcraft III's map editor / A 40Go Skyrim / Mindless unfinished forgotten games wrote in flash or Java. The most amusing is to make them work somehow. Ne gaming is about creating oneself logistic nightmares, imo.

Ni -&gt; The Sims / Eve online / No Man's Sky / Games with zero replayability because there is no realistic gaming lifetime to expect in the first place

Se -&gt; Guild Wars / CS Source /Unreal Tournament / Mindless flash games that ask for eye hand coordination / Any fps 

Si -&gt; Secret of Mana / Any jrpg whatsoever, only if it was made more than ten yeasrs ago. / Any Rpg with a huge lore, like the Elder Scroll serie.

Fe -&gt; Wow / Candy Crush / Pokemon Go / Any game they've been asked to play at least three times the same day by different people.

Fi -&gt; Loco Roco / Okami / Zeldas / Journey / Fez / Those indy games less about poesy than solitude

Te -&gt; Wow / League of / Clash of Clans / Those Facebook game about managing a city or watev's. Bonus points if about managing real people.

Ti -&gt; Dragon's Lair / Dwarf Fortress / Spelunky / "Die again and again to never play it ever again" gamplay at large / Osu!, too. Ti users are good speedrunner and TASers, imo.&gt; a lot of that is incorrect for me personally.

Care to be a bit more specific ?

&gt;Also I still disagree with the idea that Se=FPS games.

Se don't like micromanagement. Not as much as Ne but quite a lot.

Se users are really good in managing their attention, and have a good hand-eye coordination, usually. Quick paced FPS are an easy choice for them. I would place survival games right after that. Both survival horror and survival sandbox. That's where Se overlaps a bit with Ne.

&gt;I'm still confident that Si users are the ones that dominate the realm of FPS/StarCraft/League.

Micromanagement is more a Te affair to me. I'm not sure. I think Si prefer more contemplative, slow paced games, like the ones I selected for Fi.

I put all the worst and hardest games I know on Ti as a joke, because I think I would have put these game on Te ans Si.

Fe is kind of dishonest, too. I just had nothing in mind to compensate that insulting selection. I was wondering if Fe users could enlighten me about that.

The rest is about right to me, having in mind my choices are based on minimal archetypes. It's cliché.

I would never be able to content everybody, even with researching on Steam for the best matching game. I just opted to make somewhat of a disgraceful joke of it.&gt; I only posted so that others reading it would have 2nd thoughts. I should have mentioned this sorry.

Why ? Now you know it was my intent all along, too. 

&gt;My argument is pretty much that Se's hand eye coordination is only as fast as consciously possible.

Yeah. And some are slowpokes.

But most can decently aim with a mouse, and feel the difference between a wireless one and a cable one, or even a change of about 10 % in sensibility settings. I can spot some one is a Se dom by their mouse settings quite easily : the sensibility setting is set really high.

&gt;Si on the other hand( with lots and lots of practice)will become Se on steroids( in this case)

Like I could. The question is, don't they prefer something else instead ?

I know I do.

&gt;Their hand eye coordination will operate like a robot, they wont even have to be consciously aware. It will be faster than Se by far.

But slower at spotting, rigid in their strategies, and far slower to change of tactics if they are read like a book. That's Se pride to do all that efficiently, like if it were nothing.

ESTP best friend uses snipers and knife. He finds the other weapons kinda dull, and love surprise people who remain at the same place. He played really fast paced games and change of game each three months, out of boredom/disgust. 

&gt;Assuming both is equally talented of course.

The comparison don't make any sense to me.

&gt;I just wanted to put it out there.

You didn't wanted me to respond ? That makes no sense. I suppose you didn't thought I would nitpick/quibble. It weirds me because it's wrote on my flair.

It's when an ENTP don't quibble or nitpick that the situation is worrisome. 

&gt; I guess I'm forced to reply now.

Hahaha "forced". You could just walk away, you know. I don't mind. That's what three thirds of the internet do, myself included. I won't judge you.

&gt;Te would make up for most of this though.

Somewhat. Te doms can play at equal competency, but Se doms just enjoy that too much.

Te aux struggle, because Si has the upper hand. It means lots of frustration for introverts.

&gt;FPS/ League/StarCraft

You're aware there's a distinction to be done, here, right ?

&gt;there are only a limited amount of possibilities possible.

That means that. Most FPS are so limited it's painful. MOBAs have potential, it's just trusted by Si and Te into making the meta idiotly frozen. The tactical games of Warcraft/Stractraft family are of another kind.

Far less reflexes, far more micromanaging. It's totally the realm of Si/Te. Competitive players spend the 5 first minutes of each games doing exactly the same thing each time. And it's a huge pile of timed allocations sandwiched between verifications. These games are a bane to me. I will never be happy playing it.

&gt;If Si has prep and prepares for literally every possibility then they will be able to switch strategies very quickly.

But they rarely do. They have a couple of strategies they thrust and just go with that most of the time. The others are deemed "unlikely", "non viable" and my favorite "It could work but let's just do my way because I'm right"

&gt;Most of the wins are won because of superior hand mechanics.

Mechanics don't do everything. You played LoL too much, if you believe that.

&gt;He'd always like FPS online games especially competitively.

Whatnot. Works for me.

&gt;I always admired his hand mechanics, it was just so fast and smooth that I just literally cannot comprehend, He was definitely a talented one.

I have in mind Fe users are shallow. I forget how out of they way they can go to impress others. It works. I won't complain about that.

&gt;He used to be among the top players in the US on a online FPS game( he was on the team for US) that's no longer relevant.( used to be back then though).

Does he still play that game ? It would be sad to climb so high just
to quit the game altogether. It would mean he wasn't interested in the game that much.
&gt; I think most of the Ni games are actually Ne games. 

Huh. Possible. I just read myself again, and I think I know no real Ni game.

&gt;D33P M34N1NGFUL S70RI3Z.

Naaah. Fi search that. Ni prefer D33P 1MM3R51V3 G4M3PL4Y. Like coherent open worlds and emergent gameplay.

It amuses me because I think it's for hipsters even if I like it myself.

&gt;They can't play games without a purpose and direction. 

I think they do, but they prefer having a help in time and others. No Man's Sky is a great example of that, even though the thing is quite empty at the moment.

&gt;I'll also agree that I enjoy the Ne stuff you listed 

I played all but Factorio. If I told you why I fear playing this game …

I've installed Rimworld, instead. I'm quite happy with it, atm. I've seen there were a modding feature in it. It's about time before it becomes unplayable.

&gt;I often make my games into a logistical nightmare... 

I have a 700Mb modpack on Minecraft I can't run becaue I don't have enough RAM.

I have a 15 Go installation of Skyrim … On a Mac. I'm trying to get the Nexus Mod Manager and SKSE working. [Goddess, why.](http://pre00.deviantart.net/a158/th/pre/f/2013/219/2/9/oh_god_why_in_hd_by_lemmino-d61t8ou.png)

&gt;I've spent more time modding some games than playing them.

Sounds familiar to me. =)

&gt;I kinda hate the style of the games you listed for Ti.

No one like those. I was wondering if any would notice I just put horrible games.

&gt; I'd say I enjoy your Ni, Ne, and Se lists the most (in that order).

Interesting. I think it far better fits Ti than my Ti list.

I think I would probably make a less troll list. It asks to get through the steam store, and I'm not overly happy to do that just for Karma. I don't know. Maybe I'll find motivation.

&gt; KSP

I should definitely had added it in some list here.

&gt;SimCity

Kinda meh. I don't know if it's a micromanagement game or an accounting simulation. ``

&gt;survival games like Ark or DayZ

I don't know Ark , but I know DayZ. Really arcade. Game about zombies bored me because of that fashion born from The Walking Dead.

&gt;simulators

Which kind ?

&gt;turn-based strategy.

Already took care of that. It's the JRPGs.&gt; Indigo Prophecy and Deus Ex

Don't know the first. Just took a better look at Deus Ex because of the last one just released. I couldn't help but think about Watch Dogs : promising but empty.

&gt;so like what Star Citizen promises to be?

I'm not sure about Star Citizen. I was deceived by No Man's Sky. I'll wait to see gameplays before forging myself an opinion.

&gt;There's a fine line to draw between sandbox and immersive worlds, I guess. 

Yup.

&gt;Right now my primary install is at 79GB and damn near maxed out on ESPs (max of 256)! I think I have several layers of Direct3D injectors running on the game too (ENB, SweetFX, SMAAInjector, VorpX (for VR), and I think others). 

Worth saying I only have 4Go of ram, 120Go of space in my HD, and only a graphic chipset.

I'm already happy to play with 15 FPS.

&gt;My Skyrim is a fucking Jenga tower. I haven't even played the Dragonborn DLC because I never get my characters leveled high enough to go to Solstheim before I fuck something up in my config.

Haha. I have half of my mods that don't work anymore. Apachii hars is one of them. One of the first to fall, because the cider port don't allow multiple windows, so no SKSE.

What did I did ? I made myself a Wineskin port. Mine is a jenga tower built on quicksand. I just happened to never be able to build as high as you.

&gt;Through some API reimplementation like Crossover or WINE?

Wine, for me. It used to be a Cider port.

&gt;Mod Organizer is superior to Nexus Mod Manager. 

I don't know mod organizer. 

&gt;I guess it's just another one to throw on the pile of "interesting ideas that I'll get around to aaanny day now."

I won't even postpone it indefinitely because I haven't already scheduled it already.

I feel like doing nothing these days. I feel tired, and nothing really brings me joy.
&gt;What's there is really good.

I'm meh. The technobabble is omnipresent. It makes me drunk out of it's own inconsistency. It flushes my willing suspension of disbelief down to the toilet's hole.

I should have played the previous ones beforehand. Now the game makes me pay for it.

I haven't brought that comparison with Watch dogs innocently. I have a whole theory about that. It's my answer to "why games these days are boring, when I used to be entertained by pokemon blue."

&gt;Yeah, running on OS X is going to be difficult.

That's an understatement.

&gt;Doesn't SKSE only pop open a window when it for a second right before it launches Skyrim? It shouldn't be technically different to, say, what the Skyrim Launcher itself does.

More or less. It's integrated to the game, but it needs it's own window while launching the game.

&gt; it's the games that have a strong modding community that I stick with the longest. Otherwise, I get bored with them quickly.

Modding says a lot about a game and it's spirit.

&gt;I have the same problem. I've been endlessly tired and lethargic over the last few years. And it means I don't do the things that I really want to do.

I've come to follow STJ's advises : 

 * Plan
 * Automate
 * Save for later

But that's what makes it all gray to me. I've come to think it's what means to be an adult.

&gt; I'm not sure if it's depression, physiological, my not taking good bodily care of myself, or something else.

It's the boredom of aimlessness.

That's what I talk about with Watch Dogs, and why I keep chasing my own shadow. I feel imprisoned by my own freedom.

I think it's something like that.

&gt;I'll admit, it's kinda helpful to hear someone complaining of the same thing; at least I can know that I'm not crazy and making up a problem. 

You aren't to me. But I sound crazy to most. Demented. I just gave up talking with someone or relate to someone.

So thank you.

&gt;You have my sympathies and I hope you get it figured out.

I think I have. It's just the quickest solution I know takes years to implement.
&gt; It's not a large soulless city with prop buildings like Watchdogs.

Feels soulless to me in it's own terms. I can admit it's more subtle than Watch Dogs.

&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines

I don't know it.

&gt;The first half of the game is really goddamn excellent with great writing, great atmosphere, lots of little easter eggs, and interesting missions. The second half... well let's just say they ran out of funding.

Or out of ideas ? Out of sprit, maybe.

&gt;it's so hard to stick to.

I willingly admit I'm far from being as efficient as STJs are.

Jut's just that, I have the impression to walk on those picture perfect streets, but I don't have funny factoids on the strangers I pass by, displaying in the screen of my phone.

I just make my music louder to not hear them yelling of pain, despite that neutral porcelain mask they display to hide it.

I play a soulless AAA game each day out, too.

&gt;It's so weird.

It's not weird. You're human. It's the deepest and most ancient organic strength and intelligence you have that is trying to give you pointers. Most of the time it's simple commands like "Eat" or "Sleep"

But sometimes it's more than about futhfilling our basic needs.

But that's when we were taught to not listen.

&gt;No time to lose then, right?

I don't know. I've all the time I need, for now. It's just demotivating.

I need to find something to do instead of waiting. I'll just wait. I've searched for answers for too long. Those I've found aren't really good news, anyway.



&gt; They're all too easy to ignore and that's what screws me over.

We aren't wired for that. I'm not sure it's really a problem.

&gt;Stagnation is death.

I don't stagnate, I take a rest. And if I can have a nice scenic at the same time, I'll be back binging chaos more quickly than I estimated.Seen it around the web. Found it cute. I wanted to avoid naming dark and depressing games. There's a couple of possibilities, even though your question is quite vague.

 * Tell her you love her (Duh !)

 * Give her a gift symbolizing your bond.

 * Do something together. I'm sure you can count on your own creativity.

 * Relieve her from her chores.

 * Give her a hug.

 * Any combinaison of any of those.T'was a lucky guess. Just read the rest, and you'll see the whole thing is cliché.Me : ENxP

**Heartbreaking** : "I feel like your little sister is the only one of my children who's a success. You and your big sister are both handicapped from living." - My own father.

Thank you dad. I'll never forget your words. Neither big sis did, anyway.

**Heartwarming** : "You taught me I wasn't a failure like dad used to tell me." - My 12 year older INFJ sister.

Ironically, it doesn't prevent me to still believe I'm a total waste of skin. Like right know, I'm sick of myself sometimes. Sometimes it gets a bit better, though. When I achieve to act like a responsible and reasonable adult.

It just doesn't happen as often as I would like to.Being an idiotic douche ? It's still better than being a narcissistic idiot, imo.Or just pointing ENTP for nothing ?

I openly admit I don't like reading that. I had the openness of not downvoting and express my disagreement.

Now explain me why we shouldn't send that comment to the karma depths.Thanks. I already know all that. It's just … he's right.Nah, but it's not theirs neither. And I can't just get through my issues. I promised myself to live, but that loneliness don't have it kind on me.Someone is lacking mental filters, here. 

I think I'm stable enough.

I get less frustrated than my friends around my age, and relate more to the thinking of people older than me. About in their 30's, mid 30's. I'm in my mid 20's.

I don't understand the concept of intrusive thought. My thought are a river of symbolically tied ideas. They follow each other. I'm pretty rigid in my thinking, so it's hard to make my thinking change of direction. I can open one or two rivers at the same time, and manage them, even though i know it's a somewhat rare ability.

I can search for an idea while I'm making my sentence or listen to someone else, for example. But I'm more limited in my multitasking than what I'm describing here.

I'm someone brutally honest and genuine, but the brutal school environment taught me how to deceive and lie. It was a matter of social survival for me. So I learned to wear made up personas. They are quite limited : it's just basic mindset I prepare, so I'll deliver a tone that's adapted in the situation I am, half genuine, just a lot filtered. I choose my social filter consciously as I haven't the ability managing them without thinking. It's both expensive in term of energy cost ant inefficient : sharp people can tell when I come as artificial and how I thought out what I said before passing it through filters.

All that let's virtually no room for being intruded, or lose the track of my thinking : I check it constantly from upstream to downstream.

Your example of friend crush : I don't know what a crush is. I can lust on someone, but that's something I got in check quite early.

I love deeply and calmly : I check my loved one's well being by long intervals, caring mostly about what is meaningful to them, and on what they struggle. I usually only propose myself to help if I know I can give a hand for their issues. Same for friends. I'm not present often to have to worry about misplaced caring. And it gives me plenty of time to evaluate if I'm as close as I want to them, and how to place myself in our relationship.

Even though I'm supposed to belong in the most impulsive type of all 16, I barely know what's being impulsive mean. I like giving the impression my action are out of the blue, but there's little chance I haven't gave it a thought beforehand.\&gt;OP ask Sensors

\&gt;Intuitives answers.

\&gt;/r/Sensor &amp; /u/AmericanSniperPanda were right : we're filthy know-it-all shitlords. =')Yeah. Totally.

I'm messy as fuck, and I don't follow orders. I'm unspeakably annoying to any TJs I know, just the way I am.

I guess it's enough clue I'm not a judger.

People on /r/ENTP even wonder if I'm not a feeler.&gt; Can say the same for myself

Not sure. I'm ashamed of the state of my apartment, currently. It's nearly bad for my health at this point.

&gt; you just have to consider the possibilities :D

It's the "have to" that rubs me the wrong way. I really hate being forced into doing something.

it's like people didn't understood seducing me into something works far better, as far as I can tell.

I'm not the all over the place kind. I'm unspeakably annoying for probably other reason than my ENTPness.IAMA cute moshi. These cute pictures please me.I can see the music ! 

I think a X-ray device is more fitting for Se.

The rest sounds about right to me.Yeah. That really showcase their vigilance and sharpness.It gets better.

You'll have to work on it, but it gets better.

It must get bettter.

&gt;Getting a close friend to explain the social norms is not an option either .

Why ?More than subtle, they're untold. I can deal with subtlety, but I can't deal with mandatory implicit.

I regret learning too late school was about socializing more than marks/learning.

I just learned cringe/disgust had something to do with those social rules.

I'm nowhere better off than you. I was just making myself visible to you, so you could understand you were not alone in that social awkwardness.

The thing is I'm sentenced for life with that. I'm autistic.&gt;  I use a paintball gun to spell it out on white canvas.

I love you.I know that divide.

Does someone know how compensate for my lack of Si ? It begins to feel really tiring to be unable to get my point across or listen to others.What could make you listen ? I don't mind people don't participate, as long as they are somewhat engaged.

Those topics are part of human experience, and usually unavoidable. I just want to take a step ahead, before being surprised and unable to chose how I react. I don't understand how it can sound pointless.I found it pretty genuine. I find OP's tone refreshing.

N/S divide is a controversial topic, but I myself can't get rid of my intuitive biais because this topic isn't discussed. Even if she would have a condescending tone, I would forgive that, for the sake of the importance of the discussion.&gt;They're just too abstract and philosophical for me.

I can get a "practical enough", or should I just give up ?

&gt;I'd rather do that on my own.

You're confident in you skills to deal with that, it seems.

I'd rather be helped if I'm taken aback : I was thinking that way younger, and I regret my arrogance, now. It's exactly the kind of situation I think it's a bad idea to be on our own.

&gt;if I'm going to put energy into a conversation I'd rather it be useful.

Even listening ask for an effort ? It does to me.&gt; if you pay attention to when their eyes start rolling

Easy peasy, huh.

That never came me naturally to check other's expression. I still can't do that correctly.

&gt;make what you're saying inherently interesting.

Best I can I put my passion in it. But no subject i love are inherently interesting. In fact, I know nothing such.

&gt;what's currently in focus.

What's in focus ? What's relevant enough ? How do i know if what I want to say is relevant enough ?

I guess I just gave up. It's a huge mindfuck to me.How do you know it needs to be developed or not, before being taken aback ?

How do you measure someone's viewpoint worth ?

How can someone know you need their viewpoint on some issue ?&gt; That's basically how you make something inherently

That's not enough. People still roll their eyes and go away.

&gt;don't start talking about dinosaurs if you want to keep their interest

They won't want me to help them for the diagnosis neither, because I'm 24.

Why my age has something to do but not dinosaurs ???

I just end up talking about dinosaurs, to entertain them and to try to keep the moral high, in an admittedly awkward and pointless fashion.

What do I do wrong ? How can they listen to me when I try to help them ?&gt; Sorry, I don't understand your first question.

Rephrasing time, then !

Do you think of improvement only after facing an issue ?

&gt;I couldn't tell you the specifics because I'd have to observe myself in the act first.

Hahaha. I don't need the specifics.

&gt;If there's a "hole" or something I'm missing in my perspective, or if I've tested it in reality and it doesn't hold up, I'll get another person's viewpoint. 

Fair enough. The rest isn't relevant and so filtered, I assume.

&gt;Usually, it's someone with an opposite perspective, so an NF. 

It rubs me the wrong way reading that, but I can't put my finger on it. I'll just dismiss it : it's not particularly relevant to me.

&gt;I then either incorporate that perspective into my philosophy or reject it based on its logical/ethical value.

No intermediate solution, like just take components, or tinker the advice/solution/method ? 

&gt;Sorry I can't give a better answer.

Good enough to me. Don't worry. I dug in that without knowing what I would find beforehand, and you did provided some interesting details.

&gt;I haven't observed myself in this process of decision-making before.

I wasn't asking you to describe me that all. I already have an understanding of that, myself, and could just see your Ti by going through your reddit history.

That was how you described your own experience of it that interests me, so I can deduce how you think things in a broader sense. That's what Ne do, anyway. =P

I wanted to see that TiSe synergy of yours in action, and see how I could adapt myself to you. I still feel a bit awkward doing that, though. &gt;That means you talk too much

I choose when to talk and what to say carefully, already. How come I can do better than that ???

&gt; but when you realize that 100% of what they say is "fucking groundbreaking shit" it starts to become the norm

I don't understand that. I don't recognize the norm.

&gt;Otherwise you focus on having other people share their own interests/ go on their own rants, and try not to shoehorn/ piggyback in too much and just ask them how they feel about X ("Do you like [thing they just talked about]")

I'm working on a way to feign interest. This is just deeper smalltalk to me. I get rarely something meaningful from those exchanges of I won't search for meaning by myself or take charge of the topic.

Of course, both are exactly what you listed I shouldn't do, and I already have quite an extensive dataset about all bad outcomes such a behavior can earn me.

I just don't know how to behave in an other way. If I don't invest myself in the conversation, I just faze out, and don't listen.

&gt;Some most people simply don't give a shit what others have to say and have their own thing going on

I've come to think I'm one of those, too. I feel like I'm out of shit to give.

I guess I just need someone who have a couple of shit to give to me. I'm wondering if I gave up about that, too.&gt; but most of the time that's just not how I think.

Fair enough.

&gt;It's tough to describe this stuff to you, though. 

I can read that ! I'm just happy you're trying. And as you're trying really hard, I do my best to listen to you.

&gt; A lot of my decision-making is very automatic.

That's not my case, but that's a topic outside MBTI, or the S/N divide, for that matter.

Keep in mind I know what you're talking about, but only because I studied it extensively.

&gt;Usually, this kind of overhaul happens over the long-term in the back of my mind.

Interesting. That's not a conscious process. You manage your day to day life, and let you mind make long term adjustment in the background. 

That's the complete opposite of what I do : I find daily contingencies boring, and let my body take care of it in automatic pilot, so I can focus on tackling some philosophical issue, and take care of symbolical movements.

&gt;I often consider these issues sort of passively until everything clicks together.

That's the kind of things I came for. That means a lot. I never could deduce that on my own.

&gt;if I'm not thinking purposefully, it can take weeks or even months to put things together in a way that's useful, since I leave that up to my subconscious.

Makes sense. I guess it's kinda the same for Si users.
I take note : it's something I'll keep in mind to go easy on symbolic and philosophy flood. It's a purposeful tip I couldn't get on my own.

&gt;If I feel the urge to test an idea, I usually do it in a safe way.

Safe way ? What's dangerous with ideas ?

&gt;But these moments are few and far between, since usually ideological issues are low-priority for me.

That's coherent with the whole of your discourse.

What's more important than that to you ?

&gt;Sorry I can't give you a better understanding.

You do give me a better understanding. You have access to experiences I just can't reach. That's what I'm chasing, more or less.

&gt;Ask me again in a month. :P

Hahaha ! As you want !

I'm patient.
&gt; but I'm just saying shit in the perspective of anonymous help for some guidebook that isn't specific to one person

Why did you wrote it if you feel it can't help me ?

&gt;my problem is that I am bad at picking relevant topics out of thin air on the spot, so I never start conversations.

I was making a point about relevancy being relative.

It means you can start a conversation based on what *you* think is relevant. 

It means some worldwide built in timeless relevancy don't exist, too.

It's somewhat of a solution to your problem.

&gt;I've found that the people who don't care if they're annoying are the best conversationalists/ best at approaching people.

Yup. They let themselves to learn how to deal with being boring, and how to make best use of what interesting they can bring at the moment.

It's fluid and organic.

&gt;I hope me sharing my problem sort of shows that the whole thing isn't as hopeless as it seems and there are real angles to it.

We don't have the same problem. Mine is of the same nature as the way of solving yours I just gave : both are organic.

I'm organically physically unable to deal with relevancy and conversational purpose. I lost my hope fighting against myself about that for a decade.

I'm not surprised you have no solution.

&gt;I think the people you're imagination is thinking of having a conversation with have too high of standards. 

They don't. I just don't meet most people's standards.

Those standards are forged by conversing with other people. They usually end up balanced and thought out.

But I'm nothing like who they ever talked with, usually. They can't care build standards just for me, even though they know I can't keep up.

I know and understand all that. I have studied it for quite a time by now.

It's just I still end up put aside, left behind and forgotten. It hurts.

&gt;Everyone has really god damn low standards when it comes to talking; except assholes.

Not as low as you think. Sonic fans are not allowed anywhere around the internet for example, even if they can prove they're perfectly fine people.&gt; Your comments amaze me, honestly.

I wasn't betting for it. =)

&gt;it's just how I developed and the way my habits formed.

That' what MBTI is about anyway. Cognitive preferences. You got it right.

&gt;If they don't accept it, I put it back into overhaul and make sure I don't need to deal with it in my everyday life. If they accept it, I'll immediately put it into practice.

It would make my life so much easier if I thought like that.

I spend my time giving pointers to others on the way to take to make their ideas back on their feet, because I feel like mine don't really need anymore. I'm bored of myself.

&gt; when I said that my decision-making was automatic, I meant that it's unconscious.

It's not the same thing, indeed, but I thought I got it right the first time.

Unless I took it unwillingly literally.

&gt;In fact, I'd view my dominant and tertiary functions as the ones that developed first, with Se and Fe coming afterward.

What you're describing is called primary-tertiary loop. It's not a good thing.

It makes introverts avoidant and paranoid, and extroverts, controlling and alienating.

Trusting your auxiliary is important.

&gt;As an introvert, it's always easier to deal with my own internal world than the outside world.

I think it's the same for everyone, considering how a mess it became. I feel like it became too complex for everyone.I'm more surprised of how much autism I don't get away with with most people. I tried hard. Really hard.&gt; Average people is what I'm talking about

It's the same. The most fitting term is neurotypics, at this point, imo.

&gt;Anyone who can't deal with a bit of autism is being pretentious

Anyone who don't know what autism is can't deal with it. It has nothing to do with being pretentious. It's just about loving little boxes and ordered daily routines, and spit on anything that can be seen as a threat to either. I'm an obvious threat to both just the way I am.

&gt;But among memers, you really don't want to come off as a legit autist

Of course not. Who want to be acquainted with such a disturbing a foreign life form ?

It's not like if it wasn't wrote in Internet's rules. I already know I'm not welcome.

&gt;It's the whole "self-awareness" angle thing people value

The same people who give themselves the right to decide who is worthy and who is not, and say they don't believe thy are any special ?

The same people who tell other violence isn't the solution, but use no other means against problems they face ?

The same people who taught me to shut up when I voiced their shortcomings with insulting nicknames, and kicks in the stomach, beaten up into laying on the ground ?

Those people have nothing to teach me about self awareness.

You think you do ?&gt; I'm only 15.

I do am surprised. I used to read adult Ti users who don't even know what ethics are, and you obviously do.

You're on a good way, it seems.
&gt;Though that raises the question, does that attitude already mean that I'm on the Se/Ni axis and just need to develop it? It's sort of a chicken-or-egg question. :P

I'd say the preference made the attitude, at first glance.

A double take makes me think it's not really a problem, as it's who you want to become that's important, not what MBTI can say about that.&gt; I've been mostly raised by an ESFJ, a very strong feeler. My main Thinker influence is from my ISTJ dad. I feel like I'm more balanced, despite being a Ti-dom.

Fe. Must have been hard for you.

My mother's mother is a Fe dom. My mother suffered quite a lot from her because of that. I hope it isn't the same for you.

Fe users don't mean any harm, it's just their faith in the social order can become alienating if they push for it too much.

&gt; skills I'll need as a person.

More than skills, if you choose to take values to harness and embody, you're up for a life you'll be proud of.

It has little to do with MBTI, regardless of your choice, indeed. And don't take my own projection too much at heart too.

Idealists don't really much have their place in our world it seems.

&gt;Thanks for letting me talk.

That the minimum I could do for you.

&gt;You've helped me develop my self-awareness a bit. I appreciate it.

I'm happy to be of service. That was one of the purpose I gave myself here. It's good to see I'm successful about that.It's about managing symbolic understanding, and expertly take intellectual shortcuts through symbolic likeness.

That's what makes the difference between a good memer and a 16 years old who spend too much time on 9GAG.

I think that conscious/unconscious barrier is bullshit. You made all your theory on that.I don't rely on that. I don't understand shadow functions precisely because I don't get that concept.

I do criticize some part of it, too. I was making my own sauce of it the past two years.

Any stronger argument ?
&gt; Just saying something is BS is a terrible way to have a discussion. 

I wasn't planning having a discussion. I just wanted to put my turd here and get away with it.

&gt;The OP is right; the unconscious plays a very significant role in Jung's understanding of intuition.

Does it still plays "a significant role" in a rework meant precisely to not use it in premises because it's bullshit ?&gt; A rework that you allude to put don't explain.

I needed to explain something ? I just wanted to singlehandedly win that argument.

I hate psychoanalysis. You're making me contemplate breaking out with the MBTI community altogether.

It's not missing things I want. It's share what I love. If MBTI isn't what I love anymore, I'll just go away and never return.I have no idea what you tried to tell me.You're a neurotypical, to me.

On/Off, social norms intuitve mastery, little boxes. You have the full package. You are just like most people are. You're one of the fittest.

Congrats.A nice thing ...

I'm not even sure to know how you're experiencing what you're talking about.

Or what I was implying, because it's never as socially acceptable thing to say explicitely. I don't even know whay you think I told you. I feel like what I wrote is meaningless without the subtext.&gt; "right place to ask"

You're asking on the Internet. To anonymous internet users.

I'm sure you know exactly what it means.

&gt;I only sense a little bit of irony there

You see well, but I'm not sure you see why/how it's ironic. My guess is you just sense it somewhat by automatic habit.

&gt;I sense a little bit of anger-hate and I don't want that.

More frustration than hate. It means anger indeed, anyway.

&gt;It's not a problem for me. You can say what you want to say explicitly.

Until you do are shocked/offended. I won't play that way.

&gt;"You are not that special, everyone is like that, stop fucking thinking every behaviour like something special only to you".

I could. It's somewhat what I told, in fact. There's just a central element that lack and function as a keystone, and that I really guarded myself from telling explicitly there.

This comment have been brought to you by the ghost of a Jungian typology enthusiast who's turning round in his grave.Neutral mobs : 

* Bat : none.
* Chicken : None. Too dumb.   
* Sheep : None. Too insulting.     
* Cow : None. Seriously. Imagine I typed it any introvert feeler ???    
* Villagueger : ISTJ. I know you guys won't take exception to that.     
* Golem : ISFJ. No particular reason. I just think it's a good fit.

Hostile mobs :

* **Skeleton/Wither skeletton** : INTJ. They snipe you when you're expecting them the less, and then chase you relentlessly.    
* **Pigmen** : ESFJ. Not hostile at first and quite sociable, considering where they live. But don't dare hurt any of them.    
* **Enderman** : INTP. High on his legs, so I take it as a metaphor to say this mob is some kind of visionary.    
* **Creeper** : ENTP. That one fucker who blow you up when you're gathering wood, in plain day, thinking you were totally safe. You were dead wrong.    
* **Guardian** : ISTJ is already attributed, so ESTJ. ST was given for this monster, in any case, imo. Even though guardians group is in fact SF. I don't care.    
* **Ender Dragon** : ENTJ. I love you guys so much. I know it don't really fit, but that amuses me anyway.    
* **Spider** : INFJ. It's some kind of reference to the vague liking of all things creppy around /r/INFJ.

* **Blaze** : ESTP. Those won't miss you.
* **Wither boss** : ENFJ. Same reason than INFJ/Spider. But in more awesome.    
* **Silverfish** : ISTP. I'm already regretting.
* **Ghast** : ESFP. Needed an extravert. There isn't really much available anymore.But they take and put blocks at random. Villagers are more industrious. #ThatOneGuyWhoIsTryingToJustifyHisLazynessSomething like that. But they have a plan we can't see.#**LOUDER ! 8D**&gt; Objection!

I don't see what's wrong …[OBJECTION !](http://orig13.deviantart.net/9eb9/f/2015/103/f/d/objection__by_troll_overlord-d8pmg44.png)

This is not the Mr.Wright you're looking for.People's ass, mostly.

But it doesn't mean it represent's anything and lacks of accuracy, ironically.More than 30 years of research and a humongous amount of data ! All lies !!!&gt;has actual recordable data to support it

It has. MBTI was assessed in the workplace before having a community of it's own. Most of those assessments were far more accurate than any shitty internet test, and were methodically recorded the past three decades.

We have enough accurate enough data.

&gt;can never be 100% reliable. It's literally impossible .

Do you even know what a confidence interval is ?

&gt;it's still literally impossible to know the general population based on the population of a few

That's all what statistics are about. It's a valid field of mathematics, you know.

&gt; since the MBTI is completely random.

It isn't. It follows a model. Unless you don't know what Jungian typology is.

&gt;There's literally no way to predict something that is literally random.

That's what scientists do since science is a thing. Theorizing, searching for trends and compare models is all the tools mankind use to exactly do that.&gt; Are saying that the MBTI is genetic? and therefore predictable?

I say it's been studied with scientific rigor, therefore it's somewhat well defined and predictable, by definition.

&gt;What I am saying is that the MBTI is not genetic and therefore unpredictable.

I say you don't understand what predictability is and therefore are an idiot.

Genetics is just a scientific field. Predictability is a characteristic all scientific fields have. Social sciences, and psychiatry included. MBTI is born from both.

&gt;So lets say I take an INFP...... tell me what type it's offspring will be.

Safe guess is ISTJ and ESTJ, by default. Then I can dig in the quadrant, so, ENFP. All are in the same quadrant, so your example is too easy to me to be really relevant to your point.

I can troll, telling you a daughter has a lots of chances being an xNFP, but a son, more chances being an xSTJ.

I can cross the data with hursband/wife's type, too. It can agreeably spice the exercise a bit.

Culture plays a large role too. An WASP american family would lean on the xSTJ side, a family in south-eastern Asia more on the xNFP side, etc …

As I've said, that's what science is about.

Can you explain me why you're so dense about that ? 

&gt;If you can answer this question with 100% certainty then I will believe you.

I don't need to because that's idiotic and unreasonable. You know it.

I just don't understand why you ask me that that way.Then go [there](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Science), because you don't know what it means.

And [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Statistics), [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Confidence_interval), [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mathematical_model), [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Personality_type), [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prediction#/Scientific_hypothesis_and_prediction), [here](http://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/), [here](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Relativism) and [there](http://s6.favim.com/orig/65/hey-idiot-love-phrases-Favim.com-589219.jpg), too. Same reason.Maybe ENTJ. Not sure about either the N and the T.

I think ESFJ is a better fit, if it's only about dichotomies.

If I would use functions I'd say Fi Se. So more ISFP. I know, that's the total opposite of the ENTJ, but here me out : 

 * those type are of the same quadrant. It means they have the same functions in their stacks, being Ni, Te, FI, Se. Naturally, the order is inverted : Te Ni Se Fi for ENTJ, and FI Se Ni Te for ISFP.

 * You don't seem really much like an ENTJ to me : I see no Te, barely Ni.

 * You seem sorta introverted.

 * You sound like someone who's driven and dedicated. I associate those to Fi a lot.

 * You seem like someone who's attentive ans sharp, sensorily speaking. I associate those with Se a lot.

---

EDIT : it seems there is a consensus about you being a sensor around there OP. Tell us why you think you're an intuitive, please. Maybe you post didn't made you justice about that.More Ni to me. Si is grounded to the point of being nearly mineral. OP don't sound as reliable as it's said Si users are.&gt; (cuz let's face it, from the time genetics got brought up all respect went out the window).

Mine went away before that. In her first reply, even.

&gt;Science does not claim "truth", it claims "facts", facts that are subject to being discarded once proof that said facts are incorrect

It claims neither. Good science describe. From principles to realities.

Notice the plural. Fact(s) is a meaningless word to me.

&gt;"educated guesses" […] "infer"

Drop those quotes, please. You're hurting my eyes and my heart.

&gt;that is a fact.

That's a reality experienced by everyone.

Also, it seems you made a mistake to who you answered.

&gt;I think ScalSaver already addressed everything I said

Yeah. I didn't quoted really more, because all I can do at this point is nearly exclusively nitpicking and quibbling.

I can't help but notice you got my nickname perfectly right. This pleases me a lot.&gt; a US population

Return in your country, yankee. MBTI isn't exclusively american.
&gt; ( ok not ad hominem, you are attacking another a part besides my argument which is another type of fallacy)

Which your whole argumentation **obviously isn't nearly completely filled of**.

\*Sigh***All** scientific fields, in fact. Even mathematics.

That's really saddens me /u/L7k5u8 has **absolutely no idea** what it is.&gt; Have you ever seen the actual MBTI test? 

I talk about assessments. Have you seen what professional MBTI practitioner do when they type someone ? Well, neither did I.

My guess is that it's mostly the same than "typings by hand" done around there. It's the most reliable typing way I know. Sheets you cross dots on are just here as decoration, indeed.

That's why I still have confidence in the statistical dataset.#Long answer :

Depends on what the room is about.

Depends on why people came there.

Depends if you count them correctly or like a bigoted idiot who don't know what confirmation biais is.

#Short answer :

Just don't. 30 persons isn't a meaningful sample.Guru ?

&gt;they do not have to be trained in or even have passing knowledge about Jungian ideas / cognitive functions in order to be certified

That wasn't always this way. The MBTI practitioners in the 80s couldn't know about MBTI without having heard about functions.

Anyway, and despite all I usually say, had typing only with dichotomies is accurate enough, if done with enough care.&gt; this is why science requires facts to back up/serve as the foundation of theories.

What's those foundations ? I know the answer, but I want you to say it.

&gt; and I assumed that by mentioning him/her like that she would be notified (Like how Facebook does)

 1. You're right about that.

 2. I cringed really hard. Never ever compare Reddit to Facebook again. **Never** ***EVER***. It makes you look like an internet equivalent of a Redneck. A huge dork just freshly arrived from IRL.

&gt; It's for the best anyway, in this discussion you know more than me, you have stated, and linked things better than I can, if that didn't get through, it's best if \/u/L7k5u8  doesn't waste his/her time reading it anyway.

I don't care if he reads what I linked or not. It was mostly just me insulting him of idiot, anyway.

&gt;it would be a disservice to you to not get it perfectly right.

Sweet Eris. It's like that scratching between the ears. Don't stroke any ENTP's ego like that, we just like that too much.

I can just help it : I *love* that kind of praise.
 
&gt; Today the "official" MBTI is little more than a simplified and commercialized version of Big Five.

I don't think so.

&gt;But they certainly do not provide a reliable foundation for making any broad claims about the theory, because of the extremely high risk of systemic bias.

It's compensated by the size of the sample and the statistical treatment of it. You don't need ground, just doing it right enough.
It's stereotypical Te. No Te doms like to be in the lead like OP said he did.

Also : 

 1. Just one sentence is easily negligible.

 1. We can have a particularly charismatic ISFP in front of us. That and if taking charge is one of his main values, here is the false Te flag.

 1. I don't know. I'm out of fuck to give, honestly.&gt;demands &gt; my knowledge.

Sad. I could have seen it coming, maybe. I'll give you the answer at the end of this comment.

&gt; (may include more trial and error than stated).

It's **only** trial and error, by essence. The rest is just intellectual shortcuts to save a bit of either.

it still doesn't tell me on what this understanding is grounded on.

&gt;In this analogy I'm still here cuz I heard you city folk had really huge TVs and other cool stuff but I still don't understand what y'all got them colourful tall buildings fer. But I did have some fast food and I am renting a place for about a month now. It aint got the scenery, but it sure as hell is a better place than that darn ol shack where I left my sister/wife.

Something like that. More incest and less working in the fields. Add a dash of "I know Star Wars so I'm a Geek", and you'll have it. The dork. brrr.

&gt;Any ego stroking I got would just go into a "you're goddamn right"

I can't personally help but feel like it's some back handed manipulation attempt, too. No sane ENTP thinks like that.

I hate loving it, if you will. Else I would just do like the others, and like you stated : "holy shit, that's goooooood …"

Now the "On what science is grounded on"

I said first the principles and then the observable effects. So "facts come after the theorizing. So it's not that.

It's called axioms. It's unprovable theories and statements. Science is built from thin air. That's the big thing. Nobody knows, because there's nothing to learn around there. Nothing's absolute, like you had the intuition of.&gt; The thing about systemic bias is that if it exists, then it renders the sample size totally irrelevant.

Systemic and not systematic ? I read systematic.

There is no systemic bias here. the only one I know in the community is the Intuitive bias, and statistics favors sensors. The bias exist because we're in fact a minority, not the inverse or anything.

Soooo …

The data seem clear enough and the sample size saves the day. QED.&gt; much lesser purposes like pissing off my ISTJ friend.

Pissing off ISTJs should be an international sport. It will make up for all the stupid traditions and procedures they blindly enforce.

&gt;I did not see what you did there

Nevermind. I should quote the passages I was talking about but laziness is kicking in.
&gt; the only letter I've consistently been typed as

I cringe. You don't even know what the dichotomies are. It means I talked Chinese to you with the functions.

We'll have a lot of work to do, here.

&gt; though I've noticed that the tests aren't considered reliable.

That's why you're here.

You know you can type yourself, right ?

&gt;I had social anxiety in high school

May Eris have mercy. You won't make all the rookie errors in one post, will you ?!?

Introvertion/extrovertion has not the same meaning in MBTI than their common meaning. It's about where you draw energy. Social anxiety screw it up, but has nothing to do with your preference in itself. Same for shy/not shy.

Now that said, well, if you're still socially anxious, we'll have hard time anyway.
I don't think I'm able. It's usually a pride to me to be able to pass any bullshit wall thrown at me, but this one resisted me for nearly a year, now.

Your argumentation makes no sense to me : sample size always matter. You can't handle huge datasets with ineficient or completely aberrant method.

Human beings are always biased : we're made this way. We can't even make unbiased artificial intelligences. I can't prouve I'm right, but I can tell you're asking me an impossible proof.

I'm just growing tired of this discussion.I don't know how to lie and I'm very careful about what I say to loved ones.

I care not to say what they want to hear, but things like I think them.

I'm rarely believed or understood, so I'm careful about taking care of my responsibilities.

I guess all that means it's important to me.
I left my parent's to live with my big sister and her husband, 50 meters away, letting them a message saying "forget about me", in size 450. I was very angry, and I was right, but I was also a huge dick doing that.

Even if people are dicks to you, please don't think it gives you the right to be a dick yourself. No truth worth to sacrifice kindness for it, imo.&gt; s a human made construct and literally does not exist

Oooooooh a good client !

Didn't we already argued against each other, already ? 

&gt;If you think something is bad then you simply do something about it. But dont say it's "in the name of justice" because that's just a bunch of bs.

If I say I do something because it amuses me ?

Let's take something random …

Arguing on someone's simplistic positions on complex issues ?

In which little box does it goes ? It's outright trolling, right ?Don't feed the idiot troll. Let the professionals take care of the issue, please. =P

I can't let a good client like him just spurting nonsense like that for everyone to see, and not engaging (And of course having a huge lot of fun doing that.). That would be against the moral code of my religion.He says facts. 

Still in ?&gt; This one is literally set in stone.

Oh dear. You're in trouble with me.

Let's begin, shall we ? I don't need your link. I'll disregard it completely without read it or even click on it. Why ? Because either :

 1. It's an expanded version that basically say exactly what you wrote here. Pointless read, so to speak, if it's the case.

 1. It's your base material/source. I won't source my argumentation. Seldomly, if I use some complicated concept, else completely not. Reciprocity means I don't need your sources as you don't need mine.

 1. It's somewhat unrelated. I know, unlikely. It means I can disregard it without second thought, though.

That formality done, the main dish. 

You're making a relativist argument. It's nice : most of my philosophy relates a lot to relativism. You're saying it applies to moral, but not to facts.

So my argument will fit in only one sentence : why making such difference ?Hahaha. Don't do it if it's not funny to you.

It is to me and I'm already on it.

Choice is yours. You're free. You can live with someone being wrong on the Internet, right ? Please tell me you can.&gt; It's not an argument if it cannot be disputed.

It can't be one if you refuse to, like you did last time, by ignorance. i really hope it's not the same thing, but I can't be sure.

&gt;( that's all I'm going to say, don't put word in my mouth.)

Like if that's what I usually do. =P

&gt; if you want to debate at least try to post something more understandable.

Two cases :

 1. You genuinely have no idea what I want to talk about, but you don't even try to extract what you can, or ask me on the rest. I need you to do that, so I can pinpont where things go awry, and give you a hand about that.

 2. You know exactly what I talk about, so that's dishonest to pretend you don't.

&gt;You are saying otherwise? 

I don't focus specifically on morality. Read again. Answer to the simple question I asked you.

&gt;more link

Don't care. Already told you why.

&gt;EDIT:

Where is the actual Edit ?
&gt; There's literally nothing else to it.

There is, bit that would be for another chapter.

&gt;Ok lets say I think "murder is right it is a good thing to do" are you going to say I'm wrong?

Not arguing about that. Read again.

&gt;And again you are playing the ignorance card.

I'm merely agitating it under your nose, expecting such act may awake some motivation in the conversation at hand.

&gt; If you wanna argue your then do it. Quite hiding like a little bitch. 

I don't hide I asked you two very specific things : 

 1. I asked you a question at the end of [that comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/54g2tb/whats_the_worst_thing_youve_ever_done/d81xs89). I really want it to be answered.

 2. You're arguing the wrong way. I wrote the same comment I linked really specifically about what I wanted to argue about.

&gt;Unless you are straight up trolling.

Who knows ? I thought I was making a genuine and heartfelt point, here. Why do you think it's not the case ? Such accusations offends me. 

&gt;It's normal for ISFP's to not understand NTP's mumble jumble.

That being normal not mean you can lazily let things going that way. You know most ENTP make themselves a pride to challenge norms. 

That's what I'll expect from you, here.

&gt;Seriously try to talk more sense fucking idiot.

Why the anger ? maybe you're just unable to grasp ? =)
Then I'm done, too. You're free to go.

You're using that lazy cope out **again**.I'll begin to take "Sounding like ScalSaver" as a compliment.

I would feel genuinely insulted if you could understand.We lied about that. I can at least give you an upvote for that.But you didn't listen. Know your place, dweeb.Cleaning, or maid. I'm not even invested enough to find something either more insulting or creative.

I do like guessing games, though.I don't know if I feel bad. I think that's why this one is clearly the worst. I know it's some kind of betrayal : I even thought it like this myself.

It's just added up to all littles things I didn't did for them out of incompetency weight somewhat heavily on my shoulders. I just can't act like if it was nothing, even if they told me they forgave me.Hahaha. I really used to take that as some kind of insult. Repeated so  often I just gave up on even being understood.

It makes me happy you could at least read something in that.Considering I was somewhat trolling …

You weren't fooled, anyway. I'm not sure you know how heartwarming it is to me.
&gt; Your writings are composed finely

Someone who can appreciate the work I do on my word choice, finally !

&gt;your bull shit cutter is respectable.

Considering I was writing at 2:30 am, it would be inhumane I could cut through all bullshit. It's not even my topmost pride, I suppose.

I'm really more prideful of my pattern detection.

I'll tag you. People who can appreciate what I do are so rare it would be a crime if I forgot you're one of those.Because we're low on ethics ? I'm sure it's hard for FI and Fe dom to be sociopaths.It's more complicated than that.

Trolling has more to do with intent than result in my opinion. Unless you can prove I had bad intentions in that discussion, you can't be sure I'm trolling.

Obviously, that's a huge digression form our original topic.

Back to or discussion from last time, shall we ?&gt;  doing some crazy stuff.

What's that crazy stuff specifically ?

&gt;if their principles were fucked up enough

Which is realistically rarely the case. Fi doms are usually self conscious and ethically competent enough to not let that happen.

&gt;I think at that point in development, it's less about "not caring" as it is "not prioritizing".

It's in some values of some to have no care to give to others.

I hope it's not in mine but I'm not self conscious enough about that to be really sure, or keep myself straight.

I supposed it was the same for other Fe-ter and worse for Fe-inf.

I've seem sone INTJs display some kind of heartlessness I could somewhat relate to too. I simply inferred it was comparable with Fi-inf and maybe Fi-ter. 

I'm not sure what you point is about.&gt; the greater good in (sometimes the back of their) mind.

Yeah. Except I think it's more the social order than the Greater Good. Some sacrifices are acceptable to ESFJs, if it means to be sure to keep the status quo in place.

I disregard both the status quo and the social order. I'm intendedly disruptive, just because I find the rules suffocating.

It means my act are sometimes really akin to sociopathy. It's just my ideological agenda is kept hidden under layers and layers of seemingly random crap, when true sociopaths are "people without a plan". It's just one bad day away from where I am.You confuse yourself. You'll be able to read it with all your wits back tomorrow, if you want.

I case we don't meet again : good afternoon, good evening and goodbye.&gt;  Not sure if that's necessarily sociopathic, but it could seem that way to outsiders.

Nothing's truly sociopathic in this thread.

I think I know what you mean, and I think it's highly unlikely.

&gt; I'm just wondering where the disparity comes in is all.

That's a good question. That's the question we should ask for all test : MBTI, Big 5 and even autism spectrum tests.

&gt;I'm brainstorming and may sound a little incoherent.

I was indeed trying to find a trend. I'll let you brainstorm. I have nothing really valuable in mind to add to the topic at hand, anymore.&gt; unnecessary complication

Unnecessary to you. Those complication makes sense if you can grasp the trends behind them.

&gt;not even XSTP's do.

You would make my ESTP best friend really sad. He does follow my ramblings, and outwit/outoverthink me from time to time.

You're not not able to because you're a sensor : you're not able to because you're unwilling to.

That's what we all told you last time, and that's what I'm telling you right now again.

&gt;there is a fine distinction between intelligence and "unnecessary complication".

You really want to play this kind of game with me ? Really ?

I just have to ask you what you mean by intelligence. Chances are you mean NeTi wittiness, making a paradoxical point.

If I'm right, just stop it all here, bro. You just made me really bored of our discussion.

You basically told me you didn't even knew what you're talking about if I could anticipate that.

Else, go on, when you'll have your night of sleep.I'm happy to help, I guess.&gt; For someone to go out of their way to spit in the face of social order or the status quo you mentioned.

I go out of your ways, not mine ! And I don't spit. It would make me end up in prison.

More like casually undermining it with apparently meaningless insinuations.

&gt;Rules are what keep the world from becoming a giant chaotic clusterfuck.

I guess I'm one of those who just want to see it burn. Maybe I'm not a bad day away from being a complete sociopath.

&gt;Unless that's not what you meant at all and I'm going off on the wrong idea here but I'm sure you'd tell me.

I would. But you're right enough, it seems.

&gt;Also nice quote there.

An ENTP, talking about sociopathy and not quoting Heath Ledger's Joker ? It would have been a crime against popculture not to make any reference along those lines. =D

It's gold lampshading, here.

It reminds me I just respect a fucked up social order, too. Maybe.&gt;  llama-kin and that this is your way of truly being yourself,

Something like that, yeah.

&gt;I'm sure everyone will understand.

Nah, they don't. Like if I cared.

&gt;As long as I keep it in my mind it's all good though.

Hahaha.

&gt;I was wondering when the first one would pop up, and it seems like you win that race. :p

You can't win that game against a Ne dom. =3

I appreciate people who can appreciate that, in any case.

&gt; I could definitely see myself as a serial killer if I'd had a fucked up childhood, or if I had a vendetta/cause that I felt really strongly about

I had a fucked up childhood, and I killed nobody. Reality is really disappointing, usually.

&gt;infiltrating and torturing/murdering all of the members of a pedophile ring in a post-apocalyptic wasteland scenario.

I don't think there will be a lot of people who would be able to spare child rapists. I know I wouldn't either.

&gt;I wouldn't feel guilt, hesitation, or remorse about that at all.

I'm sure you'll do. Those things are insidious.

&gt;There's a little of them in all of us :') We just hide it better lol

What's the point hiding it, when Ne doms like me see it in plain sight, regardless of your efforts to hide it.

&gt; or something.

More that. I even explicitly stated what I expected from you.

&gt;And jump to conclusions thinking you are right.

I use intuitive leaps because the long version will obviously bore you. Should I explain what an intuitive leap is to you too ?

&gt;I probably won't reply to you ever again.

Said the one who already said that two other times, and shared a couple of dozen more replies with me.

I can't choose if what you're telling me is meaningless or completely empty to me. =)

See you later, I guess. You just need to sleep, like you said.&gt; It's a "necessary, not sufficient" thing for serial killers

Just being fucked up is enough most of the times, imo.

&gt;I would enjoy it.

I wish I would. If I ever would, I would also guilt myself about it. I really hate the idea of being a sadist.

&gt;And yet you're the one arguing that it doesn't exist in me, the evil? Or that I would/could never express it?

Neither. Something like succumbing to it. It's an idiotic idea I keep from a long time : I think there is something inherently seducing in evil. Like a flame, where insects go burn themselves on.

An irrepressible attraction I do my best to ignore.

I don't remember how I had this idea.I'm more on physical mental integrity. I find it seductive because they are sometimes way to gain power and recognition, through manipulation and outright bullying.

It reminds me also why I don't give in. [#HeWhoFightMonsters](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters)&gt; you're made that way, not born.

I'm born different from other. It's not particularly difficult to suppose it's an evil nature. Not difficult to most people, anyway.

&gt;I'm sure a fucked up childhood helps a lot in creating a serial killer.

To not have to deal with the implication if it doesn't. That sound quite familiar to me.&gt; I just think that if my experiences were different, it might have really changed my priorities, you know?

I can picture.

&gt;I think it's just what constitutes that dark side for everyone that's different.

I agree. It means I ought to fight my demons alone, like everyone.

&gt; Think of the religious schoolmistress that makes a dirty child wash her hands 100 times.

I used to think it was Te, but Fe begun to sound fare more like that, the more I learned about it.

&gt; to tolerate messiness in the world

What's tolerable messiness ? I've formed an answer to that, but I wonder about yours, if you have one.

&gt;and to focus my influence on growing positive influences in society rather than destroying negative ones.

Promoting instead of suppressing. Some of us are better in getting their hand dirty, and let live what should be let untouched. I always thought I was this kind of person.It can fit in a three word sentence, by now : 

I'm autistic.I vaguely seek power. I know how dangerous I can be with, so I flee from it as much as I can.

I used to search for knowledge, but I found out meaning ≠ knowledge. I learned a lot of useless crap.

I'm searching for meaning, by now. I don't seem successful : I simply feel lost. I'm wondering if I'm not distracting myself from something even more important.Because I've constantly be told I was.

Snide, avoidant and insidious.
We're definitely wanderer until we find someone to settle with.

I think I'm incompetent. Idiocy is more dangerous than bad intentions, imo.

Most ENTPs take the charge they can handle without ties and being able to undertake them indefinitely. That's how they earn the respect and/or the praise we carve.

But I'm not competent enough to earn any, it seems. Not as much as I need, anyway.&gt; Do you think you know why they think you're evil?

I don't know for sure. 

There is what I told you, of course. I used to hurt loved ones out of carelessness, to the point they have just barely the minimal confidence in me, now.

I can't keep friends, because I'm not wired to take care of the relationship (and the actual person, for that matter). The few friends who remained by my side know I'm blunt and harsh, and that I can remain months and even years not giving news, because it's just how I am.

I'm incompetent in tasks that are obvious to most people. It always puzzle them, it angers most, and disgusts the rest. I'm even angry and disgusted of myself about that. I feel alien to the rest of mankind.

I think I belong to a very ancient and forgotten form of humanity. The kind nobody wants to be reminded of.

You can keep asking. People curious like you are rare. I would be a real idiot to brush you off, especially considering I do want to talk about that.That's fine. I wasn't even hoping for that much. Thanks.&gt; Just give me a shout though when I'm crossing any lines.

Of course. My lines are pretty large, anyway, so don't sweat too much.

&gt;I think it's especially the dom/aux Fe folk

Let's see.

SeTi ESTP best friend.

NiTe ENTJ close friend.

XiFe IxFJ friend.

NiFe INFJ big sis.

Not really much much Fe, indeed.

&gt;I mean there is impatience, and then there's being a right dick, and it sounds to me that most people you met are being the latter. 

The've been plenty of patient with me already. I ask a lot of commitment, and give a really few. Their frustration is rightful. I just can't communicate, when they're angry, and hateful.

&gt; Instead of looking down on others for not getting something/being able to do something, we could also offer to help, or to explain.

They think they know what's all about. It's about laziness to them. No one listens.

&gt;I'm sorry that you've encountered people that get angry or even disgusted at you for that.

No need to apologize. I've made myself a reason. Maybe they're right after all. I'm just too slow for this world. I'm not one of yours.

&gt;It might be nothing coming from a stranger on the internet, but I just want you to keep remembering that.

I can't forget all the times people told me they preferred I wasn't by their side.

It's a long time my wishes were broke in million shards on the concrete. So I decided to grant them that one. Fading away and just observe from afar. I remember, now.

I've forgot.

&gt; For me it's tolerable as long as it can eventually be cleaned.

Uh oh.

&gt;. Once there's something that's doing permanent damage, though, it must be stopped.

Uuuuuh …

&gt; I can tolerate any amount of corruption or incompetence by public officials

But not your closest ones ? I don't understand.

&gt;But as soon as the people's education, information, or access to communication is threatened

I threaten any of that. I threaten the rest to make more place for all of those be better promoted. Especially the first, as a Nerd.

&gt;Because if you can censor the truth, you can keep them from turning against you. 

Censoring isn't a real threat to information, oddly.

Misinformation is one far more insidious and disregarded. Some people inform themselves from Facebook or Fox News. Either is more one needs to drown in bullshit, and take it for granted.

&gt;but we've yet to see whether the people still have enough power left to fight back, or whether it will crumble.

If y'all choose Trump, you'll die the American Way : with a huge rainbow colored fireworks that would last for decades, and put fire everywhere.

I guess I can't think of a better fitting death for the ol'Uncle Sam.CROOKED HILLARY SHALL NOT PASS !

VOTE TRUMP FOR COLLATERAL DAMAGES ![That taiwanese 4th july fireworks.](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/fireworks)I answered honestly. I want America to be great again before a last gigantic boom.Thank the Oatmeal. He's an ENTP, for that matter.

That explains the HIGH ENERGY of this metaphor.&gt; As a Christian

Please tell me I can have a laugh on your religion. Pretty please !

(Also, Trump share your faith. That explains a lot ! =) )&gt; What do you mean exactly?

I'm not committed enough in my relationships. I try to preserve my mental energy for my projects, and be with people, even if I know them is really draining to me.

So I take a step back, more often than not.

&gt;(how much I hate to use the word in this context) society

Why ?

&gt; Regardless I think we should all learn to maybe not listen more, but listen better.

That's the kind of meaningless pseudo empowering discourse I hear/read all day long.

You can't learn that, as I can't learn to interact with you all in an understandable enough way. You're not curious, and I'm not sociable. That's biological facts.

Best we can is work a bit to make things a bit smoother, but there will always be ostracism against me and the rest of the spectrum, and you're all bound to repeat mistakes because nothing that's not broken should deserve any attention.

I'm not even broken. I'm just unspeakably strange.

&gt;Were they mad at you or something? 

I don't really remember. I told myself it doesn't matter, by now. I tried to know that. I searched a lot, and emptied my own memories, replaying them to myself to see if I missed something.

I know I missed something. But I'll never be able to get it. It doesn't matter anymore.

&gt;that right there sounds so negative.

That's pure hatred. That's the reason I know so well what it is.

&gt;but I suppose people that don't want you around aren't worth your time anyway. 

I wasn't worth their time anyway.

&gt;I'm sure there are tons of people who do want you around and appreciate you once they meet you

Yeah. And then either I forget about them because I don't have place to remember them in my brain, either they forget about me because I don't foster the relationship enough.

\*Sigh*&gt;loving your enemies, being charitable to others, and becoming a humble servant to people

Who does ? I don't.&gt; So you are ok with gas prices going up by a lot?

Oh yeah !!!!!!!!

That would makes you'all yankees drive/pollute less.

I will see less of those shitty SUVs on highroads driving like retards because driving code and even the concept of owning a car is too complicated for them.

You don't deserve such easiness of life. You don't even know how to use it with responsibility and intelligence.

Time to use the train or the bus.&gt; to make sure all the CUCKS are staying in check, LOL!!!

The moderators ? I'm no policeman. I'm just an idiot who uses memes he don't understand.

&gt; Good thing you are a living regurgitation of what we see on r/the_donald to save us all the trip over there!

It's not my fault if your memes are so dank I fell in love for them.

&gt;Thanks for spreading the good word :-)

I'm just saying the truth, right ? Right ?

**Sigh*\*

Long live to Kek's reign. May he speaks to us through the dubs for the eternity. May the world remember is HIGH ENERGY for millennia to come.&gt; Oh wait. You don't.

Then use your legs. =)

It will make up for your fat ass.&gt; In my day growing up in the middle class, we didn't have legs.

Hahaha. 

&gt;None of these little brats have to even work for them (= millennials will be the downfall of our republic.

Kudos to you good sir. Here is an upvote for that quality entertainment you gave me. =')&gt; And by that I mean, everything is ridiculously spread out.

I know most of the US is just empty, but I never been there by myself. I guess experiencing it makes the difference.

On the other hand, though, the man or woman you'll choose as president don't matter. Even Obama couldn't fix your country. I don't think any other retard who presented themselves for the task can even be remotely as great as Obama is.&gt; How the hell would you know if I was fat or not? 

I don't. =)

You insulted me of ignorant idiot, I insulted you of big fat american. That's all.

No biggie, right ?

&gt;I should have to walk 6 miles to class and 6 miles back home 4 times a week? Ya. I doubt even YOU would do that.

Half of that with a 10kg back pack, in high school.

There were about 30km to do to go to uni, but the public transport is cheap around there.

And I did the army, a couple of months so I guess I walked about 10 miles a day. It's not that hard with good shoes.

Now, well …

Let's say I don't have as much of opportunities to do exercise as I used to. The army pretty much disgusted me of that.Nah. That's synonymous of saying "If something can't be solved with violence, it's you didn't used enough brute force."

You know as well as I do it's not only completely stupid and cynical, it totally delusional, too.

No more strategizing for me.I use Reddit Enhancement Suite.

It's a browser addon that changes completely my experience as a Redditor, with a ton of features.

One of them is tagging : I can associate a short written tag to someone's username, and it's displayed each time I see that username again. Like a flair, but for Reddit as a whole, and for me.

And it's a link to where I set it, for context.

It's a mean for me to remember what you just told me.

I won't forget it.You use which web browser ? I can tell you if RES is compatible.It's the lastest version. Google don't make programmers shit bricks to publish their work in the chrome store, unlike Apple.

I use Opera. I installed the Chrome version, because I can.

It has a real shitton of features, so take time to locate those you like the most.IE ? Seriously ? 

IE has no redeemable quality. It's 10 years behind, which means even someone who don't read about web browsers features can see it's a crippled relic of the past.

Chrome don't fit to my habits I find it rough. It works decently.

Firefox is supposed to be at the top, technologically speaking, but it means it's also unstable.

Opera is a bit behind. Some interesting features like an integrated ad blocker. Most stable I used by now.

I'm on Mac, it means I have Safari, preinstalled. I seldom used it. It's a disgrace. Not as much as IE, but still.

Most of open source browsers that remains are really behind technologically and have really rough interfaces. Vivaldi is the exception : it's based on chrome, and the interface is an interesting curiosity.Good enough for me. =)&gt;Sorry for the late reply fam.

No biggie.

&gt;But what do you mean with that you ask a lot of commitment? Like more so than most people or?

More than I can reciprocate. More than most accept to give.

&gt;We're all part of society so no need for me to exclude myself from it in my words.

I exclude myself. I guess it allows you to.

&gt;you seemed down so I wanted to cheer you up.

I've seen. I guess I should have acted in a way so I shown you I've seen what you did there, at least.

It's not because you personally are not able to cheer up, but because I'm more depressed than what any cheer up can compensate. I don't want to give you hope, when it's just impossible. To lie to you.

You shouldn't apologize for that.

&gt;but it's also something that you can change in yourself.

How so ? By *learning* it ?

&gt;People aren't static, we change by the minute.

I've changed myself, by the course of the last couple of years. I just feel unable to register those changes.

What's the point trying to do something you just can't measure or sense ?

&gt;I just wished I had asked what I did wrong so I could avoid it in the future

Hahaha. I did asked.

That's why I kinda think it's their fault. It's just I know it's completely arrogant of me to think I bear no blame.

But I still have no answers.Do however you feel like it. It's just an Internet test. You life don't depends on the outcome.

You can ask for a typing, here if you're still wondering.

You can fill it multiple times, and make your selection between the different outcomes.

You can just put a little x in your 4 letter label. Like I *can't* do on my flair, here, which is a shame, because I know exactly why it's impossible. I'm an ENxP for now. It can change. Everyone can change. 

Dont sweat it too much.You just took a test barely useful. Online test are crap.

I wonder when I'll be tired saying that.That's not passive agressive, that's ego stroking. And I love that.

Ask people here. Machines can't type.

You could try to type yourself, too, but it ask for reasearch about the holy and sacred cognitive functions.

Primary at the same moment than language, aux at 6-7, Tertiary in the late teens.

Inferior in the mid 20's.

So you can try when they are 6-10, but easiest when fully adult.Dammit. It's unreadable.Ne Male Fire Mage. Burn first, ask questions later. He can make the ashes talk, too. He's the party funder. He was kicked off the mage academy because of his fiery temperament, but he's smart enough to help folks around, and feed the misfits who decided to follow him.

Ti Female Assassin. Prompt to retreat. Great tactician. She decided to follow the mage, as he's knowledgeable about the assassination contracts around, and good in negotiation. And he really appreciate her zero nonsense advices and warnings, even though he ignore them in times and others.

Fe Male Novice Nurse. Try to heal the mage's victims, but that's pretty pointless. Handle the negotiations with the mage because the assassin is shy. He's naive. He believes the mage is still a member of the Academy, and the assassin is his assistant. He likes having everyone's needs met, and don't hesitate to go out of his way to assure himself it's the case.

Si Female Novice Accountant. Handle paperwork and intendance, badly, because the party is always broke and on the road. Succumbs easily to the Mage's smooth talking into indulging his eccentricities. The mages hide her a big part of the origin of the party's earnings, giving her bad excuses. She did't quite achieved to find out the truth, because she's too occupied dealing with the authorities.Obligatory pun. =P&gt; Sasuke from "Naruto"

Noooooo dude …

&gt;I relate to him a lot. 

Noooooooooo …

2 paragraphs about Narutarded shit. Bro …

&gt;the trauma Sasuke went through as a child

May Eris have mercy : your entire comment is about that excuse of brooding character with a troubled past.

You can't be serious. It's not that it's barely interesting, it's more you literally seem to have nothing else to give as a contribution, here. I'm not angry or anything. I'm just really and genuinely sad for you.Hum … No ?

You seemed in need, and I'm idiotic enough to believe the words of a song from a cartoon initially aimed to 8 years old girls and maybe their parents, that happened to be really popular on 4Chan at the time of it's most recent reboot.

The difference between this one and Naruto is popularity. I just don't want you to learn what this difference means the hard way. I mean well.Why ? You don't mean as well ?That … Amusing, somehow. 

I really try to be kind with you. For real. Your reactions tempt that troll that crawl in the back of my mind. I like you, dude. It's just it's old habits I'm not sure to be able to contain if you make too much promises to me.

Just tell me what's you have on your heart, and you'll be off with it. I promise. If you give up on that childish masquerade, you'll be safe, and listened to.Meh. Suit yourself. I tried.

I'm happy I got some coherent words from you at last, anyway.Depression and social anxiety screw up a typing.

At 19 years old, chances are you haven't quite finished your cognitive developpement. A couple of years more are needed to have your thinking stabilizied after puberty and having some consistent data about your thinking habits. Those are what I need to type you accurately.

On a side note, I hate emojis. &gt; antidepressants work suprisingly well

Reason more. Psychoactive substances don't magically put you up on your feet. And I don't know if you really walk like you would once not depressed anymore, or are just smiling to me, telling me all is fine when you just can't see all is not fine.

&gt;I will be 19 in two months :) .

That don't changes what I was saying about your age.

&gt;But, if you could have an idea of my type, what would it be?

I didn't cared to read in detail because you're depressed, too young   trying to extorque me an answer at all cost, aaaaaaaaaaand on a minor note, using emojis like if you were writing on Facebook.

You can't have a compromise with someone who isn't here to negotiate. You need to have me open the negotiations and that's not going to happen.

Comme back when you got your whole mental health at hand, and then we'll talk about that.

&gt;I hate sounding too cold.

Then do like in the 90's : use smileys. =)

PS : Yes, this smiley is used condescendingly. That's impossible with emojis. That's why smileys are a superior form of expressing emotional cues by writing.

That's also a totally idiotic debate because it doesn't matter, but it stills matters a lot to me despite what I keep telling myself and what I told you all along this thread.You won't be able to say I didn't told you.

It's not MBTI is Serious Business™ to me, it's just your situation don't fit to the typing process.

I gave you the specific reasons.

The ball is on your side.I'm the most in pain to tell you : Your waifu is a one dimensional badly written cartoon character from another insipid show for 8 years old girls.

She's untypable because she has the cognitive competency of a 6 year old ADD hysterical little girl.

Not only that's beyond MBTI, but she's even beyond our knowledge of human thinking. That's how bad they screwed up her characterization. And she's the best of the three at this regard.

My condolences.&gt; Because humans can't be as perfect as them in real life.

She isn't perfect, she's an Eldritch abomination, psychologically speaking. An unspeakable shallow puddle of hysterical giggles and yells, incompetent spy in neon green suit, uncurious nerd who read nothing but tabloids.

&gt; So it's not "screwed up", the correct term here would be "idealized to the point of impractical application in the real world". 

I chose my words carefully. She's so screwed up science can do nothing for her.

You're lying to yourself.You don't think positive. You think deluded.

Maybe we'll meet again. Stay safe until then, and don't obsess too much on that thing.

You'll just earn yourself headaches that way.Obvious ENFP.

Ne everywhere, and Fi behind, like how I expected it to be. You sound like an insane cartoon ENFP character I love. Bouncing everywhere and asking for throwing up a party every day.

[](/5k "Who also happen to be Best Pony.")You should really get those beliefs and values in check, or your thinking will literally go everywhere and anywhere. Trust some Ne dom wisdom, here.

Else, well, your case seem pretty easy !

Defo Fi/Te. You don't know what ethics are, but all will click once you'll learn about it.

You're nearly a textbook ENFP to me. Nearly too easy.

I'll need to explain you where I see specifically your Ne and Fi. I won't do that, because it's tedious, and I'm tired.

I think a good exercise for you is to read material were Fi is labelled as "Extraverted Ethics". Socionics and the ol'Jungian typology refers to it that way, when people who know what they are talking about tell us what it is.

I usually go through that kind of work, but there is a moment I just don't feel like it. Today is that kind of moment. I guess you'll learn how to type yourself with that. Cheers.Sadly, I'm not perfectly an ENTP. Flairs here don't allow me displaying my undifferentiated dichotomy.

But here we go. I'm back saying some heresy again.Bb ? \*skeptical eyebrow raising*
See you later, I guess ...What are you saying, 'Morty ? \*burp*

EDIT : Didn't watched enough episodes to make a good impersonation. It means it was mostly heartfelt. So, uh … Thanks I guess ?What effort you're talking about ? Writing crap on the net is *effortless* to me. Why do you even care ? He's just another anonymous redditor.
I've created this based on the numbers provided by myersbriggs: https://man42.net/external/Jung.html

My biggest open question is about the female population valuing F more than T in their decision making (73%) against 43% in the male population. I wonder where this gap comes from, if it's inate or if they are just mistypes due to the cultural environment.

Has anyone tried it?I see it more as "How do you feel knowing what these people think about you?"

The more data we get, the more accurate these tendencies will be. [Take the survey!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTCIkcxO30RBnpXQIGXV0xaRqj5LFytF_LPmE-DdrD9-qSoA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1)

Thanks :)

Agreed that **ENFP**x**INTJ** relationship's ratings seem average, where **ENFP**x**INTP** seems to be a much better fit.

Also, **INTP**x**INFJ**  and **ENTP**x**INFJ** relationships seem to be both quite popular and well rated no? (see [Other types relationships with INFJ](https://man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-stats/#other-types-relationships-with-infj))You helped me realize that it was easy to get confused by the results, so I've just made the following changes:

- Added different colors for friendships vs relationships statistics (instantly figuring out what you are looking at).
- Added "quick jump" tables through the page (easier navigation).
- The score tables are now sortable when clicking on a header (easier comparison between ratings, happiness, duration, etc)

:)Super interesting blog, thanks for sharing!You should look at cognitive functions:

INTJ: Introverted Intuition, Extraverted Thinking
INTP: Introverted Thinking, Extraverted Intuition

For example: do you rely on thinking merely for the purpose of understing things internally, or merely for the purpose of having an impact to the outside world?

Extraverted thinking would be more relying on thinking to reach a practical result.

Introverted Thinking would mostly be satisfied by the sole purpose of understanding something.

Read about cognitive functions :)Actually a guy who spends the time to get 13 different MBTI tests just to know what type he might be (which has apparently no direct practical use for him) would indeed suggest INTP to me.

Moreover, if he wanted to take the shortest path to know his MBTI type, there would be more straightforward ways to do that. Seeking the knowledge of how all the different tests compare would be more of a thing for INTP than INTJ to me.

So I get the same impression: sounds more like an INTP behavior to me.&gt; could I be 50%/50%?

No.

The functional stack are the functions we tend to use naturally and value (we mostly enjoy using them). As we grow older, the 3rd functions usually start to take more space and become more enjoyable (25-35 years old), and the 4th function a bit later on.

We all use all of the 8 functions. A person leading with Ti will generally be quite proficient as well with Te, but it's not usually activated "automatically" compared to the function that would be more like a constant background process.

Elon Musk is a good example of an INTJ. He is quite technical, but his Te make him automatically get him a sense of the shorter path to reach a practical result (this explains a lot of his decisions).

An INTP would (generally) be more like exploring knowledge for the sake of knowledge, and eventually combining what he knows to create things from time to time (but the practical result won't be the main goal for gathering this knowledge).I don't know you, but it would indicate that you are satisfied at the step where you have acquired the knowledge and the practical use of it becomes irrelevant.

I believe this situation would be seen a bit as a waste of time for an INTJ, while it would be satisfying for an INTP (highly speculative on the INTJs side).Apparently it's a mix of both when I check the results.

I find the humanmetrics test to be the most reliable usually (it doesn't mean it's always right).

Keep in mind that tests are just an indication, they are only ~70% accurate and doing the same test 2 times can give you different results. They just give you a "hint" to which profiles you should read and then figure out by yourself.

I don't have any specific literature regarding INTP vs INTJ. Read the profiles, read about cognitive functions, and figure out what fits you best.

I find this blog to be resourceful:

 - http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/masterpostsSee this other thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5w5ok2/entp_vs_intp/
Rick is a perfect caricature of the ENTP personality. "Hating people" is a common ENTP trait, and ENTPs typically prefer to do things on their own, not trusting others to accomplish tasks in the most efficient manner - motivating them to shut others out to do things their way; "the right way". 

Many people seem to forget that just because you're extroverted doesn't mean you love socializing with everyone all the time and enjoy the constant companionship of others. Cognitive extraversion is not synonymous with social extraversion.Oh shit my bad, that comment was supposed to be in response to /u/muon42

Edit: wait never mind.... Idk who that comment was for now... Wtf is wrong with meYeah, I chuckled a bit. The interaction was just comical. The dude was immature and explosive and the woman was seemingly brain dead.

Too lazy to explainBecause people like to sit and toy with ideas. You're on the MBTI subreddit dude, this is kind of what it's for.Well by your logic you do believe that feminism is correct, you just think that the term feminism is incorrect on an etymological level - which I agree with.Oh idk, this is the first I've heard of it.I agree. A lot of modern "feminists" give the movement a bad reputation and are the primary reason why so many kids try to be so contrarian and obtuse.I would say this is mostly true about INFPs until you really get to know them on a deeper level - then you find out that they're really just a ball of rage and tears.What's this "quadra" shit? Can someone shoot me a link?LmaoTequilaQQGot ENTP. That was actually a pretty well made quiz.You're a FiNe SiTe is way better.As an ENTP I got Freewheeling Leader. Nice. B)You're adjective is respectful and you're an ENTP?? Something's fishy here.....Absolutely Ne, it rules my entire life.Yeah what the fuck is this dude talking about?Okay, I've been laughing these threads off and just fucking around with you guys, but it just seems like you guys are getting angrier and angrier so I'll actually weigh in on a serious note.

The characteristics you all are describing sounds like you're encountering some very immature people - whether they're actually ENTPs I can't say. However, I can't say I've ever met an ENTP who poked fun at others who wasn't sending an open invitation to have that person poke them back. On top of that, if you're talking to a person who is easily offended, I really doubt that you're talking to an ENTP. Many types mistype themselves as ENTP; INFJ being one of the most common. Finally, the fact that you all are getting so bent out of shape over your extremely generalized perception of an entire type shows that you all really need to:

A.) Lighten up.

B.) Learn that each individual under one type is just that; an individual. What one person may say or do is not an indication that every other person under that type is going to act the same way. MBTI is a rough pseudscience that can not be relied on as a way to label every person on the planet with one of 16 titles. 

In closing, I encourage you guys to talk to some people on the ENTP subreddit. Preferably someone who doesn't sound like they're 14 like the way you're describing us all lol. If any one of you are genuinely interested in having an adult conversation with an ENTP, feel free to shoot me a message. I love you all!

Edit: a wordI'm fine with being called out, but if you're gonna sit there and gripe about a joke then you do need to lighten up. People often get mad at ENTPs because when someone complains about something an ENTP says, the ENTP will just continue to make light of the situation. This is because ENTPs generally don't take shit too seriously.Just out of curiosity, what's your type? Many people don't get along with ENTPs, but most of us don't see that as a social problem. Yes, we're abrasive and can sometimes be a little relentless, but when someone is off put or offended by this, I don't take it personally. I don't need you to like me or to associate with you (not you specifically, just speaking generally here). If we don't get along - that's okay. We don't all have to harmonize. You're either young yourself, or you're hanging around very immature "ENTPs". Nothing of what you've said about ENTPs has resonated with me at all, it just sounds like you're describing a very childish person. For what it's worth, I'm actually married to an INFP and she likes all my "jokes". I hope your future encounters with ENTPs aren't as shitty as the ones you've had up until this point.I'll argue for any type. I'm willing to take criticism, but I'm also willing to defend my personality when it's being shit on.I was only putting ENTP in quotes because the people you're describing sound nothing like ENTPs to me, but I'll take your word for it. I guess they're just idiots.We are a polarizing people!Tyrion from GoT and Rick from Rick and Morty.Hey you don't say that I'm hearing a lot about ENTPs who are getting offended on this sub, and I don't understand it. I've never known an ENTP to really be offended by anything, same with INTPs I'd say for the most part.

Edit: This isn't to say I'm not insecure, because I am to an extent (aren't we all?), but nothing anyone could say would offend me because of my insecurities.I definitely wouldn't say that "easily angered" is an ENTP trait. As far as typing yourself goes, study the functions!So close!You're looking at it. Good luck getting any xNxP's to sit here and devote time to listing traits that they personally value when they could instead be watching tv or reading a Wikipedia article about why ducks have corkscrew shaped penises.Whenever you need me!The point of my comment was that XNXP's are historically known to be unmotivated and distracted.

No, I'm not attracted to my mother.Okay, ISTP is definitely more dom than me, but I'll argue every other type! There's a difference between insecure try hards and Dom types... Keep that in mind. ISTP is the ultimate dom though.I would say Ne is more like branches on a tree than roots. Roots imply the beginning, branches imply the end. With Ne, one idea splinters into a thousand, Ni is the opposite. So you could make the root-tree analogy with Ni and the tree-branch analogy with NeFair enough, I see your perspective. I love you bbI like all MBTI types. We're all human. Your temperament isn't a reason for me to dislike you.Wtf is this#I'm not religious at all, but I can't see someone with my personality being *anti*-religious. Because who cares? But yeah, ENTJ seems to be the most likely to be some kind of religious zealot lol.Will you marry meI'm an ENTP and I support this message. If you haven't seen James Acaster... Go do.He gets an aneurysm so you don't have to.Nope. I'm getting better at recognizing it but sometimes I just default to getting angry because it's easier than figuring out what's going on in my head. I probably also default to anger because I get frustrated trying to conceptualize my emotions while I'm experiencing them. Ti Aux btw.😎👍I feel like the ENTJ should look more angry/outraged instead of insane/maniacal while killing the ENTPSomeone doesn't like their type....*ahem*

 VIDYANTs daydream but they don't convey any sort of emotion while doing it, in my experience.I'd say ESTJs are probably the *least* daydreaming.Haha schmucksYup, I was just pleased to hear it in the wildOh yeahAlso ENTP type 7 and I agree.What do you wantBojack is most certainly ENTP... I don't know how you could think he was an INTJ lol.If you trust statisticsTrust me bbGrossIs it sad that I'm calling you out or sad that you're too prideful to acknowledge your own arrogance?Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't emotional intelligence your ability to read and discern the emotions of others?My point is that people use the term "emotional intelligence" to describe their recognition of their own emotions. NTs typically don't have issues reading others emotions.I mean I said correct me if I'm wrong, so if I'm wrong, correct me.You wouldn't get itWell I deleted my post because I scrolled down and saw something you commented that made me laugh, but now I realize that you just got lucky and you're probably 14. In which case, it's okay to be so obnoxious and clueless to how much self awareness you lack, I was similar when I was your age. But if you're over the age of 20 and still acting this way, do some soul searching friend. "Troll" shouldn't be the defining characteristic of your personality. That's boring.We're not all this bad, I promise.Nah bro Fleck is definitely an INFP.This is awesomeYou can actually filter people based on their flair?Swap INTP with ENTP and ESTP with ESTJ.

Also I don't get INFJ.And "ENTP". So you they're filtering both? Maybe it's a browser thing.Wow if that whole thing was a joke then yeah that was trash.It's not that you're sad *emotionally*, you're sad *conceptually*. Like, when I think about an INTJ, it makes *me* sad. But what do I know, I'm just an edgy thot.You lil thotty thotI'm really just fucking around but there's some truth to all jokes. You guys can be just super reserved and stand offish at times. I feel like you can be pretty lonesome because you often don't allow yourselves to get close to people.And that's why you aren't *actually* sad, you're type just *feels* sad to other types, especially extroverts.Good to hear my guy, you do you.Sounds like you're just really sensitive.ITT: A bunch of ENFPs pigeonholing INTJs as assholes to make themselves feel better for being so delicate.They're called PREniusesI think we're both right here.Whoever made that typeface needs to redo the lowercase mWhat does the trophy say on itCan you write "love Dad" after the inscription? No reasonWow thanks Dad ☺️🏆That explains the heels and lipstickINTP - can talk forever about ideas and similar interests

INTJ - can talk forever about ideas from very different perspectives, but we still get each other

INFJ - makes me feel lovedYeah I tried to tell him 🤷Hey bud this an A-B conversation so make like a tree and fuck offEverything is a mental illness now.This post was made by the Ne gangxTREMEThis is ISTP broMan I don't relate to the last one at all. I have a lot of friends like that, but I don't ever get that kind of hypochondriac worry. Would that mean I have underdeveloped Si?watIf seeing a cartoon representation of your "personality type" shooting itself with a shotgun makes you sad, you have bigger issues than "offensive" memes.u r rartedImagine having to talk to your mom.... We live in a societyThis is also my take on existence.

Fucking weeb.This is how INTJ sees himselfBasedPretty sure intuitive types all have a touch of autismME THINKER NO HAVE FEELINGSAmen.Yeah, r/ENTP is starting to get pretty unbearable with all the self-aggrandizing bullshit.ENTPs suck.lolr/entpMy brain is long and smoothCleverer doesn't sound as clever as more clever though, more clever sounds much clevererI imagine it's pretty difficult to use Ni to predict the off the wall bullshit that Ne is going to come up with though. That's why we're soulmates ❤️Well, that doesn't follow because I'm clearly much more cleverer than youThe battle never truly endsYeah, the ENTP keeps the INFJ entertained and the INFJ keeps the ENTP from being a fucking retard all the time
xxFP???I wish I could hold a grudge. I feel flighty because I can't.I can see how you ended up at ISFP.mumпиздаI got chaotic evil.You're describing me to a T. It's hard to explain.. But after the funny thing in question happens, I keep playing it over and over again in my head, maybe looking at it from different perspectives. Like squeezing all the laughter I can out of it I suppose. Not necessarily to do with absurdity, but it is a lot of the time. Just the absurdity of the particular thing I'm laughing about though, nothing else.I suppose I'm more like an STP in that I would more likely be laughing at something in the environmentxSTPs don't have Fe??These sorts of comments aren't constructive at all. We get it! You have an opinion!Nahyou can't speak for us!So you're arguing against the correlation.What do you think about ENTP for Kevin? It would explain the relationship between him and his mum (unhealthy W
ENTP with an unhealthy INFP).Well yeah obviously, but there is an inherent difference in the way they act. So what do you think of ENTP for Kevin? I think I might see Ni but idk, I should go to sleep110% THISThe reasons for the doorslamming are different though. An INFJ would doorslam if they feel their trust or friendship has been breached, /u/omiocat doorslams if they don't feel understood. That is very Fi.we see the possibility of each path - Ne

it hurts to choose one and abandon all the others - Sooo.... Ne.........

Not assertive - Ne

can't get ourselves to like someone unless we feel that he/she will understand us perfectly - FiI start about 1% of the shit I think about, and I have the iciest ambition there isThat's so dumb... Literally everyone has this capability, you just won't do anything about it. Granted, I don't finish anything, but I don't go round telling people who have got their shit together that they're lucky.yawnI think Kevin (especially in his younger years) is characterised by his distaste for authority. I won't dismiss ISTJ because of this, but it's more unlikely. I don't remember anything about the robin hood story (was it in the film? fuck), but if he clings onto it that could be childish Si that you would see in NPs. I don't think he is an INTJ, but I could see ENTJ.I don't read old conversations, but I do find myself looking back at old photos a lot. I always end up vaguely depressed so i try not to do it.oooooooh fuck, that makes sense. Just made the movie go up in the ranks for me. But do you not see a proper fucked ENTP right there at all?No I'm not saying you were disrespecting him, I'm saying you're an idiot&gt; Are Dom Si types necessarily pro-authority?

Nope

&gt; Si types cling to the beliefs they were taught as a child right?

Likely

&gt; So if a child was raised with somewhat anti-authority beliefs, is it possible they would seem unlike a typical Si user?

YeppavlovxNTx. 16personalities did a study on this a while back.INTPs can't be organised?People say that nostalgia is usually related to tertiary or inferior Si, the child-like functions.Ne Ne Ne Ne NeI live in a constant state of vague nostalgia.I thought there already was one?ingenious, hahahaIf they don't act to the functions, they're not infj's.. Unless you mean they don't act like you expect infj's would?I would expect INFPs to dislike being typed, but not INFJsI don't daydream as often as I space out, where I will just sit there staring at blank space with nothing going on in my head (that I can see).But wouldn't Fi dislike being pigeonholed into one type, as they most strongly think everyone, and more importantly they themselves are unique? And why would the INFJ get offended at trying to understand them?Oh, you mean /r/infp?If you're not "certain," you're not an INTJ.What doubts are you having about which one you are?Hmm.. Well, the first thing to note is that people often don't notice themselves using their dominant function, because it's so well developed. I'm leaning towards INFP. To be honest, I'm not 100% on whether or not you use Fi either. Do you relate at all to Ti?Well, I looked through your post history, and I think you are an xNFP. Probably INFP, like i said before.From what I've seen, ESTJ and ENTJ are considered the "douchebags" of mbti./r/infj is 50% infp, bearing in mind.Most of what you said be applied to sensors too, and not getting S on a test isn't really a valid reason. Have you read any of the sensor descriptions? I say that because I don't think you would agree with me telling you to looks up the functionsI suppose the INTP would be a quantum computer then?[there you go.](http://i.imgur.com/lkAbsIQ.png) I think /u/peppermint-kiss got 2 of the colour codes wrong (there are duplicates) so i adjusted them.no worries :)You're wrong.

Fi anywhere = "Fuck social rules that don't make sense"

Inferior Fe = "I wish I knew how to fit in but I always fuck up, anxious etc."

It makes no sense for Fe to act in the way you explain it.He is definitely not an INFJ, haha. INFP or ISFP without a doubt.&gt;CaricatureENTPFor one, Fe wouldn't leave their family worrying for no reason.Everyone's different, but everyone falls into one of these 16 categories. Chris does not fit into any of the 8 categories with Fe as one the four functions, which includes INFJ. FWIW I'm leaning towards ISFP. I am going on functions alone here - even I can relate with Chris McCandless, and ISFP is the polar opposite to INTP.Annie wiggles between isfj and istj.For the difference between INTJ and ISTJ, a basic question: do you spend more time in the future or in the past?What?What are you talking about?INTP: Musical, Social, Math/Logic. The lowest was language. Something's off here???Got the same results as you, only Social and Math switched around. I'm doing a degree in animation :)What do you think about other MBTI statistics then? Do you think they observed every person for a week to deduce their fuctions??? No, they made them take probably the official MBTI test which is just as unreliable as 16personalities' test. The data in this thread is no more inaccurate than other MBTI data. You can take the official MBTI test online and see for yourself that it is no different to 16personalities' one.

All MBTI survey data ever, #Junkdata and "unreliable." By your logic at least.Fair enough. But what "strange things" am I implying exactly?I must be the exception.What?Thom Yorke, INFJ?Can't help you out there, but for a good example of an ISTJ comedian look no further than Jon Richardson.Everything about school is great, apart from being graded.HahahahaISFPSPs

edit: to elaborate, I read a theory somewhere that faulty use of their 7th or 8th function is what makes each type laugh. This video is an example of really haywire Ne, which is the 7th or 8th function of SPs.I think they are, just very vaguely. Anything can make any type laugh, but I suppose each type has that thing that makes them laugh harder than anything else.I reckon that the types are rarely offended when someone questions their 1st or 2nd function, but can become angry when it's their 3rd or 4th function that's questioned/dismissed. This theory is usually consistent when I apply it to real life examples.Maybe I should have added, SPs show a _tendency_ towards this sort of humourWhat if someone tells you you're being irrational? Or maybe it's a distinction between healthy and unhealthy types1. slapstick humour,  
2. distinct lack of values (in a character, can't think of an example) Edit: [Maybe this is a good example](https://youtu.be/et5EBZvEhlI?t=5m00s)I think you might be right. Personally I get offended when someone says I'm selfish or unkind.Your accent is fantastic! I watched all of it, there is no doubt that you're on the Fi/Te axis, and I see more Te than Fi. You say you smoke and drink when you are stressed out, this points towards inferior Se. INTJ.It's also never been proven that it's not related.ayyYeah! Literally everybody is half sensing, half intuitive - only they prefer one over the other.Well then, I think you should reconsider your subscription to this community. Everything in MBTI is completely theoretical. 0 evidence.Is this another UK adaption?∞I was just wondering. Hadn't heard of a US version before now.O dear, I got Authority, Shyness and Aggression

&gt;One part of your character is anger in all its forms

edit: no one else got authority? it linked me to an article about the joys of BDSM or something hahahaYou're needy for warmth and understanding, but not for help with living your life?Doesn't answer the questionI don't find it interesting, sorry. But I respect that you find it interesting.As much as the worth of OP's contribution.It's sooooo boooringOn the test that made you identify as ISTJ, both Ni and Se were higher than Si and Ne respectively. Think about it.Your reason for typing Morpheus as ESFJ over ENFJ is invalidROAD ETERNALxxFP, more info pleaseConfusing. I don't know what you've mixed up where, so I'll just say a bunch of stuff at you.


In socionics, only the Ps and Js for introverts are flipped. So INFj in socionics would be INFP in mbti, and likewise ENFj would be ENFJ in mbti.


The dual for ISTP is ENFJ (also known as ENFj in socionics). ENFPs are theoretically (_theoretically_) the worst match for ISTPs.


let me know if this clears things up?And shallow? (high level)A main characteristic of Python is that it's a very high level language, just thought that could equate to shallowness.They aren'tI sound like the INFJ in this instanceHow old are you?_all_ the timeIs this a joke?

1. My inner world....I guess my inner world can be described as a well-organized junk yard:  I keep filling it with stuff I may need someday.  I'm definitely a "head in the clouds" type.  I love thinking about things.  I am a collector of information, and I like to stew that information around and see where it leads.  Unfortunately, practical things are on the back-burner so I end up procrastinating and sometimes I forget to brush my teeth before I leave the house (don't worry, I have a spare in the car).  I guess that's the overview; I like to think about things n stuff.




2.  A new experience, new idea, and figuring something out are the things that excite me the most.  


The new experience could be as exciting as a trip to Europe, or as mundane as trying a new flavor of ice cream.  

I usually get new ideas by talking to people.  I don't ever really pull them out of thin air, but I can take something someone said and run with it.  For example, one of my friends is a conspiracy theorist and he thinks that the ultra-rich are going to colonize the atmosphere of Venus and leave the rest of us here to deal with the fallout of whatever impending disaster (which I think is total crap, that's, like, 99% not going to happen, I think).  But, it made me wonder what the ultra-rich *are* actually doing (I'll give you my thoughts on that another time).  

Figuring something out is my crack.  It's the drug that keeps me going, constantly chasing the dragon.  Puzzles are good, I like solving puzzles, but they don't really scratch the itch of really understanding some kind of intellectual concept.  For example, I'm in college (for the fourth time, I already have 2 degrees and a certificate) and I'm taking a typography class (the study of fonts) and we're learning about the history and classification of different fonts.  We did an assignment where we had to learn/practice how to identify all the different font types.  It was tedious at first, but once I got it, I was chasing that high of having a concept "click" in my brain and getting all the answers right (even though I didn't get them all right, I still have work to do).

So, that's my brain; analyze as you will.Neither.  You are an ESTJ.  I was willing to consider ENTJ until the last paragraph, those thoughts scream ESTJ.I agree with you.  

Side note: I just read [this comparison](http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hicks-carlin.png) of Bill Hicks (ENTP) and George Carlin (ENFP)and I think it's really insightful into the minds of comedians. Defensive much? Horhelamanda is actually doing an excellent job typing people;  she asking the right questions to get insight to people's actual motivations instead of relying on behavior like most people who try to type others.  You should take this opportunity and answer the questions honestly.There are a lot of things the utra-rich could be doing to plan for disaster, all of them equally (un)likely.  First, they could be building a self-sustaining compound on an island, this would provide them with security (it's hard to get to an island), but the melting ice caps are probably dissuading them from this option, as the island could be underwater in a matter of decades.  Next, they could be building compounds in the vast northern wildernesses of Canada or Russia.  There's a lot of land there and (in Russia at least) no roads to get to most of it.  There are plenty of natural resources (big game, trees, oil) in these areas, so building a self-sustaining compound would be much more feasible here than on an island.  The problem here is that in the event of a nuclear catastrophe or an outbreak of a highly contagious illness, they would be just as vulnerable as anyone else.  The next logical step would be to go underground and build a something there.  I've read a couple (fiction) books about living underground in an apocalypse scenario, and other than making sure your engineering is perfect so water and air don't run out this seems to be the best bet.  Maybe not, though, because if you're attacked you're basically just a sitting duck with no where to go.  I don't know if the ultra rich have access to any heavy artillery (I'm assuming they do because enough money can get you anything) but if they do, then that would be helpful, but not a complete solution.

There's an overview of what I think for now.  Most of it is taken from stuff I've read, both fiction and non-fiction.

&gt; Do you have plans for the information or is it more of a "you never know what will happen so this might be useful" kind of mentality?

Yes.  Someday I'd like to write a book, and all of this information I've collected will be very helpful in telling a complete story.  Right now I'm really into urban fantasy and sci-fi, but that could change by the time I get around to writing a book, so I try to store away anything that might be useful (so everything).  I don't have the best memory for detail, but I can usually remember enough that google takes care of the rest.  Also, lulls in conversation make me twitchy, so I like to start random topics of conversation to see if the other person will engage or just look at me like I'm a weirdo (it's usually the latter, but I keep trying).  I'm pretty bad at talking to people, unfortunately.  I love to talk, but I, a lot of times, end up getting a blank stare.  I've been told that people don't know that my story has ended, because sometimes I talk with no purpose.  And sometimes my mind jumps ahead and I say something off topic.  For example, my friends were talking about going to see a movie.  Yay, I love movies.  I should get an icee and some popcorn. I love popcorn!  Oh, that's right, I ordered a home popcorn maker and it should be here tomorrow.  "I bought a popcorn maker!"  Blank stares because they are still talking about what movie to see.  But, I digress, I store info for both future use and just because I may need it.&gt; Why would the ultra rich be working together, shouldn't they be competing with one another, at least the ones in the same business?

Yes.  They are each building their own compound for themselves first and then for whomever they deem worthy. They are very secretive and competitive, so they would never work with a potential rival (which includes anyone who isn't them).

&gt; complex characters, a dramatic plot or a complex and coherent world

All of these.  Otherwise, what's the point?Ok.  Sorry about my hasty response, I was on a break from class and wanted to get a response in.

&gt; But isn't it also true that the top benefit from working together, especially if they're not competing in the same business? Doesn't it make sense for Facebook and Google to collaborate when their products aren't competing? Aren't the rich going to socialize with other rich people simply because that's where the business is at? Isn't it somewhat likely they'll then become an "in group" so they help cover each other's asses?

Simply put, but yes this is true.  It's also not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about survival, and the survival instinct doesn't look out for anyone else, it looks out for number one.  People who climb to the top step on a lot of people along the way, usually without any remorse.  So, take away business etiquette and you're left with a ruthless and self-centered person who is only looking out for him/herself.  Altruism will be thrown out the window and only what and who they need to survive will matter.

On to the book.  While I would like to think I'd take the time to develop all three completely and write the perfect novel, I know that's not going to happen.  So, my first priority would be character development, then an exciting plot, followed closely by world building.  I think I would have the most trouble with world building.  That kind of macro view of things would definitely be a challenge.

The most important aspect of a book, for me, is an exciting plot followed closely by well developed characters.  I have a pretty vivid imagination, so I can do a lot of world building in my mind with just a few details.  I couldn't just read a character study with no real purpose, that's why I don't read biographies. I like an exciting adventure story (a little romance thrown in doesn't hurt either, but it's not necessary).

Edit:  Is any of this helping you narrow down my type?  If it helps I think I'm either Se or Ne dominant, and I'm about 60% sure I'm ExTP.  Also, I think my enneagram is 7w8 (so or sx).* ENTP 7w8
* Gryffindor
* Wampus
* Walnut wood with a Phoenix feather core 13" and Unbending flexibility
* Buzzard


I'm OK with all of this.All of this is true. But what should we do about it?When I read about authenticity I automatically think of *The Chappelle Show* "Keeping it Real" sketches.  Watch a couple of those, that's authenticity to the extreme.No. Astrology isn't real. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that astrology has anything to do with anything. MBTI may be questionable to some, but it's still backed up by scientific study.Angry cheerleader says, "Rah rah rawr!"Ok, I'm too lazy to make a meme, but here's a list:

* unkempt mop of hair

* the most badass new phone with a broken screenBut......there's only four.[MBTI for skeptics](http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/02/mbti-for-skeptics/) is a good article that covers a lot the arguments that mbti is pseudoscience.   I don't think mbti is pseudoscience, but it is a loose theory that can be interpreted at will by any individual.  I find it useful and entertaining, but it's not hard and fast science and should not be treated as such.Wow, somebody's angry about being totally wrong. Life must be hard for you.&gt; XNTP: To understand the universe. Total comprehension is impossible from 3rd dimension pov.

I agree.I am confused by this comment.The post about how introverts deal with talkers led me to think about who the talkers might be, and that led to wondering about some stereotypes in general.  So, here's what I've noticed.  Please let me know if you disagree, and feel free to add your own observations.

* The talkiest talkers seem to be Te or Fe dominant.    

 * I've had people who I now recognize as ESxJs just chew my ear off non stop.  They don't care if I'm interested, sometimes they don't even care if I'm listening.  These types usually talk about what is interesting to them, so their own life and the people in it, they don't really explore anything outside their comfort zone.  So, they talk about work, family, vacations, maybe they'll reminisce about something, or all of the above.  (I write this with love.  I need these people to fill the space when I have nothing to say)

 * ENxJs, on the other hand, will chew your ear off with a purpose.  Whatever their cause is, they will tell you about.  And even when you state for the 50th time that you agree with them and really appreciate all their valuable insight, they'll continue to try to convince you of what you already agree with.  (It's the same if you disagree, just more annoying and relentless)

 * On another note, ENxJs seem to be the "strongest" personalities.  They seem to carry an energy with them that gets them noticed.  The one's that I know, even the ENTJs, wear their mood on their sleeve and are able to manipulate the atmosphere of an entire situation.  If they're pissed, the room quivers with fear.  If they're excited, everyone else can feel it to and they also get excited.  I don't know why, or if this is accurate for all ENxJs, but that's just my experience.

* The least introverted introverts seem to be Te or Fe aux.

 * I don't ever really get a standoffish or shy vibe from ISxJs.  They're usually quieter, but willing to engage in conversation.  I don't know any INxJs, so hopefully someone else can fill in that ______.

* Se is the most active function.  Se doms and auxs are always on the move, always doing something.

 * They are always moving, always doing something.  Sometimes I can't tell xSTPs apart because they can both be serious and always busy, and ESTPs aren't super talky unless there's a reason (or alcohol involved, but I think that goes for everyone).  ESFPs are also always busy, but usually a bit more talkative (or maybe they just like people more) than ESTPs.

* Ne and Se seem to be the middle ground for talkative-ness.  Both Se and Ne doms can be very talkative, but can also be quiet and sit back and observe.  

* But, Ne and Se auxs seem to be the quietest of introverts.  They're not necessarily the most "introverted introverts" but less inclined to speak without a specific purpose.

 * I think Ti and Fi figure things out on their own and need less input from the outside world, so those that lead with those functions don't really feel the need to discuss things.  Also, small talk seems to be excruciating for these types.  I can tell if someone is IxxP when I say something like "Nice weather we've been having," and they grunt in response and walk to the other side of the room.  And, there is a difference between a non-IxxP doing this rudely, and an IxxP doing this just because that's who they are, and it's not subtle.  You can (hopefully) tell the difference between rudeness and a preference to be left the fuck alone.

***

That's all for now.  Like I said, feel free to correct me and to add your own observations.

Edited for formatting/readability.

Ohh, mind telling me why?

And do you think I sound/seem more like an INTP or ENTP?

Thanks regardless. :)ISFJs in my opinion. I just love 'em.Nice type you got there. ;)Yeah, sounds pretty Si to me, or at least Ne+Si. You percieved something that reminded you of something that you have percieved in the past.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've read and learnt so far Si is mostly about comparing things to past data. Say you attempt to pull a door and it doesn't open. You think it's locked and ask for help, and someone points out to you that you simply have to push the door instead. Next time you try to pull a door open and it doesn't work, Si compares this data with that previous similar experience and will think "oh maybe it will open if I push it instead, like that other time".xNTJ: world domination

Though I'm unsure whether it'd be a struggle. Something tells me the fuckers will actually succeed.But that's the same thing as saying that if you throw a fish in a lake it will start swimming as a side effect of being in the water. One is of course a logical result of the other thing, but if it happens every time then wouldn't it make more sense to call it a direct Si action? Or well, Si+Ne since Si can't function on its own.You just want to cuddle them and love them forever.

Unfortunately my SO is an INFJ, but I guess I'll just beat the Si in him. &gt;:DIf there were more Intuitives than Sensors I don't think shit would ever get done haha.Summer is my favourite, followed up by autumn/winter, and waaay in the back is spring.

I'm most likely an ENTP if that helps.Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up for me then. :p

While we're already on about it, what would you say are the differences between Si+Ti and Si+Te?Honestly you can make me really happy by calling me kind or caring and meaning it. I never really saw those qualities in me, I just assumed I was struggling to do what everyone else is supposed to do when someone needs help or is feeling down, etc etc. But I've been told by a few people that they've never seen someone as caring as me, and even though the first thing I think is "wow you must not know a lot of nice people then if *I'm* the most caring", it does make me happy to know that I'm apparently doing that right.That's a scary thought, *shivers*

Good thing that's not actually the case........right?Sounds like a good plan, guess I should start recruiting some more ISFJs in my friendgroup.

Ahh now I want to see which Pokemon the other types would be. Eevee for the INFPs hm?Aw I'm sure there's a sweet Feeler out there who finds your quirky inferior Fi adorable. :)That's okay though, I mean you were asked. :pThat's kind of too little information to type off. I'm sure the other people here are generally better at typing than I am but if I had to guess I'd say ESTJ.Ah okay, thanks for telling me what you think. :):'(Perhaps a result of there being less Intuitives than Sensors on this world. Some people think rare = better and mistype themselves N because of all the interesting and romanticised stuff about themselves, and then go off writing things about themselves? And if they then look at each others' romanticised N posts, it'll only confirm for them that they're an N and not an S? I mean sure there are plenty of N types that are actually N, but it's just statistically more likely to be an S.

Or maybe that's all wrong and I'm still half asleep. :pHow sure can we be about that. &gt;.&gt;

Maybe you're secretly an ISTP. &lt;.&lt;Ah yeah I know, I was just trying to be funny aha.

But yeah you're right. :pBut... That's exactly what they did.

The title of this post is "Which type has the most POTENTIAL for evilness?"1: Hmm well I usually see or hear something and then start thinking about that or something related to it, having a whole conversation to myself in my mind. Right now, this question made me think about what I'm thinking about which reminded me of the time that I tried to stop thinking about Spongebob saying "the Hash Slinging Slasher" about twenty times in my head, so now I'm thinking about that again which is always wonderful.

Sometimes I'm also not thinking about anything which is basically just me daydreaming and staring out of a window or whatnot. I usually do that when I get really tired, usually it's just thinking about anything that comes to mind, trying not to think about things I don't want to think about, worrying if someone around me can actually read minds, laughing quietly to myself when I think back to something funny that happened.

I think back to things I've said, things someone else said, made-up conversations that never even happened and probably won't anyway, recognising the person that just waved at me a little too late because I was having a conversation with myself about what the best moveset for a Pokemon would be. There's also usually a song playing somewhere in my head. Right now it's this one. https://youtu.be/BpF3IV51MPg

2: In one word? Summer. It doesn't really have to do with the season itself but the way I imagine summer is just being all happy and excited with my friends, and just the idea of spending time with them while in that mood is amazing. That's why it's also my favourite season. :p

Another thing that always gets me really excited is when I think of cool things that I can do for my friends. I love randomly surprising someone with a some cool drawing I made, a self-made shirt with the name of their favourite band on it, or even just giving them a random small present like a chocolate bar they like or a something that has to do with their favourite movie or so. I just like showing them that I care about them, and I love it when I see them getting all excited and happy about it.

Or just thinking about things that I can do. Now that I said the thing about making a video, I really want to start a Youtube channel with a friend that just features us being silly, or making an actual cool short movie where we all get together and make something really neat. Or just dressing up as zombies and walking through a random town and doing nothing else. Ahh now I got myself all excited again. :')

Edit: whoops I never actually said anything about making a video in this post. I mean I did but I cut it out and I thought I re-added it somewhere but I didn't. Oh well.Deja vu is really just your brain lagging, I doubt it has anything to do with the functions.I think Fi and Ti are the most introspective functions, so I'd say if either of those is your dom/aux you should in theory have a tendency to daydream.Yours are all pretty close which is interesting. What would you say your type is?

I got this by the way:

36% ENTP, 33% ENFP, 10% INTP, 7% ENTJ, 6% ESTP

Basically ENTP all the "variations" of it.Ah I see. Tell you what though, ENTPs are usually known as the most introverted extroverts, it's probably the biggest factor as for why a lot of ENTPs think they are INTPs instead because they don't seem to fit the picture of a typical extrovert.

I've heard from people around here that this test is generally pretty accurate, and if you think you fit the description of an ENTP, I guess you got the right one there then. :p1: Sounds like inferior Si to me. The person *has* to relieve some stress that they feel inside their own body.

2: Se, somewhere. Probably a bit on the lower side.

3: Has nothing to do with functions. You can't just snap your fingers and cry on command.

4: Again, has little to nothing to do with functions. It's a natural human reaction since crying relieves stress.

5: Depends on why. Does the person do it without knowing, or because they think the other person might not have gotten all the details? If it's the latter one, that sounds like Fe&gt;Si to me.

6: Dominant Fe.

7: As a random thought that's one of many, or as an actual goal that the person has thought about so many times? If the former, Ne&gt;Ti. If the latter, high Te and/or high Ni.

8: Sounds about the same as 2 to me, so probably low Se again. Possibly aux Se in a younger person.

9: Happens to me too but I'm not sure if it's a function thing. But if I were to guess based on my own experience, high Ne.

10: No idea, sounds like something that can happen to anyone, regardless of the functions.

11: Dominant Ti most likely.

12: Si somewhere, as well as high Fi or high Ti, which depends on what the person analyses. If they analyse the memory through internal logic ("how does it all make sense to me?"), it's Ti. If through internal feelings and emotions ("how does that make me feel?"), it's Fi. (Also excuse me for my very generalised perception on Fi here, trust me I know there's more to it).

13: Are they aware of their hunger but choose to ignore it? Probably higher Si. If they aren't aware of it, low Si.

14: Kinda just depends on what you enjoy. It sounds like a high Feeling thing but I do that too, and my Feeling function is tertiary.

15: Nitpicking is a stereotypical Ti thing, could be Fi too though. (Read 12).

I hope that helps. :)r/INFP apparently also happens to be the capital city of the Feelers.Funny thing, my SO is actually an INFJ who mistyped as INFP at first. It does happen but it's way more common the other way round. I find it easy to tell the two apart though.Yep. Probably my most used sentences are "I didn't lose it, I just don't know where it is right now" and "I haven't lost it, I know it's somewhere in this house".Haha I got 11.

Guess I gotta up my sociopathy game to fit in with the rest of my fam.Don't think you'd be much higher than the other SFJ haha.Are you okay?I don't typically do morally bad things and so the only thing I can think of was when I stole someone's pencil case when I was like 9 because she had pretty pencils. I felt bad and cried and gave it back later.If it is for all types, then why call it xNTx?I'm honestly not sure. I got 11 which is more than 8 points lower than my type's average ahaha. I'm sorta glad to see that not a single type scored higher than 20 on average though.Jupiter man, it's the king of the Gods/planets. I think that's kinda rad. And also because it's my astrological planet, which is cool even if you don't believe in astrology imo.TINY BLOB PLANET. ;w;Ah yeah I feel ya, I feel the same about it. The test that was linked to in the survey does have a lot of questions that Thinkers in general will probably answer the "wrong" way, but I'm surprised to see that it's the Ti&gt;Fe'ers that have the highest averages. I thought it would have been the Te&gt;Fi folk that would thrive at the top.True, I guess I feel more attuned to my Fe than the average ExTP, perks of having an ESFJ mother haha.

I find it a little hard to see Fe folk in general to have sociopathic tendencies. It seems like they'd do everything with the greater good in (sometimes the back of their) mind.

Edit: Whoops I thought this was a reaction to my original comment, excuse the weird phrasing. :pHm that makes sense yeah. Now that I think about it, it does make a lot more sense to see the ExTPs at the top.

So why would you think the IxTPs aren't the ones that popped up as the most sociopathic? Maybe because they're in their head more because of dominant Ti? Or perhaps because of their inferior Fe having more of that desire to be accepted by society? Either way it's an interesting thing to think about.What are the kind of things you'd test out then? Because right now I'm imagining every other ENTP testing to see how many stabs to the chest it would take for someone to die. :p

That actually reminds me of how I was younger I wanted to see if ants could swim, and so I went and dragged those poor fellas into a bucket of water. They did survive I think, so that's all good.&gt; I disregard both the status quo and the social order. I'm intendedly disruptive, just because I find the rules suffocating.

This is something I unfortunately can't get behind. For someone to go out of their way to spit in the face of social order or the status quo you mentioned. I mean I'm fine with breaking a rule here and there if I feel it would help me get to my goal more efficiently or better, but to do it just because is something I wouldn't do. Rules are what keep the world from becoming a giant chaotic clusterfuck.

Unless that's not what you meant at all and I'm going off on the wrong idea here but I'm sure you'd tell me.

Also nice quote there.Ah yeah, my main interest lies in other people too. I think humans are the most interesting thing out there, and so I spend a lot of time trying to get behind their motivation as well as my own. I poke and pry too, but I tend to be careful with it as I'm pretty insecure and self-conscious.

Outer space and the deep seas are also really interesting in my opinion, so I can understand why you'd be curious about them. I think it's mainly the idea of a whole undiscovered world being down and up there that piques my interest.

And also have you ever thought how great of a murder weapon an icicle would be? It literally melts away so no finger prints. :pOh definitely, but I'd say that's the case for anyone. I think it's ISxJ's who stereotypically are said to always follow all the rules? I'm sure that if you'd throw some bullshittery in there even they would find them suffocating.I use it to get a general understand of the people I care about. Or to get some pretty solid insight on people that I don't really know yet. I know that you can't just throw every single detail about a person under the lampshade of these four letters since that's not how people work, but it does give you a good idea of how a person thinks. I keep that in mind when I spend time with them, to try and not just parade all over the values of an Fi dom, or to understand that the idea of the importance of harmony and morals might get completely past a Ti dom.

I also use it to try and improve myself. To make sure I'm working towards becoming the best me that I can.Ah but Feeling is just as important as Thinking. I imagine emotional intelligence comes more naturally to you than it does to Thinkers, which is something I find wonderful. And you can also think rationally and still be a Feeler. Besides, ESFPs are always fun to be around in my opinion. You people always seem so energetic. :p&gt; I go out of your ways, not mine ! And I don't spit. It would make me end up in prison.

Ah but just say that you're llama-kin and that this is your way of truly being yourself, I'm sure everyone will understand.

&gt; I guess I'm one of those who just want to see it burn

I definitely think it'd be interesting to see, makes it so that my imagination is a fucked up place sometimes haha. As long as I keep it in my mind it's all good though.

&gt; An ENTP, talking about sociopathy and not quoting Heath Ledger's Joker ? It would have been a crime against popculture not to make any reference along those lines. =D

True true, I was wondering when the first one would pop up, and it seems like you win that race. :p&gt; INFJs are even darker I think. E.g. Osama bin Laden and Hitler.

Ah but the question is whether they count as sociopaths or not. It surely was fucked up what they did but especially Hitler did it with the greater good in mind for his country. I mean surely there are better ways to get your country to be a better place that doesn't involve murdering millions of people but hey, we can't have it all.&gt; What upsets me is this "emotional intelligence" has hardly ever favored me.

Oh what do you mean exactly? If you don't mind sharing, of course. I'm just curious is all.Yeah definitely, and I think those might be the scariest ones, because they whole-heartedly believe that what they are doing is right and anyone who opposes that is wrong.Ohh I didn't know about those subs yet. I'll give them a try later. :)&gt; Just being fucked up is enough most of the times, imo.

Ah but you're made that way, not born. Unless we're talking about certain mental disorders and whatnot but let's not get into that. :p I'm sure a fucked up childhood helps a lot in creating a serial killer.I personally don't think Ts and Fs are supposed to stay apart, most of my friends are Fs in fact and we get along great. :p

You just haven't found the right Thinker yet. ;)We should all just start using the ESTP flair, see how long it takes for people to pick us fakers out from the real ones.&gt; I'm born different from other. It's not particularly difficult to suppose it's an evil nature. Not difficult to most people, anyway.

Oh if you don't mind explaining it, how is that?I see, I figured it was going that way.

Why do you think it's evil? I'm curious because I know another guy who is autistic and who had a somewhat similar view on it.Huh no, I didn't. You already were at the bottom of the thread but I like to read every post.

http://imgur.com/MG9GYLuI don't know you in real life (at least I'm fairly sure I don't &gt;.&gt;) but that does pique my interest because it's almost exactly the same thing the person I mentioned above used to say. Do you think you know why they think you're evil?

Sorry I'm asking so many questions by the way, I'm just curious. :p I'll stop if you want me to.The first thing I want to tell you is that just because you share a type with someone, does not make you that person. You are your own person with your own thoughts and feelings, actions and reactions, and no one here thinks of you any less if you would happen to share your type with a bad person. They aren't you after all, only you are.

I'm not an expert on typing people (or on Hitler for that matter), but I've seen Hitler being typed as an INFJ for the most part. In fact, I can't think of any specific type I've seen him described as other than INFJ. For that reason I'm inclined to think he is one. If you think he was another type I'd love to hear your reasoning, I'm all open for another perspective on it.

&gt; Is Ni Fe really about treating other human beings as the "lower" level race?

The thing I focused the most on was how he did the things he did in the best interest of Germany. I'm sure that if it wasn't for the antisemitism and the mass murdering, he would've been a great leader. He fought in the first world war and I think that's where his idealised view on Germany came from, I mean he wasn't even German to begin with. They lost that was and they lost horribly, they got humiliated and thrown into poverty by all the money they had to pay to France and alike. I think that's where Hitler's idealised perception of Germany sprouted, he wanted to bring the country back on even level with the rest of the world, and even higher than that. He fixed the economy and provided thousands of jobs for the Germans by building highways and whatnot. That was all in Germany's best interest, and I think it was that Fe at work there.

Sure, Hitler did some really horrible things, extremely fucked up, but I doubt he did it just for the sake of doing horrible things.

&gt; Wonder if some PR prodigy/other type diverted attraction from themselves and used INFJs as escape goats. Maybe hitler was a puppet by something/someone more powerful...

It's always a possibility, but rather out of the realm of reality right now. But humour me, what is your theory on it?Maybe it's the things you said about Fe folks that bothers people. Still not really a reason to down vote though, I'd at least ask you to explain your views on it. So that's what I'm gonna do, what makes you think Fe users are manipulative/not genuine?&gt; You can keep asking. People curious like you are rare. I would be a real idiot to brush you off, especially considering I do want to talk about that.

Ah good, good. Just give me a shout though when I'm crossing any lines.

&gt; I can't keep friends, because I'm not wired to take care of the relationship (and the actual person, for that matter). The few friends who remained by my side know I'm blunt and harsh, and that I can remain months and even years not giving news, because it's just how I am.

I'm glad to hear your friends don't mind you fading away for longer periods of time, I think it's especially the dom/aux Fe folk (not all of course, but for the most part) that thinks that a friendship is only a friendship if you talk to someone x amount of times in a week. It's nice to sometimes talk and catch up, but I don't think most of them understand that alone time can be great and sometimes even necessary from time to time.

&gt; I'm incompetent in tasks that are obvious to most people. It always puzzle them, it angers most, and disgusts the rest. I'm even angry and disgusted of myself about that. I feel alien to the rest of mankind.

This really angers me to be honest. I mean there is impatience, and then there's being a right dick, and it sounds to me that most people you met are being the latter. Instead of looking down on others for not getting something/being able to do something, we could also offer to help, or to explain. I get a little impatient myself occasionally, sure, that's just part of me. But when others need help, we as decent human beings should provide it. I'm sorry that you've encountered people that get angry or even disgusted at you for that.

&gt; I think I belong to a very ancient and forgotten form of humanity. The kind nobody wants to be reminded of.

It always breaks my heart a little when people feel like nobody cares/wants to know about their existence. I don't think I have to remind you (but I'm gonna do it anyway, fite me) that people do care about you. They might get a little impatient, or don't fully understand, but you're not insignificant or just a bother, even if feel that's the case sometimes. It might be nothing coming from a stranger on the internet, but I just want you to keep remembering that.He is? Man I learn something new every day.Ah yeah I get ya, I was only trying to show them that Feeling isn't inferior or anything like that to Thinking. I might have used some wrong information but the core of the message is still being conveyed. And I do think there is at least some correlation in the Feeling functions and, well, *feeling*.&gt; I ask a lot of commitment, and give a really few.

What do you mean exactly?

&gt; They think they know what's all about. It's about laziness to them. No one listens.

I think this is definitely a problem with (how much I hate to use the word in this context) society, we all want to be understood but forget to try to understand others. Maybe we're taught to not show our curiosity for others from the moment we take our first breath, because it almost seems like we're all too scared to ask questions, maybe because we're afraid to be laughed at or something alike. Regardless I think we should all learn to maybe not listen more, but listen better.

&gt; I can't forget all the times people told me they preferred I wasn't by their side.

Were they mad at you or something? Because I simply can't get behind that. I mean I sometimes don't want to be bothered by people either but that right there sounds so negative. But I suppose people that don't want you around aren't worth your time anyway. I'm sure there are tons of people who do want you around and appreciate you once they meet you, you just gotta keep looking for them and enjoy the ones you already found. :)I fit like 80% of that starterpack. Maybe I'm actually an INFJ.I think your issue is more a lack of being a good judge of character and less a lack of T-ness. How exactly did you get taken advantage of? Maybe I can provide some insight.Hahaha not even the bright hair and converses? That's totally my style yo.Ah yeah I've got people like that in my life too. I just stopped expecting things in return and just doing people favours because I want to do them a favour. If you want something back in a situation like that maybe you can vaguely suggest it? Like say you walked someone's dog for them, you can say something like "next time it's your turn to walk my dog" in a laughing/light-hearted way. It at least tells the person that you wouldn't mind something in return.

As for backstabbing, it sounds a little as if you got some toxic people in your life. What did they do to betray you?

And there's nothing wrong with being a little assertive from time to time, as long as you remember to enjoy the people around you too. :pSorry for the late reply fam.

&gt; I'm not committed enough in my relationships. I try to preserve my mental energy for my projects, and be with people, even if I know them is really draining to me.

But what do you mean with that you ask a lot of commitment? Like more so than most people or?

&gt; Why ?

Because it sounds as if I'm putting myself above society. We're all part of society so no need for me to exclude myself from it in my words.

&gt; That's the kind of meaningless pseudo empowering discourse I hear/read all day long.

Aha sorry man, you seemed down so I wanted to cheer you up. Still working on getting better at it.

&gt; You can't learn that

I don't think that's completely true, especially for curiosity. It's a personality trait and you aren't born with traits. Sure some people might naturally have a bigger tendency to be more curious than others (cognitive functions in MBTI perhaps, I can see it for the Se and Ne doms), but it's also something that you can change in yourself. People aren't static, we change by the minute.

&gt; I know I missed something. But I'll never be able to get it. It doesn't matter anymore.

Sucks, I got a few of those too. I just wished I had asked what I did wrong so I could avoid it in the future, but hey perhaps it was their fault and not mine. We'll never know.Ah well, I think almost anything can work on anyone as long as you feel it, you know? That said there are some things that shouldn't ever happen (like people over 40 in hot neon pink shorts and low-cut animal print tank tops *shivers*)

Also come on man why not try some bright coloured hair, we can make you look like the Joker. ;pHahahaha maybe I am. Where is my bag of rainbows and puppies and rainbow puppies?Hogwarts houses.INTP and ENTP.

Been trying to figure out which one I am since forever, though I'm inclined to lean towards ENTP now.&gt; Is possible to be ISTP but just also be good at and enjoy mastering people/conquering my immediate environment (i.e. E stuff)?

Pretty sure that that's Fe at work there, and I'd guess it's not inf Fe.

Then again I'm stuck with the I vs E dilemma myself ahaha, sometimes I also feel like I use Ti waaay more than Ne but then I also remind myself how I'm pretty sure my Fe is not inferior.ENTP, I get Ravenclaw about 70% of the time, the other 28% it's Gryffindor and 1% for both Hufflepuff and Slytherin.

Oh yeah the actual test on Pottermore gave me Gryffindor by the way. As well as Thunderbird for the Ilvermorny houses.I like /r/INFP the most for some reason. Gotta love those Feelers.Over at /r/ENTPOh we're coming alright. ;)Oh I got that too, I think I'm driving everyone nuts with my "y'all", "fam" and "fella".

But yeah I don't really like /r/ENTP tbh, it all seems so cliquey when you look at it for longer than a minute.I've never met an INTJ (or at least I don't think I have), but y'all seem cool.You know one of them IRL? Lucky, all I get are xNFPs and xxFJs hahaha. I'm not complaining though.No kidding, I've only met one other xNTx that I'm sure of their type and that was an ENTJ.Damn your handwriting is pretty.Just add me

.

.

.

.

I'm lonelyNTs cling together huh.

Oh well, I got my INFJ boyfriend aha. But having an INTP or INTJ friend seems pretty cool. I mean of course not everyone that shares a type also shares a personality and whatnot but it does overlap which is cool.Hahaha I got all the xNFPs flocking my way. They make great friends though.Ah but by the power of the internet I shall find my very own INTP sooner than you can say it.My initial thought is INTP (disclaimer I might also very well be wrong I haven't been into this shit for very long)

&gt; Most often when a feeling pops up in this or that situation, I’ll think, that’s batshit, and no else needs to suffer knowing about it. As for communicating emotions, it’s a rarity for me. I may mention an event that’s caused me emotional distress, but it’s really infrequent that I would share the degree of the distress.

Ti &gt; Fe

&gt; I’m likely to represent caring about others feeling welcome and included symbolically. For example, when I have friends over, I might forget to say “welcome” or “thank you”, but I’ll make them feel relaxed by telling them to get their own beverage in a playfully bossy way.

Also sounds like either tert or inf Fe to me, aided by an iNtuition function perhaps?

&gt; My mom told me I was hard to punish when I misbehaved because I never got upset about toys and such being taken away. I presume this is because I was usually (and still honestly sometimes am) playing pretend, and could do so with or without toys.

I think any type could like to play pretend, but yeah sounds like an N function at work, though it's a bit too general information to tell which one.

&gt; There are dark corners of my apartment where I keep twelve-year-old notes shared between my then-crush and me. I can’t stand to read them, but I wouldn’t dispose of them either.

I dunno man, I don't think this one has a lot to do with functions.

&gt; I quip without inflection and then have to explain myself. Several years ago my boss told me she was doing some spring cleaning while listening to Eminem. I asked, “Oh, were you cleaning out your closet?” (If you don’t know, which my boss didn’t, “Cleaning out my Closet” was an Eminem song.) When my boss missed the reference (to which I thought, how do you miss that?—it was a pretty popular song by an artist she just implied she liked), I thought, “Great, it sounded like I was asking my boss which part of her house she was cleaning. How creepy.” Then I explained myself.

Ne for making the reference, Ti for logically dissecting your boss' reaction.

&gt; I definitely would not say I live by any kind of logic. Though I can think impersonally enough, my goal is not usually to be efficient or logically consistent; it’s to connect with people. Or to play Pokemon.

Inferior Fe showing your desire to be able to connect with people.

&gt; I don’t really get tired of spending time with people with whom I can joke and talk about interesting things. I also don’t really love socializing enough to do it if I don’t care what people are talking about.

Could be anything since social introversion =/= cognitive introversion.

But yeah you definitely sound like an INTP.There's a pretty good description of how each funtion works in every type in the sidebar, you should check that out. (I can't give you the link though since I'm on my phone myself)

To clarify where, I'm pretty sure it's the links of the types that have the functions written underneath it.I use it a shitload too though.Judging from your writing alone, probably the INFP.Lmao I can't believe some people actually believe it despite of how it's been disproven so many times.I'm not sure but have you checked out ISFJ? These two lines especially are giving me ISFJ vibes:

&gt; I'm (or at least I like to believe that I am) a very logical person, and if I hold a belief I can't rationally defend, I'll feel really uncomfortable and spend a long time questioning my belief until I eventually change it to something that's logically consistent.

And:

&gt; I dwell on the past a lot. Some nights I'll just spend hours going through old songs/Facebook posts reminiscing about the past (nostalgia trips, basically). I'll try to chase and "re-create" good memories and try to re-live them, but it's never the sameLol tell those kinds of people all about how bridges and education and smoke detectors are all obviously pure evil because they're not natural. :pVery true, although I see it less so at the other subs, with the exception of /r/ENTJ, but that's not very lively anyway.16 personalities has a very generalised and almost horoscopical discription on the types though.

But yeah now that I think about it ISFJ might not be the answer, I was kinda still half asleep when I read this and probably just focussed on those two points, which don't even seem that ISFJ-ish anymore now I think about it. Safe for perhaps the last one. I mean it's still possible, except the probability is back to 1/16th now.

But yeah the information you gave likely isn't enough to determine your type on. Can you think of some other things that less so describe *you* and more so describe *your actions?* We gotta see those functions in action y'know.Aha thing is I'm not really all that good with coming up with good questions that would show the functions. But yeah the points are very general and most of them are really just there to point out your introversion.

Although this one here seems like an S function of any kind guided by Fe:

&gt; I care a lot about people's opinions (although I don't know why) so I pay attention to my appearance more than I'd like to

Okay as for questions I'll give it a try, let's see. Look outside from wherever you are and describe what you see.Actually, the functions describe how you percieve and judge information. That's why the functions are devided in groups of Percieving functions (Ne, Se, Ni, Si) which gather information, and Judging functions (Fe, Te, Fi, Ti) which are how you make decisions.

The functions do have some influence on your personality (like how most xNxPs are prone to be big procrastinators because of Ne &gt; Si), but they don't directly affect personality, nor is personality something you're born with or something that cannot change.

Your type can't change. Your personality, however, can.You perhaps haven't, but there are plenty of people that aren't sure whether they got an I or an E next to their NTP. Granted, most of them are ENTPs thinking that they are too introverted to be an E, but it seems like there are much more xNTPs being confused about their first letter than, say, ENxPs being confused about their third. Or ExTPs about their second.Judging from their name, they're probably part of the NF crew.What about the other half?Got it, that sounds pretty S to me. I'm now left with either ISFJ, ISTJ or ISTP for you. The first two because you showed quite some Si already in the examples I pointed out, and the last one because Se &gt; Fe is also still an option.

What is your biggest desire?Why do you want to be the best at it?Oh haha, yeah the way you phrased it made it sound like you are an XXXX and the ENFP sub made you think you are an ENFP half of the time. Should've read your flair, my bad. :PH-he's like 11 :0Hmm well I definitely think you're on the Ti-Fe side, which rules out ISTJ. Two left!

When you're extremely stressed out, what do you do to make yourself feel better?L from Death Note is a pretty famous textbook example of an INTP (plus, not a minor! Hahaha)Hmm let me ask the reverse question then, what are some things that stress you out?

(Sorry for the 92796 questions by the way, I'm having difficulty seeing the difference between Se and Si (and even Ni and Ne) haha)Way off about all of them huh? And yet you only adress 2/4. :p

Really? When I watch Mark play any kind of puzzle game all I see is Ti&gt;Ne. I'll try and find an example when I'm back home.

As for Pewds, I've seen him typed as an ENTP by various people but I have considered ENFP too, although he seems to have that quirkiness that Ne doms/auxes have, and he just radiates a lot of Ti&gt;Fe (possibly even Fe&gt;Ti but I doubt IxFJ for him) in his videos where he rants about about things.I sadly don't know any of them so I'll take your word for it. :pInteresting, I've seen Vsauce (1) being typed as an ENTP more often. Why do you think he is an INFP?What do you suppose their types are then?Oh yeah him, I've only seen two videos of his but I got some major Fi vibes from him, so perhaps ExFP?I can relate, the only thing I don't use regularly is savage, but everyone's a dude in my book."How daaare you take all of our precious ENFPs away, you will burn!"Is it mine or yours?&gt; Your Movie Sucks: INFP? INTJ? INTP? I'd really like to hear your opinion

Hmm I think INTP. I had to look him up and watched about 10 minutes of one of his videos (The Hungergames' one) and immediately noticed his very monotone voice, which is why I'm inclined to think inferior Fe. Ti is obvious in how he makes his arguments, and Ne for the random sudden (but within the logical bounds of Ti) leaps he makes.Tert Ni doesn't sound too crazy. I think ISTP would be right for him then since I really do see Ti&gt;Fe in him, rather than Fe&gt;Ti. (Then again that was all from a first impression, but hey ISTP is right next to INTP)Yes, and I didn't say otherwise.But people who are narcissistic do have a high self-esteem.

Kinda like how all bears are mammals, but just because something is a mammal doesn't make it a bear.Might as well

ENTP: 11/40

I've had more points on this particular test before though.Perhaps how you don't rely on others? I don't see the direct connection either but I'm sure it relates to it somehow.Sure try me. I might not be much of a regular for people to know me already but I'm definitely still unsure. I've submitted a Type Me post a few days ago so that's something y'all can type me on.Thank you! So it is, at least if your typing is of me is accurate and I do think it is. Though I'm curious now what the typical Ti dom writing style looks like and how it differs with mine, and how you see that I'm Ne dom rather than Fe dom. Basically, tell me more about myself ahaha.Yeah but can you get 'em all? ;)I'm fairly certain the test has a disclaimer that says you shouldn't take it too seriously as it's just a simple A vs B statement test made for mass usage.

Anyway I'd say putting up a narcissistic front as a defense mechanism is very different from actual narcissism, which is an actual personality disorder. Narcissism is literally being overly positive about yourself (a very generalised view of course, but it gets my point across), so I'd say having a high self-confidence *is* one of the things that marks narcissists as narcissists.

And as for your last point, *just* being very self-reliant/self-sufficient doesn't make you a narcissist. Just like how you aren't a sociopath just because you tend to act on impulse, or how you don't have OCD just because you like to put everything in order neatly. The trait is an indicator, not a red flag. Like I said to some other guy on this post, a bear is always a mammal, but just because something is a mammal doesn't mean it's a bear. Bears and mammals do have things in common though.

Edit: whoops, guess that other comment was in this specific thread, sorry man.Yep, that definitely helps, thanks again! :)Oh whoops, I didn't realise you used "esteem" instead of "confidence", my bad.

Yeah, they're two different things, but coming from the same root I believe. Having high self-confidence would also mean that you got a good self-esteem, but you can also have a good self-esteem without having the confidence, I think. But I still think both would be high in someone diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, considering they'd truly believe themselves to be exceptional.Right, the first two things you mentioned sound pretty Si to me, although the third and fourth sound like they're coming from lower Fe (which could mean inferior, and therefore IxTP). The last one sounds like it's coming from somewhat higher Fe though, so with that all in mind I'm back to my original idea that you're most likely an ISFJ.Wow no kidding, you're a tough nut to crack. From first impression by looking through a few of your posts, I think you use Ti &gt; Fe rather than Fi &gt; Te, but I'm not 100% sure.Haha I feel you, I've had the hardest time typing myself too, but now I'm pretty confident. You're welcome, and you have great one too! :)My guess is either INFJ or ISTP. Are either of those close to home?

Edit: possibly even ISFJ, but Ni/Se seems more likely.Haha thanks, you're appreciated back!

I just always get so amazed when I see someone's handwriting and it's not only readable but *also* looks fancy. Mine looks like a whole zoo just ran through some ink and all up on my paper.

Haha and Ne-dawg actually made me chuckle. :)Baby one more timeHaha I'll definitely remember your awesome username now.

I'm not an expert or anything but ISFP seems right for you. The only other thing I could think of is INFP, and if you want my perspective on that one, all you have to do is answer the following question: would you rather have a pet dragon or pet unicorn? (And why?)Neither of those traits make you a narcissist, they're simply two traits people that are diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder very often possess. :PActually after looking into it a bit more, it appears we're both wrong. A lot of psychological articles say that self esteem is unrelated (found both high and low in cases) to narcissism.

https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder

This conflicting quote sorta shows;

&gt; Narcissists tend to have high self-esteem. However, narcissism is not the same thing as self-esteem; people who have high self-esteem are often humble, whereas narcissists rarely are.Ah but the Feeling funtions are more so about values, morals, norms and harmony and less so about emotions and actual feelings. Being unsure of what you're feeling most of the time seems to me like it would come from a lower Sensing function (specifically, Si) because of how it relates to percieving what happens inside your own body and mind. 

Fi vs Fe also plays a role. Higher Fe is more likely to emote their feelings to others, which is probably because of how it would affect the harmony between them and the other person(s). People tend to trust us more when we show ourselves "vulnerable" (it's shown that, for example, people trust others who blush often more than people who don't blush). It might also have to do with the already set tone or mood of the room. High Fe users will likely pick up on that and judge that it will be a good decision to act accordingly.

All that while Fi users are more occupied with staying authentic to their own identity and values. I'm sure there are a lot of high Fi users that like to show lots of emotion, as well as there are lots of them that are stone cold on the outside. Fi looks at the why's of it all, if Pe or Pi percieves a feeling then Fi will look at it and go "does this click with my identity? Does this feeling overrule any of my core values? Is it morally right or wrong to have this feeling?". If Fi thinks it's irrational to feel this feeling, it will probably just toss it into the bin and move on.

What's your thought on that all? It's a bit long and oddly smashed together but maybe it makes sense somehow somewhere.

My best guess is still xxFP at this point, though to get a bit more specific I'll go with INFP because he strikes me as more of an introvert and because of tert Si. But yeah I do agree that high Fi users would be more likely to know what they are feeling because they're after the why's of it. So if we take that in mind, how does IxTJ sound? Tertiary Fi can be pretty appearant.Ah, I'll explain why I think you're one of those types then.

&gt; I absolutely love meeting new people and making friends, but only at certain times. I tend to need to recharge after being with others for a long time. I also really like new beginnings and tend to struggle with endings - in all sorts of situations.

This part suggests social introversion, which isn't same as cognitive introversion, but they do correlate in almost every case. The second part of this part does point more towards xxNP, but it can honestly be seen as a result of any Percieving function wanting new things to percieve.

&gt; I kind of suck at social media, which I have been told many times. I prefer in-person conversations, particularly conversations with depth, and sometimes can go days without replying to people over the phone (...may or may not have many, many unread FB messages). I feel quite bad about how I've treated a good number of my friends/potential SOs but not enough to change that part of me because living in the present is something important to me.

More introversion, but the juicy part is the part where you say "living in the present is something important to me". That indicates Ni/Se which is more concerned about the here and now and the path to the future, while Si/Ne is more concerned about every moment in time; the past, present, and (near) future.

&gt; I have a horrible memory most of the time, and much prefer applying knowledge to solve problems rather than regurgitate information.

This part here tells me that you're not an Ne dominant, which rules out ENxP. Ne doms live to percieve and gather information, whether they can see the direct use of it or not. The applying knowledge to solve problems part again sounds like Ni/Se to me.

&gt; I love travelling, learning about new cultures, and have several ideas about my next trip.

Wanting to learn about new cultures could indicate Fe, but it's a little too vague for me to give any clear answers.

&gt; I enjoy sports, grew up playing soccer and lacrosse. I like rock climbing, hiking, and working out. This also means I'm pretty competitive.

xSTPs stereotypically enjoy sports the most, but yeah, that's just a stereotype.

&gt; I'm pretty empathetic, and enjoy listening to people talk. In a casual 1-on-1 conversation, I try to ensure that both people are talking around the same amount; in a group conversation, I tend to listen a lot more.

High Fe.

&gt; I enjoy logical puzzles, and would consider myself a pretty logical person?

Ti somewhere.

So with all that, I'm positive that you're on the Ni/Se axis and also the Ti/Fe axis. That leaves xNFJ and xSTP. You're an introvert, so that rules out the E types which leaves INFJ and ISTP. Let me ask you a question, what is your biggest desire?Ah your answer is difficult too haha. I thought this question would show the difference between N and S, but I can see both working for you. Either you're an ISFP that likes using their Ni or an INFP that isn't afraid to throw some Si in there. Can you look outside for me and describe it?So, what exactly is it that you're trying to ask?

I mean sure you can get test results that are different from your actual type. 16 Personalities for example gives me INFP and ENFP occasionally, but there's not a single doubt in my mind that I use Ti&gt;Fe.

To just illigalise, as you put it, the easier (but less accurate) route of typing someone seems kinda unnecessary to me. Not everyone wants to spend time on cognitive functions, and that's fine.&gt; I am in my head a lot, like a dominant Ti, but what comes out of me can be random and never dull.

Have you ever considered INTP (Ti&gt;Ne&gt;Si&gt;Fe)? It's the most logical answer if you feel like the lovechild of an ISTP description-wise and an ENTP function-wise. Of course there are ENTPs that act like ISTPs, just as there are ISTPs who seem like ENTPs on the surface (my brother for example). But just from the first impression I'm getting from you, you do seem like a Ti dom.Was that really necessary? There's this neat thread here for typing youtubers that hasn't even been around for 24 hours yet.

https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5572k4/types_of_youtubers/Can't tell if you mean it or not, the period is kind of throwing me off there haha.Ohh okay, in that case I'm glad to see I'm getting better at it. :p

And well in your defence I've been pretty damn active on this sub the last two days hahaha.Haha I didn't have a lot to the last few days but my friends did so I went to Reddit for some social interaction...kinda, I mean does this count as social media? And have fun there man.I for one can't study or do schoolwork at all when I'm at home, the atmosphere is just way too relaxed for me to get into that serious studying mood. So I usually stay in school for an hour longer, sit in the cafeteria and revise a little there.

Also just a tip here, don't study before you go to sleep. By that time you're already tired and your memory absorbs way less information. You've forgotten most of it by the morning again even if you think you know all of it perfectly.I honestly spend my social time like 50% on Reddit and 50% texting/skyping with my boyfriend who sadly lives too fas away for me to just visit him. And I talk a little with people at college *I guess*, lol.The kid in the middle.Ah hey if it works for you then keep doing it haha. But yeah I'm not that great at math myself. Except probability, I rock at that.Haha an ENTP-INTP relationship seems pretty interesting, what's it like? :P&gt; I tried my best to answer this question as I would if I had no idea of what your intentions were in asking it/how you were gonna analyze it, that being said, it's hard to think anything nowadays without immediately following up with, hey, that seemed Si/Ni, or, hey, was that Te? But I tried to not be biased and answer it as it seemed most natural to me.

Yeah I get what you mean. I find myself doing that all the time too. :P But this did tell me a lot (maybe because you told me a lot? Haha) and I think ISFP is correct for you. The dragon/unicorn question (though now that I think about it, it was originally a pegasus) *usually* shows a difference between N and S but doesn't really go that far into the functions. But your answer to this question here showed a lot of Se. Very detailed observations on how everything looks, way more than Ne (or dom/aux Ni for that matter) would show. You show little subjectivity in your observations, which I think Si would do more since it's focussed internally. So yes, I think your flair is correct. :)&gt; "I have to be liked by other people, and I need praise from people in order to feel like I did a good job."

&gt; "it doesn't internally bother me, I'm more worried about what other will think."

Hello inferior Fe. :)

Nah but you seem like an IxTP, definitely. I can get a better/more specific idea if you look outside real quick and describe it.

And also I can relate so much to this:

&gt; I love talking to people I love meeting new people. I act like I'm in love with everyone because I genuinely just like learning so much about people.Not wanting to be alone doesn't mean that you can't be an introvert, especially if we're talking cognitive introversion which is different from social introversion. I might have this fancy E in my flair but I do love my alone time.

To give you another example, my brother is an ISTP but he's always around in the living room, gaming and making conversation (or sometimes just completely ignoring you when he's deep into his games), whereas I spent most of my time upstairs in my room when I was his age.

Your post just gives me a whole lot of indication that your Fe is inferior, which ties in with dominant Ti. I'm fairly certain of that. The only thing I'm not sure about is Se/Ne in you, which is why I'd like you to describe your surroundings real quick. :PEh, it's possible but I do think it's more of an inf Fe thing. The last function in your stack most of the time easily shows where your insecurities lie. Or if we switch it around, your biggest desire, deepest insecurity, or what stresses you out the most are a pretty good indicator of the inferior function, which is why I think it's the best if you look for that first after determining the Judging (and sometimes even the Perceiving) axes. Inferior Xe functions especially are usually pretty easy to spot in my opinion.It didn't rule out Ne/Si types, only Ne dominants. And yeah I've read some other people's view on similar things and I can see how it applies more to Te vs Ti than what I described, but would you mind going into detail a little more? I'm still trying to understand, well, all of it better. :P

And yeah ESTP seems fair enough, I do think xSTP is more likely than INFJ here in general so ESTP wouldn't be too crazy either.Hahah, sounds like both heaven and hell in a way.I've heard that as well. I think that either way the best way you can handle it is by studying while there is still daylight.Oh no I understand that there's a lot more to Se and Ne, but you can usually see a pretty distinct difference between S and N types (especially if their dominant/auxiliary Percieving function is extraverted) in the way they describe their surroundings. I find it a little difficult to explain what exactly makes the difference, since it's not exactly a black and white thing, but you can usually know it when you see it. So that's why I asked.

&gt;  I use Ne more than I would use Ti.

Ohh, can you explain or give some examples?

Regardless you seem pretty confident about your type. If you're not an introvert and use Ne more than Ti, then there would be no question about you being an ENTP right? So what makes you doubt that?Definitely The Road Eternal. At first the idea of living forever didn't really appeal to me that much, but the things that come with it- never having to worry about basic human needs like food and a roof above your head while you explore the world(s) seems amazing. No responsibilities, all there is is you and the world and so many different people from different cultures to learn from. It might get a little lonely, especially since I'd outlive everyone, but that's a price that you'd have to pay for the purest form of freedom.There was one here a day or two ago!
/u/BlondeRJOne of them has it half of the time depending on who you ask (House from, well, House), the other one (Roxy Lalonde from Homestuck) is an ESFP I think. I'm leaving the third one blank because I really don't know lol.Ah okay, glad I made that understandable then. :)

I mean I'm obviously not entirely sure if what I said is completely true, but that's what I've gathered so far haha.&gt; I received no ESTJ responses – presumably because they were off actually living their lives and accomplishing things.

I think this is my favourite part.

Edit: And oh yeah I'd probably want to be either an ESTP or ESFP. Se doms always seem so energetic and present, they're great.Ah you're welcome. I wouldn't rule out ENTP either but yeah I do think INTP fits you the best from this first impression. :PHehe, I gotta say I do love my Fe. Not too present, but just enough to show people I care lol. Fi seems like it could appear too cold for my liking. (If it was tertiary/inferior I mean :P)Ooo, who are they?How about an anti-villain antagonist? Near from Death Note is often typed as an INTJ, I'm not sure about him myself though.Haha INFPs are pretty cool, most of my (good) friends are xNFPs actually. I don't think I'd want that dominant Fi though haha, my identity is so fluid I would drive my own Fi nuts.Yep, :P I think we're only missing an ENTP in the group (unless you think Mello is one, although he seems more like an ESTJ to me?), and arguably an ENTJ if you think Light is more of an INTJ than that.Yeah, I think the same about Light. I guess the biggest reason why he gets typed as an INTJ a lot is because he seems like an introvert?

And whoops I completely forgot about Ryuk (sorry shinigami, I still think you're cool though). It's been a while since I've watched Death Note (the last time was before I knew about MBTI), so I really don't know. There's no doubt about ExTP though.

What do you think Misa and Rem are? I can see ESFP and maybe even (unhealthy) INFJ for Misa, but I'm not too sure about Rem.Haha yeah, I could see INFP for Rem from what I remember.

But I think we can all agree on L's type though.

.

Obvious clear as day ESFJ.I can see both INTJ and ENTP for him and it's been a while since I've watched an episode so I mostly just agree with whatever argument seems more logical. I've also read that he was written by multiple people so he can essentially even be both. And a dating sim character huh, who in their right mind would want to date an ENTP???? Haha.&gt; First sorry if l am replying to this subject past its due date. My Ni was in lalaland. I needed to step back until my irritation subsided.

Ah that's okay, I'm always interested in hearing other people's opinions. :p

&gt; His approach just doesn't seem infj to me.

Yeah I'm not too sure about INFJ either, I tend to leave the typing to the experts. But I can see where you're coming from.

Regardless, I think it's for the best if we stop the discussion now, don't feel all to comfortable about it myself and I get the feeling you don't either. :p*Even stronger?* :OHahaha someone should make a dating sim based on MBTI types, that'd be interesting to see. And then the playable character chooses their type at the beginning and your dialogue options would be based on it. Or maybe the other way round and the way you do your actions determines your type haha.

But yeah that 707 guy is definitely a cutie, I'd love to have a jacket like his.Ohh that'd be so cute! I always find adorable when I see couples cosplaying as fictional couples, that's one thing I'll definitely want to do sometime haha.K from Virtue's Last Reward!Ohh cool. I had to look them up because I'm not too familiar with RWBY, but their designs seem really nice and interesting to cosplay. I've done it before as Meenah and later Roxy from Homestuck, but after Meenah I'm not doing anything with face paint anymore haha. That stuff got all over the place.Ayyy I love competitive, haven't played in a while though. Rotom-w is definitely a good one in pretty much every OU team, though I prefer Milotic and Vaporeon for a Water type. Nice and tanky haha.I don't think this is really enough to type of. What would you say some of your habits are, what stresses you out, how do you see the world? Things like that. Less about the things you like but more about the things you do. :pSo just to continue the Pokemon-type discussion, I think Xatu might be a good fit for INFJs. They can see into the future with one eye and into the past with the other. I think that sounds a little bit like Ni, but I don't think it would fit INTJs more than INFJs.

And I don't exactly know why but Deerling seems perfect for ISFJs somehow.Haha I think most Dark types are pretty rad, and the Zors are probably my favourite out of them. My favourite type is probably Bug though, I think the smaller Bug types like Volbeat and Kricketot are adorable.Interesting, I'd see Eevee more as an INFP Pokemon for some reason. Probably the combination of Fi and Ne that would translate into having so many possible paths to choose from.

Also Entei is pretty neat. A pain to catch though. &gt;.&lt;&gt; I just have such a hard time saying my number one favorite anything.

I can relate to this so much haha.

And ooohh Clefairy, I like that one a lot.&gt; I think asking this question mostly tells you about how old a person is instead of their personality type though.

Oh it probably won't tell anything about someone's type. But I'm always interested in someone's favourite Pokemon haha.

And ayy, I grew up with gen 4 just coming out too. We must be about the same age then. :P My first main game was Pearl, although my first Pokemon game in general was Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness.Ah you're welcome. Those answers are a good starting point. I'm not 100% sure but I think we can rule out the E's and F's (and EF's), which leaves IxTx.

What would you say is your biggest desire?

If you were to look outside right now, how would you describe it?

&gt; I see the world as both all and one. Things are dependent on each other, and without darkness light cannot exist and stuff like that. The world is both beautiful and ruthless.

Could you elaborate on this?Ohh that's pretty interesting. I made a post on tumblr over a year ago once that also tied MBTI to Pokemon types, but that was all from the very limited knowledge I had on it back then.

And I'm 17, a tiny bit younger haha.&gt; Everyone uses all functions.

This still remains up to discussion though. I've seen an equal amount of people say you only use the four functions in your stack. Can you maybe go deeper into this?

And I'm still not really convinced about Fe dom for Mark, what makes you say that?;n;Not a big fan Azumarill haha. I often already have my team stacked with choicers (Scarf Heatran being my favourite; unexpected and it hits hard fast), so having a tank Milotic or Assault Vest Vaporeon gives me a change of pace. Dragons are a little less common now though thanks to Fairies, but now we got the problem of Fairies dominating OU haha. They're probably the best defensive type after Steel, *and* with great offenses.I'm a liberal airhead. Cool.I unfortunately have yet to meet an ENTP in real life, the closests are my ESTP dad and my ENFP friend. I'm not extremely close to the ENFP anymore since we're not in the same school and all anymore, but when I do hang out with her it's a lot of fun and Ne greatness. I don't remember the exact details of how our friendship began but I'm 99% sure that after a few days of knowing each other we just became friends and not much later we suddenly were best friends. That's all the way back to elementary school though, I wish I were a little closer with her again but oh well, we're still good friends. And my dad, well, he's my dad. I go along well with him for the most part, but some Ne Se dissonance is inevitable.

That said, the ENTP sub is too cliquey for my liking, and I often feel that I'm not ENTP enough to fit in. I much prefer to hang out here on the main sub and in some of the feeler subs.If it helps, I think ESFPs are awesome. I know a few of y'all in real life and they're always very energetic, bubbly, and pretty much instantly lift the mood.&gt; I like this general sub the most for the range of perspectives.

This is exactly why I like it too. :)&gt; ENTPs step into shit a lot more than Mark does. Fe dom people seem to be aware of where they're headed 10 steps ahead of time, before tones or sentences end up coming across as cringey. Once they're baseless, then they'll use Ti as a means to get some grounding for whatever they want to say, then usually punctuate it with "Maybe? I don't know" as to segue right back into using Fe as the preferred method of communication.

Ah yeah, that makes sense. I figured that if he was an INTP then he'd be a really cautious one in a way. So what makes you think Fe dom over Pi dom? He's said a number of times that he is an introvert, and Fe doms are often seen as the most extroverted types.

And the other thing you said, I'm still not exactly sure about it all myself, but what you said does make sense haha.Do you mean Haunter? Haha.

Also did you know Haunter's German name is Apollo? I think that's pretty cool, which is why I now always name my Gaslty's Apollo.Can you describe your surroundings for me?

What is your biggest desire?

What stresses you out?Haha I'm sure we can't *all* be that bad.

...right?Hmm I'm kinda getting ISFJ from you, have you thought about that one?&gt; I don't value tradition and get sick when I see people acting too sweet lol.

What do you mean exactly by this?Wikipedia tells me this about the god Apollo:

&gt; Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague.

Perhaps that has something to do with it? The word has no specific meaning in German iirc.Ah I see, makes sense. Thanks. :pOohh Togekiss is great! I love using Flinchkiss with King's Rock haha. And for Scarftran, it's usually so that he outspeeds Ground most unboosted/unscarfed things and if he definitely doesn't, I'll switch him out to something that survives an Earthquake.Hmm ISTJ seems more likely judging from your answers here. The reason why I'm thinking Si dom is because of this:

&gt; My biggest desire... difficult question. I want to be free and happy. I got some goals that I should reach but I am very lazy. Despite being lazy I tend to reach my goals, but it's a huge struggle for me. I feel caged inside an ill society.

It sounds a lot like inferior Ne to me.

And ISxJs aren't necessarily all about routine and tradition, that's more of a stereotype if anything. You can be an ISTJ and hate certain traditions. :pAh I get ya, honestly I get intimidated by them too as well as some INFJs (they can be scary yo), best is to just not let them get to you, there are bad apples for every type.Haha I don't think you can be a good or bad one. Maybe healthy or unhealthy, but if so you should just do your best to get rid of the stress you're having and just lay back and relax a little. And I do think it can, inferior Ne is known to think of all the worst possible outcomes to a situation if used in the wrong way.Yep same here, math isn't my strongest point. I'm just so happy they added the min and max Speed on Showdown if you hover over the opponent's Pokemon, makes it easier to predict and whatnot.Haha I kinda agree with you on that. Unfortunately it's the only way I can play against others since my 'latest" game is White and Nintendo kicked out all the internet using features of everything that isn't gen 6 a few years ago. Rip Dreamworld. :(You're very welcome!Right, I'm getting especially Ni and Ti from your answers, which would put you as ISTP if we rule out the F's and the E's. INTJ also still seems possible.

If you could take this quick little test it would tell me more. :) http://personalitygrowth.com/extraverted-thinking-te-or-introverted-thinking-ti-quiz/Certainly. When I actually still thought I was an INTP it gave me Ne&gt;Ti&gt;Fe&gt;Si, so even then it gave me what I needed. I get ENFP and even INFJ sometimes too but for the most part it's ENTP.Then I'd say ISTP might be the type for you. :DMe: ENTP

Mom: ESFJ

Dad: ESTP

Bro: ISTP

We all got that Fe/Ti going. :)Lots of Fi you got going on over there, how did your INFJ sister stand out from that?&gt; I don't know why other forums says INTJs get along well with ISFPs, but I can say this isn't true at all.

Probably because of the same functions but in different orders. Regardless, that sounds tough. I'm glad you got to move out if she was a negative influence on you.Eh, I'm alright with it except for the Dreamworld part, I loved that shit.Yeah alright, I used it more as a disclaimer if anything. :p

And will do, what are some good ways to "test" Se?Honestly I can't wait until S/M for the meta and all the new features they'll have.&gt; They'll find a dictionary word, explain the definition, and show how a specific scenario matches- but not really notice that the fact that they're using some means of formal logic doesn't make their argument any stronger.

I feel as if this is a specific jab at feminism haha.&gt; They have to have had all the different cognitive functions between them

Problem is, INTP and ESFJ share all their functions.

INTP: Ti&gt;Ne&gt;Si&gt;Fe

ESFJ: Fe&gt;Si&gt;Ne&gt;TiThat's the problem, he definitely does both but I can't seem to figure out which one is more apparent. I guess it could make sense if his Fe and Ti were closer together which would point more towards INFJ, but sometimes he just seems too Ti to be a Feeler. It's like a 50/50 thing, so I guess the best thing I can do is see whether it's Se or Ni that's more apparent in him.Sorry English isn't my first language so I have no idea what that means. I mean I have an *idea* but yeah, could you explain it?Right, yeah agreed. I'm kinda on the middle of it myself because you can see ridiculousness coming from both ends.Ah okay that explains it a bit, thanks. :)Ah yes, thank you for that. I do believe he prefers Ni over Se now that I read your experience with it. He very often says things like "does this make sense" or "I don't think you even understood a word of that", which sounds more like a thing an Ni dom would say rather than an Ti dom.Thanks, that helped a lot! Now that I've read your post and a few others' I do think he is an INFJ rather than an ISTP, and I've considered ISFJ but inferior Ne doesn't seem to fit him at all, so that's why I excluded it.INFP *could* be right, but the reason why I excluded it is because the way he talks and rationally dissects things is much more Ti than Fi. The test on 16 personalities also gave me INFP the first time and I'm starting to believe it just gives everyone that is socially more introverted, feels feelings, and thinks about abstract things sometimes the INFP result. The cognitive functions test on similar minds, however, did give him INFJ which is the main reason why I thought of him as that to begin with.I can completely relate to the p and P aspect of this so for me at least this is correct.Sorry fam, we *do* exist.I don't think that's the case. I'm 99% sure about Ti/Fe for him, and Se/Ni seems to be the case in him too. I'm sorry but there is little to no doubt about this at this point.WAIT I'M IN THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE?I sure do.It's interesting, there's a lot of things I would call fucked up and I just could never do, which goes from big things like murder to smaller things like telling someone else's secrets to someone to very simple things like not giving your seat in public travel to elderly people. But then there are the things where I clash with my ESFJ mom, like how I just quit my job after a week because I didn't enjoy it and it gave too little money for too much of my time and they didn't have my name on anything. My mom kept telling me to finish the month because that's just what you're supposed to do. I said no because I didn't want to. I guess it just really depends on the situation for me.

As for the concept of good and evil, I don't think there are good or evil people, I think there are people that can do good or bad/evil things. And how you take that is up to you.Hm, perhaps there are some more key differences then? The main reason why I hold high morals most of the time is because I don't want to get "kicked out" of the group. I mean not consciously, but that's probably the biggest reason why. Maybe you don't hold that motivation as high as some others do?&gt; So because someone is born in Febuary they are a Pisces or Aquarius?

Well yes, that's exactly how it works. :p

And I guess the reason why people believe in it is because it gives them a sense of security and self-confidence. Astrology isn't harmful, and it's written in such a way that it can be applied to everyone. If you read your horoscope and it says that you'll feel really confident today, chances are you're going to focus on that feeling of confidence. And if you read that you're going to meet a cute guy/girl, you're going to pay extra attention and make sure you seem likeable for every new person you meet. Astrology might be just that little push people need to believe in themselves, so what's so bad about it?Maybe someone ran away and deserted him. :(Yeah I guess in the way of Fi vs Fe, Fi is more proactive while Fe is more reactive.It's not even out of the question that someone told a lie and hurt him. :(Haha that too yeah. Besides it's just too many ENTPs in one place. :pThe key word being "overall". These are averages so they won't have a lot to do with one specific person. It's not a great idea to decide your type based on your test scores or whether you're gifted or not because for one single individual the averages don't matter as much as people make them out to do.I'm mostly getting ENTP from you.I apparently fail at both. Good to know ahaha.Haha as much as I don't want to believe in it, mine fits damn well.I claim all the IxFJs, you're all mine now.Yeah likewise for me, that's when you've apparently failed the tests. For the right brain test it doesn't give you the results if you score under 60%, and the other one I have no idea. Probably about the same.Sorry man, you gotta.Cause you're all so cute and fluffy with your aux Fe. c:I'm mostly getting ISFJ from you, possibly even ESTP. Your preference for sensing over intuiting is clear and I think you know that yourself too haha. You seem to be sure that you're on the Fe/Ti axis and I don't think there's much here that suggests otherwise. I don't think you're an Fe dom, you seem too immersed in perceiving things for you to be any Judging dom. So yeah my best guess is ISFJ and ESTP is not as likely but also possible I think. What are your thoughts on Si vs Se?

Also I thought I was the only one who did this haha:

&gt; I like trying to listen to each individual instrument and hearing their clarityHonestly I think all that MBTI and the functions primarily describe are the way you percieve and judge information, how you behave by using the functions is a secondary process and doesn't really fall under the same lampshade as the primary objective. I guess it's more like a tree that branches out if anything, with at the very start the way you judge and percieve information (the functions), after which it branches out to your thoughts, opinions and perspectives on things, then how you act thanks to the information and your "inner" perspectives, and maybe after that even the way people see you. Place 5 people of a certain type next to each other and you'll see that their personality (as in their whole persona) most likely isn't identical to that of the other 4.I doubt that it's an iNtuitive function considering you made a judgement, rather than just percieving the information. 

But yeah anyone can think that up, no matter the functions in your stack. What would help more is if we knew *why* you thought it.Well it's definitely a combination of them, since you can't just use percieving or just judging, you always use a bit of both since information's gotta come in somehow and it's also affecting you in a way.

But that still tells me nothing. You only expanded on the context of when you thought it, you still didn't give me the why. Why do you think those videos are only popular because people want confirmation on their actions?Interesting. See, I can't really comprehend that since I always know why I think a certain thought or how I got to it. Perhaps that's because of Ne-Ti, or just Ne in general, which makes me believe that you're using a Judging function influenced by Ni there. Something on the Ni/Se axis at least.

And also after watching the video, I disagree. I think the main reason why people watch that video is because of how Sips acts, because his reaction is funny. Sure there will be people who watch it only because it justifies their own behaviour, but I doubt that is the only reason why people watch them.I relate to both cognitive extraversion (Ne dom) and social extraversion, although most people probably wouldn't take me for an extrovert because I'm a little shy in real life. I notice that if I don't interact with people for a while I get really bored and eventually exhausted, to the point where I just lie in my bed and look at the same few unchanging apps on my phone for hours. It doesn't really matter to me whether I'm actually talking to someone in front of me, texting with someone, or just sitting in the same room as other people, I just get my energy from being with others, physically or virtually.Yes. Generally speaking. I can go quite a while without any interaction but that'll eventually drain me to the point where I just gotta *talk*. But that aside, I'm 100% sure that there are ENTPs out there that are extremely extroverted, just as there are ESFPs, who are generally considered to be the most extroverted, that are actually more on the introverted side.&gt; However, MBTI is a personality theory.

That was, essentially, what I was saying. MBTI and the functions can be used to predict and understand personality.

&gt; The Persona is a subset of one's personality.

I don't think you understood what I said there. I used persona for the lack of a better word, but I was referring to your whole being. "Soul", if you will. What makes you you. Personality is more than just traits and behaviour, it extents to your thoughts, opinions, feelings,  emotions, etc etc, as well as how the people around you percieve you. That's what I meant with it. That in its entirery is, at least as I see it, personality.40% Trinitarian / 60% Quaternarian, which leaves me at "casually Quaternarian". After reading both blocks I definitely am more Quaternarian yeah.*melts*&gt; Novelty seeking is a big Ne flag.

I don't think that's necessarily the case. Both Se and Ne seem to be big on the whole novelty thing because extravertedly perceiving the exact same thing over and over is *boring*. The big difference is that while Se quickly seems content with a new experience or sensation, Ne needs a whole new idea, new connections, new possibilities in order to not get bored. Because OP seems to be describing the need for a new experience I'm inclined to lean more towards Se for him.You're famous! :DYou mostly sound like an INFP to me. Fi is pretty clear in your post, and this particular sentence makes me think Ne over Se:

&gt; There are so many things I want to do that I put off or don't start because I'm too busy thinking about them.

ENFP also seem possible, but judging from your writing alone you seem more like an INFP than ENFP.Haha a lot of IxFPs have that melancholic aura hanging around them. It's like you can spot one from miles away because of it.Definitely, my grandma is an ESFJ and she walks on eggshells around everyone. She's very sweet and caring for everyone and wants everyone to be included, so offending someone is a big no-no for her. My mom who is also an ESFJ also does this but more in an "every opinion counts" kind of way. She's the kind of person whose motto would be "there are no dumb questions, and probably no dumb answers either".Oh I caught mostly Se from his post. But you could be right too, I can see now why you think Ne fits him better.Yeah I thought that the example I put there wasn't very conclusive. I thought about getting rid of it, but I ultimately decided against it. :p

&gt; There's a chance I'd feel way too tired for a party after jumping around for a few hours but I might go if enough of my friends go. It depends on my mood though, and there's a good chance I'd just want to go straight home and relax.

The way I see it, this seems more like Fi judging the possibilities that Ne brings up. Fi knows OP the best, which is where the chances come from. They're all about how it will make him feel, not just pure iNtuition in the form of Ni. You could still be right though, it's possible that this is Ni&gt;Fi at work. The main reason why I think Ne for this particular thing (weak argument but throwing it in regardless) is because I do it a lot myself too. I think in chances and probability, I say a "there's a chance that.." and "it's more likely that.." all the time, to myself and others, and I'm pretty sure I'm an Ne dom rather than an Ni dom.

&gt; It depends on the belief.

Sounds more like Fi to me honestly. The context is that someone says something that clashes with OPs beliefs, and what OPs reaction to this is. Fi is very subjective, so of course it's going to depend on the belief. If the person says "dying your hair is stupid" and OP just happens to love dying his hair, I can imagine that OP is going to think "whatever, your opinion". But if it's something like "white people are superior to other races" then of course that's going to bring a different reaction out of OP. And then of course there are even more factors at play like whether OP is good friends with the person, and how long the ride will take, etc. etc.

&gt; If it's someone I'm close to I'm very likely to call them out on it. If it's a stranger saying things I'd get annoyed but not engage with them unless they were really bigoted.

I don't really see what about this exactly points out Ni. I again think this is Fi&gt;Ne looking at the hypothetical situations from different angles, and then judging the right way to react through Fi.

&gt; Starting one of my obsessive binges gives me a lot of mental energy since it gives me plenty to think about and do.

Ne&gt;Si. Si especially here for actually noticing the mental energy he gets, a sensation within his own body. Both Ne and Ni seem very likely to obsess over things and get their energy from it, but Ni tends to keep their interests while Ne quickly jumps to the next interest. Like here:

&gt; I get very attached and obsessive about certain things (TV shows, games, music, other interests) but after a little while it fades and I move on to something else. I was really into Community a few months ago, moved on, and recently rewatched the entire series and reignited my passion for it.

Rewatching an entire series inherently seems like an Ne/Si thing to do, revisiting the original feeling it gave you, reigniting that passion you previously had. Ni can stay interested in a thing for a long time even if you don't give the interest any attention in the external world, but keep thinking about it internally. Ne needs to keep interacting with it somehow, since it's focussed on the external world and sees possibilities and connections in that same external world. 

&gt; Anything that triggers strong emotions in me gives me energy.

Fi, again aided by Si. Se users usually don't exactly know where their energy comes from, while Si is really good at dissecting the internal feelings a person gets, where *exactly* it's coming from. As for the Fi part, Fi is more likely to be triggered by emotional things that they can feel for themselves, while Fe gets their energy from being in a good atmosphere with good people and keeping it just right.

&gt; I also have strong associations with certain vibes or atmospheres and get a lot of energy from being in environments or doing things that have those.

I agree with you about this though, this particular part does sound pretty Fe.

&gt; There's just something in the air that triggers these feelings but it's hard for me to describe in words. It's just something you have to feel.

This, however, is very Fi again. Fe would have an easy time describing that feeling they get in words. Fi is internal, so it feels the mood in its rawest, purest form. The judgement is easy to detect in their mind but Fi users have a harder time getting the right words to match what they feel and think inside.

So yeah I think you did make some good points, but I'm still staying with my first answer, OP is an INFP.Ahh no, but you can be second in command though. Or we can share our leadership over the IxFJ empire.For one, you would usually easily recognise an ENFP just through their writing. It looks very... *excited*. Usually lots of exclamation marks and smileys, bold or italic text and words in all caps. Though that seems to be less the case if they have a more developed Te, then it's all a little bit calmer.

As for you, you describe a lot of how things affect you, how they make you feel. You use phrases like "I hate" and "I feel", which Fi users tend to do. You show a good insight in how things make you feel, and you also seem pretty calm. I don't really see a lot of Te in your writing either, which definitely makes me think Fi dom. My answer here goes more into detail why I think you're an INFP:

https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/56mejt/i_cant_settle_on_a_type_can_anyone_help/d8lnpakN-no don't leave me with the TJs. They're scary.Yep, I look at Fe/Ti vs Te/Fi first too, then look for the order. Percieving functions are usually a bit harder to notice in someone else but eventually you'll see the difference between Se/Ni and Ne/Si in them.INFJs use Ti rather than Te. The only type that has tert Te and inf Si is ENFP.How about we leave you to do the official stuff like starting wars with the FPs who probably want their FJs back, and keeping the TJs far away from me while I go hang out with the FJs and eat some of u/rwarimaursus 's cookies.No worries, just helping you out.

I do agree with ENFP though, the entire post seems pretty ENFP to me.Ah okay, honestly I like them too. We should start recruiting them. What do we do about the other TPs? We're stealing away all their Feelers and I don't think they're all too happy about thatGood idea. We can make it so that they keep their peace with us in turn for some F time.In what way is it genetic?What's your problem famUrban Dictionary tells me it either means "Estimated Time of Arrival" or "Edited to Add". I wonder which one it is though.Wait are you saying I'm the only one with that LED board?&gt; I think you're projecting your own cognition too much on the OP.

Yep, I was afraid I'd go into the projecting territory by now. You make a lot of good points and I can definitely see why INTJ could be a good fit for OP. I do still think INFP though (but perhaps that's just stubbornness, I don't know), but this is ultimately for him to discover. I'm going to leave it at this because you're probably right and I've basically made all my points by now. It was a good read though, so thanks for the reply to my comment haha, it gave me some good insights.Exactly! Besides, being serious about your time of arrival is overrated anyway.Typical intuitives at work here, always procrastinating.

I'll help you make yours, do you want comic sans or impact?Even better! Nobody will understand it and that's how us poor misunderstood intuitives feel every day. :(I suppose it's mainly the weird phrasing and aggressiveness. They make pretty solid points most of the time but things like what they just said are a little hard to break down to a good point.Yep I've seen those too. I don't really see how being able to "destroy" someone is a good thing anyway, it sounds like a really immature thing to be proud of. I usually just go all "okay have it your way, I'll go post somewhere else now" when I get that vibe from someone.LOOK AT MY BUFF SMARTS, PREPARE TO GET REKT BY MY INTELLECT.I mean it'd be pretty cool imo to be wearing like a shirt with your four letters on it and see how many people know what it means, but for an ENTP that'd most likely be seen as "bragging" about your N or T. Sigh, I guess I'll wear an ISFJ shirt instead, they're way cooler anyway.Interesting, there seem to be more on the Ne/Si axis than Se/Ni, and more on the Te/Fi axis than Fe/Ti. That should make xSTJs and xNFPs the most common types, and xNFJs and xSTPs the least common. In that sample size, of course. Pretty interesting if you think about it.I have a lot of arguments with my ESFJ mom and she's made it clear that she finds it very annoying when I apparently try to get the last word. So that I guess? My ESTP dad is the same in that as my mom and they both usually answer my "why"s with "because I said so"s, which is very annoying if you truly genuinely want to know why. I'm guessing NTP kids can be a pain for ESFJ and ESTP parents.James Bond is usually typed as one, though that's the only one I can think of.Huh really? I thought he had a really introverted vibe about him. He also seems to prefer doing things alone so I can see the I for him.Oh yeah that's right, Trish from Divergent is also seen as an ISTP for the most part.I see, yeah I can see what you're getting at with that. I actually haven't really given it much thought myself, where your type comes from you know? But it seems more likely to me that it's at least somewhat genetic (maybe kind of in the way that hair is, colour, texture and everything) than it being completely random.I don't think that's what they meant. I'd guess Fi users (especially Fi doms) experience it more "raw" you know? Unfiltered I'd guess, since love and other feelings/states of mind come from inside. I think it's a little the same for Si doms too, since Si is all about perceiving senses internally.I agree to an extent, because I think sex and chemistry are just as important as cuddles and romance. Love consists of those things equally imo. Sure you can have sex without being romantically involved with someone, or being in love with someone while never having sex, but I think there's just a little bit missing at those points, you know?Don't have an own place yet, but I do have an own room. It's messy in an organised way. There's a pile of worn clothes on the floor, but that's the only place in the room you'll find worn clothes. There are random piles of books placed across my room but never a single book just laying there, all lonely. There's a bunch of plushies placed on a tower of boxes that are still unpacked since we moved here about half a year ago lol. There are a lot of unpacked boxes in fact. I got a half-assed drawing on my door because the space felt too empty, and I got a few posters but I never hung them on the walls. My bed is never made, I mean what's the point if I'm just gonna dive back in at night? There's a clear path from the door to my bed though and that's all that counts.I stay calm mostly, unless there's a time limit that's causing me stress, then I start getting panicky, trying my best to get as much done as good as possible. Usually I make it just in time though, I've developed a great skill for going juuust over deadlines but talk my way out of it at the end.Ooohhh I used to love Totally Spies when I was younger, Alex was my favourite. I don't completely agree with Scal that you can't type characters from kids shows like this, I think you can at least give a guess based on stereotypes and behaviour. Perhaps ESTP for her?Oof I don't know, I wouldn't know if people see me as messy but vaguely organised. I think it's more of a representation of my "inner self" if anything. Every sort of decoration in my room is either unfinished or half-assed, kind of like how my interests stop being my interests usually after that sense of novelty fades away.I'm a female fam. ;)

I think ESTP because (from my memory) she definitely seems like a T type rather than an F type, because of for example the nerdy bookworm trope, but not to such an extent where her Feeling function would be inferior. Other options with those criteria would be ISTJ, ENTP and INTJ, and out of these four I think ESTP seems to fit her the best.I use fam too, does that mean I'm an ESTP?Haha ISTP seems possible too, if we go by the typical "mechanic" stereotype which she does seem to radiate. I guess the main reason why I think ESTP for her is because she seems like an extrovert with high Ti.

Also if you compare her to other female ISTPs (Lara Croft, Katniss Everdeen etc.) and other female ESTPs (Korra from Avatar, Ginny Weasley etc.) I think she fits the ESTPs more.I think there's some truth to the whole opposite types being the best pairs thing, since I find ISFJs adorable and I could totally see myself being with one, if it wasn't for my INFJ bf who I shamelessly stole from the ESTPs haha.manbrodudefambuddypalsisI always got pretty scared and went around to look for them immediately because I was afraid they'd leave the store without me.

Forgot to mention, this happened a lot when I was younger. Hell, I still get separated from whoever I'm with because I lose focus for a second.The spoopiest.

http://i.imgur.com/hQKSmAX.gifHehehe there's no stopping us!Ayy good to see I'm starting to make a name of myself around here.

Haha my ISTP brother does it too, though I'm not sure whether that's my influence or the internet's. :PGo change that P for a J. :D ISFJs are the fluffiest.To scare them is my real test, to spoop them is my cause!I'll be an INTP then who silently still does some intense redditing in the background with supreme boss-avoiding stealth skillsI think INFPs are both often mistyped and people often mistype as INFPs. I mean it's basically become the reserve dump of MBTI. "Oh don't know what type you are? Just take this nice little INFP label and move ahead." It doesn't help that the MBTI test on 16 Personalities gives INFP to almost everyone who is introverted, has feelings, and imagines sometimes.

On the flip side apparently a lot of INFPs mistype as INTPs and INFJs and very occasionally INTJs.Oh no that wasn't a serious suggestion haha, sorry. :pYep, my ISFP friend also thinks she is an INFP because the tests tell her so, while the Se in her is pretty obvious. Oh well, I won't try to burst her INFP bubble unless she specifically asks me to. :pI also think N vs S is the hardest to get behind. I usually narrow it down to the judging functions, then the order of them, and then see which of the four I have left fits them best.I don't think tests like that really mean something for your MBTI result. I'm an ENTP and the average for the sociopathy test that floated around a week or two ago for my type was 19. I got 11, which is a pretty big difference for a test like that. 

If you relate to INFJ then you most likely are an INFJ. Have you taken a look at the functions?Haha those descriptions. But it is true, that happens all too often.

By the way, where is your name from? :o I recognise it.Yes! That's where I recognised it from. I haven't played the games myself but I've watched playthroughs of all the games and I'm in love haha.Yeah, I don't think it's all *too* common but my INFJ boyfriend mistyped as an INFP at first. Not a grain of Fi in him haha.I'm p good at Pokemon

And besides that, people tend to trust me really easy. I'm not one to misuse that trust so it's all good, but it sometimes scares me a little how easily people trust me. Like they tell me all kinds of secrets I didn't even ask for and things like that. I'm also pretty good at getting people to say what I want them to say, which easily falls into the manipulative territory too so I try to stay away from that skill.75%, ~~although the values of the cards *did* change occasionally. Maybe that's just my phone being unable to keep up though.~~ ignore my ignorance, forgot to read the instructions.Ohhh that makes a lot more sense. Should've read the instructions a bit better before excitedly rushing into it haha. I might as well give it another try sometime with this newfound wisdom.Fair enough, I only really remember the newer movies anyway so that probably explains it haha.I usually get the same. Mostly 9, but because I'm not remotely 1 or 8 it puts me as a 5w6 instead. :pSlight Extraversion: 12/21

Very Clear Intuition: 25/26

Moderate Thinking: 17/24

Very Clear Perceiving: 22/22

Nailed it.

But yeah anyway I do think there's quite a bit of N bias in the way they phrased the things. This one for example (I mean I'm not 100% sure this is N vs S but I do think so):

&gt; 24. Are you more attracted to:
&gt; a person with a quick and brilliant mind, or 
&gt; a practical person with a lot of common senseYeah, or not be particularly interested in either. I mean sure they're both sort of defining traits but it's not going to be a deal breaker in either case.I cry very easily while watching drama shows or movies, but very hard when it's in real life about real people. I guess it's just something in the atmosphere of the show/movie, something in the tone and mood of it just very easily brings me to tears.

Edit: so yeah I think both of them equally to be honest, though for different reasons. I think for Fe users it might especially be because of the tone, the music, the build-up etc etc, while for Fi users it might be more about the actual emotional impact and the content.Ever watched Angel Beats? I've watched it three times and cried each and every time.I can smell the Te from here, have you considered ESTJ?Sweet precious Yui, I loved that whole episode. The scene that always immediately brings me to tears though is the one where you learn about Ayato's past. Gets me every time.I've seen it, yes! It was amazing, the ice skating scene got me incredibly feelsy. Elfen Lied also brought me to tears a lot, especially nearing the end, although the reasonable amounts of gore did distract me a little from the feels.Definitely, it's a though one to answer regardless. I want a little bit of both, and I'm sure that most people do have a little bit of both. Very little people are delusional to point of lacking all common sense, or stubbornly practical with no imagination whatsoever.By now I've learned what exact answers to give in order to seem the most ENTP as possible so tests are barely reliable for me anymore lol.Haha exactly.Hmm, I guess that leaves it more to atmosphere and tone to Fe? I hadn't really thought of the Fx's in combination with Px haha.

Oh and with build-up I meant more the change in the mood getting ("building up") to that point of where you'll inevitably shed some tears.I don't really get that, I see way more Fi in you than Fe. I don't know about N vs S but I'm sure you got that figured out mostly.That's not a lot of information to work with, but from what I can gather you do seem like an Fe fella. People pleasing is one of the "core definitions" of Fe, and the way that you change your behaviour to fit how others see you, I don't think any Fi user in their right mind would do that. So that leaves the xxFJs.I guess it depends a little. How about you describe your surroundings to me, I'll try to make a guess that way.Never heard of any of those haha. I might give them a try. :pMaybe the answer is both. :PAlright with that I think you're an INFJ yeah, or at least xNFJ. An xSFJ would also go into detail like that, but in a different way I suppose.Dude chillISFJ?It's still there though.Oh so that's what they meant with it.Yeah, ENTJ is definitely possible. His post seemed a little more Si to me somehow, but that could probably also be tert Se creeping in.Hmm if you put it like that, ISFJ makes sense yeah. I guess the way they wrote it seemed more INFJ but that's no good base to go off on haha. So yeah you're most likely right.How would you say Ni works in you? I'm 100% sure that a friend of mine is an IxFP, and I'm leaning towards ISFP for her, so I'm pretty curious as to how Ni works alongside the other functions for ISFPs.Interesting, thanks!Wait wait wait, you're in the Netherlands? :o

And also your writing seems very ExFP to me, leaning towards ESFP.

Also we played that game too in class!Oh but introversion and extroversion aren't really the same in MBTI as they are in common terms. Have you looked into the functions?

And awesome, me too. I'm studying communication-y stuff ~~and I actually am one of those people that are 17~~.Well, it's a bit of a baseless guess but your writing style is very *excited* and all over the place, which is a bit typical for ExFPs. The S is because it seems to me that your insecurities come from an N way to look at things, like this sentence for example:

&gt; every day I have this fear in my heart that something will go wrong, every day I survive and at the end Im like, see heart?

Unless I'm completely misinterpreting that, of course.Ohh okay that makes things easier. Well cognitive extroversion and introversion is really just whether your most preferred function is Xe or Xi, I mean sure it has *some* correlation but it's not impossible for an ESFP to me more socially introverted, and for an INTP to be more extraverted.

ESFP over ENFP is because of the sentence I mentioned in the other comment. It looks like some inferior N function, though it could be inferior Te too which would put you as IxFP, but your writing seems very unlike that of Fi doms, but I'm positive you got Fi in there somewhere. You don't seem like an ISTJ either, so ESFP is my best guess. 

And Psychology, awesome! I get psychology lectures too, though that's more about communication psychology, of course haha. That's awesome though, what do you all learn?

Edit: You don't really seem like an INxJ though, but this is all just from that one blog post so take my words with a grain of salt haha.Ah, thanks that makes sense. What's the difference in the way the two perceive information though? I mean I know that Ne is external and Ni is internal, but how can you see the difference in the two from an outsider's perspective?http://imgur.com/r9GFD3rOof I don't really remember. I think I remember I got at least optimistic and something like honest and I suppose that fits me.

And thank you, I guess I practiced a lot haha. :p

And ah, I see. Well you could still be an ENFP but I really wouldn't accurately know from this bit of text haha.Why? Because he asked a question? It took me some time to figure it out too.Haha my best friend is an ENFP I have to keep telling her to calm down because she gets excited and riled up about pretty much everything. It's kind of adorable though.Yeah, sometimes it's even that I don't feel anything. Of course it's unfortunate that something bad happened but I don't feel it. ~~You need some music playing in the background for me to feel it~~I love this bot.What do you mean exactly? Sensitivity is a personality trait, it's not really like a state you can be in, so I'm kinda confused what you're really getting at here.Uhh I don't know. I don't think you can just turn functions on and off like that, they're always working in the background...I think. But if you're talking about my feelsy side, I guess I cry a lot when watching sad movies, that's the best answer I can gave.Please stop doing thisYeah aha, but this has been posted here a few times before. I guess he wasn't satisfied with our previous answer.I'm Twenty-Pikachus. Nice to meet ya.Hey what are you calling me a bitch for out of nowhere? I was being all nice and friendly, and then you give me that half-assed insult/threat. I take that nice to meet you back, you don't seem nice to meet at all.Oh I'm sure he is. He wants people to agree with him because being evil is totally badass right?I'm extremely ticklish too- does that make me an INFP?I thought that the functions tests only really measured which functions are most likely in your stack and not necessarily in which order? I could be wrong here thoughNo but I'm sure there's someone with that fetish.&gt; Just because it is a noun doesn't mean you can should capitalize it just because you feel like it!

That's especially the case with native Germans. In German you *do* capitalise every noun, so that might just be something they're used to and can't help if they're not focusing. It's not the end of the world if someone capitalises something or if someone says your instead of you're though.How so?AAAAAAAAAAAYou have fun there hehehe.But an ENTP and ENTJ don't share any of the functions in their stack (Ne&gt;Ti&gt;Fe&gt;Si vs. Te&gt;Ni&gt;Se&gt;Fi). That's what I kinda meant. If you're, say, an ESFP those tests would at least show a preference for Se Ni Te and Fi right? Unless my understanding of those tests is completely wrong, but in any case, like you said, the tests aren't really reliable anyway.Hey what are you mocking my breasts for!

T-they're big I swear! :'(I'm good with money in the sense that I pretty much never spend it, but I'm also bad with it since I don't have a job. I'm in college and at the moment I don't really feel the need to have the money, you know? I don't *have* to have all the luxuries it brings me, I'm happy with a glass of water. I just have what I earn with my summer job and make it through the whole year with that. That said I do want to get a job now, it makes me feel more responsible.~~I'm an Ne dom I change topics all the time, serious or not~~

And yeah I know, I'm not really self-conscious about my breasts. I'm just glad they're not really big because it seems to me they'd hurt and get in the way and everything. 

I gotta say though, I just googled it too and that's a condition I've never seen or heard of, but I can definitely see why someone would be embarrassed of them. Or maybe not embarrassed, more like self-conscious.My parents just completely stopped at one point. Not because they thought I was too old for it, just because they forgot.I always thought Harry Potter was an ISFP. Then again the only sources I have for that are a number of Tumblr posts and Tumblr isn't typically the most accurate in typing.Likewise, I haven't met any of them outside of Reddit. The ones on here seem mostly chill though.What's even more fun is if you get to pretend to be an Fe dom but are actually an Ne dom that's pretending to have stockholm syndrome and then sneak-attack up on you and then inherit the whole harem. :DNah not really, I don't desperately need the money for myself.It seems like the only letter people seem to agree on about Harry Potter is the I haha, I've literally seen him typed as every introvert except the INTxs. And you're right about the ISTJs not really getting enough credit for it. We tend to only really pay attention to the Ns it seems. Interestingly, I've seen Hermione typed as an ISTJ too, thoughts on that?I mean I tend to do it too sometimes, acting as the most stereotypical ENTP without even realising it. And then I remember "oh wait no I'm *human.*"Let's go revive it! :DYeah I think INFJ for OP, I can definitely see a young Fe-aux (especially in combination with dominant Ni) thinking "if I let my sister have this thing right now it will benefit me later because my mother will praise me".Wonderful, where can I get my emo haircut and a passion for melancholic poetry?Interesting, I've almost exclusively seen her typed as an I type. But I can see Te-dom for her. :pNot me, I've never misjudged a situation like that. I usually get a pretty good indication of how serious it is judging by the person who is organising the event. This is pretty the reason why I always got away with handing in essays days or sometimes weeks past the deadline, because I only did that with the teachers I knew I could get away with it.Two 7s. 7 is nice, good number that you can give to yourself without seeming vain or something like that. I always give myself 7s for this reason tbh./u/mirrorconspiracies remember the talk we had about a dating sim? Haha.Procrastinating on 2 major projects with upcoming deadlines.

I'd say that's pretty ENTP.Bake a cake in the shape of a guitar to even further impress them.

Edit: Even better if you can also play the cake.D:Sometimes they make a better fork than a fork does.Weird, I'm the exact opposite. I'll probably forget your name, style, voice, occupation, hobbies etc. a bunch of times but you can be damn sure I'll remember your face for years.I often do this too. But getting too focussed doesn't help me either because then I'll focus too much on the words and don't actually register any of them.Ah cool cool, so would you see yourself as more of a 9w8 or 9w1? Or balanced?&gt; So reading this definitely makes me think you use Fi and I also think Ni

I think so too, my first guess based on all this would be ISFP because of Fi and Ni.I think it's unusual in the sense that INFJ 2s and 4s seem more common, but it's more common than the INFJ 8w9 on this page. :P

Edit: Oh hahaha I just saw that that was you.Me neither. Except for maybe that I do desire to be respected and have pretty ambitious thoughts, but I think those relate more to the 1 part than the 8 part.Do you mean in the sense that his Te seems higher than inferior, or not at all there (so more Ti/Fe)?

And as a bit of an unrelated but related question, what does inferior Si look like in somewhat older people? I'm about the age of OP myself and I'm having difficulty figuring out what even Si is in me, so comparing that with somewhat older ENxPs might be helpful.Oh, that could be it. I've seen the INFJ 2 thing on other sites and on google images, perhaps those statistics are mainly people mistyped as INFJs? Or maybe the 2s just aren't drawn to sites like Reddit as others? I only just started understanding the very raw basics of enneagram so I don't really know haha.Oh don't worry about the rant-ness, it was interesting and helpful to read, thanks! I can definitely relate to all that, which makes me a bit more sure again of my own type haha. And I'll check out those links. :)Awesome! I think the "usual" type for ENTJs is 8? How would you say you're different from ENTJ 8s?That's a pretty interesting graph. I guess ENTP 9s aren't the least common combination, but 7s definitely outnumber them haha. Out of curiosity, what enneagram type are you?Ah that makes sense yeah. :)Oh don't worry I don't know a lot about it either, I just say what I think is right and wait for someone to come along and correct me haha.

But yeah, I can relate a little to that. I don't really feel the need to show off either, but I do always secretly hope someone notices my skills. :pENTP, and I "admire" ESTPs the most. The way Se keeps them grounded and interested in the here and now is something I'm really envious of. I can talk about hypothetical situations and philosophical thoughts all day long but it's just so wonderful when you see an ESTP talk about something that's relevant right here and now and they have knowledge about. It's so nice and practical and down-to-earth and there are lots of times where I'd gladly trade my Ne for Se to be a badass ESTP for the day.*Wake up sheeple*Hahaha exactly what I thought.Yeah I know after looking a bit into it, but it's not *the* most common combination. That's what I was getting at.ENTP Ravenclaw. And if I don't get Ravenclaw it's pretty much always Gryffindor.Hell I'm not even an Fi user and I'd wear that.Of course they can. Those are simply typically extraverted things to do, so it's more likely for introverts to leave that to the extroverts. Similarly extroverts can engage in introverted behaviour, but at the end of the day they're still extroverts because social activity energises them rather than drains them. Please tell me why.Here I'll give you something to do haha.

1. I suppose so. Depends a little on what you mean with abstract ideas. If it's pure unorganised randomness then no, but I'm pretty good with learning theory that's not necessarily practical.
2. I try to. English is not my first language so I mess up often, but I still think long, fancy-sounding words are wonderful.
3. Mentally I guess. If I'm about to do a test or presentation I try to run through everything in my head, but I rarely physically practice (which is probably because I'm lazy tbh).
4. Both, I like order but I am messy. Results in everything around me being an organised mess where I'm probably the only one that gets why things are in a certain place.
5. Depends on the people, but I get along with most others.
6. Not at all, I tend to talk pretty fast and start sentences over again because I realise mid-sentence that it's not going anywhere.
7. Really depends on the situation and the person. Sometimes it hits me hard and I instantly mirror their feelings, while other times I'm pretty much as sympathising as a rock.
8. I show interest in people but go out of my way to take time for them unless they're really close to me.
9. I don't like it too loud, but I do love having at least some kind of background noise. I can't concentrate as well if the room is completely quiet.
10. Only if they give me a reason to be. Otherwise I'm pretty chill.Wasn't that the whole point?Ah I see haha. I was confused considering OP was asking for help in the context of his experiences, which pretty much automatically makes it subjective.Oh I wasn't confused about the subjectivity, I could see that from miles away. I was rather confused at what you were getting at with the statement. So I suppose you were getting at his type here, which makes a lot more sense than you saying it randomly.

And don't worry about offending me, unless it's a personal attack I'm pretty chill.

But yeah, interesting analysis.Welp, guess I'm an ISTJ now. :DPicking christmas trees in October??? /r/madladsI don't know about the Ni one, but the Ne thing seems like it would help you use Ne more naturally. It doesn't really increase anything since it's not an actual substance in your body/mind, but it'd help in getting more used to using Ne. I think.Haha, my INFJ boyfriend seems to have the ESFP eyebrows, I guess he must be mistyped as well. :PThat would be cool though, the eye colour thing. I claim bright/neon yellow eyes for us ENTP folk.&gt; I can't even tell if the right or left side is supposed to be towards the nose :Ddd

Hahaha me neither. I'm guessing it's the right side that's towards the nose but the ENTP eyebrow threw me off a little.That makes the most sense yeah aha.I saw a video once where this guy shows and talks about pictures taken of every type after they got typed by professionals, and you could see a pretty good correlation in the facial expressions of every type. I can't find it though. :(

And oh I'm fine with sharing, as long as I get my blinding yellow eyes. :POh no that's understandable, privacy is privacy haha.

And after some more digging I found the video(s) again!

Gammas: https://youtu.be/GoFS9X3j2BM

Deltas: https://youtu.be/nciMUF-qLG8Because symmetric mustaches are so 2015.Probably an ISTP,  considering everything has to have a purpose. I think that's a pretty good giveaway for Se/Ni. The descriptions aren't the most accurate thing anyway, I can relate a lot to the INTP and ENFP descriptions as well but I'm neither of those types.

Maybe ask them how good they are with reading body language? My ISFP friend always notices things that I never would've seen, like someone mirroring her body language, or that someone "looks" upset and such. Maybe that could be an indication of auxiliary Se?Hahaha please stay. :')Good night. :)

http://i.imgur.com/wHSg8if.jpg

ENTP, 17 and Dutch. :DOur god seems like an xNTP for sure, he left things half-assed and imperfect and I'm sure he's enjoying watching us all struggle from his little cloud up in the sky.Hahaha those downvotes, must be some butthurt introverts who can't handle their little bubble being popped.

But to get into it, things that extroverts would "naturally" be better at and have an advantage of are probably the things like handling group work, creating a network, thinking faster out loud rather than inside their heads. Things like that.Alright I'll give it a shot :)

&gt; I tend to overreact to events and let myself get carried away with my anger or emotions but it's only because I feel so passionately about things.

Fi most likely.

&gt; they know I'm really good at creating art that reflects their individuality.

Ni insight perhaps?

&gt; Flaky. I go through obsessions like I go through underwear. I can be really into an idea, a tv show, a musician etc, one minute...but a week later I'll get a bored and move on to something else.

High Ne tends be like this, but so does high Se.

The way you formatted your post seems pretty structured in a Te way.

From this I'm guessing ExFP, leaning slightly towards ESFP. When you get bored of something, do you get bored of the experience or of the concept?Perhaps Se doms do it more so than other types, maybe they notice it sooner?&gt; Probably the experience....because a lot of the I end up getting back into things after I've had a break from them. Or sometimes its just that I forget about things because something else has occupied my mind so I neeed to be reminded why I like such things again.

That sounds more like Se than Ne to me, so my best guess would be ESFP. :)

&gt; What makes you say E over I btw???

The way you write pretty much screams ExFP haha. It looks really excited and bubbly, which is pretty typical of those types. IxFPs usually are a little bit more reserved and analytical I guess, their writing looks much more sober.

I hope that helps!

Edit: oh and with sober I didn't mean that your writing looks drunk haha, I guess IxFP writing seems more self-aware in a deeper way.Aaaah I'm your favourite? *Melts*

Haha I looked at your post too and you look really pretty. :0Me too me too! :D&gt; People that play a game of any sort but don't even try to win.

Oh man I hate this too. The stereotypical ENTP version of this though would be the same but with debating. Which I hate too. Don't give me the "okay you're right" crap I know you still don't believe me.Oh that's definitely possible. The reason why I think E over I for OP (aside from the things I already said) is because their Fi sorta seems to be kept on a leash by their Se. At least I get that kind of impression from their post. OP clearly has that high Fi like insight in themselves, but more in a way an Fi aux would than an Fi dom, I think.

I could be wrong though! It's ultimately up to OP to figure it out. :)Haha yeah, it'd be hella cute but privacy is still privacy.Your name is gecko, which is a lizard.

Guess who are also lizards!!!???Does that jacket have cat ears by any chance? :oI didn't think the post was that hostile, it sounded more like sarcasm to me.

edit: To clear it up a little I mean it more like it has some sarcastic undertones to it (especially the parts that seem asshole-y), not that the whole post is sarcastic.I think that also has to do with Fe vs Fi. While all people care to some extent about how others see them, I'd think Fe users acknowlegde the social norms and boundaries easier and generally speaking give more fucks about fitting in. Fi users seem to only really do that when it's something they value from inside.Yeah, now I think about it more, INTP seems the most likely. Everything in our world works, everything makes logical sense in a way that a Ti dom would put it as. I think that if an Ne dom had created this world everything would a little more...uncanny I suppose. More chaotic connections between things, more unfinished frameworks, and he himself would probably show his face every once in a while.I know one thing and that is if I would have created an entire world I'd want to participate in it myself. So if there is a god there is a chance that he's walking around somewhere, just playing along with everyone.From my experience, ESFJs. My mother and my grandma are both ESFJs and they just go on and on even if nobody is listening anymore. It's like talking is the same thing as breathing to them. Same goes for my ESFJ classmate, it's as if she wants to share her whole life story with everyone, which is both interesting to see and a little too much to deal with sometimes.I love your hair!Pretty much. xDWhoops sorry, guess I spend too much time with my INFJ haha.Ahh too bad, otherwise we would've had the the same one most likely. :pOh of course, my Ixxx friends do too haha, especially the IxxP ones. But it's bit in a different way I suppose. Fi/Ti seems to keep the Se/Ne under control in a way, while for ExxPs it's the other way and Se/Ne outshines the Fi/Ti. But yeah, ISFP still seems likely for OP. :)I always thought Yuno was a perfect example of an INFJ gone cray cray with inferior Se.I think karma and destiny would be mutually exclusive. Fate is a little more fluid than destiny.I think the reason why it seems stubborn is because the introverted functions are subjective by nature, which can seem irrational or stubborn by their extroverted counterparts.You think so? I thought Ne was all about expanding from one point on into all possibilities, which would make sense in how OP made his notes.

What his friend did sounds more like Te filtering out what is irrelevant at the time.Maybe you should update your flair to avoid confusion. :P&gt; I think it's hard to narrow it down to one function altogether, but I find that my Ne dom/aux friends tend to write notes like as if they were speaking to themselves; the whole stream of consciousness thing. If you interrupt them at any point, they might lose that train of thought.

I see, I suppose you're right with that because I can really relate to that haha.

And yeah I agree that it's hard to see just one function in it, or perhaps impossible since functions don't really work alone I think.4D apparently.

Cool.Hahaha so that's why.Yeah that makes sense too, maybe she's one of us. :oYou think so? I thought her whole attitude was very Ni-driven, she goes out of her way to make sure that her vision of an ideal world with Yuki comes true, to the point where she basically kills him off (on impulse!) because things aren't going her way.

I could be wrong though, it's been a long time since I've watched Mirai Nikki and have come to realise that the characters aren't exactly the best written people anyway. Or the show for that matter. It's still enjoyable though.Function-wise it would be ESFP actually (Ne&gt;Ti&gt;Fe&gt;Si vs Se&gt;Fi&gt;Te&gt;Ni) but personality-wise I agree with you on that ISFPs seem a bit like ENTPs' polar opposites.Well I'm dating an INFJ which is going pretty great. Not completely my opposite though.

I could definitely see myself with an ISFJ (they're honestly my favourites), although that's also the case with any FJ. Something about that Fe&gt;Ti just draws me in so good and it's wonderful.

Function-wise, I dated an ENTJ for about two months. Again, not completely my opposite, but close enough. I thought it was going pretty well at the time until he abruptly cut it off, but now that I look back it probably wasn't the most healthy relationship anyway.This is my new favourite bot

Aside from the Jack Sparrow botYeah I thought so, but I also thought "hey maybe there's a correlation with MBTI in here, let's see where this goes" haha.Yeah likewise, when I'm alone I never do it, and I do it way less when (mainly) my family is around.Haha I'm imagining someone's mouth turning into a black hole while laughing now. :')I think that's why I do it too. Although I'm not sure since I only just noticed that I do it haha.Haha yeah, me too although it's more often smiling when it's inappropriate than laughing.~~ISTJ because all detectives are ISTJs~~

Hmm it's a tough one since it's been so long since I've watched it but somehow don't really see INTP for him when I compare him to other INTPs. I always thought INTJ somehow seems like a better fit, but this is really just a pretty baseless guess.I talk in my head (and sometimes out loud) like I would if someone were listening, so pretty much as a typical monologue. I'm Dutch but I think in English 99% of the time, I don't know when I started doing that though.

I like talking out loud to myself (when I'm alone of course) better than thinking though, it helps me register what I'm actually thinking better. Maybe that's because my dominant function is extraverted?

Oh and one more thing that I forgot to mention which probably counts as unusual, usually I pretend I'm talking to [current fictional character I'm obsessed with]. I don't imagine them talking back to me but it's just nice to have someone listen to your endless ramblings. :)&gt; that's interesting! 2 ENTJs i know also have different "personas" in their head that talk to each other. they both name these personas and "become" them.

Aah that's cool, I know an ENTJ who does that too haha. Interesting.N is the übermensch.

Edit: Lmao it was a jokeI think you're either an INFP or an ISFJ. I don't know how much you know about the cognitive functions so just typing them out for you might not be beneficial if you don't know what the hell I'm on about. But if you want me to I'll gladly go into further detail. :)Done this particular test one too many times for the results to be accurate haha. I consistently get ENTP though, sometimes INFJ too since my Ni and Fe seem to be on the higher side. Fi is always historically low, as is Te. :PMy first guess is xNTP, leaning to INTP. I see a lot of similarities with what I am/do in your post, and of course that's not the most unbiased way to look at it, but that's why it's just a guess. :p

I'll take a better look into it later.Pick me pick me! 

How does it work and what do I do?I got it too and I have no fucking clue how it got that from my answers haha. Maybe I'm an ENFP after all.Hahaha, good luck with that idea! :DFor the longest time it was Sirius Black (from Harry Potter obvs), but now I put both Batman and the Joker out there thanks to my boyfriend getting me into that haha. It changes every few weeks or so.

And you should, it's a pretty fun thing to imagine. I tell myself as long as I keep in mind it's not real then it's all good hahaha. I do remember the first time I did that (which was when I was about 12 or so), I had just watched Death Note and wrote "L" on a piece of paper with I put in my pen which would somehow make him appear there in my mind. Now I touch my index and middle fingers with my thumb which makes them "appear", it's become a bit of a habit haha.My mother and my grandma are both ESFJs and they're really kind people. They both always make sure that nobody is left behind or feeling excluded. The only thing that bothers me sometimes is that they want to know _everything_ that's going on in my life, but that might be more of a family thing rather than an ESFJ thing. I love them both very much though.

One of my friends is an ISFJ and she's also really kind, funny but also serious when needed. If it helps, ISFJs are honestly my favourite type. Most of you seem so nice and generous but you all also got that tert Ti going which makes conversations with you all really interesting to see how you work and think. ISFJs are great. :)I think it's mainly that your Se and Fi are very obviously there haha. Fi&gt;Te uses typically say things like "I love" and "I hate" way more often than Ti/Fe or even Te&gt;Fi. And said things that you love are very typical Se things to enjoy. ISFP seems possible, but I think your Se is more apparent in this post. :PAyyy me too. :)I wonder, when is the last time you posted something here? I mean it's kind of weird to call this sub out on only having shit posts when you don't actively try to make a difference yourself, wouldn't you agree?ISTJ: The dad

ESTJ: Your boss

ISFJ: The goofball

ESFJ: The mom

INTP: The nerd

ENTP: The shitposter

INTJ: The puppeteer

ENTJ: The supreme overlord

ISTP: The nerd who gets things done

ESTP: The jock

ISFP: The new-age hippie

ESFP: The succubus

INFP: The flower child

ENFP: The puppy

INFJ: The unicorn

ENFJ: The sociable unicorn&gt; Enjoy your shit post!

Thanks fam, I will. :')Glad to be of your service. :)We all need that one FJ to fill up that hole in our lives. :')

Either way, like Lawdoodette said, I think it's better to date first and type later than to type first and date later. Girls and guys come in all kinds of shapes and colours, you just gotta find a girl who you like for herself and not just for her type.

To answer the real question you asked, I met my INFJ (although he's a dude) online a couple of years ago and we've been friends for way longer before we started dating. If you got a bit of a network around you then I'm sure there are some FJ girls too that you already befriended. If not, go out and explore! FJs are practically everywhere. Stalk their subs a little to see what they'd be like and try to recognise it in the people you meet. :)I'm an ENTP, my mom is an ESFJ and my dad is probably an ESTP. My younger brother is an IxTP (most likely ISTP) and my half brother (mom's side) seems like an INFJ. We all got that Fe/Ti going haha.&gt; I on the other hand... am an INFP female who just hates high heels. How do people walk in them?

These are the important questions. Someone please shed some light on this.Yeah, they pretty much mutilate your feet too. I'll just stay away from them and continue wearing my converses haha.Interesting, I'm about the same height but it's considered short for me. Then again I live in the Netherlands where everyone is at least the size of two giants.Interesting, but aren't high arches a result of consistently wearing high heels? I'm not saying everyone should stop wearing high heels all together, but isn't it pretty dangerous to practically put all your weight on just your toes?I think that's the case with most movie characters, regardless of their type. The typical blockbusters like superhero movies and The Hunger Games don't focus as much on character developement as they do on the general plot, because that sells. Most people simply want to see a movie that has an enjoyable story and something that is overall pretty to watch. The movies that *do* show predominantly well-rounded characters and character developement are mainly the underdogs that don't get mentioned that much.I think he means that actual retards are not going to find this offensive.Of course, gotta stay true to my title after all.I think you're definitely an xxFJ, the majority of the points you made here are about your interactions with others and what they told you you're like, which stands out as Fe to me.

Ni also seems pretty apparent in the way you seem fairly future oriented, but paired with that Se that requires you to keep things going in action.

I'd go for xNFJ, leaning to INFJ seeing as you consider yourself introverted.Ohh haha I thought you were the one who made this post. Your names both start with "Ma" so that might be why. Would tagging him here do the trick? /u/mackeliseYou're welcome. :)

Yeah I could see ISTP too, but when going by this post dominant Ni + good Ti seems more likely than dominant Ti + good Ni I believe. Your Fe doesn't seem to be your inferior function at all here, and since one of your friends that knows you much better than a random stranger on Reddit does thinks of you as an xNxJ too I'm inclined to agree with her here haha.Oh I wouldn't know, I was just repeating/explaining what Aurarus said.

But since colloquial roughly means informal, I suppose those would be the people that are called retarded by people that don't actually seriously mean it, whereas the actual retards are the people that are actually mentally delayed in such a way that retard is not an unfitting label for them, I think.That was intended yes. ;)Ah, I didn't know it was something that you could be born with. At least I think that's what they mean. And perhaps that might work better for those with those kind of feet. :PCool list. What am I supposed to do with this?Indeed. But why are you telling me that? If I recall correctly it wasn't me who used the R word in a harmful way, nor did I take the side of the people who did.Woah for some reason I really pictured you as a guy. Unless you're a guy who likes to wear heels of course which is probably what I will picture you as from now on for comedic purposes.Haha nooo, you INFJs are the purest most innocent beings so the unicorn title fits perfectly. ;P

Reminds me, I once saw a post on Tumblr somewhere that said INFJs were practically "psychic unicorn Jesus" lol.Ah thank you! I don't know a lot about these loops, but I suppose I'll find out more by digging into it a little deeper. :PAh good idea, guess I'll be flooding each sub soon with questions about how they would handle a situation.Sure haha. I've never actually gotten far enough with a project to add in a decent amount of character development, but I think that by using MBTI I'll be prepared a little. So how do you usually start with coming up with a character from scratch?&gt; I think ENTP would be more likely to 'show it' in the sense that their F is extroverted.

I can relate, it's what keeps me up at night wondering if I'm not actually an IxFJ because of the amount of Fe I think that I show.Just poke and pry and see if they like it. Drop (understandable) bits of information and see what they do with it. You can't force someone to like something, if they don't they don't, and if they do they'll ask you to go on about it.Ohh, that's pretty cool. :o

When I create characters I usually begin with thinking "okay what would be interesting traits to give this character?" and then round him up like that basically. I often also just fleshen out the personality along the way. Creating characters is probably my favourite thing about writing. :PI understand that it's...dangerous, I suppose, to use MBTI in mind when writing, but that's kind of the point. I've never done it before and I'll be happy to try out this challenge. If it turns out to be shit then no problem, I'll just not do it again in the future, but for now I need to have that experience before I can really judge. :pFemale T(i) here.

I think the name of it has been tainted by bad reputation over especially the internet. That's pretty much as far as I'll go with my opinion because every time the topic is brought up my opinion seems to change.

I guess the only other thing I'll state is that America (USA) seems to have *way* more issues regarding feminism and sexism than where I live in west Europe. In America the men seem to be manlier and the women seem to be more feminine (or at least that's the vibe you all give off, it's more expected in America to conform to the typical gender roles) while here it's more closer together. Nobody really bats an eye here at men being more feminine or women being more masculine, which is why I've never felt the need for feminism in my life. I personally don't need it because I have never experienced sexism and don't see the issues here where I live. I can see why someone in a more masculine country would need it though.You sound pretty ENTP to me man.&gt; I think out of the NT types, ENTPs are definitely the most prone to oversharing.

Whoops I can relate. I always fear that I'm talking too much (especially about myself because I'm interesting as fuck).I always test ENTP because I know what I need to click in order to get ENTP. The first ever test I took (on 16 personalities) gave me INFP, most likely because I think my Fe is a bit on the higher side and I'm also socially more of an ambivert.

Functions tests usually gave me (in order of frequency) ENTP, INFJ and INTP in the beginning.+/u/user_simulator /u/twenty-pikachus+/u/user_simulator /u/twenty-pikachusThe human mind doesn't like incongruity, that's why people keep bringing it up. :P&gt; ENTPs have this "look at us, we're so awesome" thing going on.

But that's because we are awesome, just look at us.It seems to me Fi and Ni are generally the least understood functions. Si too, but with Si it's more that people get it completely wrong rather than that most people aren't even confident in what they think Fi and Ni even are. Ti seems to me the easiest to understand (out of the introverted functions), but that might just be from my own view because it's my auxiliary function.Haha thanks. :) I guess the main issue is that I do a lot of introspecting and then dump that on everyone around me and then get self-conscious about that hahaha. I don't know any other ENTPs IRL (at least not that I know of) so it's interesting to see that others throw their random bits of information at others too. I guess it's that Ne-Fe at work there that wants to gather as much information as possible and then share it with everyone else.Ahah I know an Ivan, used to be one class lower than me in elementary school.

And I usually don't get far enough with a project to create good, well-round characters. I had an idea a while ago for some kind of subtle yandere girl who has been obsessed with my main character (who is kind of a dork but a cool dork). Then later on I got the idea for that same protagonist to be in love with his friend, but have it disguised as some kind of platonic feelings.

Now that I think back to it maybe I should reboot it sometime, I got some pretty fun ideas brewing up again.

One thing comes to mind though, I read somewhere that you should treat all your characters as if they were the main character. I think it's so that even your side characters will become dynamic, 4-dimensional human beings. That piece of advice has been on the back of my mind ever since I read it.I think the core meaning of equality for feminism is about being treated the same way as everyone else. Not everyone is equal, of course. A garbage cleaner doesn't make an equal amount of money as a brain surgeon, and that's good because otherwise we'd have no brain surgeons and only garbage cleaners. But they both should be be treated the same way, both jobs are necessary after all and there's no need to look down on one while looking up to the other. Different people can certainly be treated equally, which is what feminism stands for from what I know.I agree about Ti and Te there. An interesting thing I read somewhere sometime said something along the lines of that Ti analyses external information that Ne/Se gathers by fitting it into a logical internal framework (what makes logical sense to me?), whereas Te analyses internal information that Ni/Si gathers by fitting it into a logical external framework (what makes logical sense in the external world?). It kind of explains that Ti is inherently subjective, while Te is objective by nature.

I wouldn't know where that would leave Fe and Fi though, I'm still trying to get a grasp on how the two judging functions work together.Oh hahah, makes a bit more sense.

And sure you can! I might not always reply quick though because I don't get notifications on my phone anymore- thanks update.Haha I occasionally come over to /r/INFP but it's been a while since I've strayed from this sub now.My ISFP friend is actually really good at reading people-- when it suits her haha. She'll see that someone is upset from miles away, and is just really good at reading body language and facial expressions. Most likely she's comparing her own Fi experiences to what she picks up about others with Se.From what I know, everyone does that. What's interesting though is that women put themselves in the shoes of men and women easier, while men generally speaking only do that with other men. It's why gender-neutral advertisements usually have a man in them (or at least focus on the man) rather than a woman.Then how do the functions work in your eyes? Because it being a colouring lens is a bit of a vague concept to me.That's an interesting way to look at it, and I think you're probably right with that.

~~Then again the Ti/Si in me wants the theory to be neatly structured and symmetrical~~That's a bit of a different situation considering what I said is something subconscious and the advertising agencies play into it, while what you said is more of a social (issue) thing. But I agree that it's a bit odd that it's only acceptable one way and not the other. The way things are looking though, I wouldn't be surprised if we started seeing more guys in feminine clothes like dresses sometime in the future. Probably not tomorrow, but I do think it will happen with the way things are going.Developing that Te I bet. c;Oh no I get ya, I think it sort of happens naturally over time anyway, developing your lower functions. I am the same with Fe too honestly, like I often feel too... *feely* to be an ENTP.ENxJ because of tertiary Se.Perhaps because Se is focussed on the outside world, while Si happens inside your head. All the extraverted functions stand out more, while the introverted functions are a little more hidden. Se is also more objective while Si is subjective, so Se seems more grounded and "Sensing" in general.That's only half of my answer. I also said that Se is more objective in general, which is more associated with Sensing, while Si can easily be confused with the other introverted functions since they're focussed internally. Si has several qualities that Fi, Ti and Ni have as well, while Se is easier to distinguish as Se.Haha, thanks regardless though! :)Ah, thanks! :D&gt; If you always feel like you are/want to be a special snowflake in the world, you're probably one of us lol

Hahaha doesn't everyone though? :PHaha I guess in me it manifests more as a desire to be the best at things, but I do often do things differently just because everyone else is already going the other way. Does that count?You got the question swapped around friend. I agree though, ISxPs and especially ISFPs seem to be the most iNtuitive Sensors, probably because of Fi+Ni that makes them seem sometimes even more iNtuitive than INFPs haha.Meh I'll be pretty content as an ISFJ. I get to keep my Ti and Fe in a reasonable order *and* I'll have that amazing Si discipline to actually get shit done lol. I can go without my Ne popping up everywhere, I'll happily move that a bit down in my stack.;n;

I CAN'T HELP IT THAT I'M CIS, WHITE AND STRAIGHT, DON'T HURT ME TUMBLRWhat do you mean?I see, yeah I don't watch his show so I don't have an answer for it myself, but INFP seems like the most popular type to just give someone if you don't know better. 16-personalities also has a pretty big bias towards xNFx types, most of the time T vs F in a question sums up to "I am the most cold-hearted, logical intellectual to have ever set foot on this Earth, and did I mention that I have no feelings and am a robot" vs "I feel emotions sometimes", and something similar for S vs N.It's pretty linear for me. I can always pretty much exactly trace back the steps how I got to a certain conclusion, or thought in general. It's what always has me thinking "wait how did I get there? Oh yeah I thought of puppies and then wolves and then the song She Wolf and then that made me think of how rad Sia actually is", it usually goes on for a little longer. Thing is, I never really come to a conclusion. The longer I think about things the more I add onto them which can go on infinitely. It's why I'm still not certain of my type haha.Easygoing for the most part. And I don't know for sure but I think people find me pretty approachable.Why so serious famOh man I can't help but cringe every time I hear the American voices, only Patrick sounds kinda like what I'm used to for them haha.Just curious, what made you doubt ESFJ? And why not go from E to ISFJ?That's a pretty cool video, he seems cool I'll watch him more. :P

But yeah I don't think I have ADHD, I can relate to most of the things he said in the video but to a much lesser extent. The part where you sent me to though, that's pretty much my thought process. I think a lot of ADHD traits overlap with ENxP traits anyway, thanks to dominant Ne.Haha I love how it gradually becomes more passive-aggressive.Haha my bad then.It reads like it too. xPMy family doesn't really celebrate Christmas that much. We go to my grandparents' place and have dinner there and that's pretty much it. New Year's Eve though, now that's a completely different story. My whole family comes together (including aunts, uncles and cousins) and me and my younger cousins (who are all 1-5 years younger than me) usually play some dumb games or go play Just Dance and Mario Kart on the Wii and light fireworks throughout the night. It's my favourite holiday to be honest.My ex bf is an ENTJ and he did the list thing.&gt; I speak in very, very uncertain terms and I rarely state anything absolutely.

Yeah, I do that too. Anything to not get tied to just one side haha.I think small talk is only enjoyable when I first meet someone. It's the easiest and fastest way to get to know a lot of facts about a person, though after talking to them two or three times I tend to stray from typical small talk and dive right into the meaning of life with them.This is pretty much another way to ask "who has the highest Fe?" tbh.Weird question, but what is that polr stuff that I see people talk about occasionally? Because I have no clue.Oh man, socionics stuff. Unknown terrain for me.

But thanks for the links. It seems a little confusing but I'm sure I'll understand it all sometime.My ISFP friend also gets annoyed very easily, there might be some truth to this haha.What about them is racist?But OP never claimed that you can't do them right if you don't have Ti or Ne in your stack. Just that the tests are structured in such a way that the questions and the answers cater more to those who have high Ne/Ti. Anyone can get a high score on IQ tests, just as any type can have a high IQ.&gt; Dumb as fuck ENFJ with "Ti too low in my stack" /s

It's odd though, I've never seen the stereotype that ENFJs are dumb. If anything I always perceived them as one of the generally smartest types. You all seem like you skipped ahead 10 levels of maturity too, maybe that's why you people seem so smart.That doesn't make the tests racist, that makes the people who use them to "prove" black people are genetically dumber than white people racist. No need to hate the tests for that, pretty much everything in existence has been used for discrimination one way or another.I suppose someone who actually has a grasp on Ni can give you a better answer, but I read a few times that it's basically subconsciously perceiving information and connecting that to each other, and then spitting out an answer into your consciousness (which I guess could be seen as one of those famous "aha-moments").Ohh, how do you and your ESTP friend get along? I've never really seen anything about INFP/ESTP friendships so I'm pretty curious for your experiences.&gt; I have a good number of other friends, but I'd be here all night if I didn't stop somewhere.

Haha I feel the same. I had the urge to start typing everyone in my class and I really had to actively stop myself from doing so.That's so cool, my brothers differ 5 and 9 years from me, and one is younger and the other is older, and my older brother (INFJ) is more of a loner type in general, so I'd be stuck with my younger brother's 11-12 year old friends haha. What's it like though, having a twin? I know it's different for everyone, but I've always wondered.In what way?INFPs are pretty rad though, I wish I had more of them in my social spiderweb.Family full of xSTJs, everything is neatly structured and organised to the dot and you all go to church on Sunday I assume? :PHaha I can imagine the INTP going all "they stopped being nice to each other, help me Anxiouslybad, what do I do?!" while you try to mediate between the two.

It's interesting though, one of my INFJ boyfriend's friends I'm fairly sure of is an ESTP too, and from what I know they get along great. It differs greatly for each person of course, but it's interesting to see the contrast.That sounds so great. I consider myself pretty close to my ENFP cousin too, to the point where I would definitely put her in a top 3 if I had to make one.Hmm, I'd say the gazelle in all the pictures except for the 4th one. I think it mainly has to do with the perspective, on every picture it looks like the man is going straight for the gazelle, safe for the 4th one where it looks like he is running down the path to go for the elephant.

What does this tell you?Living with pretty much actual stereotypes does seem like a struggle, how do you keep up?&gt; Either way I've always done my own thing, and people have come to realize you're gonna have a bad time if you try to stop me.

Like a true ISTP haha.Yeah I can get behind that reasoning, but like I said, I think it's a matter of perspective. 

But how does this tie into race and what does it have to do with discrimination?It is, you naturally adapt to your surroundings after all. If you grow up in a sparcely populated area where you have to be able to detect the slightest of movement to avoid i.e. being bitten by a snake, you'll have a hard time navigating in a busy city where there's movement everywhere.

But you're kind of avoiding my question here, how does this relate to discrimination?&gt; Because it's giving the disadvantage to those who aren't as culturally similar to those who write the test.

You'll have that everywhere. Want to go live in another country? You'll have to learn the language, respect the culture, learn the history, all that kind of stuff. Moving from the town to the city and vice versa is the same. You'll have to adjust to your new life. The city life isn't discriminating you just because you aren't used to the culture, you'll have to adapt. Official IQ tests are usually the same over the whole nation, so if you live in that nation you'll be taking a test that is made by and for that nation and their inhabitants. If you're not used to the culture in that nation, then that's too bad, but you'll have to adjust. That's simply how it works, they aren't going to change the test just for you.

&gt; This is often based on race and income.

What does it matter if a test is made by a white person, black person, asian person or whatever, and what does their income matter? The tests are, again, made for the whole nation. The test maker lives in the same nation as the test taker, is experiencing the same national culture, regardless of their ethnicity and income.&gt; You just admitted that the IQ tests were culturally specific, so... Yeah?

*In one nation*. I mean most people in France aren't going to take an official IQ test from Brazil for example. And even then the differences would be so minimal since every country is so tied-in with the others regarding communication, culture, and economy.

&gt; Also, do you really think that the children growing up in rich, white suburbs are gonna get similar scores to children growing up in poor, black neighbourhoods?

Generally speaking, that should be the case yes. IQ tests measure how good you are at solving problems, not how much knowledge you have. In which ways would the test have a different result from people growing up in poor neighbourhoods to those of people growing up in rich nieghbourhoods?

And stop bringing up race, it has nothing to do with it. IQ tests aren't racist.The INTP is the leader of an ISFP cult I see. :)I never said that.

How many people are in that sample-size? How credible is it? And again, how do IQ tests come to a conclusion that is discriminating? What are the questions that black people supposedly answer poorly?Uhh, I'd probably be fine about it. I get along pretty great with ISFJs.Same, I don't want people to go all comforting by saying "it'll be okay" and things like that. Just let me be grumpy about it for a little while and I'll be okay.I know loads of Ts but I'm lacking female Ts in my friend group haha. I know a chick in my class who I think is an IxTJ though and she seems pretty cool.Summer &gt; Autumn = Winter &gt; SpringI feel like ISFJs would be the killers who would answer to "who's there?" lols.Exactly![Here you go!](http://i.imgur.com/jHf3RVT.jpg)[:D](http://i.imgur.com/Ad0mj1S.jpg)[You bet we can!](http://i.imgur.com/qd6fHQ0.jpg)&gt; since I have no doubt most ENTJs are more than proud of Lord Voldemort

Odd, I've always thought of him as an INFJ.

Hmm admirable ENFP characters. Harley Quinn is often typed as one, I'd say she's pretty badass so I'd take her. Tonks from Harry Potter also gets the ENFP label (sometimes ESFP too though), and I think she's really cool too. Then there's The Mad Hatter who is pretty rad and an ENFP too.Nah we're not *that* edgy.Well I *could* listen but it seems like I already make it to the end anyway.Haha I gotta say I'm guilty of disliking things or people for no good reason too, but most of the time that's a result of people trying to push me to like it.Onision did the test and got ESTJ here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRBvhiVRu58

John Green typed himself as an INFP here: http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com/post/10600049862/hi-what-is-your-mbti-type-im-sure-you-get-this

Those are the only two I know of.I don't know I've thought of being an ESTP but I can relate to both dominant Se and Ne. Someone help haha.Hmm to an extent. I think Ne fits me better than Se anyway, I think it's more wishful thinking than anything because I think ESTPs are pretty rad aha.Meh, Fi is selfish and Fe is fake. There, we said it.Can't have two alphas after all, right?Oh it's so unfair.Yes, it was a joke.I think that depends a little on how well they've developed their tertiary function. ENTPs with good Fe will probably come off as warm and friendly, while ENFPs with good Te will probably appear more straightforward and no-bullshit. The bubbly excitedness of ENFPs definitely gets toned down by Te developing.I know a pair of twins that are ESTP(m) and (probably) ISTJ(f).Hmm I can see INFP for you, and less likely but still possible, ISTJ. Can you identify with either of them?I'm assuming it's for everyone to answer and not just NJ/SPs?

"See in the dark" and "make sense of the incomprehensible" (which is pretty much the same as the former one but in different words tbh.) are things I can relate to.Hmm, politics mainly, but also other things like economics, popular media, things like that if that helps.Isn't INFj the same thing as INFP though? Because OP asked for help with INFJs (Ni&gt;Fe&gt;Ti&gt;Se) rather than INFjs (Fi&gt;Ne&gt;Si&gt;Te).I never said those are the only things I think Se users are interested in. Those are just examples that I'd like to know more about but inherently seem like Se topics to me, unless I'm wrong about that of course.

I already know my shit about other seemingly Se things, I just want to know about these topics specifically. Got any tips?But real world stuff seems important to me to know about haha. I don't want to be the only person in a room that doesn't know about the issues in the world at the moment, the struggle is getting myself interested in it so that the information sticks to me. :PAh, you're welcome. :)L from Death Note is like the anime king of the INTPs.The one that uses asian babiesAh yes, I loved that anime but I think the manga did a better job at telling the whole story tbh.Ew get your American wannabe anime outta here this is a safehaven for weebs.

Also Sokka is ENTP af.You're reading too much into it. Horoscope descriptions are written in such a sneaky way that they will almost certainly apply to the majority of the population. 

For example I'm a Sagittarius (as in, born in December when the Sagittarius constellation was in the sky), and they're often descriped as people who like to explore, philosophise and hold strong opinions. I can relate to 2/3 of those things, but even though the third one doesn't fit me, I'd mainly focus on the things that do fit.

If I look at Cancer (sensitive, sentimental and protecting) I can again see qualities that fit me (sentimental and protecting). And in that way you can find and relate to qualities in every astrological combination of moon signs, sun signs and God knows what kind of other signs.

If 80% of the people can relate to their sign, then the 20% of people that can't relate are going to be less relevant in the general accuracy of it all. That's why astrology seems more credible than it actually is. And the same thing can kinda be said for MBTI, but that at least has a scientific basis.I don't know but I do know that I'm a lady and I never really pay attention to body language unless I really remind myself of it- which also rarely ever happens. I don't pay attention to it and even if I do I can only interpret it by comparing it to things I've read about, rather than naturally reading someone's body language/facial expressions/tone of voice etc. I've been getting better at reading it though so that's nice.

Maybe that has to do with demon Se/inferior Si?Haha you're not the only one on this page that hasn't, the anime part is hidden away really sneaky too.That brings up the questions though, are you born with a preference for certain cognitive functions, or do you get that preference later in life? I'm inclined to think you're born with it because there's not a single xNTP that I know of that's been close to me early in life. It just makes more sense to me that it's at least a little genetic.I'm not an INFP though haha. But that's awesome, I think the results of a questionaire posted a little while ago showed that a lot of people have xNFPs as their best friends. You guys make really great friends it seems haha.Se doms/auxes and even terts/infs tend to pay good attention to body language, at least from what I've seen. My ISFP friend notices all these things that I would never have noticed, like someone mirroring her body language, or changing their tone of voice etc etc. An ESTP friend of mine is the same, he naturally catches someone else's body language and changes his accordingly. Even my INFJ boyfriend seems to at least catch how someone else is trying to portray themselves as a lot better than I do.

Se is like *way* down below in my stack, and while I'm not too familiar with the whole shadow functions theory or socionics in general, I think it kinda means that it's the function I have the least of a grasp on.

And well if it's not demon Se it's probably inferior Si for some reason.Kirito and Asuna aren't a great example of any type tbh because they're pretty one-dimensional characters. Kirito seems to be way more ISTP than INFJ though, it might not have been written very consistently but one of his original character traits was that he was a socially awkward lone wolf type, which seems very inferior Fe to me. He is also very tuned in to his environment, something that none of the INFJs I know are able to keep up the whole time. Asuna might be Te&gt;Fi.&gt; ENTPs who are paranoid beyond belief

I heard my name?Oh god please don't bring this discussion up *again*. We've had our fair share of E vs I for the next few weeks.&gt;Accuracy: 100%. The internet knows me better than I know myself!

Lol I guess the intentional vague writing that can basically be applied to everyone did its job.

Edit: Now that I read further that seems to be the entire point. Lol nvm me I'll go be somewhere else now.I just hang out with dudes instead, makes everything a lot easier. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯I mean I can see why it's generally socially unacceptable but it's odd that being just friends with someone of the opposite gender is still such a taboo at this point in time. Oh well, I'd say don't let it get to you too much and just keep on doing what feels right.Nah I love being a healer class from time to time, as long as I can also deal (long range) damage.Shit you're right, I should also delete this and all the other messages in case someone reads it and decides to go look for the thing I did that I'm trying to cover up the tracks of. If anyone asks, we never had this conversation.Trust me, there are many more factors that make the show pretty bad haha. Oh well, at least it's still pretty to watch.Eh, I think the reason why he doesn't seem much like other ISTPs like Guts is because Kirito is a very shallow character. But what is left of his personality and character in general really strikes me as Ti&gt;Se rather than Si&gt;Te. Kirito is very tuned in to his environment in an objective manner, he lives in the moment and the near future (Se/Ni) rather than in the past, present and future all at once (Ne/Si). He has no problem understanding the underlying system of the game and all of its branches (Ti), and spends the majority of his time thinking over and making internal decisions (Ti) rather than external ones (Te). Think ~~Katniss Everdeen (from the movies)~~ Lara Croft (ISTP) vs Batman (ISTJ).

And I might give it a shot, although I'm pretty big on art style tbh. If it doesn't look right I just can't bring myself to watch all of it haha. But I'll definitely try it out. :)You're confusing INFp for INFP and INFj for INFJ.

INFp = INFJ (Ni&gt;Fe&gt;Ti&gt;Se)

INFj = INFP (Fi&gt;Ne&gt;Si&gt;Te)I think that 99% of the time that you see an ENTP claiming how they're the best type, they're trolling.

Source: am ENTPWell extraversion and introversion are more like a spectrum rather than just two definite ends. E vs I in MBTI really just means whether your dominant function is focussed externally or internally, and while it does have some correlation to social extra/introversion, it's not a fool proof system. There are some very socially extraverted INTPs and socially introverted ESFPs out there for example. Ambiversion also exists, where you find yourself more on the middle of extra and introversion.You think so? The girl kinda gave me ISTP vibes. Then again I didn't watch all of it so I could be wrong.I've been told that in the books she is an ISTJ, and in the movies she is much more ISTP.This made me laugh. :') According to my friends I'm more the STP one thoAlright, then cross out Katniss and think Lara Croft vs Batman.Why does meat taste so good when it's so bad. :'(All I'm trying to do is sketch an image of a popular media ISTP and that of a popular media ISTJ to get my point that Kirito is an ISTP rather than an ISTJ across. I'm not trying to compare Katniss to Lara or Batman to Katniss individually. You're missing the entire point.Nah, visual arts tends to be more of an xSFP thing, Se+Fi is pretty much made for it. You'll find lots of musicians and visual artists being xSFP, while authors/writers tend to be xNFPs from what I've seen.I haven't read the books myself and it's been too long since I've seen the movies. I saw someone else say it and people seemed to agree with them so I parroted.Are we arguing?Hahaha too bad I'm not a big fan of fries. But I do try to eat less pork and beef and more fish and chicken in place, I like the taste of those two better regardless in most cases haha. It's a little difficult now because I still live with my parents and they decide what we eat, but once I move out I'll definitely eat less mammals.ExTP is my guess.Man this can all be avoided with good communication from the beginning on. But this was a good read, thanks for writing it haha.

Edit: Also I'm pretty sure this happened with me with my ENTJ ex and I was the NF. vv"It's interesting, I generally speaking romantically prefer FJs, but NTs/NFPs make the best friends imo.&gt; Type has nothing to do with it other than **some types might be a bit predisposed to being interested in arts while others not so much**

This is exactly why most visual artists/musicians tend to be xSFPs while most writers tend to be xNFPs. Pe+Fi simply naturally has more of an interest in the subjects. xSFPs and music/art go well together because they can put their heart, soul and their entire identity (Fi) into the piece that they're creating while having a good eye or ear for colour and melody respectively. Their interest in music and art likely comes from Se+Fi naturally trying to identify the message that the creator was trying to bring forward in their piece. For xNFPs and writing it's pretty much the same.

I don't know for certain though, I'm kinda just trying to explain what I've observed.Oh no I definitely think anyone regardless of their type can be good at anything. I mean I enjoy writing fiction which doesn't seem like a typical ENTP thing to do. I mostly meant to say that certain types are more drawn to certain things. If xSFPs were naturally just better at music for example then most likely the *only* types that would make it big in music would be the xSFPs, which is simply not the case. But yeah I understand what you mean with it. :)Yeah exactly, that was probably what killed things with my ex. I wasn't really open about *anything*, but now that I know the importance of good communication I make sure to make use of it.Never hated anyone, go me! HahahaI do that because nearly all my opinions about anything are on some sort of grey area. I can see good points in nearly everything which is why I'm so damn indecisive, and when debating/arguing it's like my opinion about the subject keeps being thrown all over the place.Huh that's interesting, pretty much the same thing happens to me. I guess the main difference is that it isn't really a gut feeling for me, but rather dissecting any piece of information that stands out to me.

For example, a friend of mine (A) had a crush on another friend/aquaintance that we met a couple of weeks prior, and she eventually started dating her. I didn't think it would work out for a few reasons.

1. A week before A and B started dating, B had told us about how she had this huge crush on a girl from her school, and how this could never become something because that girl wasn't gay. B seemed visibly upset when she was talking about it.

2. A just got out of a pretty toxic relationship with a guy and she told me several times that she was lonely.

3. A only just came out as bi and had never dated a girl before.

To me it seemed like A threw herself onto the first girl that came along that she had a chance with, trying to fill up the loneliness she felt after her breakup. I think she mistook platonic chemistry for romantic chemistry, and acted out on those perceived romantic feelings. Whereas for B, I think that she was upset that the girl she was interested in would most likely never like her back that way, and perhaps she was afraid that she would never get over those feelings. Then along comes a pretty rad girl that actually has feelings for her, so I think B also threw herself onto the first girl that she had a chance with. The relationship lasted a couple of weeks I think.

Thoughts on this?Not exactly, a little while ago there was a post asking whether there is a correlation between being gay and being a certain type as a man or woman, and someone else replied with this interesting chart: http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/myers-briggs-and-jungian-cognitive-functions/73348-type-lesbian-gay-bisexual.html

Who's to say that there isn't a correlation between being trans and being a certain type as well?Good god to be honest I don't think I want to have this awesome piece of information while not being able to share it.I don't think Se is necessarily all about experiencing things and being proactive; there are some very lazy SPs out there too. My ISTP brother for example spends near enough his entire day playing games on his laptop. No extreme hiking or endlessly changing parts on his car-- er, I mean bicycle.

I think it's mainly about observing and percieving the physical world around you as it is.

Similarly, Si really isn't about doing the same things multiple times or being a predictable person, it's more about percieving and dissecting information and giving it all a place based on their value inside your mind, while Se takes things at face value. Si is much more subjective than Se.

I hope that helps. :)&gt; although I can't help but feel this thread has an ulterior motive or so use of Ni would have me believe

Ni is wonderful haha. Yeah, I'm very unsure myself, I think I've always been uncertain about my type, whatever I typed as. It might be my enneagram 9w1 having that influence on me, since 9s apparently have the hardest time finding themselves. Ironically though, my enneagram type is something that I *am* certain of haha. Well, until someone tells me it ain't right, that is. :PLol yeah I know, but it's not something I can just put away for a couple of years and come back to later. I'm interested now and I want to know all about it now haha, who knows what else I'll find by the time my functions and whatnot have calmed down a little.Oh I forgot to say, person A is bisexual, but person B is gay.

And I honestly wouldn't know, I'm not that close with B anymore. I vaguely remember the MBTI test being thrown around though and I believe B got INFP, and I'm 99% sure that A is an ISFP.I don't like how you're trying to compare transgenderism, which is [scientifically proven to exist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20032-transsexual-differences-caught-on-brain-scan/) to people who think that they are "meant to be a dog". You're comparing apples to special snowflakes.But wouldn't the test become more and more inaccurate every time you take it? You're starting to memorise the answers and understanding the system of what answer leads to which result. And the more you get into MBTI the more you'll recognise S vs N, I vs E etc. too, or even Fe vs Te or Ni vs Ne.Ah for me it's more the point that I can fill up multiple roles at once. Someone needs healing? I'll be there in a sec-- OH GOD AFTER I KILL THIS MONSTER RIGHT IN FRONT OF MEHave you even clicked the link I provided? It literally proves that there's a difference in the brains of someone who is born a woman but feels a man and the brains of someone who is born a woman and feels a woman. The white mass in the brains of transgender people is *much* closer to that of their perceived gender, than that of the gender they were assigned at birth. That means that transgender men have the brains of a man, rather than that of a woman. And vice versa.

I suggest next time you actually research things before you make baseless claims.Haha. :')17 years and going strong! I'll beat your record in no time. ;)Oh no I get what you mean with the Fe thing being pushed forward in women, I've seen that beingsaid here and there too. I appreciate your answer though. :)Oh haha I thought that was sarcasm. Eh I always kinda feel like I'm trying too hard to be funny but sometimes it works.

Thanks though. :)ENTP - If we're going by type, I enjoy being around other high Ne users the most. Everyone else kinda just seems to get annoyed by me going off track and going from topic to topic etc. Romantically I like FJs the most, they're super caring and have a pretty good influence on me in their Fe ways lol.

Now for actual people instead of letters, I enjoy being around people who can act a little weird around me. Not straight up starting to dance in the middle of the room out of nowhere, or trying to be weird for the sake of being weird. Just that little bit of crazy that they're usually afraid of showing. It makes me feel like they trust me and that they know I won't judge them and it's pretty wonderful. I also like people who aren't sensitive to the max and can take a joke. It's not like I usually intentionally hurt the feelings of everyone around me, but having a thick skin definitely makes things easier for me because it means I don't have to keep my guard up the whole time to not say something that might hurt someone.

I get along with most others though, and honestly I find pretty much all people interesting so I'll probably like you even if you're the biggest asshole on the planet.http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html Here you go, I'm pretty sure it's this one.&gt; I’ve narrowed it down to INTP and ISTP

Funny, those two were exactly the ones I was considering. I'm thinking ISTP rather than INTP, I don't really see a lot in your post that would suggest aux Ne, and you seem to be focussed on new experiences rather than new ideas.No problem man, good luck on typing yourself for this and for your enneagram. :)&gt; Also, transgenderism isn't a word.

It is though. :P https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/transgenderismI've read somewhere a while ago that Ti/Fe induces while Te/Fi deduces. I don't know the accuracy of it though.Actually now that I've looked more into it, most sources [like this one](http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2013/04/why-te-is-inductive-and-ti-is-deductive/) say the opposite. Te is seemingly more inductive, while Ti is more deductive. Maybe I got them swapped around in my memory, or the other thing I read really did say the opposite. Either way, that's what I found.I'll give it a shot:

- Happiness
- Honesty
- Popularity
- Adventure
- Compassion
- Freedom
- Knowledge
- Humour
- Creativity
- Solitude
- Power
- Justice
- Faith
- WealthThis whole subreddit definitely would bother. We get several "type me" posts everyday so one extra wouldn't hurt anyone. I don't have a link for you right here and now, but I suggest going through some others' type me's and copying the questionaire they filled in, and after that fill it in for yourself. It might not be the most accurate way to type yourself, but it'll definitely be a push in the right direction. :)

I have to ask though, what makes you doubt ENTP if you can relate to everything about it?Dunno man, I don't know any INTPs irl so all I got is how my mind interprets the text.Never done this before but- INFJ?Dating an amazing INFJ now, but if I wasn't I'd definitely be open for dating one of ours. :PIt was more a wild guess than anything, but I think especially the use of colours seems kinda Ni&gt;Se to me, it's really "out there" but it seems a little quirky in which colour is used where. xNTJ and ENFJ would be my other guesses solely based on this.I think it all really depends on how you interpret the values. Some people might think creativity is about actually creating things, while others see it more as thinking about things in a unique way. Power can be seen as actual physical power, or it can be seen as having internal strength, or even as power in the classic sense of having a lot of power over someone.I gotta admit that's too good.&gt; An Fe who sees a self righteous person who doesn't conform will not be attracted to them no matter how broken.

I don't think that's completely true. I feel like Fe doms/auxes would try to figure out *why* the individual is how he is and will try to "fix" him in a sorta therapeutic way. I guess it's the Ti that wants to figure out exactly he came to be this way and the Fe wants to make it "right" again. High Fe users could get attracted to self-righteous non-conforming people in that way.Ayyy :DBut don't you think the preference for a certain function/combination of functions could change over time? The preference must have come from something, I doubt it's completely genetic.We had this in class a little while ago so what I remember from it might be a bit rusty, but the first thing I thought of when I heard it was Fi vs Fe. Of course that's very generalised and probably just wrong, but I do think it uses the basis of those ideas in a way.

I consider myself a little more a collectivist because the entire idea of unity is something that makes me feel pretty good about everything, and I simply relate more to the aspects of collectivism than those of individualism. That said, since I grew up in a very individualistic country like most of us probably have, it did shape me into having more individualistic norms and values. I think the best thing is to have a little bit of both, and I think the country where I live does that pretty well.&gt; if any other FJ-FJ pairs can relate...

Woop, that's my forte. I can kinda relate to it with my INFJ boyfriend, I feel like the communication between us kind of gets the worst of it. I want him to give me "feedback" in a way so I know what to watch out with and what to improve in myself so I can be the best I can to make him (and frankly myself too) happy, while he told me he can't do that because it'd make him feel so bad for saying it. I'm sure it'll work out better eventually the longer we'll be together but it's just a little thing I gotta pay attention to now. :PWell most of it all was the feeling that ENTP wasn't right. It was kind of eating me up from inside a little in a way, even though that makes it sound way more dramatic than it is. :P

I found that I relate to dominant Si much more than dominant Ne after looking at some good sources, rather than the "Si is memory" crap. [This](http://www.typeinmind.com/sife/) description especially was a bit of an eye-opener. I realised that I've pretty much always related things to past experiences/sensations/things rather than improvising and going with a completely new approach just for the sake of novelty. Even when I'm doing what I thought was improvising I'm still kinda planning it all out from the beginning on, and I guess what made me not realise it was because I was so focussed on the idea of being an ENTP that it kinda clouded my vision and gave me a lot of bias. I still relate to Ti/Fe but the order has always been a little unclear to me, but the way the site I mentioned above explains it really applies to me.

What really also never made me consider ISFJ before is probably the stereotypes and of course the infamous S (but kind of also F) bias. I never really related to any of the online descriptions, but now that I know about the functions a bit better it all slowly starts making sense. Everyone is different of course, and I don't think there's such a thing as a "typical ISFJ/ENTP/INFP/etc" anyway. :P

Either way, I think this fits me and I'm feeling pretty good about it now. :)

Edit: Forgot to add even though I meant to, I recognise a lot of inferior Ne in me now. Jumping to conclusions and imagining the worst-case-scenarios, and it also makes sense in how I never really felt like I used Ne subconsciously, even though that's apparently how your dominant function manifests itself in most cases. Using Si subconsciously as my dominant function makes much more sense to me in that way, and now that I've realised that I can use it to stop those apparent Ne attacks lol.Haha I guess I'm not that invisible after all.

I changed it yesterday, and I kinda explained it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5d1art/ive_convinced_myself_that_im_an_entp_but_now_im/da2srk2/)Haha thanks, I think this fits me well now. :)

I get that too sometimes, like a sudden realisation of "my god x is actually an XXXX instead of an XXYY, *it all makes sense now!*" after getting to know them better and reading more about a certain type haha.&gt; I want to be an INTJ but I know im not.

Yup lol.ALARM ALARM WE GOT A RED HERRING ON BOARD

I do think there's a lot of "I want to be X type" going on in this post, even where OP doesn't actually write it down. There's a lot of Fi here too, and I agree with IxFP and most likely ISFP, she actually reminds me a lot of my ISFP friend judging from this post alone. Just the entire style is pretty in-your-face Fi&gt;Se haha.Oh boy, I didn't know it was contagious. D:

Good luck with figuring it out yourself though haha. I'm sure thinking about it all will be beneficial whatever the conclusion might be. :PHaha I give you and him my sincerest apologies. :PYou got a bit of a wrong interpretation of Si. Si definitely isn't synonymous with memory; I'm an Si dom and my memory is nothing better than anyone else's. Si doesn't hold true to traditions for the sake of traditions, Si users create those traditions because they have meaning to them. Some Si users might find christmas traditions very important because the first time they celebrated it, it turned out wonderful with everyone together being all happy, and they want to recreate that feeling by doing it again. Other Si users might not give a shit about christmas, but have this certain song they listen to when they feel down for the same reasons.

Ask yourself *why* you do the things you do, anyone can have a preference for routine after all, what matters is why you have it.~~Develop Si and you'll get it~~The dichotomy isn't exactly designed for individual use iirc. It measures how a certain country functions/is put together. Some countries are more individualistic, while others are more collectivistic. [Here](https://geert-hofstede.com/national-culture.html) is some more information about it. :)

I definitely agree without you though, both are equally necessary to live in a healthy way I suppose.&gt; Then what is the point of identifying oneself as on or the other?

I have no clue, I didn't make the post after all.

&gt; I also find it interesting that people are talking about Fi v Fe on this topic

That was me! I was the people, haha. It's just the first thing that came to mind when I first heard about the terms. Fi and Fe in their core share quite some aspects with individualism and collectivism respectively. Fi is, simply put, pretty much the embodiment of individualism. It's (in a very generalised way) all about authenticity and staying true to oneself, which overlaps a lot with individualism. Fe on the other hand is more about that sense of unity and harmony, which definitely fits the general idea of collectivism I think.Ah cool haha, got all that confusion cleared up now?But say a shift for your preference from Ni&gt;Te to Te&gt;Ni, which doesn't really sound like it would be alien to INTJs. Would you say that'd make you an ENTJ or simply an INTJ with a preference for Te? I know that socionics uses subtypes like INTp-Ni and INTp-Te, so what are your thoughts on that?My best guess is xNTJ, leaning slightly towards INTJ.

I can see pretty strong Te in your post, and you seem to have that little knack of Fi in there as well. You seem pretty future-oriented which leads me more in the direction of Ni/Se than Si/Ne, and I can see Se which shows from your desire to experience everything there is to experience and fear to miss out on that all.

ESTP seems possible too, but I don't think there is all that much evidence of Ti/Fe shown in here.

I slightly feel like you identify most with one of the xNTJs too, judging from your post alone.Probably this:

&gt; (???)Yeah ENTJ definitely seems possible, I gave the slight edge to INTJ because the post gave me the impression that OP's inferior function is Se rather than Fi, which kind of shows from his fear of missing out on the things that he could have been experiencing but hasn't. I could also be misinterpreting that though, I guess only OP would know for sure. :PYeah Fi is really easy to spot, and Ti doms seem pretty easy to find too somehow. Ni and Si are a little more hidden away which makes it pretty hard to decide E vs I in others' posts haha. I mostly just give a guess based on what kind of vibes the post gives off and by comparing it to people I know of the type I'm thinking of.Haha whoops, seems like I'm throwing around confusion everywhere today. Good luck in finding your type though. :)Man it really doesn't go by unnoticed does it? Tomorrow I'll change my type to ESTJ haha.

But in all seriousness, I had my doubts on ENTP for a while, but I've alway been pretty sure of which functions I use, just not on the order. I explained it a little more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5d1art/ive_convinced_myself_that_im_an_entp_but_now_im/da2srk2/). :P

~~Though I gotta say I feels pretty good to see that people noticed that I changed my flair. :)~~Yep, me too. I got my ENFP, ISFP and ESTP friends, my ESFJ mom and classmate, and even my ENTJ ex as those reference points from my memory because honestly those guys are all just walking stereotypes haha.I think that on first impression they might seem pretty similar, but after a while the differences will probably show pretty obviously. Then again I got an online buddy whose type I'm not completely sure of either, as for IxTP, and it's pretty frustrating hahaha. Doesn't help that he's not really around that much anymore either nowadays lol.Hmm I see, that does make sense yeah. Thanks for clearing up some confusion I had on the matter. :pYou'd be watching yourself watching a video of yourself frying eggsYeah I thought of that too. It was only leaning *slightly* towards INTJ, but now that I've looked through it a little more and read your reply as well I think ENTJ sounds about right for OP.Haha I had to show my love for Pokemon somewhere. c;To give some points to collectivism, I think if a society were to be completely individualistic it would be rather impersonal. Collectivism brings that sense of unity to the group, the whole "we stand stronger together" kind of thing. Without the bit of collectivism, those advancements of the individual never would have made it so far as to actually improve or make advancements in the world. Individualism is also a concept that deprives a society of its collectivism, after all.

Those worlds only exist in theory though- and even then it's hard to imagine a purely individualistic or collectivistic world. Every country/group/society has a little bit of both.&gt; I guess I'm constantly changing my body language, the way I talk, and the way I act based on who I'm talking to and my level of connection with them

Oh man I've noticed I do this too a lot, although subconsciously. Is it more of conscious action for you, or do you also do that without realising it at first?Yeah it's called [mirroring]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_(psychology) ), and I suppose everyone does it to an extend. Perhaps some types are more sensitive to it than others? I think my art teacher was an xSFP and she always talked about how sensitive she was to it.[Nope, the USA is *very* individualistic.](https://geert-hofstede.com/united-states.html);)[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory#Dimensions_of_national_cultures) is the wikipedia page.

&gt; "Individualism vs. collectivism (IDV): This index explores the “degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups.” Individualistic societies have loose ties that often only relates an individual to his/her immediate family. They emphasize the “I” versus the “we.” Its counterpart, collectivism, describes a society in which tightly-integrated relationships tie extended families and others into in-groups. These in-groups are laced with undoubted loyalty and support each other when a conflict arises with another in-group."

That's what it's roughly decided on. Patriotism is something that's pretty much irrelevant for collectivism vs individualism, since you can make arguments for it belonging with both sides of the spectrum.Yeah I sent it to some of my friends too and the only one who got a clear answer was my ESTP friend. It's not the best test out there I'd say.Of course, I agree with that too. A society that uses both in a rather equal way (maybe even more individualism than collectivism) would probably be the best in my opinion.&gt; does anyone else have thoughts or experiences on the correlation between mistyping and wanting the stereotypes of that mistype to be true?

I thought I was an ENTP for the longest time mainly because of the stereotypes of both types. I don't fit the ISFJ stereotypes at all honestly, and my *behaviour* will probably look more ENTP than ISFJ. My *functions* however are Si&gt;Fe&gt;Ti&gt;Ne, I'm pretty sure of that now. I think that that's the main reason why I mistyped myself, because most sources all describe how the types behave instead of how their functions perceive and judge information, and how that affects personality. It's not hard to see how I mistyped myself at that point, ENTP's descriptions are much more flattering after all.Fuck this is more difficult than I thought.

- ISTJ: Kyouko Kirigiri (Dangan Ronpa)

- ESTJ: Erza Scarlet (Fairy Tail)

- ISFJ: Diana (Zero Escape)

- ESFJ: Kronk (The Emperor's New Groove)

- ISTP: Selina Kyle, *Catwoman* (Batman Returns)

- ESTP: Sirius Black (Harry Potter) (I know there's a lot of debates going on about his type)

- ISFP: Sayaka Miki (Puella Magi Madoka Magica) (could also be ESFP idk)

- ESFP: Roxy Lalonde (Homestuck)

- INTP: Kyubey (Puella Magi Madoka Magica)

- ENTP: Gregory House (House MD) ~~que ENTP vs INTJ debate~~

- INFP: Natural Harmonia Gropius, *N* (Pokemon)

- ENFP: Nagito Komaeda (Dangan Ronpa)

- INFJ: Iroh (Avatar the Last Airbender) (lots of debates as well)

- ENFJ: Lucy Heartfilia (Fairy Tail)

I might have gotten some of these wrong but I'd love to hear your opinion on them.Perhaps Ni doms see more appeal in Se because it's what makes them feel more grounded, rather than in Si since it'd be practically foreign to them.pls I'm my own :cMost ISFJs are pretty chill imo.So xNFPs get a little bit of both then? I wonder if ENFPs listen more to the music and INFPs to the lyrics in that case. :p

Don't you think Se would pay more attention to the music rather than the lyrics too? I mean I suppose only the SPs can really tell, but it seems to me like it could be that way since Se deals with concrete sensory information.Oh I hadn't thought of maybe a correlation with love language. Well maybe it's only words of affirmation that has an effect on it. Or maybe certain types are more likely to have a certain love language. That gives me an idea for a future post, even though it's probably already been posted before. Oh well.

My highest is physical touch by the way. :PISFJ- Honestly, I like everything as long as it shows that my SO put some thought into it and that it shows that he knows me. Food is always nice haha, but I like something cute like a necklace a lot too. Maybe that's just my age though, but yeah. :)ISFJ: 9/10, got the 6th one wrong haha. The last one was *really* trippy though. I've always been pretty good with spatial awareness so I'm a little upset I got one of them wrong. :PHahaha obviously&gt; It makes it better when you struggle.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Honestly I think the iNtuitive descriptions are more appealing for people of any age, especially in the Judgers because Si often just looks boring, while Ni is this wonderful mystical psychic ability. I think you nailed the reason why with this:

&gt; And also the flattery, sense of rarity and ego boosts the intuitive descriptions grant for someone still figuring themselves out.What is ISFJ paranoia then, inferior Ne? Cause I get paranoid as hell about some things haha.I've always been pretty shit at spelling but I never really misread things (unless I read too fast which tends to happen because I'm a busy woman of course). So I kinda concluded that I don't have dyslexia but am just a little bit worse at spelling than most other people.

&gt; What's more, when typing, I often enough entirely neglect to type some "small" word, which nevertheless is needed for the sentence to conform to normal English usage.

I do this a lot. Forgetting words, letters, sometimes even whole phrases. Makes for an interesting and sometimes embarrassing read when I look back at it.

One of my cousins has dyslexia and I believe her to be an ESFJ. Likewise for my friend who is an INFP. Another cousin of mine has dyscalculia (basically dyslexia but with numbers), but honestly I have no clue about her type. Maybe IxFJ?That took me ages haha. I was looking and testing if every one of them was possible so I got to the last with a feeling of "oh wtf there's two dots, how did I mist that, stupid me".I like having things organised in my own way. Basically as long as I know where everything is, it's all good and there's no need to tidy up. Once things start getting messy and unorganised though I really start feeling the urge to make everything tidy and "organised" again.

&gt; I love organising things and creating systems - files and paperwork must be organised, schedules must be colour-coded, to-do lists must be comprehensive

This is meHaha sometimes the only empty spot in my room is a small path from my bed to the door, it really doesn't help that my room is pretty tiny as well. Right now it's a little better though, everything is just pretty much stacked onto my desk/chair/random moving boxes from months ago. :PHahaha me too, tested consistently INTP and ENTP before I got around to really learning the functions.Ah well end the end it doesn't really matter which label you slam on top of yourself. The main reason I'm happy I found my actual type is because now I can pay better attention to my weaknesses and work on them.Most of all my paranoia regarding relationships. Si picks up the slightest change in how the other person acts and Fe amplifies it times 100. Inf Ne then looks at all the negative possibilities of why this is happening, when most of the time nothing is wrong and the other person was just busy or talking about something else and whatnot. Basically I pretty much lose all sense of logic and become a paranoid needy fuck. I'm working on that.The talking about inefficiency might just be her Fe sharing it to whoever is around to listen- in this case, the internet. I think that has more to do with enneagram than MBTI. I know a couple of ESFJs and this chick certainly fits into that list.I thought multitasking was a mythThat might be the case but I think looking at the functions gives you a better indication of your type than looking at the dichotomies does. Although in a way, that describes me better than the ISFJ dichotomies. I consider myself more of an extrovert (E) rather than an introvert (I), the line between F and T is pretty blurry for me most of the time, I test P rather than J most likely because my dominant function is a Perceiving function (Si), and well, S vs N is 9/10 times biased towards N.

I see what you're getting at, but after digging more into it than before I'm pretty sure my functions are Si&gt;Fe&gt;Ti&gt;Ne, I'm just not a walking stereotype. :PAh I see, I misinterpreted it, sorry.

I agree with you though. :)The human brain [can't do many things at once.](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/you-think-you-can-multitask-think-again.html) You think you're multitasking but it's actually your mind switching back and forth between the tasks you're doing. You can get better at it (the switching), but every time you switch you have to re-adjust to the task at hand. Generally speaking it's less productive than just focussing on one thing at a time in the end, even though it feels more productive.Haha, you're funny. :')~~my lowest one is melancholic in fact, I am a phlegmatic-sanguine being and this is an inaccurate representation of me and/or my type, I'm suing you~~&gt; Really need someone constantly telling them they suck, so they can take that advice and do better.

This is actually kind of true hahaha.I don't really understand the question but dear god I love Hans Zimmer's music.I've heard from some that Elsa from Frozen is an INTJ.Perhaps it's more likely for fellows on the Ne/Si axis to be bipolar (or the other way round, I wouldn't know). I've heard the same correlation being made about autism and the Se/Ni axis. Without any real research it's hard to tell though.I honestly have no clue, I watched the movie way before I got into MBTI, so I'm kinda just saying what I've heard.ISFJ: We make the best housewives.I'm pretty sure 16-personalities allows you to give neutral answers, so why not do that?Househusband. :')I'd guess INFP solely from this. High Fi paired up with high iNtuition, as well as low Te and low Si. Maaaybe ISFP with high Ni (Fi-Ni loop?).:')Well it's a test, and tests can only tell you so much. I consistently get ENTP or INFJ results from function tests even though I'm neither. I think the best way to take the results is looking at which function(s) are a bit on the higher side and use those as a guideline of some sort. Fi+Ne can easily simulate Ni kind of behaviour/thoughts from what I know, I guess your best shot is to just let her read an accurate description of every function and let her pick which two she relates most to, and then narrow it down from there. Good luck. :)Woah don't go insulting Si like that.

All the axes work together, so whatever Ni is doing, Se has an influence on it. Same for Ne and Si. Se/Ni and Ne/Si are what take in the information, Te/Fi and Fe/Ti are what judge it according to internal frames and/or external frames. They all work *together* towards the same goal. They all got an influence on how you view the world, the N functions just give a different spin on it than the S functions (and T and F functions for that matter).Types don't really change over time. Your test results might vary depending on which mood you are, but your actual type will stay the same throughout your entire life.

I suggest you read up a little on the cognitive functions, they're a very helpful tool to understand the types (and ultimately yourself). Here are some descriptions of [ENTJ](http://www.typeinmind.com/teni/) and [ESTJ](http://www.typeinmind.com/tesi/) from a site that I found very helpful in finding my type. And here are some more links from the sidebar that might help you. :) [ENTJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2f9orq/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_entj/) vs [ESTJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2ro2fe/estj_socionics_mbti_descriptions_by_functions/)Not true. Si and Se can just as well predict the future with the aid of a judging function.

I think you got a bit of a misconception that Ni and Ne are all about the future, while Si and Se are about the past and present respectively. This is untrue because first of all, you don't use the functions on their own. Si is always influenced by Ne and same goes for the other functions. Secondly, Ni and Ne always have a great deal to do with the present and the past. Ni for example stores data in the same way Si does, the difference is that Ni puts the information in a place for its abstract value and connections to other pieces of information it already saved somewhere, while Si does the same but puts it in a place based on the sensory value and connections it has to other information.

You can predict what tomorrow will be like using any functions. Si+Je can go "oh hey, it's pretty gloomy today. Every other time that it was gloomy it has rained. It will probably rain too today based on that", and Se+Ji can go "the air feels pretty humid and the sky looks rather dark and gloomy. I think it will rain today", to give some very basic examples.&gt; nooOOOOo PIKACHUS YOU'VE JOINED THE DARK SIDE D:

But at least I get my cookies right?

I can get behind your reasoning haha. I've always seen it more as a joined thing. Like two ends of a spectrum. It's what had me confused about Ne vs Si for so long because they just seemed so similar to me, and they still kinda do. But I understand your explanation and it makes sense, it still seems more likely to me though that they all interact with each other. Granted, I haven't done as much research as most people on here so my idea of it all should probably be taken with a grain of salt. :')Not a lot to go off on, but my guess is IxTJ.

What stresses you out? What happens to you when you're under a lot of stress, and what do you do to relieve it?Can you elaborate?Maybe their name is Desi. :PI'm less shy and more bubbly, I suppose, around the people I like a lot. Normally I put up twenty different shields to protect my fragile self, but once I start really liking you (as friends or otherwise) I'll also trust you enough to show you more of myself, and be less wary of what I say. I'm pretty sure that's just a people thing and not an ISFJ thing, but it's all I can think of honestly.Ah cool cool now I just need your first name and I can start the stalking. :)I don't have a lot with celebrities to be honest, but I'll tell you that my favourite ISFJ (albeit fictional) is [Diana](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/ninehourspersonsdoors/images/e/e3/DianaThumbnailTrans.png/revision/latest?cb=20160404055039) from the Zero Escape games.Yeah I think so too. ExTPs can seem like Feelers because of tert Fe, and I suppose the same happens for ExFPs because of tert Te. Actually, I think it's the same for IxTJs and IxFJs, the line between Thinking and Feeling can be blurry for people with those as their aux/tert functions.I'm an ISFJ dating a wonderful INFJ. I think the main points of conflict are that I can be too clingy and paranoid about small, irrelevant things, and that he doesn't seem as serious about things as I am or I'd want him to be. It's a bit of a rough time because we don't spend as much time with each other as before but I'm sure we'll make it through. :)I find high Fi fairly easy to spot in others, it just has that certain feel to it that just stands out from the other functions. Other than that I agree with your order. Ne might be a little easier to spot than Se for me but other than that it seems about right. And I honestly have no clue how to find Ni. I guess it only shows when you're really close to them, because the only people I've thought that have high Ni are my INFJ boyfriend and my ENTJ ex.Oh bbyI believe I talk pretty fast and I got inferior Ne.~~You Ni folk are weird~~Hmm what about IxFPs though? They typically barely show Te but don't have Ti in their stack either.Ahh you're welcome! Always happy to see people try out things I enjoy. :')FIRST, FIRST!

Let's see what you got haha.

---

A:
17, female and Dutch.

B:
What I remember easily:

-	Music (as in the melody and such)

-	Numbers

-	Faces

-	My dreams

-	Things that I have to do but I’m pretending to not think about :(

-	Nice scents/flavours


What I forget easily:

-	What time it is

-	I ironically can’t remember what other things I can’t remember

C:
Kinds of people I’m comfortable around:

-	People who aren’t afraid to show a little bit of weirdness around me

-	People who smile a lot

-	People who can take a joke


Kinds of people I’m uncomfortable around:

-	People who believe that they’re some kind of Jesus

-	People who don’t think before they say something and hurt people with it

-	People who randomly hug and touch others that they’re not even close to

-	People who are constantly late


Kinds of people that annoy me the most:

-	People who don’t think things through

-	People who make no effort to keep the conversation going

-	People who make jokes at the wrong time

-	People who talk to others when they got their headphones in/on :(


D:
If something’s going on I want to talk about it and make it right, so it’s pretty frustrating when others don’t communicate what they’re thinking/feeling. I honestly think I handle it pretty well now, but before I used to just ignore it until it went away, which didn’t always work out in the end.


E:
I’ll just answer these questions:

-	It depends a little on where you catch me. I don’t really pay a lot of attention to my body language or expressions unless I think of it, so I feel as if I do show a lot of how I’m feeling on the inside. Usually I’m pretty content so it’s likely just a blank expression, but I find it pretty hard to suppress a smile so I guess that easily shows.

-	Really depends. When I’m around quiet people I’ll be quieter myself too, but if I’m in a group of very talky people then I’ll get all excited and join in as well.

-	I’ve been told I talk pretty quietly, but I’ve been trying to work on that (in my attempt to become less shy).

-	I can easily lose track of time when I’m really into something (like reading or drawing), but I do enjoy living by the minute when I think about it. I think I’m pretty involved and engaged with the people around me, and I find it easy to kind of read the general mood around me (which tells me whether I can joke about things or not, whether I gotta put my guard up or not etc. etc.).

-	I think on the outside (and on the inside) I tend to look a little more rational, but I’m not afraid to show my emotions to the people I’m really close with.

-	Most of the time I seem more goofy than serious I think, but I can be serious about things when I have to.

-	I stutter easily when I’m nervous, and I take a little while to get the words that I want to say actually out of my mouth, but when I’m talking out loud when I’m all alone I tend to talk pretty fast. I think it’s just shyness though.

-	Eh, not really, but it happens sometimes when I feel tired.

-	I get pretty excited about things such as thinking about things that I can do with my friends, or an idea for a gift that I can buy/make for the people close to me (I just ordered a present for my boyfriend and I can’t wait until it’s here :D ), and I’ll probably look pretty bubbly and, well, excited because of it. Lots of "oh my god"s are said at those times.

-	Boredom strikes me pretty easily when I suddenly have a lot of spare time, and well, I just try to get rid of that feeling when it hits. I’ll do things that I haven’t done in a while like going outside to cycle, or reading this one book I still haven’t finished. Things like that.

-	Depends on whether I’m nervous or not haha. When I’m not nervous I believe I’m pretty calm, but at other times I move my hands around a lot and I appear pretty tense I think.

-	Easy, although just lying in my bed for a little while longer after I wake up is pretty nice.

-	Yeah, when I feel like I’ve been doing nothing (or well, nothing productive) for too long.

-	I don’t think I can even get myself to do that, I kind of want to be busy doing something at least.


F:
I get behind how something works relatively easily, and I get pretty annoyed to be honest when someone asks me for help, because I’m stuck with a feeling of “I figured it out myself too, why can’t you do that too?”. Oddly enough I do like helping people regardless of that.

And for what I often miss, well I don’t know if it really counts but I’m pretty bad at thinking of things on the spot. I dislike having complete freedom in doing things because I kind of get lost in a blank state. I need at least some kind of guidelines or examples from where on I can think of new things fairly easily.

G:
What energises me:

-	Being around and engaging with people who are also pretty energetic.

-	Creating or getting to the bottom of systems, like thinking of new balanced rules for a game, or making a “new” language with symbols and all that. Thinking of new roles for games that use roles. Things like that.

-	Gossiping :P

-	Having music on in the background

-	Being able to talk about something I’m really interested in with someone.


What makes me feel tired:

-	Doing nothing at all

-	And well that’s honestly the only thing I can think of. ouo"

---

I hope that's enough information haha, thanks for reading through it. :)

Edit: Add "Reddit's formatting" to the list of things I tend to forget. :PWhuut I've never seen myself having high Ni, what makes you think it?nO PLEASE-Dear god, hell would break lose if we were to meet in that case. O.OMe, inf Ne is wonderful like that sometimes.[My results are all pretty close together, damn.](http://i.imgur.com/yjNlaFl.png) It gives me RDI-M, with the cool title of Defender.

I'd say it's an alright description of what I'm like, maybe it goes a little bit overboard with the stubbornness and passion. It also does say that these people don't like the limelight which isn't completely true for me. :')You seem upset, do you want a hug?

I agree with what you said though, especially since Thinking and Feeling are really not the greatest names to give to these aspects, but then again I can't exactly think of a better one myself.Inaccurate for me, I always get ENTP, ENFP and ESTP as my highest results."Here are 6 reasons why you are lucky if you are loved by an INFJ:

1: They're intuitive."

HaI love how Si is a boob. :')Unfortunately I'm a straight lady so they don't do much for me, but sure boobs are pretty rad. B)ESTPs?Tests aren't very accurate in finding your MBTI type, your result can easily change with your mood and depression (or even simply feeling down) can have a big influence on your results. I suggest studying the cognitive functions a little, and perhaps let her read the descriptions and tell you which one or two fit her the most :)Yeah, cognitive extraversion =/= social extraversion. Sure, things tend to overlap here and there, but an E type can easily be a social introvert, while an I type can also be a social extrovert. It's where you get your energy from, being around others or being alone. For example, my type is ISFJ but I consider myself more an extrovert than an introvert (although the line is a little blurry). So yes, you can definitely be an introverted ESTP. :)I'd say anything is fixable, immature people are called immature for a reason. They're supposed to be/will one day be mature people. You can get a long a way by developing your tert and inf functions, which often also happens naturally as you grow older.I explained it a little [here](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5d1art/ive_convinced_myself_that_im_an_entp_but_now_im/da2srk2/). :)

And to go a little deeper into why I thought ENTP for the longest time is for a rather big part because I saw the stereotypes and related to them/wanted to relate to them. Who wouldn't want to be a badass inventor/debater with decent social skills who has millions of great ideas but never does something with them because they're lazy, rather than the perfect housewife who is shy, sensitive, traditional and also probably the same type as your mom/grandma?

There's things that still make me look and feel more ENTP than ISFJ. For example, I think of myself as more extroverted than introverted, I believe I have an alright grasp on Ti, and then there are the stereotypical ENTP things like enjoying debating and playing devil's advocate here and there that I find myself doing as well. Now that I've looked into everything better though I'm certain that dom Si + inf Ne fits me better than dom Ne + inf Si.From what I know, Pe functions get their energy from experiencing the world around them, for Se that being the physical world and for Ne that being the possible world. I don't have Se in my stack so any Se user feel free to interfere with this post, but I think a lot of it just comes from experiencing everything in its purest form. For an introvert I imagine walking through a forest after it just rained and smelling all the wonderful scents the trees give off. Or perhaps playing an instrument without music sheets and just doing what sounds good. Things like that sound to me as if they give Se users a boost. So to answer your question, I don't think being around others is required, no.I'd say do it. c:Stress can throw you back to your inferior function, which is Si in your case. Inferior Si tends to be a little obsessive about details and routines, similarly to your experiences. I think it's more likely that your Si is taking over, rather than you transforming into a Judger (which would probably be relying too much on Ti).

[Here](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/136898571387/how-functions-work-inferior-si-entpenfp) is a helpful little link. :)Can we talk about how fap is probably the least sexy word in existence?I believe /u/tk4442 is a girl haha.

And well, that depends on whether the boobs are yours and the masturbation is coming from your SO. ;)Their sub sure as hell has some depressing content.Only you can really tell for yourself, and the information you've given us isn't exactly a lot to go off on either. [This](http://www.typeinmind.com/feni/) site is what I tend to throw in the face of people questioning their type, since it helped me a lot figuring out mine. I'd say look through some of the descriptions and see what fits you best. Remember though that everyone is different and you don't have to fit a stereotype to a T. :)Hahaha, no I meant the thought of them doing the do to themselves. Either way that's far enough into this topic for now, I don't think my SJ-ness can handle much more. :')Let's see

&gt; Do you stand near walls or in the center of a room?

I don't know, I never pay attention to that, sorry.

&gt; Do you daydream or not?

Of course, I'm pretty sure everyone does to some extend though.

&gt; Do you have more than 3 friends?

Yes.

&gt; Do you like puzzles?

Yes.

&gt; Do you describe how music sounds or how it makes you feel?

How it sounds.

&gt; Do you observe what happened or what resulted?

What happened.

&gt; Do you base decisions on your gut or experience?

Experience 9/10 times.

&gt; Should justice be based on law or mercy?

Overall I'd say law.

&gt; Do you base decisions on what will happen or how people will react?

A fair bit of both honestly, but if I can only give one answer I'd say how people will react.

&gt; Are you mostly early? 

As in, early up? If so, sometimes. I get out of bed relatively easy but I do enjoy just lying there.

&gt; Do you have a day planner?

No.

&gt; Are you neat?

I suppose.I think your best bet is to put your type on your profile of a more popular dating site like Tinder and see if people take note of it, and if so respond accordingly.Got one of them right. o3o&gt; SupermanAwesome, have fun lols :PObvious ESFJ ;DYes you already mentioned that, thank you.While the way LaughterisPower phrased it sounds fairly hostile, people who identify as something nonconforming such as non-binary often seem to be high Fi users (xxFP) because they are the types that typically care more and deeper about authenticity and their own values. High Fe users (xxFJ) are more likely to follow the lead of others in that regard.

I'd agree with INFP, if not ISFP since you mentioned having a difficult time explaining abstract concepts. What stands out as especially an xxFP thing to me is your answer to question 4. Your first reaction (even if it was written in a joking way) to conflicting ideas/opinions seems to be taking it more personally than objective ("I thought they were my friend"), which is a pretty Fi thing to do.Idk I think it's pretty chill here.Ooh fun, now I get to share even more about myself with the internet. :')

&gt; What's your MBTI?

ISFJ

&gt; What's your enneagram?

9w1 I believe.

&gt; How did you discover MBTI?

About three years ago a guy from a forum that I'm on posted the test from 16personalities so I took it there. I initially got INFP (just like about 80% of the people there lols) and then left it for about a year. Then later I got into it again when it was discussed with a friendgroup and I did the test again and got typed as an INTP, and that's basically when I got hooked up until now. :')

&gt; What's your parents possible MBTI?

I think my mom is an ESFJ (or possibly ENFJ) and my dad seems like an ESTP.

&gt; What's your best friend's MBTI?

My two closest are ENFP and ESFP. :P

&gt; Which MBTI would you end up dating?

I'm dating an INFJ right now. Before my current boyfriend I was dating an ENTJ, and if I were single and could just pick a type I'd probably like to date an ExFP because they seem like very fun people to date haha.

&gt; What's one thing about you that's different from your MBTI type.

I'm lazy? I think that's something ISFJs don't often get labeled as. I'm also more argumentative than the stereotypical ISFJ (or so I like to think lols).YESNah I think an ESTP wouldn't be so chill with just sticking to the sidelines and observing everything as an outsider like Ryuk did. Dominant Se probably wants to have a more active role in it all rather than just setting off the main event and then watching how it could and will unravel.Interesting, I never really got a good view on Mello's type myself, but I often see him typed as an ST. What makes you think ENFP for him?

And also what's your thought on Rem?&gt; I genuinely saw a picture of the Harry Potter characters' types (you know the one I'm talking about) and looked it up.

I wanted to be the same type as Sirius. :(
Hmm I can get behind that explanation for Mello.

And interesting, I was stuck between the same two types for Rem. It's been a while since I've watched the anime, but I also think INFP would be the better fit for her, since I don't remember anything she did that might indicate Ni.Depends on which part of the internet you are. People often talk about how Facebook for example is more of an SF thing.Barry (DP/Pt) seems fairly ExFP.

N (BW/2), although arguably not a rival, just screams INFP imo.

Cheren (BW/2) is a fairly obvious ExTJ and Bianca (BW/2) seems like some kind of xxFJ to me.Yeah I've noticed that in the more "dead" subs like ISFJ you got a higher chance to get more responses than on the more active ones like INFJ, which is interesting.&gt; she made a few comments that clearly showed she knew more about the topic than most of us did

I'm agnostic. I've called myself an atheist for a little while before but I realised it didn't make much sense to me to not believe in the possibility of there being a god or a higher being or something like that. That's about all I have to say about it though lol.

I have an INFP friend and she's a christian, and always has been as far as I know. I also have an ENFP friend who is agnostic too.Interesting. I've skimmed through it because I was into Homestuck for a long time (and the Classpect system is still extremely entertaining), but I don't think you can completely combine MBTI and Classpects simply because Andrew Hussie has been vague as fuck about the Classpect system. Nobody really knows how it works and it's all up to interpretation, so one can see Hope for example as a very INFP aspect, while someone else can make a claim for it being ESTP in a way.

Either way it's always interesting to read other people's interpretation. I might type out something myself later and post it here and on the Homestuck sub and see what others think.

Also I'm a Mage of Void, what about you?That makes the difference then I suppose. I don't believe in anything, but I won't deny the possibility either. It's fun to think about religion and spirituality though, I love going over the what-ifs regarding that.KinkyNah, my INFJ does it too to the extremes. Now I've caught myself doing it much more too thanks to him.It's you. You are the banana.Of course everyone does it but I think higher Se types tend to pay more attention to it (or maybe not pay attention to it, but notice it), which is how this post happened.Oh bbyThen do explain.No I'm talking about that a high Se user perhaps would notice it sooner in others.Interesting, thanks for the info, although it's an odd thing to name atheism then. Oh well, you didn't make the words either lols.Eh that's not exactly how I meant it. Doesn't matter.I'll give my guesses. ;P

1. ENFJ

2. IxFP

3. IxTJ

4. Hmm either ESTJ or ESFP.ISFJ here, I hang out with all kinds of people but a good lot of them are ExFPs, they make great fun company imo. There are also quite some xSTPs in my social web, and a handful of IxFJs.No I wasn't confused about that. But like I said it doesn't matter, no worries.Or not potato.I don't think it's as much a fact as it is a generalisation. I didn't do much different than when I was a kid besides being moody(er) and needing more food. It really depends on the person, though I doubt that people would rebel against their own functions. Most people don't even know what they are so how could they rebel against them? Besides the functions in your stack are preferences, which means it's easier and more comfortable to use those rather than others.Because all cute quirky nerds are INTPs by default.Hmm

- Motiv type - MCHXVEG

- motiv+ type - McHw|V|eG

- Jung type - ENFP

- Personality disorders - histrionic, narcissistic, schizotypal

- Enneagram - 9

- Carreers - business consultant, business owner, fashion merchandiser&gt; Careers: assassinIt also asks the same questions in like ten different ways.ISFJ: church masses.I don't think you can really give a type to her, uh, character. She seems to be void of all personality besides the randomness and craziness, so it wouldn't be fair to give her a single type.&gt; Is secretly attracted to the opposite of its last 2 functions

Ah shit, that explains why Ni is so wonderful to me. I'm not too phased by Te though.

^^...Okay ^^maybeHmm I'll answer these real quick.

- Yes I have one, yeah I hear it speak, it's kinda always there unless I completely zone out. It usually sounds like my own voice (or at least how I hear it), but sometimes it gets higher/lower/faster/etc. depending on what I'm reading when I'm reading something.

- Pretty much everything is conscious, I frequently remind myself of my breathing and blinking and things like that. And what isn't conscious, well, I don't really know because I'm not consciously experiencing them. My thought process is pretty comprehensive though, I can easily trace back all the steps to how I came to a certain thought/sound/image.

- In the same way as I daydream. I vaguely see it in front of me. It's like I can see everything clearly, but not enough to zoom in to everything. I can also recall particular scents and flavours pretty easily, and as far as I know I've been able to that since I was pretty young (I remember lying in bed once when I was ~6 and I was thirsty so I started thinking of a glass of lemonade and I could "taste" the flavour in my mouth). Sounds usually appear as a random thing someone has said to me some time, or a line from a movie, or a melody of a song. Very frustrating because I usually can't remember where it's from until it suddenly hits me days later. Right now I remember a man saying "I just remembered, today is my birthday" but I can't for the life of me figure out where I heard that before.

Edit: I just looked the quote up and it's from The Great Gatsby, my god this is so satisfying to know. :')Smell apparently is the easiest sense to trigger memories because the path that smells make in your brain in order for you to smell them goes through the hippocampus, where things with memory happen. I guess I learnt to do it the other way round too haha.Very little to go off on but my best guess would be IxTP, leaning more towards ISTP.Pansexuality is only different from bisexuality to individuals who believe that there are more than two genders, any other person would just call it a fancy new name for bisexuality.[This one right here is hands down my favourite](http://www.typeinmind.com/sife/). It's what helped me the most in realising that I'm an ISFJ and not something else.(Excuse me for any mistakes, English is not my first language and I'm also typing this on the tiny screen of my phone)

Hello lovely people of the MBTI community. I know how much you all love typing others and because I've been questioning my own type for a while, I thought I might as well get some help from the real pro's.

Let me just start by saying that I got interested in MBTI about a year and a half ago, and for the most part I've thought I was an INTP because the test told me that and I thought it was pretty accurate. Then since about half a year ago I realised that I'm actually more of an extrovert than an introvert so naturally I exchanged the I for an E. 

That was all before I learnt about the functions. I mean I knew about them before, but now that I actually know a little about what they mean, I've been doubting myself. I'm pretty sure my judging functions are Ti&gt;Fe (unless they're very obviously not and I'm wrong, if so please tell me), but I'm not too sure about Ne vs Se. They overlap a lot from what I can imagine and for some reason I just can't seem to tell which one I'm using. Same goes for Ni vs Si. And that's not even getting started about the order.

Now, I realise typing someone from just a bit (or more than a bit cause this is already turning out longer than expected) of text, but every bit of input is really appreciated. Guess I should tell y'all a bit about myself then.

---

- Like I said before, I think I'm more an extrovert than an introvert. The longer I spend with people around me the more energetic I get (though it also depends a little on what they are to me and what their energy is like etc etc). Despite that I also love being alone for some time, though if I spend too much time alone I get all lazy and my energy usually just drops until I'm around people again, even if I don't realise that at that point.

- I love theoretical things a lot and I'm usually up pretty late to just read random stuff about random topics (my current obsession is media psychology/philosophy (alongside MBTI of course lol)). But as much as I love the theory I really do need to see the use of it. I want to be able to apply it somehow, put it to good use even if it's only for the idea of being able to do so.

- To expand a little on that I understand things best if you give me an example of how it works in practice. From then on I can go back to that example and compare it to new situations (Si?).

- I really dislike small talk unless it's the first or maybe second time we meet. It's a really useful way to gain a lot of information about the other person but after we've done that I really want to get on to the juicy stuff, like /why/ you like the things you like, and not just the fact /that/ you like them.

- I'm not extremely good at noticing and remembering details, except if we're talking numbers. For some reason the fact that I missed the bus I wanted to take at 8:21 last Tuesday so I had to take the bus that came at 8:37 instead to make it in time for my class in room 7.32 at 9:15 really sticks to me. I can also remember my phone number I had years ago and the ones from a few of my friends.

- Speaking of remembering things, I can remember my dreams really well for long times. I mean, that's when I can remember them. Usually I forget almost all of it a few minutes after I wake up, but if it really sticks to me I remember it for years. Like this dream I had about Danny Phantom when I was about 7 years old, it was great.

- My favourite movie genre is horror, probably because I love the feeling I get from a good scare. The adrenaline and everything is just so great.

- I did an enneagram test a while back and got 7w6, but I think that might have a little to do with that I had just started labeling myself as an ENTP back then. Took another one just yet and it gave me 5w6, or more specifically, 9&gt;5&gt;7&gt;3&gt;6&gt;8&gt;1 (I guess it didn't even bother telling me about 2 and 4 lol).

- I tend to give long answers to short questions. Like if someone asks me what my favourite movie is I say what it is and why it is that.

Speaking of questions, honestly I'm better at answering specific questions than coming up with a list of things that should be relevant myself, so please, ask away if you need more info. :p

Thanks in advance!

Sincerely, an xxTP (I think).What are the types of popular youtubers? (Or less popular ones if you will)

I got a few that I think are correct, though I'd love to hear your perspective on it.

- Pewdiepie: ENTP

- Markiplier: INTP

- JacksFilms: ENTP

- Onision: ESTJ (who actually took the test on 16-Personalities and got ESTJ)

Anyone else?Twenty-Pikachus here, asking the important questions. As a side question, which Pokemon do you think fits your type?

Despite my name, Pikachu isn't my favourite. I mean they're rad and all, but not my number one. I don't think I even have a number one, but the first one I thought of was Leafeon. And after that Volbeat.

For an ENTP, I think Zorua or Zoroark would be well fitting. They got the ability to create detailed and believable illusions and something about that just seems really Ne-Ti to me. They're also quite the tricksters which seems pretty ENTP too haha.Hey all, I got a question. So my boyfriend is not all that into MBTI, which is okay, but it also leaves me a little unsure of his type and I'd just love to know. He first typed as an INFP after he took the test on 16 personalities once, but from what I've seen he is definitely on the Fe/Ti axis, and most likely also on the Ni/Se axis. So the first thing I then thought of was INFJ, but I've been playing with the possibility of ISTP too. I know that statistically ISTP is just more likely, but hey, I'm an ENTP lady myself which isn't exactly the most likely outcome either. So if you would be so kind to tell me some key differences? The reason I'm so stuck with this is because I never seem to see whether he uses Fe more or Ti more.At this point I'm fairly sure I'm an ENTP, I mean kinda (sometimes I think I might be an ESTP or even ISFJ) but regardless, that's not the point of this post. Or well it might have to do with it. You see, I took a bunch of enneagram tests over the last two years, and I just took one again, and my highest result is consistently 9. After that I always get the 5, 7, 1, 3 and 6s, which 8/10 times puts me as a 9w1 (and the other 2 times give me 5w6 and 7w6). But now that I've looked around a bit, ENTPs typically seem to never be 9w1s, or even 9s in general. Basically what I'm asking is, is this even possible? Or is one of the two likely wrong? I can relate a lot to type 9, a bit less to 1 but I can still see myself as that in the sense that I'm pretty perfectionistic and ambitious (although too lazy to actually work to get somewhere). Incidentally, are there any others of you out there with an unusual combination?I don't know if this is an Fe thing or just a people thing but hey, you never know. So when I talk to someone and they say something funny/nice/heartwarming I tend raise my hand to cover my mouth when I smile or laugh. I've noticed that my also Fe-using boyfriend does this too. So I wonder, DAE do that?Hi. So I enjoy writing, and what I like most about doing that is creating the characters, which is why I want to give it a shot using my limited but probably still usable MBTI knowledge. The main idea is basically to have the protagonist who is an ISFJ to be pretty much surrounded by iNtuitives, and then see where I go from there.

Basically, I need some tips to write using the functions. My own writing probably naturally shows Ne and Ti so I won't have too much trouble with that, but how would I go about writing while keeping the other functions on the foreground? *And how do I create a realistic character of every type?* All input is welcome, thanks. :)
I'm obsessed with it too, but I have a pretty strong intj shadow. My take would be:

*Clergy*

* **INTJ** high position because they love to scheme remotely
* **ISFJ** because they want to protect
* **ESTJ** because they want to supervise and order people around
* **INFP** because they want to heal people

*Merchants*

* **ENTP** Because they are visionary entrepreneurs
* **ISFP** Because they create beautiful stuff
* **ISTP** Because they craft things
* **INFJ** Because they like to advise people on what to do

*Laborers*

* **INTP** Because they like to architecting big things
* **ESFJ** Because they want to give to people what they 
need
* **ISTJ** Because they like a job well done
* **ENFJ** Because they want to teach others what to do

*Nobility*

* **ENTJ** Because they think that they have to lead
* **ESFP** Because they're crazy
* **ESTP** Because they want to persuade people of stuff
* **ENFP** Because they want to have fun and set the trends

Edit: formattingThis is just for fun I really don't understand why I'm downvoted :|This post is meant to get feedback and contradictory opinions tho, it's not a statement Father ENTP 
Mother ISTJ

Younger bro ISTPThank you both for being wonderful beingsIf you'd have to classify the most likely types to be clergy, merchants, laborers or nobility ; which type would you put in each category?
INTP or ISTJ

They always have best deadpan expressions.ISFP: hipster, artsy person

INFP: emo, always keeps the pain inside themselves until it blows out like an old nuclear missile.

ISTJ: workworkworkworkworkwork...

ENTP: lazy person that has a curiosity of kindergartener, can talk for hours, has a slightly smaller ego than ENTJ (mostly depends on person)

ENTJ: very big ego, can't accept other people opinions

INTP: just look at the Michael Cera and you'll get it. Also, has a big potential to become an archwizard.

INTJ: "always right" but hardly accepts exceptions, doesn't understand emotions.

INFJ: SJW, can be worst kind of bigot. 

ESTJ: Tumblr fag/feminist

ENFJ: one of those fuckers that feels like a unique snowflakes, can talk for hours and won't shut up.

ESTP: jock, adrenaline junkie.

ISTP: adrenaline junkie, silent version of ESTP (basically unpredictable).

ESFJ: in a nutshell: your mom.

ISFJ: dull person that hardly accepts changes, can be used as a doormat.

ESFP: go to the strip club and you'll meet a lot of them.

ENFP: treat them like ISTJs and you'll make them cry.Do you often feel necessity or addiction to music, just to chill out or go on a feel trip?I was thinking about but that but later changed my mind. I think he probably has a good Ne, which he uses to create music. He doesn't stick to one music genre- he involves features from other genres, he experiments.The ones with Ne and Si helped me out to get Diamond II

Full CRIT Jax rules!Mine is a little bit heavy too. After finishing school everything right now feels like a big RPG world where you finish the tutorial and then ask yourself - "Now what?". Before that it was a wild run full of depression and all other kind of feels. It made me deeply scarred. I even had suicidal thoughts.

In a nutshell:

In the old school I was heavilly bullied for whatever I do. For those douchebags I was like a walking punchbag/puppet. I was gullible, they used me however they wanted to and manipulated by using my personal problems. Biggest one is family problems, it's kinda sad to tell. Mom has heavy schizophrenia (she have it since her childhood), so she did lots of awful things. Because of her I almost got no friends and have hate/phobia for females, which is the reason why I avoid females, got addiction to video games and became lazy, dad fucked up his career + we had lots of debts (for few years). After 9 years of suffering I went to new school but I hardly adapted there because I had old scars and lots of problems (I even now didn't told anyone about most things and nobody knows me in the school). I was hardly introverted until 11th grade (I was INFP probably). Then tried to relieve all the pain I had and be more social, otherwise I'll become like my mother. Since then I try to focus more on logic than emotions. It's pretty difficult to change but I'm making a progress.Thank you. Jax is so broken that you can play as almost anything.I got really bored and wanted to know more about myself and my behavior. Wanted to know my common mistakes, so I as a result I analysed principles of functions and how they work. As a result I discovered that I'm flaky, lazy and emotional ENTP.You mostly look very grumpy and stubborn. Sometimes you are like unicorns... dark ones...

But in the end you are pretty cool, despite the fact that you can be very awkward in social interactions.Father - was ENTJ before, now is ISTJ

Mother - ESFJ with corrupted functions

Sister - EXFXFrankie Boyle, Jim Jefferies, Steven Wright, sometimes Jimmy Carr.

"My theory of evolution is that Darwin was adopted."ISFP. He got a well developed Se.Q) I like to talk but people seems to be boring and hate me. What's wrong with that? A) Well, you're sort of a cunt...so, ENTP

Q) I feel like I'm INTJ, I like to judge others and have ingenious ideas but I'm just too lazy for everything. A) INTP

Q) Stop talking to me, I got business to do. A) ISTJ workbot. Well, fuck you too.

Q) I like being in company and doing weird stuff sometimes. A) ENFP weirdo. Now for Pete's sake, go away from me with your horrible stench.

Q) Why everyone is so mean to me? A) Cry more. INFP emo&gt;ENTPs are usually very open about their emotions and most ENTPs I've met wear they're hearts on their sleeves. They really are just sweet nerdy dorks who can occasionally get caught up in rational thought,but most are in touch with Fe.

True. In fact, ENTPs can very emotional or easily get depressed when something unexpected happens because ENTPs usually have pretty high expectations. This shit happens to me way too often.Get back to work.Just like finishing school and being an adult.PewDiePie - ENTP/ENFP

jacksfilms - ENTP, that's for sure (he's a troll)

FilthyFrank - ESFP (messy look and manners, low brow and toilet humor)

TotalBiscuit - ENTJ

LinusTechTips - ENFP

Markiplier - INFP?

Vsauce baldie - ENTP

ThatZak - INTP

AngryJoe - ESFJ

Cry - he's a tough case. INTP or INFP?xSTJ types and ENTJs mostly. Break a few rules and they will give you a long moral about how important rules are and how breaking can affect working process.

Ironically, ENTPs and INTJs are the ones that breaks them mostly but also can be the ones that sets them and stays strict.That sounds ironic but it's true as well.What's wrong with being drunk? People looks nicer, life is beautiful, you sing like pro and play air guitar like Jimi HendrixENTJ alpha af mom, ISFJ beta dad, INTJ socially wrecked son, and ESTJ daughter. Best combo ever.I was least likeable and trustable person in school, nobody cared what I'm doing and what I'm saying, literally. Everyone just imagined me as a cheap material or their stepping stone for better life. Back in those days I was hardly adaptable with almost no friends, always scared to talk, very emotional, scolded by others for being late, not doing homework, and reckless wild card behavior. Always was always underrestimated by others. I had no self-esteem, had low grades, not to mention my both parents are assholes. Because of my parents I didn't achieved anything and was addicted to video games but then quit for a while because I had too much suicidal/nihilistic thoughts. Never had a girlfriend and didn't cared about that, despite the fact that ~65% of people in my school were females.
I was fitting to "total loser, smart with unused talents, no friends and future" person role.

9th class: One or 2 friends, everyone wants me dead, broke leg, got low self-esteem, only used as cheap-ass stepping stone by others. 

10th class: New school, very emotional, no friends, very lazy, no passion, nobody likes me, tryharding to do something  but failing.

11th class: Same as 10th class.

12th class: Not very carring, still socially awkward, with some sociopathic thoughts, one old friend from old school, some other people, we just dropped our relationship to the trash because it was too hard for us all.Johan - INTJ but could be INFJ (his Ni is screaming and he's mentally unstable)

Kenzo - xxFJ?

Eva - ESTJ

Grimmer - ENFP

My favorite one: Lunge - IxTJ (I'm still not sure if he's INTJ or ISTJ- he has very good memory, can remember details very well, has a monstrous look and lack of emotions, weird muscle memory (hands sometimes imagines that he is still typing), also is workaholic, which is why his wife and daughter left him at the start of the series)

This feels like a good idea but most of us in real life would just call cops and tell them the truth.ENTP: "What can go wrong?" or "Fuck it, I'm going to prove them wrong."When I'm high or drunk sometimes I feel anger, sometimes happiness, but mostly I become very sad version of INFP - I just go to cry somewhere.ENTP. I wish I was less grumpy and nihilistic INTJ.Scatter-brained, ADD often kicks in.

Unorganized sometimes.

Can't make decisions properly.I sometimes live inside my mind. Motherfucking Death Knight and Warrior. 

Charging straight to the boss with rocket boots and yelling "LEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRROY JENKINS!!" , while others thinks "Oh God, not him again...", and then bringing the heat. Also, I'd enjoy leaving villages with plagues for salvation or having very big brotherhood-like group.You know love is just shameful product of hormones in our bodies and we're just junkies? The more we get, the less we use our sane mind.ISTPs can be worst psychologists and can't support you emotionally, e.g.when my classmate started mourning my friend told her "Stop whining or I'll give you a something to whine about"As we know:

*He tends to be reeaaaally cocky and very sarcastic sometimes (we can see that in some of his songs and interviews).

*He claims that he is introverted and shy.

*He is perfectionist, when it comes to creation of music (e.g. he created lots of versions of "Switchback" back in early 2000s), also he characterizes himself as "jack of all trades, master of none' when it comes to musical instruments.*feel (sorry for grammar)I'm curious how would you type the members of Funhaus.
Give him a camera. A good one. And a list of any and all endangered things in the areaThey're very backwards about it. Enfps are always exerting effort actively, so they have momentum. Just gotta point them at something unattainable and they'll start moving in that direction naturally until it is actually attainable Another good one is to check if there are any wma/hema clubs in the area, or any tunnels, or wild bands of gym Bros Hello, I am an extruvertThis isn't the brain surgery I wanted to see If you try to look inside the mind of an enfp they commit seppuku as a defense mechanism.Intps, commit sudoku. It's the easiest way to trap themIt wasn't a joke I was honestly expecting brain surgery or scans.

I've been mislead and I'm very crossI feel robbedFor the record, we usually earned that. ENTPs that I know are almost always pariah as children. If *anyone* laughs at my jokes, I know I've won. I did it. I succeeded at making someone tolerate me. This is so much better now that everyone laughs at my jokes.

The reason might be small to you but it's precious to us. 

GENDER DOES NOT INHIBIT THE ENTP. THESE CHAINS ARE BUT ANOTHER THING WITH WHICH WE WILL WREAK CHAOS.

ITALIAN IS THE FIRST OF MANY, MR. TORTOISE

Edit: along with others, but really what's important here is that Mr. Tortoise in italian is an uncomfortable compromise, because Tortoise is feminine, Tortue. 

This joke is actually a reference to the preface of Douglas Hoffstatder's "Godel Escher Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid," Which is the most ENTP book that I have ever read. Ever. Sadly at that point, the kid has just challenged me, and we must see that to the endENTP, Went Valor so I could be on the same team as my ENFP brother We are the best starters, any spark can take hold, any idea can become a potential reality. It just takes other people to put properly prepped fuel on our fiery ambitionLike an ENTP without someone to pick up their shit when they forget where they laid it, Pride ought be coupled with prudence, lest it goeth before the fall[ENTP.](http://oddlydevelopedtypes.com/content/lost-translation) It's entirely possible that small differences in diet, developemental period cultural effects, and even media could cause what is a very real disorder. :/ I had it quite obviously when I was born.Meditation has worked the most for me, but can't seem to stop the distractionsI had to get off the ENTP facebook. Don't get me wrong, I loved being there because everyone on there only has social power if they don't try to exercise it. The levels of Salt reminded me of my gran's cooking and the [ragequits](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/070/061/d96.jpg), so good. But There was *too much discussion*. Valid discussion too. Almost always over the ethics of any given action or topicFEELER WARNING. THIS IS NOT A FUN THING TO READ. Except for the ENFPs, I can't tell you what to do. NO ONE IS A GOOD PERSON.Gene wilder Wonka as ENFP makes sense, Original wonka was pretty ENTP.&gt;"He" isn't a realistic representation of an *average* ENTP

That said, halfway through writing this, two things occurred to me. The first is that I have been forgetting to use the significantly more efficient þ that I have installed on my keyboard for þe TH sound. Þis feels much better and faster to type wiþ if I remember to use it.


Þe second is more of a question, could I boþer you to do [þis test?](http://aspergerstest.net/aq-test/)

Because I'm an ENTP, Ne is my main function, and you're describing problems þat I have. Þey're not intuitive problems, þey're people problems.

Livid historians foaming at the mouth trying to pronounce the word *Context* through their unfathomable Rage aside, Let's give it a shot.

NTs

ENTJ: Roman Legionnaires: Smooth, Efficient, Well trained, Well ordered. Capable of admitting faults, capable of making new strategies


INTJ: Zacateca Warriors: Similarly Efficient, terrifyingly accurate, wiped out by the spanish for not changing their beliefs 

INTP: Korean army during the Japanese Raids: Built a rack that could fire over a hundred arrows at once so they wouldn't have to actually use bows. Won.

ENTP: Chinese Army Circa 600. Capable of producing long-range missiles, flamethrowers, mass produced weapons, extremely large fleets with advanced communication and navigation methods but not eniterly sure it wants to go see the rest of the world for the next thousand years. Somehow only able to produce b-tier goods. Consistently buggered by Japan.

SJs

ISFJ: Berserkers. Historically not actually associated with people going nuts. Just respected shamanistic warriors. Loners but still pretty chill.

ISTJ: Edo Period Samurai: Calm, cool, collected, going to take your house because you didn't pay your taxes.

ESFJ: Crusaders of the Peasant's Crusade: The whole idea never made sense to begin with but they were doing it for jesus so hey, let's ride some pigs and get slaughtered by the ottoman empire!

ESTJ: Crusaders of the *Baron's Crusade*: Fanatical enough to take antioch even though they were supposed to go help constantinople but hey, king of antioch has a great sound and the whole city was already filled with mostly heathens

SP:

ISTP: Sword-Princes of India: Actually surprisingly chill despite being raised to kill

ISFP: Viking Raiders while not Viking: Really just there to get some new material, trade some fur, scope out some glass beads

ESFP: Miq'Maq Braves: Really really good at fighting but once the europeans show up, they will put on any hat they need to to not end up like the beothuk did, had a pretty good time other than the systemic oppression of the invaders, Still alive and kicking today.

ESTP: Viking Raiders while Viking: Shows up, scares the shit out of people, destroys their culture and takes their illuminated manuscripts, burns their homes, offers peace to paris, TAKES THE BRIBE, then *sacks paris anyway*

NFs

ENFP: Barbarians during the time of the roman expansion, specifically the germanic, gaulish, saxon, and celtic tribes. SOMEHOW MANAGED TO HOLD THEIR OWN AGAINST THE ROMANS *with inferior training, with inferior weaponry, with inferior tactics*

ENFJ: Scotts. They seem really chill but the more tired they get, the more energy they seem to have, somehow able to keep the romans out entirely while inventing golf at the same time.

INFJ: Aztec warriors. I don't know enough about them to give a comment


INFP: Irish Fianna. Armed and trained the same amount as the scotts but conquered by literally everyone who ever set foot there. Ever. French? Check. Normans? Check. English? Check. Other Irish? Try and stop them, you can't, because you're irish. Get into a monastery and hope that they like churches enough to leave you alone, then come out and make the best music when they're not paying attention.Does anyone hate the irish? No one hates the Irish. The Irish make [great music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njgAjaAGebw).

Or I would if I weren't bothered by the pronunciation of chalk as chock.I'm normally relatively clean, I just have an arm injury and had to move back in with my mother so I have neither means, motive, nor motivation to unpack my shit.I must be an ENTP because I can think of two different things that might share a trait in common. This is how this works. Come on nowAren't dolphins super rapey and sadistic?Relevant username I seeENTPs are humans. There are so few other creatures that are "*guys check this out, I made a machine that does this for me*"

That was my second guess. Me and My INTP last touched a spreadsheet for our RPG we've been working on for three years.I'm great at both of those things, he's a better writer and improviser and much more capable while researching, we just have been busy for a while.

This is because you're an amazing person, and a more amazing person in the makingIt's a relatively low dose honestly.I live in a house where I get exasperated at the idea that someone might not understand that things have a habit of making sense. 

Math isn't the enemy mom.You'll notice that most of us don't have portal technology. We should get on that.Great music thoStories and soupmakingSounds like quite the story&gt;Let's type this failure

INTP

You need to find a DnD group, and play some numenera, read name of the wind, and godel escher bach.

Good luckJust join the mbti discord channel.5'10 here. 178cmLikely? ENTP. We are distinctly strange people, ESTPs kinda do the same things a lot as well, just in different ways. It's worth noting that these behaviors are symptomatic of type, not indicative. Anyone can show traits that are more associated with other types. With a bit of a bell curve though, we can hazard a decent guess.

ENTPs tend to be disconnected from... well, everything. I want you to imagine that you're doing what you're doing right now. That's it. That's what we experience. This is why we are the most introverted of extroverts. We build abstractions for days, rarely deeply but shallow abstractions about function. With this loose attitude toward experience, life for us is kinda the same. Every ENTP I know is harder on themselves than any one else. We hate inconsistency because it ruins our abstractions and deeply unseats our reality. Not to be confused with integrity. I like to think we have integral behaviors but we are frequently forgetful and careless.

Our secondary Ti or tertiary Si might be responsible on some level for how we react to the world. Someone saying something wrong feels personal, and in my own life I have come to realize it is because I treat all ideas as part of myself. The information is what *I* experience and what *I* have to sort out so *I* can live life in my way. For me at least, this is why I come off as confrontational, rude, and with far more energy to argue about pointless things than I should. They may be your words but they're in my head space now. It's also why I seem to be unphased by some insults entirely, and destroyed by others.  

At the risk of falling to confirmation bias I think your friend is an ENTP, like me. Our world has a large and fundamental disconnect from reality and so a lot of things that we experience can be abstracted into each other. All or nothing thinking can be a hallmark of ENTPs. You'll probably notice quick switching behavior. Sometimes people are people to us, usually they're just idea plants. She would probably like the book godel escher Bach if you're looking for a gift.I put a caveat in mine about thatENTPs do the first 5 of what you've listed as well, It's definitely a bit of a tossupI suspect those charts indicate not what is most abnormal but which type was the baseline for most definitionsLemme tell y'all, 'bout Dwarf Fortress.Meanwhile in some dark university basement, Douglas Hofstatder cackles with glee as he writes another page in yet another 700 page tome, that when converted to binary and then multiplied by the cube of the number of periods, delivers you the same book, but In french. "And they thought fractals weren't also infinite" he mutters before a before pulling out his french-english slide rule to figure out what the next page isAppeal to authority is the hardest thing to deal with In Te users when they don't have the full grasp of context. Just endless logical fallacies and a lack of an attempt at understanding on their part drives me mad. That's a little heartbreaking. We get our validation that way. You might be doing a lot of emotional damage to them. Not really your problem but that sort of thing can get heavy for us. I do. We're not folk for social currency though, so don't try to run a tallyOn mathematically provable levels in many cases!Bullshit. We judge things all the time. They're pretty much universally wrong. Everything. Ever. You love your cats? Wrong. Two plus two is four? Wrong. Two plus two isn't four? Also wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. This word has lost meaning to me. [Wrong.]( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wrong)You can tell by the way blue is willing to liveDoes the statement "everything is probably wrong, including this statement" appeal to you? Does the phrase "alone, in a dark room with a thick fiction novel" appeal to you more than "in a well lit room with at least two people and a pile of Legos/pack of cards/at least one cold thing that can be opened"Ah good, quenya or sindar? 

How easy is it to change your mind (according to people who have gotten angry at you)? I'm getting an idea now.

How do you view people who are clearly less intelligent than yourself? Indeed indeed. You tend to do things. What sort of things? I have my own issues with taoism. Most of Tao Teh Qing is legalist and oppressive, some of it is good advice.

if you are male: Do you have a strained relationship with your father in the sense that: while he is  efficient and organized, he is too tight on tradition and possibly ignores your differences, making expressing yourself difficult? Switch genders for female.


How do you feel about nihilism? Sauron's goal of industrializing middle earth? Have you ever suffered from alcoholism?

How confident are you while driving?
You should read a book called "When things fall apart" by pema chodron, I think you'd enjoy the shit out of it. It's buddhist, which as far as I can tell is just nihilism+1. The only thing I've found so far to beat Nietzsche in existential endpoints.

So, with these stereotypes in mind, you're sounding like a fairly typical INTJ. Fairly social on the scale but not out of the realm of even the INTJs that I know.

As for alcohol and drugs, In your case I'd say stay away from alcohol, if you are INTJ, the ones I've known have all had problems with alcohol unless they addressed their mindset early. So just one of them. Shrooms on the other hand. Shrooms are something you should (from the perspective of INTJs that I know) try at least once. shit, ignore other reply. Orpheus was a parody of other music at the time from someone that no one expected it from. Dude. How many ENTPs do you know that just sit in their basement doing nothing because of their *sheer potential for complacency*. Seriously, my people are not necessarily a prodigious group. We make assumptions faster than just about anyone and because of that, we fuck up. With great fequency. Profoundly and with much noise. 
I had a lengthy, in depth rebuttal to your opening statement, with deep philosophical implications on the nature of abstractions and context and wrongness and somewhere around the fifth paragraph I actually read your full comment.  Touché. You can tell that you are by the way you are.Guilty of being amazing. The trigger is for party time supplemental disorder. Bonus points for bonus points Sounds like a disorder is involved here. Histrionic perhaps? Dat edgeThe egg came long before the chickenThe entps I know are all pretty good at not  fightingDon't try to kill the entp. We don't take threats wellNnnnope, Black and white thinking is rampant among my people. Threats are to be dealt with one way or anotherSeven samurai is a really good film, guess I've got to see Brazil now ...HA

Edit: give that user their up votes.  It was an excellent japeAs long as it isn't carrotsOne or two loud booming "ha!" Sounds might indicate a wild entpI've got a few entp friends and we get along well, but let's be honest, we're a bunch of shits and it is a good thing we're a minorityENTP_IRL: Your Actions are not serving their intended purpose, please re-evaluate your decisionsIt's the beginning of an INTP's second form, and a natural part of their life and metamorphosisHoly shit, it's Sly Marbo!Put that shit in the fridge, it lasts longer. Also Twist, clip AND tuckNo no, the clip is too close to the heel to go underIf *anyone* even  suggests entp, they get sent to the Facebook group until they have learned their lesson.Oh everything would work, a good few of us are decent enough at doing things, but damn, it would be unbearably toxic to the point of systemic blindness to problems a la citadel of ricks. In ENTPville there would be a great boom of technology and depression as we struggle to maintain personal novelty in lieu of getting by on kinda knowing things. No one feels real in ENTPville Great with stories and comedy, terrible with answering texts. Many of us are pepetually insecure and incapable of feeling secure about not being the brightest fucking candle in the room. It becomes a feedback loop of seeing a problem and not being able to solve it, which is in and of itself, a problem.

A guy plays in my DnD group. He has ruined DnD groups for other people in the group simply by being himself. Conversely, I have been told by other people that I am their favorite person, which is a compliment so mindbogglingly awesome that I can't actually process it. 

The problem is, I don't see much of a difference between this guy and myself. We share extremely similar flaws, We are capitious, rules-lawyers, **piercingly** loud, we both interrupt people a lot (actually a symptom of ADHD, which we both have), we are modestly intelligent (where modest might as well mean *enough to be dangerous*), we both have issues understanding social cues and context, and we both build our characters in the same way.

This guy has a sense of entitlement which is reversed in me to a sense of undeserving. In him, there is a fear that he will lose what he has if he doesn't fight for it, where in me, there is the fear that I will lose what I have if I hold onto it too tightly. This leads to him aggravating people with his munchkinnery, but for me, it has lead to my four Repetitive strain injuries. We are extremely similar ENTPs with people giving extremely different opinions on.  Out the two of us, I am probably the more functional, based on the opinions of others.

Similarly, a friend of mine is Dyslexic, and he does not behave like a stereotypical ENTP. While just as hole-poking, he is not as well read, and thus, has put almost all of his considerable intellect into watching the body language of others, learning *about* people, which a lot of ENTPs avoid. He didn't fall into the trap of abstracting people as the same unit copy-and-pasted at any point in his life. People do not view my friend as intelligent, he does not present the same way other intelligent people do. To the people who actually listen to the guy, you feel that stereotype wearing down. He is over six feet tall, and built like a barrel. He's overweight, but doesn't really look it. What he does look is intimidating. 

How people feel around him is completely different than me or the other guy. They see us all as argumentative, but the degree of desire to garner the attention of each of us is different. The big guy gets a lot of attention from the stereotypical bro type, despite his interests being deeply philosophical in nature. Around him people get smarter, despite never feeling socially threatened by him. I get a lot of attention from the typical nerd and social pariah, I offer them a higher level of base social power than other people do, because I automatically assume they are worth my time to listen to. People can get aggravated with me because they see my capitiousness as ill-intentioned, they find it hard to read me and this is because I have much more problems properly communicating than the other guy. The Munchkin...I don't know what attention he attracts, save from some people who wish to put him down. His entitlement is seen as a threat against other's social power, an annoyance that needs to be fixed with forceful education. His capitiousness is directionless, seeing technicality and ignoring functionality, which is in my eyes the greatest trap that ENTPs will fall into.

So with three small cases, your answer is highly dependent on how you present yourself and what your insecurities and disorders and flaws have done to shape you. How people feel around ENTPs is irrelevant. We are frequently intelligent by most standards and we are frequently worth talking to or knowing by most standards. How people see **you** is something for you to reflect on, and the seed idea for that is to ask this question:

"*When I speak to people* ***What is my goal for them?***"

If you find that your goal is to teach, as it so often ends up being for us, then people will often see you as preachy, capitious (such a useful word), and argumentative. We love to teach, we use our voices in an attempt to help others learn, and by extension, attempt to become more socially awesome in their eyes. Know that the goal splits here. If you want to be socially awesome, learn when the lesson you wish to teach does not matter. If you wish to actually teach, make sure your students are listening and can benefit from the knowledge you're giving, not just the flawed context we usually present.

If your goal is to learn, then people will again, see you as capitious, instigative, and incessant. Not seeing the forest because of the trees, is another hallmark of how people see us. We pursue a perfect truth that we know *does not exist*, and on those grounds we often forget to *actually learn what's functional*. Pi isn't 3.14, but for almost everything, it's all you'll ever need. There's more than 5 senses, but how often does your proprioception really matter when talking about experiencing the world? A lot of us need to eventually learn to stop asking questions (for the time being), and to use the knowledge we have while our opportunities are still there to learn from. 

If your goal is to prove to others that you are capable, then you're getting into some pretty nuanced territory about presentation. I can't really help you here, I just shut up and do what I can. 


To **actually answer your question** when I am in the presence of other ENTPs, I am always under the impression that I am dealing with someone who can see reason given enough time. I am always under the impression that my energy isn't wasted. I am frequently under the impression that I need another whiteboard to explain what I'm talking about.

This is my perspective. It is, of course, heavily biased, and not near enough to truth to take any lesson from it as gospel. But perhaps it is as worth considering as it was writingThis made me feel pretty good. I wrote a really long post because I'm having an anxiety day about how people feel about me. You have done a heavy job in fixing that. Thank you.There's a part of me that extremely enjoys that people like you exist.  Dance dance dance!Infuriate! Infuriate!Is off single? Tell him that he's making everyone uncomfortable and start grabbing his butt.  He'll learnTo us, perspective is power. In learning about us the way you have, you have earned a great credit, at least in my eyes:( Tell us. I've yet to meet an ENTP that wasn't trying to make the world better in their own way, so we hate to make people push us away. If you'd like, you can talk to me about it.Ah, you know it's funny, we're critical for the same reason. We're afraid of "the wrong."

To help you in particular, I can only give some Buddhist advice. Let go of the notion that you can *be* right. Aside from it not being possible in a very technical sense, that's where your fear comes from, not from reality but from your expectations. When dealing with such people understand that if given their own opinion from another mouth, they will find flaw. Let go of the idea of perfect truth or perfect action or perfect rules. Fucking up will happen when it happens, worrying happens long before or after. It's just bad juju that you are giving yourself.

Let go then of your fear of being wrong. It will happen when it happens, and in the super majority of cases, it is easy to fix.

The most useful tidbit, though, is that to an ENTP, perspective is power. We respect those who have new perspectives they give us, and it is our currency, our drug. Any time you are talking to an ENTP, if you are giving value to them, give it in a new way to think or see things. If you are receiving value, advice or criticism or help, and it is hurting you, then explain your perspective. Rarely do we take pleasure in hurting people, unless it is hypocrisy, against which we are ruthless. Never be nervous, we are predictable and energetic, but we have easy to find keys that can point that energy in a direction you want it to go.

We love helping, usually. Give us either the power to help (wherein, we find our perspective valued, and our energy charged and focused), or give us a reason that we are wrong, or if that is too much energy, you must put on your best executive air and say "I will take that into consideration." Do what you will with it after.

ENTP peak anime confirmed... that is a fair and valid ruleI am pleased at your username, it is so catchy and easy to rememberI figured that was the case.Objectively incorrect, see statement: "my dog can fly and does so all the time."

There is a context where this can be real. Ignoring that context makes it nonsensical.


Rather, the fact is correct but it is *you* who are ignoring the contextIt is a solid and obvious point as to why we should never be allowed to be in charge of anything. Oh we'll fix it, but the consequences are gonna be felt for *years*1. ENTP

2. Yes, though the context is definitely going to disappoint people and the functionality might not be as comfortable as others want. I might even say no in the same breath because the math is functionally against the idea though not technically

3. Yes. I have felt superior or inferior to others. Context

4. Yes, they all have four letters. Yes. I have issues with most J types for not being able to listen. Oh they claim they can change with evidence, everybody does, but I have to put an inordinate amount of energy into convincing any of them without getting cut off and ignored in the middle of my statement. That's just personal grudges. I'm a capitious shit, there's no reason people would find me or mine flawless

5. #No. Emphatically No.1
Even if there was a best, It is not us. A high resource-value ENTP is absolutely fantastic, but *small doses*. Go to the ENTP facebook group if you want to see what cancer looks likeThe idea of them being illogical is borne  from a lack of control of one's own thoughts, unlike other thoughts they are hard  to ignore and carry compulsions like yelling, crying, and memesHealing powers, that'd be ultra dope. I've got enough injuries but also I'd like to do a lot of things and not have to worry, and I have a lot of friends I'd like to take with me on those dangerous thingsOh man, wait until you learn that there are things that are true that *cannot be learned* Mathematically.

What's the utility of a pair?In being given the choice between doing something and not doing something, always do *\*something\**
&gt;You're aware it has basically no chance to happen ?
&gt;It's more the other way around that s likely : the car crushing an &gt;innocent deer who tried to get on the other side of the road at the &gt;worst moment.
&gt;No animal is dumb enough to attack a metallic monster that is at &gt;least twice as bigger and twice as heavier than them, without telling &gt;nothing about the nonsensical speed comparison.

Ahaha I know its not likely. I just thought it would amusing to mention. 

&gt;What is that ?

Public displays of affection. i.e. couples constantly kissing and touching each other in public. 

Thanks for the reply! :)&gt;1) Are you more energized with moving from activity to activity or &gt;by continuing what was already started?

I think I'm more energized more by the first option. 

&gt;2) What matters more, context or purpose?

Ummm, depends on the context of the scenario. :P So, I guess context. 

&gt;3) Is it difficult for you to concentrate on one long-term goal?

Hmmm depends. If its something I'm really interested in and passionate about, then its easy as a piece of cake. If not, then its extremely difficult. 

&gt;4) Is human nature inherently good or evil?

Neither. I think we're all born neutral. Everyone has the potential to be "good" or "evil". Besides, I think those terms are subjective and hard to measure. Like, if I thought something was "evil", someone else might think its perfectly reasonable. 

&gt;5) How much do you depend on social appraisal? Do opinions of &gt;others in society tend to be more important to you than opinions of &gt;your friends/relatives?

In general, I don't give a shit what society thinks about me. However, I definitely value the opinions of my friends/relatives a lot. &gt; You're supposed to know your type and we guess it.

sorry, didn't see the original post. i only saw seperate threads afterwards based on the same idea. thanks for the link to the original thread though! I'll edit my post and add the original source to it, if that's okay. not trying to take any credit at all. 

&gt;You can't be typed based on this stuff

Yep I know ahaha. I was using the word "type" pretty loosely. Sorry if the phrasing was a bit deceiving. 
Yep. ENTP is correct. :)Hmm assuming that you're definitely an ENFP or ENTP, it's probably best to compare the different cognitive functions. So that would be Fi/Te vs Ti/Fe. The points that you said don't really indicate your type at all, except that point 2 is stereotypically an ENTP trait. I hope this helps. :)Hey guys! Sorry for the stereotypical typing post, but I thought I'd get some different opinions on what people think my type is. :) Thanks in advance!

Q1: You and your friends are going on a road trip!
a.	How you feeling?
Feeling pretty excited and hyped. Road trips sound like good fun. :)


b.	What are you looking forward to, if anything?
Well, hopefully something interesting/exciting happens along the way. I hope that we all have a good time and have some crazy memories to look back on. 


c.	What are you nervous or worried about, if anything?
Eh, nothing really. Well something morbid like getting murdered or kidnapped would be pretty shit I guess. But that’s something you don't want to happen to you in general. Maybe getting lost? But then getting lost can be kinda fun tbh. Last time I got last I ended up walking in a cemetery. Aaand now I’m getting off topic. 


d.	How do we prepare for this thing: what should we think about beforehand, and what should we leave to chance?
Ummm, I guess maybe just get the basics? Get some food, water and clothes. That’s it. Everything else can be figured out later. (or I can just leave up to someone to else to properly organize :P) 

e.	What kind of problems might arise, and how should we find a solution?

Hmm…the car could break down in the middle of nowhere. In that case, attempt to spark the engine up. If we don't know how to do that, then look it up on google. If that doesn't work, split into two groups with equal portions of food/water to find a gas station or any signs of life. 

Crazy animal might try to attack the car for some reason? First you would attempt to drive away. If not, grab the nearest object that's sharp and stab it. Idk. 

 Get lost. There isn’t a solution to this one. Getting lost is part of the journey. 


Q2: Your friend or sibling wants you to meet their new significant other!
a.	How do you feel about that, and why?

Excited but cautious I guess. I’d be really curious to see what’s so special about this significant other. I’d also probably size them up and make sure they’re treating my friend or sibling well. 


b.	What situation(s) would make you feel most comfortable, and what would make you feel most awkward?

Um, I can’t really think of anything particularly comfortable? I think it’d be a bit awkward if the significant other started to express strong opinions which I disagreed with. I’d probably sit there with my eye twitching, resisting the urge to argue with them. 


Also, if the significant other was really socially awkward or just really quiet. Like if you were trying to talk to the significant other but they’re completely silent. Makes it really hard to start a convo and get to know the other person, ya know? 


Excessive PDA would be real awkward. Also third wheeling. 


c.	What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally approve? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?

Depends on the situation. Some people’s characters are easier to gauge than others. So, as long as it takes. They would get my approval as long as they’re a genuine person. If I totally approved, I would make sure I told my friend/sibling upfront. I’d be like, “holy shit dude. High five. I ship y’all so much.” 


d.	What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally disapprove? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?

Again, depends on the situation in terms of time frame. I would probably disapprove if they seemed dishonest, fake or extremely judgemental. And if they were treating my friend/sibling like shit. Once I would feel certain that they’re not a “good” (this is a subjective term, but you get what I mean) person I’d confront my friend/sibling in private. I’d probably try to phrase it as nicely as possible without sugarcoating it. Aka, I’d probably say something a bit blunt/harsh and apologise immediately afterwards. Because I’m awkward like that. 

I've done one of these things before, but I thought it'd be cool to jump on the band wagon and try the whole "type me based on my relationships with other types", so here it goes. Thanks for any feedback in advance! :)

ESTJ - I don't seem to know many ESTJ's but they seem like pretty cool people. A bit too uptight and serious at times for my liking, but hey, there's an upside and downside for everything. 

ESFJ - A bit overbearing and iffy at times to me, but overall alright in general. 

ESTP - Again, for some reason I don't know many ESTPs. Y'all seem a bit crazy, but I like crazy. :) 

ESFP - God, you guys are so derpy and happy-go-lucky. I freaking love it. I always seem to have good light hearted convos with ESFPS and generally get along with you guys. 

ENFP - I always seem to click almost instantly with every ENFP I meet. Even the crazy unstable ones. Only problem is that neither of us seem to have enough commitment to the relationship to make time for each other. I'd complain that y'all are a bit too flaky for me, but then I'd be a hypocrite. So, I usually have short lived but awesome friendships with ENFPs. 

ENFJ - Even though I generally get along with ENFJs, I think the dominant Fe can irk me at times. The collective "we should do this" and "we all think this" generalisations can be irritating at times. Like, once you're set on one idea, y'all can get a bit dogmatic for my liking. But then I'm sure this doesn't apply to all ENFJs. I'm probably just generalising the bad experiences I've had with ENFJs in the past. 

INFP - I don't know why, but I'm surrounded by INFPs. I love you guys, seriously. Like, the general sense of calm and lack of drama is so peaceful and nice. You're willing to discuss the crazy ideas I put out there and listen to my stupid ranting. And the emotional sensitivity is ridiculously nice to be around - it's definitely helped me become emotionally accomodating and less brash towards others. 

INFJ - Instant chemistry. I feel like I can talk to INFJs all day long. You're all so lovely. I feel like I can talk about anything whether it's silly or serious. The only downside is that sometimes I feel like y'all are too polite. Like you're afraid to hurt other people that you filter yourselves way too much. I don't think I can physically count all the times I've said to stop saying sorry and that nothing they say is going to offend me. 

ISTJ - I don't understand y'all but I still like you guys. :) It feels like it takes so long for you guys to open up, but when you do, it's freaking awesome. I really admire the level-headedness and composure you guys have. 

ISFJ - Awww I love ISFJs. They're so cuddly, affectionate and expressive. It feels like I can hang out with them without speaking and we seem to just have a natural mutual understanding of each other. :) (lol not biased at all. definitely don't have an ISFJ mother. /s) 

ISTP - I don't seem to know any ISTPs for some reason? Y'all seem like chill people to hang out with though. 

ISFP - Again, don't know any confirmed ISFPs. I have no idea why. 

ENTP - I feel oddly neutral towards ENTPs. We either tend to click or its kinda meh. Probably because we're too similar. 

ENTJ - I don't why but I like ENTJs. I just do. There's no reason for this one. 

INTP - Oh man, I love me some INTPs. It's so fun being able to talk about crazy ideas/theorys/random wiki articles and stuff on the internet. It doesn't feel like we have to try to understand each other, we just do. 

INTJ - INTJs are awesome. The amount of dedication and work ethic you guys have is insane. On another level. I seriously admire you guys. However, I do feel like they can be hyper focussed and a bit narrow minded at times, which can be frustrating when I'm trying to reason with them. I generally get along with INTJs though. 


EDIT: sorry, link to original idea/thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4r5hnd/lets_make_this_thread_a_place_for_those_who_want/)


I'm dating an INFJ and he's pretty cute personality-wise, makes sure I'm comfortable, remembers everything I said, etc, etc... I'd define him as attentive. He's not overly emotional but he's not emotionless either. Idk, I think this "very emotional" INFJ stereotype is bs. I usually think ISFJs are attentive in a motherly way, idk. INFJs are more like "I'm gonna pay attention to everything you say and do because you interest me and I wanna figure you out"I get really hyped and laugh at everything.I’m ESTP and I date an INFJQuestioner
Holy shit your formatting is amazing.I'm in a similar place as you are, though recently it's been more of a Entp/Enfp dissonance. Actually identify with 8w7 the most too. 

Anyways, Entp/Enfp's are pretty much the most introverted extroverts on a whole, so it's absolutely possible that introversion is just part of the deal.Great questionnaire. Would be even better if the answers were easier to copy-paste.

1) What is your MBTI type?  Entp

2) What is your gender? Male

3) What type(s) do you admire/respect the most? (Why?)  Probably Enfj's. They're usually charming but also highly interesting personas. 

4) What type(s) do you Love/adore? Enfp's I think. They're like us but warmer, perhaps more independent too.

5) What type(s) are the most dateable? I like variation. I'd rather date a different type every time than the same one over and over.

6) What type(s) would you be willing/want to marry? I think Mbti isn't qualified enough to make that kind of statement.

7) What type(s) make wonderful friends? Pretty much all the types.

8) What type(s) make you LAUGH? Again, same as above, but Intp's with their marvellous half-assed dorky-don'tgiveashit-ness are probably the best.

9) What type(s) are you uncomfortable around or are hard to be congenial with? Honestly, none of them. Maybe some really strong SJ types but I'm pretty sure that it doesn't have all that uch to do with personality types. 

10) What type(s) can you not stand/dislike/respect? The type of people who generalize and assume that just because someone scores this or that odd score on a personality test they're qualified to judge whether or not said person is a good fit.
I just wanted to say that a good ISFP friend of mine is also a highly picky eater. Coincidence or part of the type?Is that such a bad thing though?

Oh you sneaky ENFJ's, a real weakness, not a false negative.I feel like ISFPs might even like being intimidated or scared.

They sure watch an afwul lot of horror movies in my experience at least.Perhaps, but I think it's more of a result of all your functions. 
Ex. ISTPs and INTP may both have inferior fe but overthinking is more of an issue with the latter.

Or for a more direct example ENTP's are (probably?note this is my opinion on the matter) more likely to have narcissistic tendencies.

I guess biggest weak point of your type in particular/a weakness unique to your type would've been better phrasing.I've got a badass male infp friend. Wouldn't sell myself too short on that one.May be true, but it's great that you acknowledge it.

Also us ENTPs can be overly critical.I think you may have a point here.

Still, neglecting the middle functions when talking about weaknesses seems like a bad idea.(According to your opinion,of course)

ENTP: I mean this one's pretty obvious. Obnoxious cockiness mixed with  the tendency to never follow through on one's plans makes for a dastardly disgusting concoction.

Oh and please argue the points, that makes all the difference.
Entp here. I have a majorly depressed infp friend. Being there for her without trying to solve her problems or shove advice down her throat constantly, and just... Idk, supporting her. Has been working well. She really has opened up, and more importantly opened up to my advice, but it took a year of watching her self destruct without correcting her or pointing out her mistakes in an attempt to help her. This went against my nature as an ENTP, but through talking to her definitely felt this was the way to handle the situation and has paid dividends. PM me if you need further advice Assuming you understand the function stacks, sometimes the functions will develop differently based on the previous functions. We all start with our dominating function at an early age, but that coupled with how the other functions stack underneath will determine the speed at which the rest develop (along with life events). For example, INFJs generally develop fairly early because you have a dominating Ni which causes deep introspection from an early age. ENTPs like me, however, don't fully develop until 25 or older because our Ne isn't focused internally and it throws our thoughts and actions out "in the world". Most 21 year old ENTPs might come off as arrogant or flighty, whereas older ones will have a much more developed sense of responsibility and be much more in tune with the feelings of others having developed our Se. Hope this helps!It's not about the 4 letters, the 4 letters just lead to the function stack which is where the gravy is. Everyone is a feeler, thinker, intuitive, and sensor. The difference is 1) where it lands in their "order" of importance, and 2) whether they are primarily an introverted or extroverted of any of those 4 things. An extroverted sensor is much more different than an introverted sensor. And it doesn't necessarily mean one can't do what the other can - it's just a guideline to our preferences and what drains us vs. what energizes us. Approach it from this angle rather than "what defines us" and things get more clear as to why MBTI is useful.Generally speaking, INTP mature intellectually very early in life, but are even slower than ENTP in developing their Fe. That's because it's third in my function stack, but last in yours. INTPs are very intelligent and that gives them a minor intellectual superiority complex through their 20's. I'd look towards early to mid-30's for a fully developed sense of interpersonal empathy. YMMVI did, thank youHow good are you at reading the mood of the room and truly determining on the fly what people think about you? Got ya. You're an INTP bud. We can't all be winners ;) Fe is the ability to 'gauge' the temperature of the room. Do you find yourself able to tune your actions and attitude to make people very comfortable with you, or do you oftentimes feel awkward or like you may be making people uncomfortable? Do you get a good sense and understanding for how *other* people are feeling in the moment? We can be super cuddle bears :pCan confirmEasiest answer is Fe is all about reading the room, Fi is all about how things make you feel. Loki as a character is entirely driven by 1\) Deep introspective analysis and connection of how different scenarios may play out, and 2\) How the feel of the room and emotions of others can play into that. That is Ni, and Fe, the two dominant functions of INFJ. Just because that isn't your dominant functions doesn't mean you aren't capable of it, it just isn't what naturally drives an INTJ and may be a bit draining to do on a constant basis. Loki is always doing it, all the time, it charges him and he loves it.

As caring about things in an Fi way, look at it from the perspective of Stark \(ENTP\) and Starlord \(ENFP\). Starlord arguably screwed up the entire movie because he acted on something based on how it made him feel. Fi users care about things through a filter on how it makes them feel. That doesn't mean they are selfish by any means \- actually the opposite, as their feelings could be "i want to take care of my family", the difference is they look inside and decide how they feel whatever is happening affects the thing they feel strongly about, instead of looking externally and gauging the people around them and 'how the room feels' so to speak. Hopefully this helps.I can see where you're looking, but make sure you don't confuse "reading the room" as altruism. Just because he very easily sees and understands what others are feeling, doesn't mean he cares about their well being. He is acting on his own ulterior motives \- rarely how it makes him feel, but rather how it fits into the plans he is devising \(and changing\) on the fly. In other words, he is using his Fe to further his Ni. If he was looking at how it makes him feel, or Fi, he would have some deeply seated feeling about something that drives his actions \(good or bad\). That isn't the case.Right, he knew it would hurt Thor and did it on purpose. That's Fe at work, just for evil. Being able to understand how things will affect someone emotionally (Fe) isn't exclusively used for goodI'm in a 'proper' office setting in a management role during my weekdays and have to tone down the Ne, and ramp up the 'covering day to day' things. That's part of maturing as an ENTP. Wasn't always that way, but you can judge him better the few times you see Jim outside of the office setting - for example, putting on his house party, or 'winging it' with the fireworks idea for the potential proposal, or going WAY off script and unexpected for things like the actual proposal, admitting his feelings to Pam early on, etc. He's a textbook *mature ENTP, which in TV/Movies, is far less fun to plaster as a poster child than an immature troll-y ENTP (Barney, Stark, etc) so less common to see.An ESTP, with a primary function of Se, who notoriously doesn't play sports or really do much in the form of physically competitive activity?  No wayMale ENTP, have dated a couple INFJs, feel free to PM me if you have specific questions. Pretty potent combination, for sure.
No worries if you don't make it to my post, I kinda ended up writing more than I thought I would! It's also pretty disorganized and train-of-thought. Sorry for any formatting weirdness or spelling errors, I'm on mobile...

1.
My inner world is pretty much where I am most of the time I guess? I tend to be very reflective and self critical, so I'm usually judging my actions and stuff in my head. I'm always questioning my thoughts and beliefs, and I don't really trust myself a lot of the time.
I think through things I already know multiple times; when I come to conclusions I rerun the thought process that lead up to it, and then go through the exact words/emotions/examples I'd use to explain it to someone. In my head I'm really particular about the words I use, but out loud not so much!
I also tend to think up random, really elaborate schemes I'd never actually follow through with. For example, when I was in first grade I rode the school bus, and most of the time was used to think about a way I could manage to release a large amount of marbles onto the floor without anyone knowing I did it. I don't know why, since I had no desire to do that? I think I wondered where a marble would roll while the bus was moving, and it just jump started me on this weird thought experiment. I came up with like 10 different ways then gave up because they could all have been too easily traced back to me and I got frustrated. That kind of thing happens a lot.
I also like imagining conversations I might have just in case I need to sound like I have my life more put together than I actually do. I usually attempt to plan my actions/schedules/etc in my head in advance, but I'm pretty terrible at it and usually end up getting too overwhelmed and just improvising everything. I'm also a worrywart. I worry about pretty much everything, from saying something stupid to getting killed by falling space debris. If I'm not worried about something, it's because I'm too busy being worried about something else. Despite this, I have a lot of trouble transitioning from thinking to doing. I can lay in bed for 10 hours straight worrying about a big homework assignment I have to do rather than just doing it. This also leads to trouble with decision making.
I've been told that I'm "spacey", which is probably true. I tend to daydream a lot and I often don't hear when people are talking to me because my mind was elsewhere.

Things that get me excited:

- The performing arts: movies, tv, theater (especially musical theater), music, slam poetry, dance, etc. Both watching and performing. I want to be an actress, so this makes sense. I'm not as excited about the fine arts for some reason. 

- Talking to people about their perspectives and experiences. I really like talking about human nature and personalities. Mbti, enneagram, comparing my friends to fictional characters, putting people into categories in general. Not necessarily in a judgy way; it's more about noticing patterns and similarities, collecting information, and then comparing and relating it to my experiences.

- Ghost stories. I don't like horror movies because I'm easily scared, but I like reading the summaries and seeing how the supernatural elements were handled. I enjoy the mystery and the lore, but not the imagery or jump scares. But I don't necessarily believe in the supernatural 

- Discussions and debates. I love trying to logically argue a point, whether it's about the Syrian refugee crisis or about Star Wars, or anything really. Sometimes I try to argue really dumb things as a joke, but I still put effort into it. For example, I once tried to convince my friend that swallowing your saliva is healthier than drinking water. She didn't buy it at all, but that didn't stop me from trying to back it up. 

- Social events with a group of friends. I'm not a big fan of trying to enjoy time with strangers, but I will hang out with people I enjoy anywhere, anytime. Movie nights, parties, walks, just being in the same room on our phones, whatever.

- Learning. Not necessarily in a classroom setting. I like gathering random facts and bits of knowledge.

- Fashion and interior design, in the sense that I express myself through decorating my body and my living space.A lot of things can make me enjoy a movie/tv show. If I can relate to the characters, if there's a strong sense of tension, or if it presents something morally complex to think about. Usually it takes all three for me to continue a series or to love a movie. In addition to those, I also like when the outcome isn't really obvious. I like to figure out what's going to happen, and I really like it when I'm wrong. But sometimes I just like things because they're funny or relaxing to watch.

Of all of my friends, my closest ones are people who are much more bold than me: louder, more confident in themselves, strongly opinionated, etc. I surround myself with people who make me feel more confident by association. I also tend to make friends with people who are more emotionally vulnerable then I am. I've wondered if maybe I surround myself with people I want to be more like, but there are many aspects of my friends which I love in them but would hate in myself.
I also noticed that I have a feeling for who I'll be close with pretty soon after I meet them, and even if I don't know them well at the time, I'm almost always correct. I haven't decided if I'm just intuitive, or if it's sort of a self fulfilling prophecy. My core group of friends and I definitely have similar interests, thought processes, politics, and backgrounds in a lot of ways, so it's probably the latter.

I'm not as well informed as I'd like to be, so I can't say much about the political climate in Syria. I'm American, so this is all from that perspective. I think that the idea that no one should be taking refugees because they might be terrorists is just ridiculous. It's statistically unlikely and makes no sense. We have such a long and tedious process for them to immigrate into the country that a terrorist would probably get in another way for convenience's sake. 
I've also heard people say they'll ruin our economy, which is just not true? How is the addition of more workers and consumers going to hurt the economy? I was listening to NPR and they had an interview with someone who was saying that we should speed up the immigration process for those who have trade skills, which I think is a great idea. It made me wonder, though, if people think that Syrians are going to come over here to live off of government aid for the rest of their lives. I mean I'm sure some are, but if they were willing and able to successfully escape Syria I'm sure that getting jobs won't be hard.
Overall, I think it makes no sense to keep all refugees  out for the potential few bad ones. We have no way of knowing who will be a terrorist, or who will work, or who will be a bad neighbor, or whatever it is people are worried about. I don't think that someone should get the benefit of the doubt just because they were born here, it should be extended to everyone. 
My mom is ESFJ. I am ENTP&gt;  Can confirm, I love her and she loves me dearly, but we fought A LOT and she said tons of shit she didn't mean. She even hit me when she lost it, but it was not hard to imagine why she went that far. I was a shitty kid, who was nothing like his mother. After my dad died (Type unknown, but definitely something something T something) I had nobody of remotely similar personality, and worst of all, no defender. If my mom thought she was right, there was no equal to challenge her; only a child, a subordinate. I never cared about animal welfare even though I'm fascinated by animals, and my mother is and was the opposite. I would say callous things and she would brush it off but it would add up; she held grudges. She would assume I had malicious intent when I was innocent. She told me "Nothing PG-13!" (I was in middle school) and went to sleep. I just looked at her face for a second after going to put on The Lion King and she yelled at me and kicked me out of the house (for 30 minutes) because she thought I was about to break her rule. I even explained later my point and she maintained that I was guilty. When I lightly kicked her back one time she was beating me, she accused me of hurting her on purpose and she dented my wall when she threw a door sign at me, which I dodged. She really wasn't abusive; she couldn't help it. She was like a fairly predictable bull; friendly, but god help you should it decide to charge. I often heard her crying the night after a big fight,  but only after incidents involving nasty words or physical violence. The fighting lessened as I got older and learned to control myself more, but as I got older other problems occurred because I was right in a lot of arguments. It still was better though. Ritalin helped a lot with that.

TL;DR: Mom and I fought a shit-ton, she still loves and loved me though.
apoliticalit's in my flair, entpWhy INTJ for Campbell?33 entpBirdmanENTP:

Carhartt pants, work boots, Hawaiian shirt, trucker jacket and mulletCharming and spookyI prefer no school8.5Someone who will hurt meSeems like I always fall for InfjsRather be a smartass than a dumbassAs a former dumbass I can attest that experience is a cruel teacher, wisdom goes a long wayEntp here, pretty much did all the work and presented itAs a chef I feel this deeply
Private msg me if you want to know What do you mean 6w7 ? typo ?What do you recommend ? And why ENTP is the master race lol... other then that thanks for the advice I do actually start many things and not finish them in a sense, but I definitely come up with the best Not really lol... There are a lot of fake ENTPs what is a good way to weed them out in your opinion [ I have mine but I would like to add more ] Lol nope.. I have no emotional trauma&gt; no one

I meant filter mis types... Could have been more precise :/ oh well interestingI'm ENTP A , M  used this site   https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test 
The problem with this isn't accuracy so much as that it's really easy to tell which functions each question is testing for, so it's really hard not to be biased. I'd say no, for that reason. The intent of them is fine, but if they can't disguise that intent they may as well just ask 'do you use Ne or Ni?', etc. 

Of course, if the person answering has no idea about CFs, then they might be okay (assuming the conditions you imposed in the OP are still there).Yeah I wish I had a better answer. There's a whole myriad of other problems that come with online tests though (less here than a dichotomy test, but still), that are avoided when self-typing. 
Text over call. I hate talking on the phone. I feel like it invites a lot of unnecessary smalltalk whereas in text I can just get straight to the point and not feel weird about ignoring someone. Ignoring what someone said over the phone would obviously be weird haha. But overall I like talking in person the most.I don't get how ENTP is an option. I would say you're probably an ENFP. When you're alone you're using your Fi. When you're with others your Ne is on overdrive. It only makes sense that you use your introverted function a lot when alone and extroverted function when with others. Ne in itself is very witty. You don't need to be an ENTP to be a witty smartass.You've stated that you definitely use Fi. And it sounds like you're sure you use Ne with the options given. Yet you haven't talked about how you use Ti or Fe. So you can imagine why everyone here thinks you're an NFP.Yeah, some sort of TJ. If I had to guess maybe ISTJ.ISTP vibes. I can kinda see the Ti and the Ni. It's kinda difficult to type you based off of these questions. You sound like a really chill and collected person.

Edit: I'm also thinking INFJ might fit. Oh and Madoka is fucking awesome. ENTP. My favorite artists are Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens, Fleet Foxes, and Kendrick Lamar. Although I really like Kendrick, I kinda dislike most rap music.I watched this years ago and my memory is super hazy but my guesses are:  
Johan - INFJ  
Anna - ISFP (?)  
Tenma - ISFJ  
Lunge - ISTJ  
Grimmer - INFP  
Eva - ESTJ (?)

ENTP. People tell me I look, talk, and act like Elliot Alderson but our personalities are nothing alike. I guess it's a mannerism thing. In terms of personality I think Greg from Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (movie) was based off of me.I'll give each MBTI type a final evo Pokémon with the same primary type. I tried to include every Generation as well:  
ISFJ: Grass - Torterra  
ESFJ: Flying - Pidgeot (I know its primary type is Normal but there are not that many primary flying types. Normal type is pretty fitting for ESFJ too though. I just find Flying to be a better type for them.)   
ISTJ: Ground - Golurk  
ESTJ: Rock - Tyranitar  
INFJ: Psychic - Gardevoir  
ENFJ: Water - Milotic  
INTJ: Steel - Metagross  
ENTJ: Dragon - Hydreigon  
ISFP: Bug - Volcarona  
ESFP: Fire - Blaziken  
ISTP: Fighting - Lucario  
ESTP: Electric - Raichu  
INFP: Ghost - Trevenant  
ENFP: Fairy - Togekiss  
INTP: Poison - Toxicroak  
ENTP: Dark- ZoroarkI don't think I hate any specific type 100% of the time, but I find it difficult to get along with INTJs. I think we have some sort of respect for each other but we just can't get along. Lots of arguing that doesn't end up being fun. My ENTP friend has felt the same way about other INTJs he's met.ENTP:  Social and Musical are both equally high and then there's Self.That I know of most films premier Thursday and a lot of people have seen early screenings. My workplace held a screening just last night.I don't think or care much of the past and the future does scare me at times. Like I try my best to avoid thinking about the future even though it always creeps up. Potential responsibilities, death, aging, all of that freaks me out so much. I'm optimistic for the most part so that helps me cope.Thanks! Just read both loop sections and I definitely relate to Fi-Ni loop much more when under stress.Fuck: ISTP.  
Marry: ISTP, INTP, or INFJ.  
Kill: INTJ and ESTP.This is neat! Accurate to the two ISTPs I know. Obviously a lot of this is superficial but I'd still like to see you do an ISFP one to see if it's accurate for me.First real life video was beautiful. Almost teared up at the end there. "I'm just trying to make the world a more better place, a more beautiful place, and if music and art can do it and somebody appreciates it, that's all that matters. If I can make a difference in one person's life, that's all that matters."What type would you be referring to? I'm guessing xNTP? I totally say "uh, know what I mean?" a lot haha.Nice! Yellow is my favorite color at the moment  
ESFP - Magenta  
ISFP - Lavender  
ESTP - Navy  
ISTP - Olive  
ESTJ - Turquoise  
ISTJ - Earthtone  
ESFJ - Maroon  
ISFJ - Beige  
ENFJ - Jade  
INFJ - Periwinkle  
ENFP - Dandelion  
INFP - Salmon  
ENTJ - Jet Black  
INTJ - White  
ENTP - Clementine  
INTP - Grey  
  

Not gonna lie I went to crayola.com to look for colors hahaHmmm true to an ENTP I know. My ENTP friend always wears the exact same green jacket and flat cap every time he goes out. It's like his signature look. Almost like a cartoon character.I think I look like a scary fruitcake.Haha it's a pretty color.My little sister and an ENFP coworker both do the exact same thing! It stresses me out sometimes haha.Glad to hear you figured it out. Welcome to the club dude.I get ISFP vibes as well. But maybe that's just me being biased because I was able to relate to most of this. I'm not the best at typing so yeah. Just my guess.  
Some points:  
- cares about appearance and appearance shifts mood. (Fi, Se)  
- works well under pressure. Takes action. Yet lazy and unambitious most of the time. (Se, inf Te)  
- wants to talk about personal emotions and opinions rather than listen to someone else's because they can't relate. (Fi)  
- chill, unambitious, disorganized. (P)  
- difficulty understanding heavy concepts and rules especially when regarding heavy logic. (Lack of Ne, Ti, &amp; Si)   
- doesn't understand explanations, would rather be hands on. (Se)  
I had a hard time finding Ni in your posts. Maybe the spacing out section? I definitely see a lack of strong Ne though. The way you focus on something small and want to read about it and what people have to say but you don't want the details. It sounds like you read other opinions in order to form your own, not like you're doing research for knowledge's sake. I always feel like Ne tries to absorb as many details and facts as possible about random things that interest them. I also feel like Ne would be much more clear in your typing style.  
Edit: added a bit at the end there.Idk that all sounds so vague. Best bet is he's a feeler but that's about all I can get from this. We would need a bit more info. What other observations have you made about him?I don't think this is type related but.. I'm always singing. Not even humming sometimes, just straight up singing. Not loudly but not softly either. At work I'm known as the dude that's always singing when he's working. I just love singing so much and it relaxes me when I'm stressed or when I need to let out some feels. Singing is my favorite form of therapy along with meditation. If I don't get my hour long shower singing session in the morning then I'm probably going to have a meh day. I'm sure I get annoying haha.Yeah.. I mean I'm an ISFP and I can figure shit out. Being an airhead doesn't make you a sensor. I wouldn't take this advice OP.From my experience ESxPs and ExFJs. Everyone's always on about how ENxPs can be very charismatic, and they can be a lot of the time, but they're also kinda awkward a lot of the time. Awkward is ok but awkward isn't really charismatic. Anyone can be charismatic and anyone can be awkward; just some commonalities I've noticed.I'm not gonna lie I only watched like 3 minutes. I skipped around. So Ne is obvious, even if it feels forced. I sense no Fi in you whatsoever. I wanna say xNTP but it's kinda hard to tell.I really dig alcohol. Used to be super into MDMA until it stopped working or just started making me sick. And I know a lot of ISFPs are known for being pot heads but I really can't do weed haha. It trips me out.ISTP, ENTP, ENFP, &amp; INFJ. Just the types I like chilling w the most.I know two people said ISFJ already, so maybe that's going to be the general consensus, but this girl really reminds me of my ENFP sister, old ENFP friend, and ENFP coworker. Just reading about her made me anxious. She really doesn't have that Fe dom tact/ warmth.Definitely sad and prone to comfort eating but not drinking. I only like to drink for fun. I've seen depressed drunks before and I definitely don't want to be that. I'll cry over a bowl of pasta but I'll never cry drunk on the floor hahaha.What exactly do you mean by musical? Like good at playing instruments/ singing/ dancing? Just to give irl examples: I'm an ISFP and I love singing and I like to think I'm pretty good but I suck at playing instruments and I'm a decent dancer. My INTJ brother is a rockstar on the guitar but he sucks at singing and dancing. Something interesting to note is that he tells me he sees playing guitar as a bunch of math, numbers, patterns, puzzles, etc so he has a more mechanical view of music. An INFP friend is good at writing and playing guitar and he performs vocally even though his voice isn't great. And my ENFP cousin is great at making beats on his cpu and he's a good dancer but he sucks at singing and playing real instruments. Idk maybe certain types are better at certain things in music or it can just be completely random.Yes I do! Grandpa was in a metal band (drums), aunt sings professionally, sister and cousin are dancers, mom has a beautiful voice, dad plays bass and is a Jazz enthusiast, and I'm probably missing a few more haha.Weavile! He's just so fun to play with. He's fast and to the point and I love his look. I like running a jolly focus sash set with fake out, brick break, icicle crash, and throat chop. I also really dig Zoroark, Garchomp, Milotic, Togekiss, Metagross, mega Medicham, mega Houndoom, and mega Blaziken.Sinnoh is my favorite region! I love all of the evolutions and pre-evolutions they added. Their original Mons were great as well. Really hope they remake that gen.This is dumb but... I'm a gay dude and I had the hugest crush on my childhood bully for 8 stupid years. I can't explain it. I knew of his difficult childhood and I was able to relate and I felt like I was his outlet but I was ok with it. Looking back I was stupid as shit and I would love to go back in time and kick his ass hahaha. He apologized to me a few years later and he matured so much and he's doing great. I'm happy for him. I'm certain he was an ISTP.I don't think a toddler can be accurately typed but I'm going to go along with this anyway haha. I'll use myself and my siblings at ages 3-6 as examples. I'm the oldest so I remember all of them as toddlers.  
Starting with myself (ISFP), as a child I was always the artist of the family and the class. I had a ton of friends, I was really outgoing and easy to talk to, but I always chose to be alone. My mom tells me that since I was a toddler I never wanted to sleep on the same bed as her unlike my other siblings. I had a crazy imagination and a lot of kids admired me for it. I loved it when people called me strange or different (damn Fi). I was also very affectionate and not shy at all. I was really daring and I loved doing dumb things. I loved attention and I was probably the biggest trouble maker. I was good at looking sweet and getting away with things. I was also really romantic and I was always in love with someone. Heck I had two girlfriends in the first grade (at the same time) and I loved my babysitter when I was 4. I was always daydreaming in class. I HATED school and even though I had a ton of friends I liked to spend lunch time alone sometimes. I would just explore the school and mess with ants. I was the least clingiest of us all and I was the calmest. I cried the least. I was the most emotionally intelligent and "people smart". I was very charming. I also loved taking photos since I was 4. I know it goes against Se stereotypes but I've always been the least athletic. I hated sports and soccer balls and basketballs terrified me for some reason. I was the most energetic though. I loved hide and seek more than anything.    
  
As for my brother (INTJ) he was always crying or yelling. He was and still is the biggest jerk of the four of us. He only had 1 or 2 close friends and he hated everybody else. He was always quiet in class and his teacher told my mom that he always looked out of it but he was the brightest in the class. He was hardly ever happy. He was extremely aggressive and he would make me cry sometimes. Funny thing though, he's always loved and admired me so much and I've always disliked him for how mean he is. He was the one that would throw the biggest tantrums when things wouldn't go his way. He was always good at everything. Strange enough he's been the sportiest of us all. Quick learner. Bossy as hell. Has always been obsessed with money. He was the clingiest to my mom.  
 
My sister (ENFP) has always been a rollercoaster. She hates being told what to do more than anybody. She reads a lot. When she was little she was really chatty. Kids couldn't stand her because her presence was overwhelming. She loved attention more than I did. She won the school spelling b. She's had better grades than even my smart ass INTJ brother. She had weird emotional issues and she had to see a therapist for some time when she was like 6. She loved arguing and she's always stood up for herself. As a baby she cried the most. She was always the clingiest to my dad. Ever since she was little she would do this thing where she would yell at the top of her lungs for no reason, then she would giggle and just walk away. It's so weird because I've noticed a lot of ENFPs do this hahaha.  
 
My youngest brother is only 4 but he gives strong ESFJ vibes. He loves everyone, and I mean everyone. Hell he loves the Slenderman. He randomly gives people hugs and kisses. Whenever we argue he tries to calm everyone down. He gets really sad if we joke around with him. He loves order and routine. He follows every rule and he snitches on himself if he does anything wrong. He's the most organized of us all haha. He hates playing pretend and he hates it when I tell him strange things. Like if I tell him to name his car Freddy he'll get angry and tell me cars aren't people so they can't have names yet as a child I would think that was hilarious. He loves being home and he hates new things. He has great memory and the greatest attention to detail. He surprises me with that sometimes. He spots things I don't. Of all of us four he's the only one that actually likes going to church. He loves to emotionally manipulate my parents into buying him things and it actually works.    
 
I know this is long but I was on the toilet and I got bored. Most of these are just stereotypes and maybe just a few functions I noticed. I made it so that it's easy to notice certain functions. I didn't want to explain too much.
Male, 23. After a long time wondering I've finally settled on being an Fi dom (thanks to you guys). It's really obvious and I don't doubt I'm an Fi dom. I have a hard time deciding between the two. I'll give a few random facts that I feel might distinguish between S vs N. I don't have the best understanding of functions. The thing is I feel like I use both Se and Ne and not much Ni and especially not much Si. I know that's not possible but I'm just confused about the whole thing. Some of this may be irrelevant so feel free to only go through a few points. I know it's a lot.  
Anyway:  
*I'm a very sensitive person in a physical sense. Well emotionally as well but you know. I really can't stand certain sensations and I have crazy sharp hearing and I use glasses even though my vision isn't that bad. I can't stand strong odors and I absolutely need my quiet unless loudness is expected like at a party. Even then I need bathroom breaks to get away.  
*This may just be an Fi thing but I'm an artist. I see and feel art in everything. I love creating. Fuck I'll make a smoothie and I'll give it my all and make it a masterpiece. I feel like I'm art myself if that makes any sense? I've been a bit of a performer since I was a kid. I definitely love attention and I like it when people appreciate my work. I'm very needy in that sense.  
*To kinda expand on that point I love to draw and I'm constantly doodling. I love creating universes and doodling my ideas even though I never get around to completing anything. I love cooking and making random dishes with the few ingredients I'm given. I love music (who doesn't) and I love to dance and sing. I LOVE singing. Singing is like my most used form of therapy. I love photography and my dream is to become a film director. I like to create beautiful images and, again, I love sharing my work.  
*I'm very, very much into fashion and my physical appearance. Like I'm obsessed to the point it most likely isn't healthy. I've even had cosmetic surgery. If I don't feel like I look good I become depressed. I feel like image is a very important thing.  
*I know this is the biggest ISFP stereotype but I'm a massive sucker for aesthetics. I want everything ever to be visually pleasing. I love watching beautiful films, or online window shopping, and I love imagining all of the pretty shit I could potentially have in the future. I can be shallow sometimes.  
*I'm crazy clean and I take a shower or two every single day and I hate being touched uninvitedly. I mean I'm really messy and I lose things all the time but I like to keep my person clean. I'm very aware of my own body. I'm also really squeamish and I can't cope with pain or the sight of my wounds. Like I become faint hahaha. I hate violence and body horror unless it's somehow used tastefully in art... somehow... hahaha.  
*I'm a lazy scatterbrain and I'm somewhat unaware of my physical surroundings 80% of the time. I hate sports and I can't even drive. I'm really uncoordinated and clumsy. I love hiking, running, and meditating but that's about it and even then I still spend most of my time being a lazy person. Like I'm constantly out of it. I've always been really chatty and I go on tangents like crazy (exhibit A). I have a very vivid imagination and I say a lot of wacky shit. Like I know that's really corny to say and a lot of people claim being strange and it's obviously bs but I say some strange stuff sometimes. Like it all has a meaning or a purpose but it always sounds off. I also don't really put my self out there and follow my dreams. I'm very spontaneous but more like "here and now forget tomorrow" spontaneous and less like "if I do this big thing now my future will change for the better" spontaneous. This is the main reason I feel Ne and not so much Ni.  
*Growing up I was always very distracted and out of it. I was always daydreaming in class and to this day I absolutely hate school. I was a huge, huge trouble maker. I loved the thrill of being a bad kid. There was never a week that I wasn't benched or in detention. Even in high school I was always getting into something (drugs, graffiti, parties) but I definitely calmed down as I grew up although I always crave that rush and that side of me comes out when I drink or when I'm out and about.   
*I'm really optimistic. I could be having a mental breakdown but I'll still be telling myself everything is going to be ok. In that sense I kinda work well under pressure. Like I can endure mental challenges. I have severe anxiety but I still manage to pull through somehow because I know I'm going to be ok.  
*I think in images and patterns. I talk to myself a lot. I sing out loud a lot haha.  
* For an introvert I have a lot of extroverted tendencies. I really like partying and going out and I don't much dig reading or video games.  
*I'm very grounded in my beliefs. I'm a firm believer of science and I don't believe in magical or spiritual things. I need proof of something before I even question it. I'm more open to the ideas of alien life or multi dimensions but not so much a benevolent god and a holy spirit that guides us. I guess I believe in like signs and I kinda follow and listen to them. I feel like we're shaped by our surroundings and everything is for a reason and everything eventually leads us to something or sometimes there's a sign that tells us to avoid something. Idk how to explain that but I don't feel like it's a spiritual thing. Oh also I have a hard time explaining myself haha. I'm not the best with words.  
*I'm really attracted to dark and strange things.  
*I hate repetition. I hate nostalgia. I hate the past. It drives me mad when people say something is better because that's what they grew up with. New things are amazing too. New things are even better, I would say. I don't like to think much of the future either at least not in a realistic way (death, bills, aging, loneliness, work, potential responsibility).  
*I love patterns. I love mysteries. I like connecting the dots. My mind is always racing with this, and then that, and then this reminds of that, oh now this popped into my mind and it's completely unrelated, except it actually is connected in this way etc. etc.  
*I'm really into interpreting my own dreams. I think dreams have meaning, even the random ones, and many dreams inspire me or guide me. Again, I don't mean this in a spiritual way. It's a fact that dreams are the subconscious mind speaking to us and I like to use that. Dreams also affect the hell out of my emotions and either make my day or ruin it.  
  
  


Thanks for reading if you did I know it's so much. Your help would be very much appreciated. If you have any more questions or if you want to send some links please go ahead. I'm too lazy to reread because I wrote so much so I apologize for any grammar and spelling mistakes. I feel like my writing style is very Ne but the things I say are very Se. Idk I'm clueless. I'm just now realizing the amount of I's in this post is too much hahaha. I might repost this tomorrow if I don't get much of a response. Peace.Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/6mvre4/how_to_spot_an_istp/) post and [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoFS9X3j2BM) videos. Obviously not meant to be taken (too) seriously but some types definitely have similar superficial qualities.I always test as one or the other. On straight up letter tests I always get INFP. On function tests it's really 50/50. I'm 100% sure I'm an NP and I always get the highest score on Ne but I highly doubt I'm an ENxP. I'm too quiet and introverted plus I have pretty good Si. Even though I get the most points for Ne results still say INxP. Anyway, I'll give a few bullet point facts about myself. Questions and links are welcome. Thank you.  
* I'm much more of an artist and people person than I am a mathematician or misanthrope. I suck at math. Despite this, I'm not spiritual at all and I firmly believe and trust in science. I'm actually pretty vocal about my beliefs.  
* Despite appearing disinterested and aloof I'm really optimistic. I find it hard to be a pessimist.  
* I'm actually kinda good at talking to people but I still choose to be on my own.  
* I'm obsessed with the truth about everything and getting to the bottom of things. I love mysteries. I love solving things.  
* I correct people a lot. I can come off as rude. Illogical people irritate me.  
* Everyone thinks of me as emotionless. Very often I do feel emotionless but deep down I crave to feel. I really, really find sadness beautiful. I don't know what it is about being gloomy that I just love. When I'm not depressed I find myself listening to sad music even if I can't relate. I know it sounds silly.  
* I'm either too honest or a huge liar. There is no in between. I will speak the truth even if it hurts and I will lie if it benefits me. I conceal my emotions and my identity but I expose to everyone their truth if it's for the greater good. I can be shitty at times. I try to do what's right even if it hurts my image.  
* Everyone sees me as a mediator or a moral compass. I'm always left to listen to everyone's issues and fix their lives. I don't know what it is about me but people always vent to me even if I'm not interested. I still enjoy helping people though. I never vent to anyone myself. In fact no one really knows me and I feel uncomfortable when I have to express myself.  
* I'm an emotional sponge. I feel like I absorb feelings on a physical level. I can't stand negativity or bad vibe atmospheres. I run as far away as I can as soon as I feel I'm going to get dragged into something terrible that involves me personally. I try my best to keep things going smoothly. I'm super squeamish when it comes to violence.  
* I hold grudges so damn hard hahaha.  
* I have a strange obsession with my appearance. It makes me extremely self conscious. I have to keep myself clean and good looking or else I feel depressed. I'm really into fashion.  
* At times I can be a real sjw. I get into heated debates with people with stupid beliefs. I'm not really the live and let live type. I will definitely criticize others if I feel their beliefs are harmful. I can be really stubborn about my beliefs. I feel that beliefs that oppose mine are illogical. I can be judgemental. I realize this makes me ignorant.  
* I'm really defensive when it comes to people. I will stand up for anyone I feel is being wronged but I can never really stand up for myself.  
* I don't care for nostalgia. I'm ok with new. Both the future and the past terrify me. I like to remain chill and focus on the present.  
* I'm a little too chill when it comes to real world adult issues (bills, work, etc). I try not to let those things get to me.  
* I hate rules and feeling constricted.  
* I'm a messy person but I try to keep things organized, categorized and consistent in my mind if that makes any sense. Hard to explain. I can't for the life of me multitask. I know this kinda contradicts the whole Ne thing but I'm still certain I'm an NP.    
* I'm good at reading people.  
* I can be a bit needy.  
* I can be envious of others.  
* I like making people laugh. I always make it a goal to make quiet and shy people comfortable.  
* I like to encourage people to be the best they can be. I'm a bit of a motivational speaker. I never take my own advice though haha.  
* I'm really into fictional things and I hate to break immersion when it comes to fictional media. I always need to be distracted.  
* I'm extremely calm, lazy, and aloof a lot of the time.  
* I have real good control over my emotions and I rarely ever snap. I can count the times I've genuinely snapped on one hand.  
* I like to find art and beauty in everything.  
* I have a somewhat complex relationship with myself. I fucking love myself haha but I always find myself wishing I was a better person.  

I know this post makes me sound like kind of a bad person but I tried my best to be honest for better results. I think and hope I'm an ok guy haha. I've asked some friends to type me and they've told me INTP, ISTJ, and INTJ. I highly doubt I'm a TJ. Sorry I wrote so much.
This makes so much sense. I'm an ENTP, currently working with / reporting to two INTJs, and they drive me crazy! One is very nice, but we have so many conversations where we just can't understand what the other is saying, even when it's something simple! The other one is incredibly controlling, inflexible and insensitive of others views/feelings. Both want the workplace to be silent (which I find draining) and very structured (which I find limiting).What does that mean?Not 100% sure. They both tested as INTJ when we did an office test, and I'm 99% sure about one, but not as sure about the other. 

He is definitely an introvert and definitely a thinker, but I'm not that sure beyond that. He's a good strategist, and is pretty measured, precise, orderly etc. Although he often forgets things he's previously decided, and he changes his mind a lot.One of them keeps giving me instructions and information and then denying all knowledge or saying he asked for something different. I thought it was my fault (like I misinterpreted things), so I started writing down his exact words, but he still denies saying things, even when I show him the notes.

The other one is doing it in a few ways:
- Agreeing to things in front of our boss in meetings, then denying that he agreed or denying he was even at the meeting
- Saying I'm being emotional (when I'm not) as a way of dismissing me
- Saying I'm too focused on interpretation and not looking at the facts
- Undermining my credibility in my area of expertise (he and I are specialists in different areas)

Basically, I was coming away from every conversation feeling like I was wrong, couldn't trust my memory, was overreacting, wasn't good at what I was doing etc. But yesterday, I was finally able to see through it.Thank you :) Luckily I recognized it for what it was before it went too far.I read this article a while ago, and it is really accurate for me. I’m an ENTP, so my inferior function is Si, and the description completely explains this certain period that was one of the worst times of my life. Something had happened that was incredibly stressful and also really shook my confidence, and a few months later, I went through a time (for about three months), where I could only imagine negative things in my future, I made a bunch of really cautious decisions that I would never have even considered previously, and I just generally became really measured and cautious, and stopped pursuing new ideas. It was really helpful for me to read this article years later, as it explained so much. I also found the article was accurate about the way I pulled out of it - brainstorming possibilities and things to look forward to was definitely part of it.

I should note that this isn’t the way I respond to normal stress or a minor rut, though - this was a major thing.I read like half of the others, and I only related to ENTP (and ENFP, which has the same inferior function - although I didn’t relate as much to the process of the spiral for ENFP).According to my goodreads account, a bit over 800, but that doesn’t include most of the books I read as a kid, so I would say more than 1000 altogether (I was always getting told off for reading too much!).I’m (ENTP) really good at it - like, outdoing my company’s CEO etc. when reading the client, even though they have way more experience and more time with the client.

I have also always known when a guy is interested in me, sometimes even before the guy knew. I’ve never been wrong, and I’ve never been surprised when a guy asked me out. Once I glanced at a guy in a meeting (I had never seen/met him before), and thought, ‘whoever that is, he’s definitely interested’, and sure enough, he emailed me to ask me out like two weeks later.

I’ve always thought that Fe is a big part of it, as a lot of it is about reading the group to ensure harmony etc.Same. This type at work is so frustrating, as I find them really inflexible.

I’ve also had the frequent experience of having conversations with them where, despite us both trying our hardest, we just can’t understand what the other is saying!I’m an ENTP, and my sister is an INFP, and I feel like this is similar to what she says about me.

Although, I do feed the homeless and give a decent proportion of my salary to charity! BUT, only really since developing my Fe in my late 20s.That’s super interesting, because as an ENTP female, I have always known how people felt about me (like much more keenly than the average person). My super power is always knowing when a guy likes me, sometimes even before he knows it himself! I don’t know how I do it, though, as it’s just a feeling I get, but I suspect it’s a subconscious ability to read body language etc. ENTP, CatholicMum: ENTP, I think
Dad: ISTJ
Sister: INFP
Me: ENTPTwo INTJs at work tried to gaslight me today (on separate occasions). Is this an INTJ thing? 

Which types are more likely to gaslight?

Which types are more likely to be victims of gaslighting?

I'm a bit emotional about it, so in true ENTP style, I'm trying to turn it into something I can logically solve.Hey guys

So, I'm an ENTP female, with very high empathy, but I struggle to understand my own feelings sometimes, and I also really hate feeling certain negative emotions more than others (mostly sadness), which I think is due to POLR Fi. Like, I love horror movies, but can't stand sad movies and I hate true stories, because they usually have sad parts.

For the past few years, I've been trying to improve my Fi. For example, I try to 'sit with' and feel my feelings, rather than avoid them (even when they suck!), and I try to understand them as much as I can. One thing I've found really helpful is to find the specific word for the emotion I'm feeling (I think this a Ti thing, right?). So, rather than just sadness, it's helpful for me to understand if what I'm feeling is loneliness or disappointment or regret or whatever. This helps me to deal with what I'm feeling, to move past it and to also learn from it for the future.

Anyway, I'm feeling really sad now, and I can't work out what the feeling is, so I thought maybe some of you guys with high Fi (or, at least, higher than mine) could help me to identify it? I know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but I could really use your help!

**Background:** I live alone and am working from home during COVID-19, so, as an extravert, I'm struggling with the lack of human interaction, and I'm probably a bit more fragile than normal.

**The situation:** I'm feeling sad and also stressed about work. My job is very challenging, and I know that what I'm doing is right (I'm kind of an expert in my area), but the people on my team (everyone has a different area of expertise) don't take me seriously and don't listen to my recommendations. I think it's partly because I'm around 20 years younger than them. I'm so busy all the time, but I'm having to spend a lot of time justifying the same things over and over, and people are saying everything I'm doing is unnecessary anyway (it's not - as I mentioned, I'm kind of an expert, and I've conferred with other experts who agree). I feel like they don't value me at all (and I'm an enneagram type 3, so this is hard). On Friday, they ambushed me in a Zoom meeting, but I stood my ground and luckily, I was able to back up my arguments, and the most senior person agreed with me, but it was very stressful. My manager was amazing, and would always back me up, but it was her last day on Friday. Today, everyone was really challenging me a lot. I reached out to my new manager (who I've never spoken to - she hadn't tried to contact me at all during the transition, which makes me feel even more undervalued), and she backed me up on a few things, but kept challenging the strategy, without letting me explain the situation and the reasons for it, so I felt even worse. 

**Emotional feelings:** Okay, so, it's kind of like sadness, but more gnawing and harder to sit with. I wasn't crying in any of the meetings, but I felt like crying afterwards, out of frustration. I did cry a few times in the afternoon, briefly, but it was because of this other feeling/emotion that I can't name. I feel like I want to quit my job (even though I like the company and worked hard to get the job and have liked it until now). I also really feel like I want a hug. It made me cry when my old manager texted me to see how I was going today (even though she was on leave), but it made me feel sad in kind of a good way? Whereas the rest of the time I felt sad in a bad way.

**Physical feelings:** I kind of feel it in my chest, closer to my heart than my stomach. It's a little bit like a knot, but it feels very empty. 

What do you think this feeling might be?This is an incredibly insensitive post and no one should be watching/reading those things.

It doesn’t seem to violate the subs rules or reddit’s rules, but I would really suggest that you delete this post.Thank you; that’s really kind of you to say.

ETA: I think you’re right with loneliness, and also with anxiety - I hadn’t thought I was anxious, but I think maybe this is just a different brand of anxiety.Thank you for replying, I do feel like disappointment is part of it. I think you might also be right with resignation - I hadn’t considered that, but it’s not often that I can’t strategise my way to a solution, so resignation is maybe a bit harder for me to feel.Yeah, you're right about my upbringing. I was always told I was too sensitive etc., so I shut a lot of that out, and only really started to accept my feelings in the last maybe 10 years. 

I'm definitely seeing the value in actually feeling things and not avoiding them, but it can be really hard. I think being able to name it helps me to feel it, but not be overwhelmed by it (which I guess is a mindfulness thing?).

Anyway, thank you for responding; I appreciate it.Thank you ❤️Oh, I see what you mean - naming it and analysing it is another way of creating distance and not fully feeling it? You’re probably right. 

I let myself get overwhelmed for like 5 minutes, and then I switch to trying to fix it, but maybe I need to just ride it out. 

I guess naming it might also be a way of trying to justify it, but I shouldn’t see it as something I need to justify - I should accept it for what it is.

You guys are so helpful! Thank you 😊
What do you mean by E5?Ah, sorry, I am not really into that enneagram type thing. It seems way too vague in my opinion.Very often ENTPs are misidentified as INTPs due to their relatively reserved nature if nothing happens to catch their interest in the moment and especially when nobody 'interesting' is around to talk or discuss with. Furthermore, the ENTP is often considered the most introverted out of the extroverted types, making them often unsure about their personality. 

Also, I'm pretty sure that many INFPs mistype themselves as anything else, especially types they would subconsciously like to identify themselves with or look up to.With a clearly underdeveloped Fi, INTP's will obviously completely rationalize their own emotions and feelings to the point of almost appearing completely disconnected from them. Very rarely will you catch a true INTP 'exploding'. The primary and most noticeable difference between an INTJ and an INTP will be the workflow when it comes to completing tasks and duties. Whereas the INTJ might feel comfortable planning ahead with an incredible amount of precision and care, the INTP will most likely procrastinate until the very last second and come up with an improvisational plan that just 'works' as it barely completes the targeted task.

Whether you believe it or not, the average INTJ is more prone to emotional outbursts than the average INTP due to the INTJ's Fi being more developed (which is also what subconsciously keeps the INTJ motivated, giving them a sense of purpose and goal). 

To me, it rather seems that you're describing an INFP who subconsciously wishes to be an INTP.How so? 

"I even type as INTJ, but I don't think that's my type."
Sounds more like Fi; the expression of your own emotions without necessarily giving any logical insight as to why that is the case.

"I've met 3 and I don't think I'm the same."
Ti generalizes and simplifies/abstracts. However, here we can see a sample size of 4 people, which is very far away from the attempt of establishing a general principle/rule.

"Everyone I know says I'm INTJ."
Fe would give more value to harmony and thus opinions of others. The Fe function is has a sort of 'giving in' mentality, whereas this is clearly Fi. 

"[...]because I am not that knowledgeable about MBTI to begin with."
Small hints of Te shimmering through; the need for empirical data and information before taking a stance. Ti behaves differently in the sense that it is applied by internal logic and thus does not necessarily require immediate external input. 

As a whole, to me it rather appears like a stronger Fi-Te axis instead. Heck, I would even consider doggymelons to be an XXFP. 

Let's take a closer look at the initial post:

"Please stop doing this"
First, Se kicked in, observing what is happening. Probably passively/subconsciously, meaning that Se is one of the weaker functions. The person then, due to the observation, felt a strong disagreement with what is happening and furthermore feels the need to do something about it, whether or not that issue is supported by actual facts or not (or even actually relevant at all), which implies a very strongly developed Fi. Following this, the said individual proceeded to take the initiative and attempt to open a discussion on it (Te), however, the post itself is very poorly structured and chaotic while pretty much exclusively relying on pseudo-citations, which means that Te is underdeveloped. It is also to note that the post itself includes various very different examples/issues that are somewhat connected, which suggest the familiar use of Ne. 

All in all, this appears to be Fi-Ne-Si-Te (INFP) with an extremely badly developed Se. 

Another hint: "Or when someone writes about a bad experience with someone and a sub dismisses the possibility of that person being the same type as them."
This could be indicating Fe as it is empathetic and focuses on harmony during discussions, however, it could also be the passive observation of other people's expression of emotions (Se --&gt; Fi) OR even self-projection due to own personal difficulties to deal with criticizing commentary (Fi --&gt; Ne).No, what I'm saying is that you're most likely an INFP who wishes to be perceived as an INFJ. You're welcome."because INFJs are special snowflakes?" - Assumption without any actual reasoning, clearly 'Fi --&gt; Ne' and not the work of 'Ti' (which would have been the case if you were an INFJ). An INFJ would have taken that possibility into consideration all the while avoiding expressing their own emotion to that extent. As I mentioned previously, INFJs tend to be more 'giving in' due to their strongly developed Fe, which makes them neglect their Fi (in general, they try very hard to appear indifferent to others). 

"You think I am INFP based off ONE FUCKING POST" - It was two posts to be exact, so again, definitely not the work of Ti. It's again probably related to the underdeveloped Se.

Overall, there is not much to analyze, your whole post is filled with screaming Fi, which I find a little unfitting and childish as I was trying to help you out, not insult you in any way. However it seems that my comment was 'offending' your own personal 'values' and ideas (Fi by the way), so I deeply apologize for my terrifyingly honest comment. Keep it up, princess.oooooooooooooooh, now you're getting backup because you can't even defend your own identity! damn, you've clearly beaten me! respect!

and to this fuccfas guy, you don't agree with doggy being an INFP and yet you don't give any reasoning. basically, your comment is completely irrelevant and only serves one purpose: reassuring doggy of her initial beliefs. good job mate, proud of you."you're shit at logic" - lack of reasoning. OK BUDDY
"I said I don't agree with INFP, not that I think she's an INFJ." - yes and where did I say that you did something else?
"I agree with Komatik, she falls on the Fe-Ti axis imo." - lack of reasoning. OK BUDDY
"and fyi, she summoned me for a different reason." - SUREOHHH NICE you mastermind you! are you sure you're not an INTJ??? haha you got me you trickster!!!

//sarcasm = off

protip: i replied to you out of boredom and you took my pseudo-intelligent replies so seriously that you needed back-up from your buddy. it's pretty pathetic, no matter what type you are.

protip #2: sure, call me an INFP. it's easier to hide from an unpleasant reality rather than face it head on.Are you seriously that dense? I do hope that you did understand he was being sarcastic and thus decided to reply sarcastically too.

I really do hope so.........As a child, I was very outgoing, very emotional and easily angered. Though, I've always been very curious and testing my limits when it comes to rules and boundaries. Nowadays, I've 'settled down' a bit, I guess.To be honest, I don't think anyone should take infographs like these seriously. Their 'source' is a 'Career Assessment Site' with no further explanations given on how these statistics were made. Mere online studies are definitely not reliable enough, if that is what they used.

Interestingly enough, a study in 1998 (by Myers et. al.) shows that, for example, ENTP's are among the highest paid types while also being among the most dissatisfied with their salaries. Personally, I'd say it's due to our overconfident nature, thinking we have strongly unrecognized talent. 'If only I actually tried, none of you could compete.', at least in my point of view.Honestly, I've never told another person to be 'normal' in my whole life. Quite the contrary, I enjoy broken ways and broken minds, things that are out of the ordinary. Ironically, my ISTJ mother always used to criticize my actions for 'not being normal', so I'd say that the people you're describing are either strong Te or strong Si users, not ENTPs. Strong Fi users. 'B-B-B-BUT I'M A SNOWFLAKE!!! AAAAAAAAAH!'

At least that's how I generalize their attitude. Somewhere I read that the key to confidence is walking into a room and already assuming that everyone likes you.

And I just do that naturally. Of course I don't seriously think that everybody likes me, but the thought is pleasant and the resulting confidence I get from this seems to resonate well with others, so might as well just 'talk myself into being confident'.ESTPs on the internet are very limited with the tools they're so used to in real life. They are those ingenious photographers without a camera, which is why they are extremely underappreciated on the internet, unfortunately. However, one my friends in high school and one of my aunts are both ESTP and if there's one thing I can say about them, it's that there is no better type for social encounters. They easily talk about the wildest topics, no matter how irrelevant that topic might appear to me, without appearing bored at all with at least 3 other participants all the while having numerous jokes to go along with the anecdotes. They are great at body language and generally make conversations fun for everybody, which is something I truly respect and appreciate. Most of the people seem to harmonize with, look up to or just 'love' them. They are truly lovely personalities. 

Personally, I've been very doubtful of my own personality, which allegedly or seemingly seems to be the ENTP type, but I can at times sympathize or relate to other types such as ESTP, ISTP, INTJ, INTP and even INFP. However, most people in real life seem to describe me as entertaining, witty, self-confident and charming, which seems to fit the ENTP the best. Personally, if I could chose, I would wish to not have any type and have the ability to understand all of them, use their benefits in any given situation when needed. Balance seems the goal, at least to me.I don't really know any INFJs. All I know is that every INFP that I've met so far considers themselves being so different from the rest of the world and special that it makes me want to shoot myself.
ENTP here; can confirm that I do this too. On occasion, I've walked past good friends, looking them directly in the face without recognising them.
I agree with those who have suggested [Keys 2 Cognition](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm).They're great listeners.  They're always really easy company.  They make the best road trip partners ever.  On the flip side, they can be a little flaky.  They never commit to anything and sometimes you have to drag them from their cave and force them to have a good time (well, my idea of a good time).  Source: my bride and best man are both INFPs.Yeah.  They get along really well.  He and my other best friend - an INFJ - are two of the only people she's okay with dropping by at almost any time.  They don't exhaust her as much as most other people.  We also have at least two more INFP friends and another INFJ.  I am the INF whisperer.Why would I take offense to that?  It's true.  Amorality is not a bad thing, it just means that I do not agree with some internal or external subjective measurement before deciding on the best option for a given problem.  I tend to do the moral thing anyway; I just don't think about it like that.This is just the nature of INFPs.  You either accept that or you move on to someone else.  They prefer to live their monastic lifestyle. The way you or I enjoy a good party is similar to the way they enjoy weeks of quiet contemplation and focus on their art.  This solitude recharges them.  When they feel the need to come out of their cave, you will see them again.  And because they share our perceiving nature, they just adapt.  They love the one their with.  So for them, there was never a break in the relationship.  They always appreciate your company and the role you play in their life, but they will never need the social life the way we do.  This rhythm is perfectly healthy and normal for them.  They are flaky as all hell sometimes, but you have to love them for that.

None of the burnout.The volume gets turned up to 11.  I am LOUD, but jovial.  It works like a truth serum and I will tell you just about anything about myself that you want to know.

Friends and Lovers: INFP and INFJAny two stable and mature individuals can make a relationship work, but some combinations have more pitfalls than others.

Pros: You both have strong value systems.  You both seek adventure, creativity, and sensation.  If you have a number of values and goals in common, this could create a great basis for a relationship.  I have seen worse pairing.

Cons: Communication could prove very difficult.  Intuitives and sensor speak different languages and the effort of translation places an obstacle between you.  Also with two IxxPs, neither of you will speak up about your needs or address an issue until it has become a major problem.  

Furthermore, with so many similarities, you also share many of the same weaknesses.  Who speaks up for the couple? Who plans the adventures?  Who remembers to pay the bills? What happens when you're both having a particularly moody day for no reason at the same time? Who brings a calming presence to the relationship when you feel like panicking? 

You can definitely create a happy relationship out of these two types, but the odds are against you.  In the average case, I would predict a wonderful honeymoon period, a lovely fling, followed by a messy and emotional breakup within 6 months to a year.My verbal and logical intelligence are certainly not low, but I typically score highest in spatial and musical.  Both involve pattern recognition, a strength of Ne types.ExxPs run so fast sometimes because we're trying to keep ahead of our own personal demons.

I find them very attractive on other people in moderation.I would unless he or she has MMA or Krav Maga training.No.  This does sound like a fairly accurate generalization about perceiving types and judging types, at least in regards to intellectual specialization.  Si delves into the depth of your own past and Ni delves into the depth of your own imagination.  Se looks at the breadth of the observations around themselves.  While Ne observes the breadth of trends and connections in systems. I am a social libertarian (7.22 left, 6.04 libertarian).

I'm about a 7 towards non-interventionist and a 9 towards culturally liberal.One of my best friends is an NTJ.  He labels himself a "capitalist," but most of his philosophies are very libertarian.  I feel like the States would be a much nicer place if me and my Democratic Socialist friends took over the blue party and he and his scientific capitalist compatriots took over the red party.  That's a push and pull I could live with.I'm only Chaotic Neutral when I'm in a bad mood.  Typically, I hang out at Chaotic Good.  I can even reach Neutral Good on the rare occasions when I'm feeling particularly benevolent.Anecdotally, I will say that two of my best friends are INFPs.

The first, my best man, is great for a good conversation on music, Hokie football, theology, board games, comics, and just a host of other great things.  The second is a graphic artist and amateur improv comedian.  He's often so quiet, but can come out of nowhere with a one liner that has all of us rolling.

After my wife, they're two of my favorite people to road trip with, especially to a good concert.  Our shared Ne tends to lead to interest in similar topics but for different reasons.

They can be flaky, but I would never call them boring.That definitely TL;DR.  Stereotypes ahead: 

The INFP is trying too hard to be unique and genuine (but they get closer than most and I love them for it).

The ISFP is a about to do something incredibly stupid like get into that car with strangers offering candy, but they'll come out on the other side completely fine with a great story about the time they road tripped with the band Willy and the Wonkas.

The ISTP is trying to kill you.  Probably with sarcasm and snide comments, but possibly with bullets and sharp objects.

The INTP just posted a screenshot of how they reached 1000 hours of gameplay on CKII or WOW.Oh, it's definitely pot to kettle for me.  I only have 470 on CKII, but I did break 1000 on Civ V.Economic Axis: Equality 75%

In general, INFs are excellent conversationalists.  They ask interesting questions.  They're the perfect foil to my random adventures.  

INFPs never try to control me or change me.  They love me for who I am.

My wife is an INFP.  My other best friend is an INFP.  (And the third is an INFJ.)  My first thought was accountant, but that's worse.Cleaning is pretty bad and we're not very effective in that role, but at least it doesn't require mental or emotional involvement.  If you put your body on autopilot and download some good podcasts, it's doable.    I think accounting, data entry, bureaucracy, and hospice care would all prove much, much worse. Favorite: 4X strategy games like Civilization and CKII.

Also Like: Tactics (XCOM), Sports (NCAA Football, FIFA)

Least Favorite: Fighters. I am mediocre at best and usually far worse.This sounds very reasonable.  Two thoughts:

- Shyness often gets mistaken for introversion, but they are two different things.  Introverts get energy from solace with their own thoughts and feelings.  Individuals who demonstrate shyness  - both introverted and extroverted - exhibit a lack of confidence.

- I also tested as an introvert in high school due to psychological baggage.  I moved in the fifth grade and had difficulty making new friends after that.  As my teen years progressed, I grew depressed from a lack of close friends and a lack of frequent social interaction.  This resulted in a lack of energy which just made me more withdrawn and repeated the cycle.  So when I took the MBTI for the first couple of years, I tested as an introvert, but the test picked up on my depression, not introversion.  It wasn't until I started developing really close friendships in college that I really started testing as the extrovert I am.

This goes back to my biggest gripe with MBTI and Jungian Psychology.  As much as I love the utility of the system, the tests are often garbage.Mom and Dad: Authoritative

Parents divorced when I was 10,  I lived with my mom who soon remarried.

Mom's Second Husband: AuthoritarianI showed this to my INFP.  She loled.Well, I definitely represent some of the typically "masculine" things.  I love sports.  I was an infantryman in the Army.  I worked as a carpenter for four years.  I like when I can fix something on my car on my own.

But I also don't limit myself.  I enjoy dance: I watch videos on youtube often and I've seen at least half a dozen seasons of *So You Think You Can Dance* all the way through.  I, too, like female fronted bands and I'll always defend '00s emo among my other varied tastes.

Spouse of almost a decade: INFP 4w5NPs can be very political.  I'm very politically inclined to the point of canvassing during elections before.  My INTP friend worked as an organizer and is now a union employee.  Even the INFPs and ENFPs have strongly held values that can lead to political involvement, particularly for their favorite causes.

NJs have a vision of their ideal world and may see politics as a way to achieve it.  SPs may see politics as a fun game with winners and losers, and the STPs certainly have strong opinions.  

I think the SJs might be the least likely to be politically involved.  They might vote out of a sense of duty, but they prefer to seek out the consensus on many issues and align themselves with that viewpoint.  They may be the centrist seeking the status quo.  Since they have no strongly held opinions of their own (other than wishing the loudly political would just fall in line), they may not really seek out political involvement unless pressed into it by their social circle.I would be happy to stay in there until all of the hot water runs out.  But typically I'm running late for class or work and it's closer to ten minutes.That's why you sleep with one.[I wrote on this a few years ago.](https://aroomofrequirement.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/the-sorting-hat-of-harry-potter-and-myers-briggs-personality-typology/)  I had difficulty finding my house and I noted that the sorting hat often gives people a choice.  So I gave each type a primary and secondary house based on their primary and secondary function. Thus (Edit, I'm now realizing that the posted chart is just a more confusing version of my chart without giving me credit):

|Type|Primary House|Secondary House|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ENTP|Gryffindor|Ravenclaw|
|INTP|Ravenclaw|Gryffindor|
|ENTJ|Slytherin|Ravenclaw|
|INTJ|Ravenclaw|Slytherin|
|INFP|Hufflepuff|Gryffindor|
|ENFP|Gryffindor|Hufflepuff|
|ENFJ|Hufflepuff|Ravenclaw|
|INFJ|Ravenclaw|Hufflepuff|
|ISTP|Ravenclaw|Gryffindor|
|ESTP|Gryffindor|Ravenclaw|
|ESFP|Gryffindor|Hufflepuff|
|ISFP|Hufflepuff|Gryffindor|
|ESTJ|Slytherin|Slytherin|
|ISTJ|Slytherin|Slytherin|
|ESFJ|Hufflepuff|Slytherin|
|ISFJ|Slytherin|Hufflepuff|

&amp;#x200B;

But in the last six years, I've learned more about the functions and I have a  much better understanding of the houses.  I took the Pottermore quiz: it put me in Ravenclaw and I now realize there's no way I would be happy in Gryffindor.  So I'm considering a rewrite.  My new working hypothesis looks like this:

|Type|Primary House|Secondary House|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ENTP, INTJ|Ravenclaw|Slytherin|
|INTP, ENTJ|Slytherin|Ravenclaw|
|INFP|Hufflepuff|Ravenclaw|
|ENFP|Ravenclaw|Hufflepuff|
|ENFJ|Gryffindor|Ravenclaw|
|INFJ|Ravenclaw|Gryffindor|
|ISTP|Slytherin|Gryffindor|
|ESTP|Gryffindor|Slytherin|
|ESFP, ESFJ|Gryffindor|Hufflepuff|
|ISFP, ISFJ|Hufflepuff|Gryffindor|
|ESTJ|Slytherin|Huffepuff|
|ISTJ|Hufflepuff|Slytherin|

Which do you believe is more accurate?Probably my bias against SJs (I didn't care much for my mom's ISTJ second husband).  They're in Hufflepuff in the rewrite I'm considering.Yeah.  Gryffindor really doesn't work, does it?  At the time, I'd only read the books.  I have a fuller understanding of the houses after spending a little bit of time on Pottermore.ENTP

BS in Psychology and History

MA in English

Currently working towards a BS (and maybe a master's, too) in Civil EngineeringFunding has definitely been interesting. First Bachelor's was the GI Bill and grants. First Master's was GI Bill and $30,000 in loans. This degree is thanks to a full Army Corps of Engineers scholarship and stipend.I'd sooner stay single than have a long term relationship with an SJ.  I would be miserable.That surprises me a little, but I'll freely admit that my bias is strongly colored by poor relationships I've had with SJs in the past (my mom's second husband was an ISTJ).  On a purely theoretical basis, I would think that most S v N relationships would have an extra barrier to communication, concrete versus abstract language, that would make a relationship more difficult.  Eh.  Lack of focus eventually makes us our own worst enemy.Four of the measurements in the Big Five also correlate highly with the four dichotomies of MBTI.  However, while MBTI remains neutral, the Big Five picks a side and suggests that ENFJs are the only truly healthy type (and God help those horrible ISTPs).They do things like sleep and need solitude for recharge.  I come to Reddit to avoid the boredom between the fun bits of life.Silence is soooo boring.  I really wish I didn't have a physical need for sleep.And you just described my hell. This is how people would torture me to try to get information from me.You show a strong preference for introverted feeling (Fi).  You also show a strong secondary preference for intuition (N).  Your four letter type is most likely INFP.  One of my favorite types BTW.ExTP, INFP, INTJ

And Winston's an xSTJFrom those results, I would expect ENFP.  Dominant Ne and secondary Fi would strongly suggest that type. From the more traditional MBTI format, your T-F preference is borderline, but that may just be socialization if you're a western male. In the west at least, men are encouraged to be more T and women are encouraged to be more F, often in conflict with their inborn personality.Sometimes the haughtier religious types just need to be taken down a peg.Depends on the type.  NFPs were always full speed ahead for me.  I always avoided the SJs,The memes circle is my kind of party.One of my really good friends is an NTJ.  I've never seen such wildly different viewpoints on politics so respectfully discussed.  Of course it helps that we both acknowledge science.Lol.  I've been called out.I married one.  10/10.  Would marry again.Married to one for seven years and counting.  Good choice.That's all kinds of bullshit.  Anything that puts us within 100 ft of a romantic relationship with an SJ has to be all kinds of wrong.  And ENFJs aren't always much better.  Far more "supervisory" than an INFP.I thought I had some baggage (mom's second husband was an abusive ISTJ), but the airlines are charging you extra.

As much as I've tried, I have very few hard and fast rules about relationship pairings.  The only one I hold near sacred is that S and N don't mix.  Communication is vital to a healthy and successful relationship and Sensors and Intuitives speak vastly different languages.  Relationships are difficult enough as it is without adding that extra barrier.  

NTPs, specifically, require a mindmate, someone who inspires and excites us intellectually.  SPs can at least provide a modicum of spontaneity before the relationship inevitably implodes.  SJs are boring from the start and their constant expectation that the NT conform to societal norms is tiresome at best.  I don't need anyone to help me develop my inferior functions.  As a mature ENTP, I have worked to develop these on my own.  I needed someone heading along the same path in life; not someone for whom I would be a project.  Among the Ns, I recommend my type avoids other NTPs as that tends to double weaknesses and encourages burnout.  

Among the remaining pairings, I could argue for and against each.  The NTJs provide a wonderful intellectual challenge, but it can be difficult to establish an emotional connection.  NFJs challenge us to become the best version of ourselves, but that can prove stressful if we have a history of overbearing or perfectionist parental figures.  NFPs are wonderfully adventurous, but your life will be a little more haphazard.  Find what works for you.

As for me, I have been married to a mature INFP for 7 years and we have a wonderful relationship.  It's everything I could have asked for.  Just because a childish ENTP burned you, does not mean that a particular relationship is doomed.Sometimes you have to burn it all down to have the space to build something great.Sounds about rightWe're those kids that "totally didn't study at all for this test" and still pull a 93 out of our ass.It was business as usual when I studied history/psychology/English, but I had to do an overhaul when I went back for Civil Engineering.Nah.  Those are my favorite people.I think extroverts have it easier than introverts.  Our society encourages everyone to be more E and does not provide as many healthy spaces for I.

S is probably easier than N.  They're in the majority and they tend to find it easier to take the world as it is rather than what it could be.

Due to socialization in the west, a male T and a female F will each find it easier to live within the expectations set for them.  Outside of socialization though, I don't know that either would have a clear advantage, depending on how the traits are used.  T might make it easier to plan and problem solve as problems arise, but F might have a more robust social network to fall back on in the face of difficulties.

I find that P produces a lot less stress than J.  When healthy, we tend to adapt well to whatever comes our way.  P rolls with the punches.  J is far more brittle.  They plan ahead so much because they sometimes freeze up or collapse when something large and unexpected disrupts their environment.

This would lead me to conclude that **ESxPs** have it the easiest.  And most that I've met do seem to just float along through life.Monopoly is an awful game, but I got very good as it playing with my family through my teens.  It's a pretty simple game, you just need to be as aggressive as possible: buy everything you touch, try to force through a trade to get the first Monopoly, and build as much as possible even if appears to put you in a dangerous financial position.  There are some other nuances, but it's really just a game about being first to market.  In that regard, it's a fairly accurate representation of capitalism.&gt;Immature  XNTX

I often call my INFP wife "my dryad."  Totally getting that vibe here.This applies to all NPs.I have a family now that keeps me on schedule, but between my Junior and Senior year during my first trip through college, I had no internship, no job, no classes, and no responsibilities of any kind.  I fell into this strange 30 hour routine where I would play video games for the better part of 20 hours and then slept for 10 or so hours.  It was awesome, but I could never predict whether I would be diurnal or nocturnal on any given date.I did that one summer.  Strange and disorienting but also awesomely liberating.I don't know.  This looks like TP malicious compliance to me.It would be a total clusterfuck in the lead up, but we'd miraculously pull it out at the last second with a flawed but generally good performance.This is so true.  Zero self-discipline until someone else is relying on me.It took a long time for me to realize my own charm.  I think my wife pointed it out to me when we were dating.  It's not anything we can manipulate or weaponize.  We're just so unabashedly into what we're into that certain people get sucked into the gravity of our passions.Thank you.  Everything you said about us was completely accurate and it's refreshing to have someone on this sub not shit on us for once.I think most of the people on the ENTP sub are 17.  We can show *some* of the negative stereotypes before we're fully formed, but a mature ENTP should grow out of most of the idiocy eventually.They're not really my ty... Oh, wait...Shit.  If I find an ENTP being racist or saying racist things to be provocative, I'm gonna slap 'em around a little.  That's unacceptable on any level.  We police our own; unlike cops.Nah.  Punching fascists works.  Should probably work on racists too.Most of the tests are bullshit.  I've studied MBTI for 20 years and I've known I was an ENTP for 18 or 19 of that.

Racism, fascism: these aren't disagreements.  These are moral failings.  Such people should not be allowed a platform.  They should be opposed at every turn, up to and including non-lethal violence.My INFP wife has told me this many times.Honestly, it's not any worse than most tests.  The others thought I was an ISTP in high school, too.I do not at all feel confident in my ability to lie, so I rarely if ever try it.  I find radical honesty works so much better at being an effective bludgeon for getting what I want.  But maybe that's why my infrequent lies so often work.  I'm the last person most people would expect it from.  I've built up such large stockpile of truth that I can wager against it from time to time when absolutely necessary.That ENTP was me in college.We always have the rough outline of a plan.  We just don't tell anyone about it and we reserve the right to change it at a moment's notice if something new comes up.  The plan is more guidelines than rules.While I definitely loved me some GTA: San Andreas, I don't think of it as a quintissential ENTP game.

Those with the functions we lack can be insulted if their reputation (Te) or their beliefs and individuality (Fi) are attacked.  We don't really value those things, so we don't really consider personal insults.No.

I don't know if any amount of money could ever cover up the guilt and the the post-traumatic stress.

Reddit: NT dominatedI love you too, fam.And everyone knows, that all ENTPs are jobless tinfoil hat wearing neckbeards, that loves wearing "MAGA" hats, and are #1 fans of Alex Jones.Now that's what I call edgy.&gt; considering their 300+ IQ

I'm not Rick &amp; Morty fan. 'nuff said.Kind of awkward to ask this but, does anyone know what are the MBTI types of Joji "FilthyFrank", Max "maxmoefoe" , Ian "iDubbbz", and "Fat Cunt"/anything4views?[Some background](https://youtu.be/GxnL9QlXcI8)INTJ

My parents' wedding tape still gives me shivers.
Yes. You just described a stereotypical ENTPINFJ, ENTP, ESFP/ENFP, ISFJ? An MBTI extravert doesn't mean extravert in the stereotypical social sense. It means that your dominant cognitive function is extraverted in nature. An ENTP is a good example of a socially introverted MBTI extravert, an ENTP can satisfy its extraverted intuition by playing games or even reading a book. Of course, any type can be socially introverted/extraverted it's just more unusual to see a socially introverted ENFJ.I, E, N, S, T, F, P, and J aren't functions though, they're...letters. The functions are: Ne, Se, Ni, Si, Fe, Fi, Te, TiGoogle couldn't give me a proper answer in 5 seconds, can anyone quickly explain what Ilvermorny is and where the hell it comes from? &gt;INFJs have an equal amount of pros and cons.

You named 4 pros and 3 cons, shame on you! For the love of God PLEASE stop using MBTI to excuse irrationality. There's no such thing as "Fi being too strong", you may have a preference for Fi but any single person can use any function if they make a conscious effort to do so. So instead of being mad at your brother, try to find out exactly WHY he sided against you and what you can do to improve yourself to keep that from happening.Puppies pose an existential threat to kittens, therefore they must be annihilated. Judging by your irrational and fanatical behavior the chances of your child growing up to be a terrorist who kills a million people are about 0.1%. Which means that by killing him we are foregoing a 0.1% risk of a million people dying, 10^6 *0.001=10^3. Therefore by killing your child we are effectively saving 1000 people, the profit margin being 999 people. Now where's my gun? Just because it's not "easily swayed" doesn't mean that you can use it as an excuse to be irrational. 

Then every Ti dom would just be like "sorry honey but I can't tell you that I love you because love is just a chemical reaction and I can't be sure whether or not it's still ongoing, we cool though?" Deductive reasoning isn't subjective, it is BY DEFINITION objective. 
In fact it's the ONLY thing that's objective. And your feelings don't want you to become a better person? This is an example of deductive reasoning:

All humans are mortal. 

Socrates is a human. 

Therefore Socrates is mortal. 

Deductive reasoning in itself is objective, your premise may be false but your conclusion based on your premise is always true.You become a better human by admitting your mistakes and trying to fix them. 

Your brother pointed your mistakes out to you. 

By pointing out your mistakes he made you aware of them, thus making it possible for you to fix them. 

Therefore your brother facilitated the process of you becoming a better person. 

I'm pretty sure that someone as close to you as your brother is the ideal person to decide that. Dominant function with the opposite direction (introversion vs extraversion), so Fi with a "different attitude" is Fe. Too soon dude, too soon. Seems legit. INFP because you forgot to mention them (and obviously nobody on the Internet is an ISFP... Obviously). Way too lovey-dovey to be an ENTP (S)He used the words "love" and "kind" more than once while describing others, that counts as "too lovey-dovey" by ENTP standards That's just your dominant Ne going batshit crazy. On a good day it'll find a direct connection between cats and Donald Trump's foreign policy. Pretty sure that an INFP would get bored writing that and randomly start singing a song they heard on the radio when they were 4.Don't think so, he actually believes the bullshit he's saying I'd just read personalityjunkie.com, it has a description of each type and explains how each function manifests itself in that type He's saying that it doesn't matter whether or not an INFP is a live death star, they're still Fi/Te while INTPs are Ti/Fe and the functional distinction make their differences obvious. &lt;startdebate&gt;

ENTP and INFJ 

&lt;/startdebate&gt;You people do realize that I was making fun of the ENTP/INFJ "best match" stereotype...Right? And how did you deduce that there isn't a gap between type frequencies? No I was just wondering why you made the claim, I'm fairly certain that there is a gap between the frequencies of personality type solely based on the very obvious N/S divide. Being able to make connections and "see the familiar in everything" is a Ne-Si trait so... Yes.Not really... 

Though I'm pretty sure that the woman is a Fi user No. Or at the very least replace them Yes. In fact, forget the blackjack! ENTP. Joe's Garage just screams Ne. You can just use your knowledge of MBTI to get ANY RESULT you want though, just identify which questions are testing which dichotomies and answer accordingly. I actually kept getting ESTP instead, so I wouldn't be too sure about that. You're an INFJ aren't you? (S)He said cognitive function, not personality type. Omfg, what an INFP rant, this has Fi written all over it! 

/sHe gave an example, how in Satan's glorious name do you know that it's "not true"? He didn't claim to have proven anything, he just gave an example. You're not making any logical sense *at all*. He gave an example, he did not claim to have proven anything. You on the other hand said that what he said was "not true". Which could only mean that his EXAMPLE was not true, you did not prove that his example was not true. 

Then I proceeded to explain the absurdity of your actions. Now you're claiming that I made an assumption without having proven it, despite that *not actually happening*. 

Please explain how I'm the one not making logical sense? One in a million intuitives will change the world, but the world would've stopped spinning by now if wasn't for sensors. No, the more Ns they have the bigger the chance is that they disagree about a plan and end up murdering each other. tldr; Sensors are more practical while intuitives have better abstract thinking You're an INTP. Ni would figure out that someone left the bottle there because he/she didn't want to walk around with a water bottle and look like an idiot Those aren't functions, those are dichotomies. The functions for an INFP are Fi-Ne-Si-TeThis is a good intro to the theory behind MBTI: 

http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/

And this is a pretty good function test:

http://keys2cognition.com/explore.htmYou could also be an INFJ, try reading both type descriptions and try to find out whether you identify more with Fi or Fe. You're incredibly indecisive, ergo INFP. He's trolling, you fit the ENTJ stereotype perfectly. What's in it for you?The point is that cognitive function theory doesn't say that Fi users can't be compassionate and that Ne users can't smell things. INFPs mistyping as INFJs was just a good example to help get the point across.    Again, my point is regarding function theory and INFPs mistyping as INFJs is just an example of that. Obviously not everyone who's been mistyped as an INFJ is an INFP, how did you reach that conclusion?  That was the point. It was supposed to seem like it was directed at just INFPs and then I brought up my own type to make it obvious that it was about the misconceptions surrounding function theory in general. He's doing a /r/iamverysmart parody

Typical ISFP who can't understand the big picture...  /s/s means sarcasm. I thought you'd get it anyway but I ended up adding it just in case lolSo how was the rain? Saying "I can't be an INFP because I'm compassionate and therefore must have Fe" is like saying that you can't be an ENTP because you can smell things and therefore must have Se. 

Everyone has a nose and everyone has a heart, get over it. 

Except for INTJs, they've already replaced both with better robotic versions.
Which testament

and god as a whole or god as the trinity just wondering 
dont have an answer just wondering lolthanks :) now I will watch and see if anyone answers Got entp on both but the test seem to be unreliable at some points Sorry for the late thing but it was basically the same thing as what borscht party. I can easily be manipulated unconsciously to answer who I would like to be not who I am. 

Like I am an artist so when I do a self portrait I can find my self fixing parts of fast rather than just drawing it. May you please show me a link I have no idea what you are talking about. I can be both in certain situations. I can be individualistic when I want to be but when I see a better opportunity with someone else I will take it. I try to be analytical first (base on a principle I have) bit info comes to me in an instant and I get it usually easily. The most recent decisions I have made I have basically made a t chart either in my head or on paper to show the cons and pros. Then weigh them and see which is the best. So I guess I am being pragmatic thinking of what is the best option base on the probability happening and using my NE to imagine what will happen. Basically creating stories that are most likely to happen then go based on that. -ask what happened and why he broke up with you
-ask if your dog is dead and if he isnt ask if you need some help taking him to the vet.
-just try to get a read on the situation then prob go and talk to her ex either in person or calling and texting to get his side of it (i have trust issues even with people I know well, because someone close to me lied alot and I realized even people who are close will try to manipulate you.)
-Make the most logical decision based on the information that I have. 


So mostly helping by actions and then trying to get a read on the situation so I can make the best decision. I wouldnt really comfort to me that feels weird. I like to fix the problem not make you feel better. Because if you dont fix the problem you might keep on having that problem. But if you fix it or make it the best it can be at the moment that helps alot more then say "oh I feel so bad for you."  

and if I cant do any actions I will prob talk to them. Ask them question about how they are feeling trying to get them to look at their own emotions and see why they are feeling this way. Why this all happened. And what they could do since at the moment I cannot do anything. &gt;To me, this sounds Fi-Te (righteous indignation then action with expected final result)

Its not that I am having a major emotional reaction. Like from that example I gave before. When I found out (through reasoning then asking others) I barely felt any anger or sadness. I just thought I do not want this person in my life because I cannot trust them at all. They did betray me but I'm wasn't angry that they betray me I just thought this relationship will not work unless I can trust you which I cannot. 


&gt;Ti-Fe (comiseration and theoretical problem solving, but no real action)

I do have sympathy for others its just that I understand that I am not very good at helping them in an emotional way and that I can do a better job by helping them or helping them help themselves. 
Lol this might give you some thought. I want to be a politician so I can help people and help my city/state/country. I've never wanted to be a politician to get the dirty money (even though it would probably be easy). I want to be a politician because I want to help the system not help people who are struggling in the system. And by helping the system I can help the people. I just see it as hitting the source.


&gt;Also, when I hear "trust issues" I think Fi, because someone betrayed a personal value.

Its wasn't really because she broke a personal value. I just felt this isn't going to work if I can't trust your words and even who you are. And when I meant trust issues it was more that I dont take anyones word as the exact truth until proven.  
 
&gt;I was talking to someone I didn't trust, I wouldn't care about the whole story, I would just listen and offer a solution for them to do then gtfo before acquiring any responsibility, emotional or otherwise.

I was talking about someone I knew personally.
If It was someone I didn't really know or didn't really care about I would pretty much do the same thing except I would make it clear that I won't give any emotional support and that I am just telling them how to get rid of the problem. 

I just wanted to explain alittle more. 

FUCK YES!!! NIHILISM!!!!Well I guess he can change it to pretty much say this. 

Title: Why do you believe or not believe in God. 

Why do you believe or not believe in God. I am wondering this based on your MTBI type to see if the reasons have a relationship with the type. Darker than Nigerian's ass crack, some shock humor, the extremely dark stuff that is honestly not suppose to be funny but I find that it is, and finally laughing at the meaningless of the world and the stupidity of humans. Idk why I just find it funny, I laugh at my own dad's death I'm all kinds of fucked up 0_o lmao XD (and I love it).Now I am guessing its the 

&gt;the extremely dark stuff that is honestly not suppose to be funny but I find that it is, and finally laughing at the meaningless of the world and the stupidity of humans.

Now lets go through them and why I find them funny.

1) I need some help because I a fucking psycho. 
 
or 

2) I am a nihilist and I use laughter to comfort the dull and meaninglessness nothing of this world. That is universe is a cruel joke and I just find that cruel joke funny. Just like a joke about 9/11 (the Janga shit whenever I see the video I think that and chuckle a bit). I have realized I cannot change what happened to my father. I realize I have no power and why be sad about things I cannot change. So I laugh. If you don't cry because of this then you laugh or do not care. I am nothing just like you a speck of dust in this cosmic shit basket. And I find humor in this because we all think that we are special that we deserve an afterlife, especially since we are just selfish, dumb beings only living the tiniest of tiniest slivers of the whole span of the universe. 

Here is a little from a essay I have due on Wednesday. "He came over in his car five minutes later. After he fully realized that our father was dead. He started screaming and bawling with an extreme mixture of sadness and rage. He broke down on the driveway sobbing. 
Back then it was sad to see that happen to my older brother but now it's kind of funny and interesting. Not funny in a comedic way but funny in the way that we can be changed into an incoherent mess of emotion. How we are controlled by these chemicals and neurons in our heads. That these emotions can make us do something so idiotic and childish. Make us into a portrait of a sniveling child. 
The weird thing about me now is that I look at the stupidity and absurdity of humans and this world and just find it so funny. Even when I am saddened or broken down I find myself chuckling at the meaningless of it all. The meaningless and irrationality of our emotions and the trivialness of the impact we make in this universe."

....."During the funeral and after I was just going through the motions I didn’t cry. I honestly didn’t really care. I was just living my life. He was part of it now he isn’t. A chapter within my life. I just turned the page. Continued reading, continued living. 
Now I have to ask, have you lost someone. If you haven’t imagined a friend, sibling, a parent. Now imagine dying, imagine how you would feel. Imagine the pain and how long it would take you to finally accept their death. Years, months, weeks, or days. I myself got rid of most of my sorrow in a week. Most emotions for me burn brightly and die quickly. I guess I’m lucky. Through these 2 years though I have changed in a massive amount. I have turned into my own person. Being who I want to be, learning about life and shedding my old life. 
I have changed and adopted atheism and nihilism. I’ve become something different most expect from me. My thoughts now on my father show that. Before I had the faith that my father would be in heaven. That he was looking over me and my family like a guardian angel. Well, no he’s dead. That’s it, he is just dead, no special meaning, no afterlife. No angels, no reincarnation, and definitely no fear of an eternal punishment from a supposedly all-loving god. He is just dead. His remains are in the ocean where it is probably either eaten or on the seabed to become rock. 
That’s what all of us are an assembly of atoms that has been from stars and asteroids. Now these thoughts don’t fully explain my position on my father. Yes, I do miss him. I loved him he was my father. Whenever he came back from work I would hug him around his waist. He was always out working for a long time sometimes more than a week and always came late. I would love for him to come back but I can’t and I am not going to trick myself into thinking that I will see him again. There is no afterlife, death is just a natural process of which I have no power to stop. 
Why be sad over these things you can’t stop? That will just cause an endless amount of sorrow. So I have hardened my heart. Anyway, sadness is just a chemical reaction in one's head. Once you realize that your emotions are just that it's quite easy to understand that they aren’t that special. Let me ask this, why be sad when you don’t want to be? Why be sad when you don’t have to be, why be sad when you can’t change it all? Just accept it and continue living your meaningless life."

This is alittle of what goes on in my head. I use laughter to get through the destruction of our lives just like some one would use sadness. Do I have to be the same as others being a pitiful baby and crying because I or others can't live forever. I dont think I have to be I see no problem with it. 



Now is that insane, do I need help for those thoughts? 

I laugh at the uncertainty, I laugh at the idiocy and down right evilness of humans and this world. Its just my way of getting through it. 


Now that you have read this, do I need help? Or do I just have a different view then yours. Looking through a different window, going through through different experiences. 


I am glad you said the comment that you did. Now I can tell you more about how I feel rather than hiding behind a down vote button and not trying to understand like a fool. 


I would love to hear what you have to say for that. 

And if you are wondering I do have emotions I'm human. They just burn bright and die quickly. 
 
&gt;First sentence was funny, but got dark really quickly

Thank you :) for both parts.

lol :) 

you may be imagining me saying this incorrectly but I do enjoy your comment. Now you don't know how to fill out a questionnaire do you?not really surprised I do wonder what signs of god you have seen though. Because I must be blind.&gt;The beauty in this planet, the universe

How is that proof of god existing in any shape or form?

&gt;imagine if you were in space you would feel so small in comparison to the Creator

Kinda have to believe in a creator to feel that. But you might be talking about the universe as a whole. yes we are small. Just like ants feel when they are in our house. 

&gt;the structure of your body will shrink and whitout the oxigen reseve you would die

Ye  because you are outside the specific conditions that allow you to live. When fish (who isnt able to breathe for a limited rime or just breathes air) comes out of water it dies. Air is our water. 

&gt;we should be more humble and stop creating things on our own

Neah I would like people to not stop creating a cure for cancer. I mean at lesat some of those scientist are atheist correct? Doing it alone still wouldnt want them to stop. 

&gt;being so materialistic

Definition: excessively concerned with material possessions; money-oriented.

Only if it creates a problem for someone else. If I want something and steal it that is morally bad, if I want something and buy it that is seen as morally better than what I said before. I am still concerned with a material possession but I getting it without hurting someone else. 

And way money makes the world go around. 

&gt;the human civilization is the one that is destroying the planet

Ye I agree with part of that statement, still dont need a god to fix it. 


&gt;we act so stupidly and carelessely and think we are smart, modern, it's all bullshit


Depends on the people. the whole human race is like one giant machine. You can't get mad at what the guidance chip when the cooling unit made the problem. You especially can't blame the whole machine for one part of it. Just go and fix the part is broken. Find the part in this world and make sure it stops fucking it up for the rest of us.


But in the end I didnt really see proof. Just someone ranting that the human race sucks. Ye I know the human race sucks get to the proof. Your welcome, and I very might will but I need sufficient evidence for it. **What is your type if you may please**


&gt;Agnostic, I suppose. I don't personally believe in a god but I'm not ruling out the possibility that there is one.

then by definition you are an Agnostic Atheist


&gt;I can't really grasp the concept of a God spiritually myself, but I have friends who consider religion an important part of their lives, and there sometimes are mystical phenomena that might be caused by something beyond our perception and current state of science.


Ig for the last part needs to be proven tho. But I find it interesting that your questions are different then the usually. 



&gt;I don't practice it, but I think it's an important thing for a lot of people and it can be very useful, so I think it's important it exists. 



Importance doesnt always mean good. Useful sometimes bad sometimes. just like anything in this world. I just find it throughout history religion makes it a whole lot easier to manipulate people or justify "evil"



&gt;That religion is a construct just like science is, and that while science seems more objective, a lot of subjective factors such as the ideology of scientists do influence it. Plus, not every religion is harmful to other people, and not every aspect of science is beneficial (like researching nuclear weapons).



Not saying you are wrong but please give some examples of scientist doing that. and please give some examples of known religions not hurting people. Like I said before everything can be used for bad or good. 



&gt;I think it's a beautiful thing that can be useful for one's mental health, but sadly also has the potential to become quite destructive towards the self and others. I think some kind of liberal (in the sense of non-dogmatic and love-focused) religion is the best approach. 



Yeah so does racism. Dont you feel great being above all those dirty black people, I feel so fucking special. But racism can turn a quite destructive towards others. 

Being good at one thing and bad in another doesnt mean its ok you must weigh it and see if the good things in religion stands above all the terrible things it has caused. 

I would say science stand above. Some might differ but we wouldn't be talking if it weren't here.


Thats pretty much all I just wanted to respond :)determinism?
 &gt;Gnostic

Interesting would love to know why (as in more)


&gt;God has been an active presence in my life. I don't believe in dumb luck. I wouldn't be where I am or as successful as I am without His guidance, even when I didn't want it.



Allah has been an active presence in my life, Yahweh has been an active presence of my life, thor has been an active presence in life, the flying spaghetti monster has been an active presence in my life. If you don't believe in dumb luck then were you lucky or not that you were the certain sperm that got to your mother's egg? Is he talking to you bud? Just asking not trying to be a dick but when someone says guidance I think this guy is literally talking to you just wondering. 


&gt;Religion, not so much, spirituality, yes.


I am guessing you mean religion as in the whole thing rather than just the belief. I can understand that. 



&gt;Yup. Also was Atheist in my mid teens.



Come back to the dark side. We have cookies.



&gt;In my Atheist years, I argued religion was violent and hateful and that we were better off without it. Now I argue that Christianity is about love.



Flooding thousands of people just because they are sinful then in the next testament dying on the cross because they are sinful. One is loving one is fucking horrific (and is plagiarized from gilgamesh) The old testament god is a fucking touch to be honest.



&gt;Religion is messy. It leads to unnecessary conflicts and violence. Spirituality is the critical part, because it's not what you do or how you act; it's what you believe and how you feel in the depths of your heart.



I believe in the depths of my heart that gays should be killed. Then I act on that belief. They both can be bad. 





I like being there and can easily do the stuff there but I fucking hate doing homework-"Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."-Einstein

Anyway i am just saying that each type is the "best". Each type has something they are good at and something they are bad at. You should really ask best at (_____). then you can conclude. But yeah whatever I'll do my type.

-I can't stop thinking of new ideas
-I love to discuss and argue
-I could literally not give a fuck about this world
-alot of other cool shit Ig those are just the major three for meVisual-spatial but I felt like the test was to specific and for the questions needed more options to correctly say what I was feeling. anything and everything ne is a bitchGot 22 30 out of 36 meaning I got more than 82% of most I am an ENTP.Same score better type. (Im kidding I love my INTJs)Eh love is OK I would love to have it. But I would also love not to have it. Its weird, on one side of my brain I feel that love is just a dirty trick that nature plays to get humans to mate. And on the other side I am in love with the feeling of that trick. Idk love is weird people are weird but I love people and the weirdness of people. And love is pretty much caring about the well being for me. And being happy with them and someone to talk too definitely some one to talk to.Sorry didn't have my flair showing 
im ENTPNever said I hated it because of it being a biological function I hate it (sometimes) because it's double edge sword and doesn't last forever causing divorce because they ain't getting that hit of dopamine anymore.I still like the feeling of love just like I like the feeling of greed and other "sins". But me liking it doesn't take away the "bad" or "negative" parts for me. And I make sure that I know when I am in the process of being in love.Yeah there are a lot of tricks. ENTP I got rebelI know this isn't answering the question but I just found out Richard Dawkins coined the term meme. TfI always get ENTP now. 
When I was younger I got INTJ and after that INTP but now I never get anything but ENTP. Be cool if you tried to find out why too. There might be different reasons for each type. This is kind of funny but I'll play along.

Me being an Entp usually Infjs don't annoy me. When I'm having a conversation with them it's honestly really relieving because I don't need to over explain my complex ideas and they provide a different perspective which can contrast my t with their f. And it doesn't come off as annoying or overly sensitive (most of the time). I just enjoy talking with them and wish there were more out there. 

(Was that nice enough :P)Have you ever seen any against entps I don't go on the sub that much I would love to see what they hate about my type.Aren't we all :P
It'd be boring if everyone was perfectPhallic CompensativeSamewell depends on your definition of perfect but also if you'd say everyone is perfect do you mean perfect human or a perfect version of themselves because those two are fairly different.I do

In the beginning, when I was younger like around 10 it was the first time I took the test and I got INTJ like 2 times. 

Then around the age of 13 and 14, I took it again and the 3 times I took it I got INTP. 

But at the age of 15 and 16 (now) I only get ENTP on pretty much all the test and if it isn't it would be INTP.

I don't know how to explain getting INTJ when I was younger (I just think I didn't really understand the question completely and how I felt about them). 

But for getting INTP I believe at the time my Fe was fairly low and as I went through some of my mid teen years it started to grow and now I am a lot more extroverted and I have a lot better sense of how the situation is going be it bad or good. 

But yeah :P Back then not really but now it's been consistent with ENTP and I have taken dozens of more test than before. Ye happens to me all the time really fucking annoying especially worse when you have had slight speech problems throughout your life. I'm drowning in the emojisyeah lmaoIdk, all I want is someone who I can trust with the crazy thoughts in my head and someone I can learn from (also trust). https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b1/0e/4d/b10e4d36f2aff35337d8a9a4f5cc861c.jpg Have you told him how you feel?Yeah I didn't get the ENTP vibe from him that muchI did the same thing lmao. Affiliative humor: 38.0

"A spontaneous dreamer) You make out-of-the-ordinary decisions, quick as a flash."

**Openness: 62%**

"Your high level of openness suggests that you are imaginative, creative, and comfortable with variety and change. But you can also tend towards individualistic behavior and impractical thinking."

**Conscientiousness: 1%**

"You like to act immediately on impulse, which can be both effective and fun. But if taken to the extreme this can produce undesirable long term consequences for yourself and others."

**Extraversion: 50%**

"Your high level of extraversion suggests that you experience positive emotions from social situations and activities, so are likely to seek them out and thrive in them."

**Agreeableness: 31%**

"You have a healthy sense of skepticism, and a strong resolve. You don't shy away from making those tough decisions which can't please everyone but still need to be made."

**Neuroticism: 38%**

"You are calm, emotionally stable and are less easily upset than people with high levels of neuroticism. But this doesn't necessarily mean you experience more positive feelings than them."

OUTLOOK

**Optimist**

High levels of extraversion combined with low neuroticism mean that optimists always look on the bright side of life. This doesn't mean that they don't experience troubles from time to time, but they don't let negative things get to them or bring their mood down. Your naturally sunny disposition means that you have plenty of other things to get excited about.

CHARACTER

**Indulgent**

Indulgent people might have a tendency to be more concerned with their own comfort and pleasure than other people's. But they can also sometimes have problems identifying when their indulgences have become undesirable and unhealthy habits. You may fall into this category if you find it difficult to identify areas of self improvement from time to time.

SELF CONTROL

**Determined**

You keep your cards close to your chest and usually seem very laid back, but you know exactly what's going on around you. When you take offence at something you may not show it there and then, but you're likely to seek a way to even the score somehow. Be careful to maintain a sense of proportion and think about how other people might view your actions out of context.

COMPOSURE

**Easy going**

Easy-going people are very laid back about life and don't really see a need to be overly serious about things. This means they can often lean towards the easiest route or option in any situation. It's important to overcome a lack of self-motivation you may feel and put in the extra effort when you know it’s really worth it.

TASTE

**Pioneer**

You're interested in the new and different. Whatever it is, if you haven't experienced it before, you'll want to give it a try. People who share this characteristic also enjoy meeting people from different backgrounds, so thrive in big communal activities where they can learn about new places and perspectives.

SOCIABILITY

**Leader**

People with this characteristic are likely to enjoy social situations where they can really shine - where they can be in charge and give instructions rather than take them. They tend to be natural decision makers. If you recognise this trait in yourself, remember to think about how other people might perceive your forthright approach.

ACTION

**Spontaneous**

Spontaneous people tend to be pretty full of energy and love the thrill of new adventures. But that energy isn't always completely constructive. Your spontaneity and impulsiveness might mean that it's sometimes all too easy to drop those serious, unglamorous tasks for the promise of a good time.

ATTITUDE

**Analytical**

People with analytical attitudes are true critical thinkers and like to consider each situation on its own merits in order to avoid being influenced by sentimentality or tradition. This leaves them free to think about every angle and option before making their own judgement. If this sounds like you, be careful not to disregard the feelings of other people in pursuit of 'the truth.'

PROCESS

**Dreamer**

Dreamers get very excited by the prospect of new ideas and ways of seeing the world, but they tend to lose their way in theoretical possibilities and flights of fancy. If this sounds like you, you might be seen as a fantastic starter but not so great finisher. But, no one can fault your enthusiasm and ability to thrive in the uncertainty of the new. Force yourself to be a bit more organised and you'll blow people away.

RESILIENCE

**Engaged**

Engaged people tend to take life quite seriously, but are still able to see the funny side and laugh off difficulties when they arise. They're very adaptable, and don't view problems as things to stop them but as opportunities to inspire them to come up with creative solutions - and of course some humour.I don't consciously value things so this was a little hard but I made a list with from highest to lowest. 

Stimulation,
Hedonism,
Self Direction,

Achievement,
Power,
Universalism,

Benevolence,
Security,
Conformity/Tradition

&gt; They get joy out of fucking with others

Ye that's me in a nutshell, my ISFJ mother can attest to that.This pen with black ink is what I am writing with and what I utilize to draw things that pop into my head. This black ink puts formless thought unto paper giving them life.ENTP are allowed to be bubbly and cheerful. Even Rick had his moments. Also think about another ENTP character the Joker. Who is giddy and happy most of the time even though it is in a murdery way. 

If you really want to find out look cognitive functions

ENFP: Ne-Fi-Te-Si
ENTP: Ne-Ti-Fe-Si

The reason OG_FinnTheHuman said that you were ENTP was because of you saying you don't have strong values, morals or ideals. This is in direct opposition to ENFP's second function Fi which tends to hold strong morals. (ENTP) Ye I get this although I do have anxiety. Although I don't find my self wanting to talk to people I just find it really awkward and start to think that they are thinking about me in a bad way or something to that degree. It actually gets worse with people that I know but not that well, because there is a higher chance of them noticing something about me. I can agree with what they say about ENTP. I don't really seek out relationships where we are talking about what we feel because I honestly don't typically like that. Most of my good friends are the group of friends who shit on each other extremely often. Coyotes, Foxes, Crows

In a more societal definition of these animals. In stories they are usually known as  tricksters especially native american. Although they can be seen as malicious tbhENTP- Depends really, I do enjoy time alone especially when I want to think extremely on one subject, but if I'm trying to throw around ideas its always better for me to have a group to bounce off of. 

Socially speaking I hang out when I feel the need to. Although if a good friend wants to hang out I usually have no qualms going out. I was wondering which judging type tends to show traits that go with **J** the most and which judging type tends to show the least traits or shows more traits that go with **P** even though they are a judging type.


The question popped into my head because I always here that ENTPs are the most introverted extrovert due to our Ti and because our Ne doesn't really need people to function. 


So here are my main questions:

Which extraverted type tends to show the most traits that go with **E**

Which extraverted type tends to show the most traits that go with **I** (Usually told it's ENTP)

Which introverted type tends to show the most traits that go with **I**

Which introverted type tends to show the most traits that go with **E**

Which intuitive type tends to show the most traits that go with **N**

Which intuitive type tends to show the most traits that go with **S**

Which sensing type tends to show the most traits that go with **S**

Which sensing type tends to show the most traits that go with **N**

Which feeling type tends to show the most traits that go with **F**

Which feeling type tends to show the most traits that go with **T**

Which thinking type tends to show the most traits that go with **T**

Which thinking type tends to show the most traits that go with **F**

Which judging type tends to show the most traits that go with **J**

Which judging type tends to show the most traits that go with **P**

Which perceiving type tends to show the most traits that go with **P**

Which perceiving type tends to show the most traits that go with **J**

and why


thank youLike (Least) ENTJ-ESTJ.....-ENTP-ISFP (Most) :P just wondering which type is the king of procrastinating. This is really coming from me thinking that Fi and Fe can do the same actions but the reasons they do it are different and I would like to know the reasons. When I think of Fe I think of e for Everyone or enviroment because they like to have a stable enviroment and for everyone to be good around them, and for Fi I think of I or myself because they think of how this make me feel .

Thats pretty much all I know so help please :).My father died when I was 14 and it has been almost 3 years since. I am wondering what type he is because I'm trying to find out my family's types here is some of my stuff I remember (I would ask my mother but whenever I bring him up she gets fairly sad.)

&gt;He seemed to be extremely extroverted due to him hating being stuck in the house and he had friends literally everywhere. Alot of people knew him and considered him a friend 

&gt;He enjoyed getting on people's nerves (which I guess I got from him too or its just my entp nature to be trollish) he just enjoyed being that guy but did it in the way that was charming. It even got to the point where he got kicked off of facebook for doing some stupid stuff. 

&gt;He had poor impulse control when it came to emotions and drugs. The main emotion that he couldnt really control was his anger. Going out bouts of rage when something didnt go his way. Like I remember he was yelling and breaking stuff when he lost his wallet. He also was an alcoholic and did drugs in his young adult life (I am not sure if he continued) he was also a smoker (only cigars). The reason he died was due to him drunk driving. He cheated on my mother (idk if this was a choice when he was drunk or a fully conscious choice). 

&gt;He did not really like to show when he was sad and I only seen him cry once and that was when my mother caught my older half brother (father (my dad) mother (wasnt my mom) selling weed . And had him move in with his mother. I didnt understand why this hit him so much (his other is five mins away). But it did.  

&gt; He really enjoyed social media and couldnt put his phone down. He also hated watching cartoons saying "they were for children" and watched alot of tv like judge judy and shows that he felt he could relate too (like this biker show Sons of Anarchy).

&gt;He was a great worker and his main goal was to get alot of money so he can get whatever he wanted. Or get his "toys" as my mom would say. Which included a Harley-Davidson Motorcycle (which he died on) and a corvette. He was a really really hard worker when he knew what he was going to get at the end(he worked as a truck driver). 

&gt;He didnt really enjoy punishing us (through spanking) although he still did it. I believe he felt he had too. It didnt really work with me though (dont know with my brothers.) He also wasnt very smart alecy like me. He would end little playful arguments with me by threatening (I didnt think he would do anything but I still stopped anyway.

&gt;He was very musical knowing how to play the guitar, and drums prob more. And was a music junkie. 

&gt;My mother is ISXJ i think more of a ISFJ but its hard to tell the two apart sometimes. 

&gt;He wasnt very organized but not as disorganized as me. My mom had to clean up after him sometimes. 

&gt;She says he was very loving. I guess I can see it because I myself dont show my loving side that much but still feel it. 

Thats all the comes to mind right now. I'm guessing he is high in Fe but I'm not the best at determining what peoples types are. I'm trying to learn the types of my friends and to see whether or not they lean to one function or another so that I can study them get a proper conclusion.

 I want to know a situational question so that they can answer and give their own opinion on rather than a multiple choice question like in test online. 

Can you help me please? :)So I was thinking (already know people have thought of this before me) in every relationship the people in it use the other for something. Like a husband uses a wife or vice versa. 
Of course this isn't (always) bad, like lets a husband may use his wife to have emotional support in his day to day life. 

So I was wondering what if different types have different needs or wants from their sig. other in a relationship.

I thought of this when I was reminiscing on one of my worst relationships. She was an INFX and I am of course o an ENTP. 

Her need was someone to keep a constant state of Emotional approval (this isnt necessarily bad but the way she went around doing it was terrible. As in lying constantly just to get approvable from me).

My need was someone to talk to our just spew out my ideas constantly without having to worry about the person calling me stupid or insane. 

I notice that this was my need in a relationship after a few months after the break up where I starting missing having someone to just talk to. 

**Anyway the question is what need in the relationship do you think each type strives to fill?**
As an entp, I can confirm the above scenario ^-^Yup pretty much me too. My siblings are used to me randomly laughing at stuff and seem to have lost all hope in me :)Thats kinda sad really. I like math and sometimes I get jealous of INTPs because I think dominant Ti would be better with that kinda stuff.You sound like my dad LOL please spew out more nonsense it is very entertaining to readYeah he is istj.

Tell me, what would you do if 2 entps got married and had a kid? Should the government take the child away? Should the kid be forced into being adopted?We are all full of shit XDThat's true, sometimes I need to keep myself in check so I don't just end up being rude and calling everything people do irrelevant.Guilty as charged
ESFJ's they should just stay away from me or i'll throw rock at them25/36 :|
I'd like to see that the ones that you do see travel in packs and that's all you see of them. There's probably an Se-Ti drought elsewhere :pINFJs Ni really fucking hard. You can't miss it, and they tend to be deeper in their Ti. Most ISFJs will stay surface level with things if it's not their Fe latching on to something. Plus I get hard when talking to an INFJ and not ISFJ. :p /joke(Laugh track) You *sound* ESTP but anyone can act like a type, it's how you process and export information that determines your type. 

[Take this](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm) and show resultsYeah, I generally do those two things and it does work for the time being until I stop feeling that way. Though I was interested in trying to get it to stop permanently, maybe that isn't possible since everyone has personal issues...No problem man, I also have a seasonal thing going on! Nice to hear feedback.Yup, I definitely need some Si-Fe in my life. 

What would you mean by "influx of power" though?Your personal experience does indeed give me much to think about, thank you!Justice, but mercy is required to balance the justice as being truly "righteous", or whatever these Fi loaded words mean :p  ENTP here.So I'm a 7w8 sx/so ENTP, very strong Fe, abysmal Si.

Only some months ago did I truly realize how much thinking about these things fucked me up. 

I get choked up at images that make me nostalgic or when I get feelings that could even resemble nostalgia (doesn't even actually have to be my nostalgic experience, could be someone else's.) I can't stand funerals or people mourning their loved ones, pets, anything that they don't have anymore.
My anxiety over dying or otherwise not enjoying my life to its fullest have been mounting for months now to the point where I am almost always thinking about how I, and everything around me, will die, and that makes it extremely hard to focus on the positive things in life or enjoying myself before I actually die. 

An INTP friend discussed this with me and theorized that these are because my Si is incredibly weak and my Se is just fucked all the way up. I don't really know how to resolve any of this or how to go about it. Anyone have any other analysis or ideas to help? Many thanks in advance.
As far as surefire signs go, the best way to type people (or identify N vs. S) at a glance is to follow their speech patterns. Ask a question and see how they respond. What's their humor like? When they tell a joke, are they creating some kind of alternate world and laughing at how ridiculous that possibility is (N)? Or are they laughing at some realistic situation (S)? Jimmy Fallon is a good example of S humor with segments like "celebrities read mean tweets about themselves", and Stephen Colbert is a good example of N humor as he creates an entirely ridiculous character and acts it out as convincingly as possible.

Going a little beyond that though, it will be way harder to tell S vs. N if you're not looking for the direction of the function too: Si vs. Se vs. Ni vs. Ne. In reality, Si isn't that similar to Se and Ni isn't that similar to Ne. I'll give a brief description of each below and associate a comedian with each function.

An Si user is focused on how concrete information impacts him, and how it integrates with his full memory of sensory information. Jimmy Fallon, detailed above. It has a lot of references to common knowledge, and simply connects the dots. "Inside jokes" are an example is Si humor. 

An Se user is focused on scanning concrete objects and events and understanding them in real time. Jim Carey - he is incredibly physical in his humor. He's just plain refreshingly silly - there is no implication, meaning, or possibility behind what he does. 

An Ne user is focused on the possibilities for and implications of everything around them, exploring those possibilities in real time. Stephen Colbert, detailed above. There's a lot of real time wordplay, twisting of situations, piercing yet silly observations, deliberate misunderstandings, etc. 

An Ni user is focused on how the possibilities or implications of something affect him and how they integrate with his entire memory of metaphysical information. Movies by the Coen brothers (Fargo, Big Lebowsky, Burn After Reading, etc.) are perfect examples. Ni humor is long-winded. One example is building a melancholy world or situation and immersing you in it, then suddenly breaking it and showing the cynicism to be completely pointless. Or it shows the long-winded journey of someone on a quest for answers they expect to change their life while the viewer knows that the answer they're seeking is simple and meaningless. 

Also remember that Ni users always have Se and vice versa, while Ne users also have Si and vice versa.One question could help you figure it out: how verbal are you? 

INFP's often aim to express their feelings and internally developed ideals through words with use of Ne while ISFP's are more concrete and aim to live their lives consistently with their ideals, leaving it to their actions, and sometimes appearances, art, music, etc. (like David Bowie, for example) to communicate those similarly conceptualized idealsInteresting. Yes and no to your question, at least based on my understanding and personal theories, because I think all types aim to live by their ideals.

Fi is about focusing on internally defined values and allowing others to do the same vs. Fe which focuses on relative values formed in real-time situations and values which can be broadly applied to all people. 

What I meant but didn't state very clearly about ISFP's is the way they seem to communicate those ideals physically rather than verbally. By "live by" I suppose I meant "live outwardly by" or "project" or something along those lines. 

You should look up Michael Pierce on YouTube. He's a hobbyist in the Myers Briggs and makes just about the clearest, most insightful type description videos I've seen. I discovered him a few weeks ago and have watched almost all his typology videos since! He's made a video for each type and is on his way back through the types making a second round of more in depth and more speculative videos for each type. Lucky for you, he's made the second round videos for both ISFP and INFP already!Well.... here's some hard advice, for what it's worth. (ENTP married to an INTJ)

Work on your communication. Develop your inferior Fi. Don't blame your difficulty communicating your emotions on your type, just work on it and it will improve. 

You will always be an ESTJ, but you can gain comfort with your Fi. My tertiary Fe led me through many one-directional relationships where I learned to underexpose my emotions by focusing on solving the other person's problems. I grew past that and learned to value my own emotions and to stop telling myself that others' feelings were more important than mine. As a result, I am now in an unbelievable marriage and I've gained a consistent happiness I never dreamed possible. 

It's hard but worth it to challenge yourself to grow. If it were easy, everyone would be happy, but the fact is that very few people truly are. You can achieve it, you just need to make it a constant priority. Don't listen to friends who think they know best, or what society tells you are acceptable faults or errors. Listen to yourself, understand which communications fail because of you and which fail because of your partner, try not to repeat repeat your mistakes, and insist that your partner approach it the same way. 

Lastly, you should look into your enneagram type. The enneagram focuses on personal development in a way which the MBTI completely ignores. Discerning your enneagram type is always hard because it's concretely tied to your fears, which we often subtly maneuver around encountering, but once you find it you'll have a pretty effective model towards developing yourself, and your inferior functions will develop as well as a result.

Best of luckI don't know why the stereotype exists, but I feel like it's just wrong. I'm also an Ne dominant (entp) and I actually don't get that sense often. I know a few people who are sensors whom it's really hard to connect with, but I also know N's whom it's hard to connect with, and I know tons of sensors whom it's really easy to connect with!

I'd think about it this way: sensors and intuitives both sense and intuit, but each focuses or relies on one or the other more strongly. If you're talking to an Si type, they can acknowledge your Ne and even value it as something they have but are not in touch with. Likewise you may be impressed by their consistency, or their notorious Si memory or organization, which you have but are likely not very in touch with. 

There are two sides to every coin, but the coin is worth the same amount no matter which side is face up.Totally ENFJ. 

The two things I noticed first: you have very clear Fe, and are very much an extrovert. That narrows it down to:  ESFJ, ENFJ, ESTP, ENTP. From there, we eliminate.  

ESTP and ENTP are the first to go. You're just nothing like those types. You don't seem like a T type, shown by your focus on your friend/sibling's well-being,  and how you seem to feel responsibility for them. Not that T's don't care about the people in their lives, it just happens in a different way. I'm an ENTP and care deeply for the people I'm close to, but my answer to Q2, a. would look something like: "I'm curious to see whom they choose to be with. It will help me understand them better, and hopefully I'll be able to help them figure out if this person is right for them." The focus would be on the discovery aspect rather than the implications, and the deduction process rather than the justice of the situation. 

Now that leaves ESFJ vs. ENFJ. You seem too open to be an ESFJ, who would have auxiliary Si. The ESFJ's I know are doers and deciders, plowing forward and rarely second-guessing their course because they're sure they have the answer based on their prior experience with a similar situation. You're very much not like that - you're excited, you don't feel rushed to make decisions, you want things to generally be happy or positive, and you look for ways to make that happen rather than jumping to execute on an immediate opinion. 

Boom. You're typed ;P

P.S. My sister is an ENFJ, and you kinda remind me of her 
P.P.S. There's no such type as 3w7 lol. MBTI people always get confused about the wings! You have a core type and your wing can only be that number +/- 1 (unless you're a 9 or a 1 - you can be 1w9 or 9w1 because there's no type 10 or type 0). You're likely an enneagram 7w6.Interesting observations. I'm just going to give some feedback, take it or leave it. You seem to be taking isolated statements and tying them to certain functions without context, then building a theory based on the number of figurative tally marks next to each function, and the more tally marks a function gets the more likely it'll be to get another one because you're progressively becoming more invested in the type you're theorizing. I used to do that a lot, I don't think it's effective.

This is going to come off as critical. Maybe it is, but I wouldn't have learned the system deeply if my methods and understanding hadn't been scrutinized, so I'm going to do you the favor of calling it like I see it.  I don't think you understand Ne or Fi that well. The statements you tie those two functions to above just don't associate with what the functions are like in the real world. It's hard to develop an understanding of the functions because there's so much bad or vague info out there, but the basic rule of thumb is to always relate the typology info to patterns you've observed in people while not thinking about the MBTI. Think about people you know and what they do, not the way you think certain types are supposed to behave. Don't put people in boxes, make boxes that are appropriately sized for people. 

Anyways, hope that helpsForgive you? I applaud you for your studious spirit! Lol

Basically, the four letters you're familiar with are code for the order of your functions. 

I vs. E shows the "direction" of your primary finding (outward / extroverted, or inward / introverted). Each function that follows alternates direction: E first means I second then E third and I last. 

N vs. S shows which perceiving function is in your first two functions. Every type uses both sensing and perceiving, but prefers one over the other. If your first function is an N function, your last will be an S function, and vice versa. If your second function is an S function, your third will be an N function and vice versa. 

T vs. F shows which judging function is in your first two functions. The ordering process is the same as for the perceiving functions above. 

J vs. P shows us whether the type's judging function is extroverted, or whether the type's perceiving function is extroverted.

Example: if you are an N and a P, then you will use Ne, or extroverted intuition, because the N tell us you prefer intuition as your perceiving function, and the P tells us your perceiving function is extroverted. If in addition you are an E type, you now know that Ne is your first function because the E tells us you lead with an extroverted function, the P tells us your primary perceiving function is extroverted, and the N tells us that you prefer intuition. Finally, if you are additionally a T type, we know that your second function is Ti, your third function is Fe, and your last function is Si. 

Ta da! You have a functional analysis of my type, ENTP!

You should watch some good YouTube videos on the MBTI, that will make it much clearer. Check our Michael Pierce - his videos are the clearest I've come by. I discovered him not that long ago and have been singing his praises from the mountain tops ever since hahaLol at the near simultaneous recommendation of Michael Pierce's videosI like that description. What part does it contradict?There's no need to be rude. I was just sharing an observation which I think to be true.ENTP's and INTJ's are very different, even though the stacks seem similar (I'm an ENTP and my wife is an INTJ). Look into the difference between Ne and Ni. I'll give a brief run-down below, but what you should really do is watch Michael Pierce's videos on YouTube - he has two videos on ENTP's and INTJ's each that are really good. 

Ne and Ni are both intuitive perceiving types, meaning they look for the metaphysical data behind objects or events rather than at the objects themselves. Possibilities, implications, essences, identities, etc. 

As an extroverted function, Ne does this in a kind of roving way. Pierce describes it as "telescopic" (if I remember right) because it zooms in and out and moves on to the next thing it can find to focus on. It is mobile, searching for new data and possibilities at all times. If you're an ENTP, this searching is your priority, and it is grounded only by your Ti, and more distantly by your Si. You take your Ne observations of possibilities and try to use that data to build logical systems in your mind that make sense in a completely self-contained way. Your depth comes from your logic, not from your observational power (even though your observational power is really awesome (I'm an ENTP lol))

As an introverted function, Ni intuits in a deeper way. It mulls things over, spends a lot of time thinking and searching for the answer. It tries to incorporate its observations of possibilities, etc. into its knowledge as a whole, rather than making the observations in a moving way and feeding them into a deep, complex logic machine like the ENTP. For the INTJ, Te, and more distantly Se, feed the swirling tumult of the Ni dominant mind with concrete observations of reality (Se) and cold, hard, objective conclusions about reality (Te). It may be more accurate to say though that the Te works to aggressively manifest that Ni-Se knowledge in the real world.

Also, you should look into your enneagram type. It may help you resolve your self confidence issues. The enneagram deals a lot with self development, and it's often hard to identify your type because you really effectively hide your fears from yourself (it's amazing how well we can deceive ourselves), but if you figure it out and learn to focus on what you need to do to grow, whatever issues you may have will slowly start to melt away. 

Lastly, my guesses for your types! ENTP, 3w4 so/sx (least confident about the instinct stack, but what the heck, I'll leave it in there)I see what you're saying. I think they can tend towards the kind of repressive behavior described by Jung above, but I don't think it dominates them or the full picture of their type. Healthy INFP's often like to express their inner worlds in detail, like C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, etc.Start here! https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/

Just start by reading the overviews for each type description and then explore! There are a lot of facets to the enneagram, but I'd say just keep reading and thinking about it a lot and eventually it will make sense. I think people tend to try to rush to type themselves with these systems and skip the step of learning how the system works, because it really takes years of mulling it over for it to really click - just a warning since it really is hard to find your type lol. I thought I was a 5 for a year then an 8 for like 6 months before realizing that I'm a 9w8, but each time I "found" my type I was 100% sure of it haha

Anyways, my wife also had a useful example of INTJ vs ENTP that I'd like to share with you. She again is an INTJ, and her old boss is an ENTP. He would often go to her and say "let's sit down for 30 minutes and solve this problem". They would sit down, and he'd start talking. "We'll if we look at it this way, we can conclude.... that reminds me of this other client, so maybe if we present it this way.... and so we can tell them this...". He basically ran the show and built up ideas one after the other and would keep building, all the while my wife silently observing, until she would say something like "I don't think that works because of this." And he'd go "oh. Ok, well we make that change and...." and he'd keep going until she spoke up again. The exercise for you I guess is - which role are you more likely to play?Hahaha this is so great! The bias knows no boundsDrumroll..... Sensing bias time! I just slapped this together, hope you like it! 

If you are...

ESTJ: You are a paragon of consistency. A master of determination and unflappability who not only produces the highest caliber of work, but elevates those around you who wouldn't be worth a damn if you didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. 

ENTJ: You're a bossy faker who can't accept that things aren't the way you want them to be. 

ISTJ: You are the reason the world doesn't crumble to the ground. You preserve time-tested methods and keep the cogs of history turning. 

INTJ: You're a lazy dreamer, claiming to need time to think about quotations with obvious answers so you can sit around and do nothing instead of carrying your share of the load. 

ESFJ: You are the sole source of comfort in an unforgiving world. Supporting others and helping them stay comfortable, you bolster those around you and spur society to action against immoral and unfair practices, aiming to stabilize society as a whole. 

ENFJ: You like making friends and hanging out. What do you do for a living again? I can never remember. 

ISFJ: You are a fierce protector of those you love. You relate to everyone and help them find solutions to their most complex problems because you've built a deep understanding of them through years and years of detailed attention to their likes and dislikes, reminding them of who they really are when they lose track. 

INFJ: You're Hitler. 

ESTP: You're an unstoppable dynamo, hurling yourself into new experiences and developing new skillz for the pure love of learning and if action. You accomplish the most amazing feats man has ever seen, and rally others to action not by convincing them, but simply by inspiring them through the way that you are. 

ENTP: You're pretty funny but can't get anything done. You should probably be a comedian. 

ISTP: You embody true understanding and impartial logic. Delving deep into the true mechanics of everything and anything you see, you have an understanding of the world and an ability to create just about anything you set your mind to. 

INTP: You are society's unthinking naysayer, defaulting to cynicism and doubt no matter what the topic. 

ESFP: You endlessly energetic, fun, and unique. You live loudly and proudly by your own standards, showing others what's possible through sheer force of power and will. 

ENFP: Sorry, we don't need any more comedians. Maybe you can be a cheerleader, or run around in a hamster wheel to produce electricity or something. 

ISFP: The most individualistic person imaginable, you share your inner light with the out of world through art, all forms of which you mastered with literally no effort. 

INFP: You write big books and complain about the fact that people don't get youhttp://cdn2.omidoo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full_width/images/bydate/201502/keep-calm-and-don-t-feed-the-troll-86.pngHey! You seem to be asking yourself some good questions that could lead you to your type. Take a step back and look at the big picture rather than thinking on a "1 point Ti, 2 points Fi" kind of level. Understanding those points is important, but focusing too strongly on it could lead you to focus so much on the trees that you don't see the forest. Observe yourself and try to figure out how you think, acknowledge patterns in your behavior and ask yourself what patterns are type-related and which are separate.

I have no way of knowing if what you shared is representative of the full picture, but from the sound of it you could be an ENTP. Many type descriptions focus too heavily on the pitfalls we ENTP's have through tertiary Fe and inferior Si, effectively describing characatures of our real selves who don't understand feelings and will never achieve an ounce of regularity in our lives. What you cite as evidence of ENFP/Fi above sounds to me like a simple assertion of the fact that you have feelings that the type descriptions you're reading don't acknowledge.

Lastly I'll just say - be yourself and keep studying the myers briggs, and your type will become apparent.It's funny because it's true hahaI'm going to be admittedly lazy and not read the whole thing, so I'm also not going to pretend to have an answer to your question, but I did want to mention one thing about the mbti - enneagram relationship that I've noticed. There are definite correlations between mbti and enneagram types, but there are almost no rules.

For example, most ENTP's seem to be 3 or 7, and slightly less commonly 5 or 6. Those are the most likely, but there are still ENTP 9's (like me!), and 4's, etc. There are type combinations that it is really hard to imagine though as they're combinations I've never seen and seem contradictory, so I think of them as impossible. For example, an ISFP 8w7. Maybe they exist - if you think you've found one let me know - but I highly doubt it.How was I rude?Agreed with your F vs. T distinction. I think it's easy to blend "F" in MBTI and "emotions" together, but they're really distinct. 

Op I agree that emotions are subconscious, but F in MBTI is a preference to make decisions based on emotions. You could kind of call it the process of "doing math" with emotions - the numbers are the emotions and exist no matter what, but you use the numbers to form conclusions with addition, subtraction, etc., which is the Feeling functionI've been trying to peg down the Fi-Fe distinction recently into clearer terms than I've seen anywhere - I haven't seen it articulated anywhere in a way that makes sense to me. Plus, the way Fe is commonly explained has given me an odd feeling as an Fe user (entp) that Fe types can be misunderstood as people with less emotional depth. 

After a lot of thinking I've reached a point where I understand it as Subjective Feeling (Fi) vs Objective Feeling (Fe). The basic distinction is that Fi types base emotional judgements on their subjective,  internal codes whole Fe types base their emotional judgements in an objective, relative way, case by case. Advice to choose the "lesser of two evils" seems like an accurate equation of what I mean for Fe. This is not a new thought, but it gave rise to a thought I had not encountered yet: 

No person is without a contemplative, deep, "introverted" core, and likewise no person is without a reactive, mobile, "extroverted" bridge between their inner and outer world. This is why functions stand on axis: Fe-Ti, Fi-Te, Se-Ni, Si-Ne. You need one perceiving and judging method for your inner life, and one to guide how you bridge that life into the outer world. 

To relate that back to feeling (and the conversation we're having in general), Fi is concerned with establishing the subjective assumptions of an emotion, such as love, hence creating a "passive" state, and Fe is concerned with determining what is right or wrong in any given moment. So, to Harold's point, there is a layer of conscious and subconscious which we use/draw from with our extroverted and introverted functions respectively. Feelings are, in essence, thoughts, and thoughts can be a manifestation of the conscious and can draw from the subconscious. The MBTI categorizes the ways we tap into those fields.

Paladin - what I'm saying fits the Active vs. Passive terminology, but I think some of Jung's examples contradict my theory. Thoughts? 

Also - I'm not particularly well read in psychology. If I'm making points that have been made before, I'd love to know where to read up on them, so please point me in the right direction if you can!I like the idea of a sticky thread, but wouldn't standardizing the format of a typing post take away some of the personal flair people put in that helps us type them? I think it's really useful to see how someone approaches the postExtraverted thinking describes the use of logic in an objective way. It processes information it receives in motion, with focus that shifts from problem to problem. It does not, and has no desire to, build or establish; it simply has a desire to analyze. 

Opposing Te is Ti, which describes the use of logic in a subjective way. It freezes  information still in time and holds then there until it is sorted in a way that is logically consistent with all other frozen pieces. It has a focus that resists shifting until it has completed the problem it is solving; moreover, once the problem is solved, the logic system is preserved for future use. It uses an aspect of memory that Te doesn't touch.I like how you describe things, the imagery is very rich lol. I should read some Jung - any suggestions on where to start?No prob! And ya I think the best way to learn how it works is in practice. Research and then use it in your life, type people you know, talk to people about it, try different communication styles with different types, etc. That's where most of my knowledge on mbti comes from, but I've been doing a lot more reading in general recently so I'm interested in reading some books on psychology to see if I can develop my understanding of the mind even moreWhat I took from this is that ISFPs eat ENTJs for breakfast, but INFP men are basically women. Did I get that right? ... ;PThat's the point. The article is flagrantly inaccurate, I was making fun of it.I think the common misconception about Fe users comes from looking at the function in an isolated way (as opposed to looking at it's function in the type as a whole) combined with negative experiences with unhealthy Fe users (the types who try to force solidarity/are uncomfortable with non-conformity). 

My belief is that the depth of our minds and beings takes shape through our introverted functions. For example, as an ENTP I use Fe and Ne, but my depth and consistency comes from the use of my Ti and Si. The Fe and Ne serve to bridge my inner depth with the outside world.I use tons of analogies, but I think it's mainly driven by my NeI think your observations are good! Though I will say, I only use my sledgehammer for good.

 I'm going to paste in a description of Ti I posted on another thread:

"Ti describes the use of logic in a subjective way. It freezes pieces of information still in time and holds them there until it fits all the frozen pieces together in a way that is logically consistent. It has a focus that resists shifting until it has completed the problem it is solving; moreover, once the problem is solved, the logic system is preserved and held as true until new factors come into play that affect it."

I think Ti-Ti banter is enjoyable for both because they agree on their logical method; that the information should be "frozen" and "sorted", and they don't have to struggle against the Te-Fi communication or deduction style which uses logic in fluid motion. Some of the rare communication lapses I have with my wife (INTJ) I think are rooted in this difference. I feel like she rushes to draw conclusions before clearly identifying each of the individual factors in a system, whereas she seems to feel like I'm expecting her to fill in the blanks between my words (i.e. I don't identify every single "frozen" piece of info that I'm considering). 

Also, to the Fe factor, I like sharing my ideas to see what others think because it gives me more perspectives with which to get to the root of the idea. That may be my Ne at play more though. I think the aggression factor could partially be a result of undeveloped Fe, particularly in Ti dominants. I've never really had a issues with that - though I'm also a type 9 enneagram, which could diminish. That said, I only started using a week ago and somehow seem to have annoyed a few people already, but I'm just going to guess that those people are "trolls" until I can be proven wrong lolSeems like a good time to test out a description of perceiving types I wrote a few weeks ago!! Take a look below, see what you think :D

The facts of the world are constant, but the way we process those facts varies. Perceiving functions describe the patterns and mechanics by which our minds connect to those facts. We connect to the world by means which are concrete or abstract (S vs. N), and in ways that are subjective or objective (i vs e). There are four perceiving functions representing the four possible combinations of those means:

Si - Introverted Sensing
Ne - Extroverted Intuition

Se - Extroverted Sensing
Ni - Introverted Intuition

(S vs. N) Each mind will prioritize either concrete or abstract perceiving, as denoted by the second letter in their Myers Briggs Type. (S) Concrete, or sensing, functions deal in the physical, literal realm. They focus on objects as they are and events as they happen in the tangible sense. (N) Abstract, or intuitive, functions deal in the metaphysical realm. They focus on the concepts surrounding an object such as implications it could have or possibilities for it. 

(i vs. e) Each concrete or abstract function will either focus on subjective or objective interpretation of information. (i) Introverted perceiving functions deal in complete knowledge. They assimilate data into a complete, self-contained understanding from which no perception made throughout life is omitted or removed. It ties to our memory and our sense of broad understanding of the world. (e) Extroverted perceiving functions deal in momentary cognition and perception. They are used to assess information as it arises. They tie us to our immediate surroundings and to our environment. In short, extroverted perceiving is reactionary while introverted perceiving is ruminative.

(S/N, i/e interaction) Each individual mind uses both a sensing and intuitive function simultaneously, one introverted and one extroverted, always with one prioritized over the other, and always paired as shown above. I.e. If you have a subjective relationship with the concrete world you must have an objective relationship with the abstract. Likewise, if you have an objective connection with the concrete world you must have a subjective connection with the abstract. Each mode of perceiving is described below:


(Si) Having a subjective relationship with the concrete realm means that you prefer to focus on the way the physical qualities of the world impact you, and how they relate to the total sum of your memory and understanding of the physical world. I.e. when you see a chair, you are more in tune to how that chair impacts or relates to you and your experiences: is the chair comfortable? This chair is like the chair at my favorite restaurant. Chairs like this are good.

(Ne) Having an objective relationship with the abstract world means that you prefer to focus on the possibilities for, and implications of an object. I.e. when you see a chair: What if this chair had ten legs? What other uses are there for this chair? 


(Se) Having an objective relationship with the concrete realm means that you prefer to focus on the physical qualities of the world and its components. I.e. when you see a chair, you are more in tune to the physical qualities of the chair: how many legs does it have? What is it made of? 

(Ni) Having a subjective relationship with the abstract world means that you prefer to focus on the possibilities and implications of an object or event you perceive with relation to the sum of your complete, subjective understanding of the metaphysical state or direction of the world as a whole. I.e. when you see a chair: why are chairs like this still being made? The design clashes between styles and is inconsistent within itself: what does that say about the standards we hold our furniture providers to?Also, here's a chunk from a post about humor by perceiving type. I associated each perceiving type with a commonly known person's comedy style.

An Si user is focused on how concrete information impacts him, and how it integrates with his full memory of sensory information. Jimmy Fallon, for example, with segments in his show like "celebrities read mean tweets about themselves". It has a lot of references to common knowledge, and connects the dots. "Inside jokes" are an example is Si humor. 

An Se user is focused on scanning concrete objects and events and understanding them in real time. Jim Carey - he is incredibly physical in his humor. He's just plain refreshingly silly - there is no implication, meaning, or possibility behind what he does. 

An Ne user is focused on the possibilities for and implications of everything around them, exploring those possibilities in real time. Stephen Colbert creates an entirely ridiculous character and acts it out as convincingly as possible. There's a lot of real time wordplay, twisting of situations, piercing yet silly observations, deliberate misunderstandings, etc. 

An Ni user is focused on how the possibilities or implications of something affect him and how they integrate with his entire memory of metaphysical information. Movies by the Coen brothers (Fargo, Big Lebowsky, Burn After Reading, etc.) are perfect examples. Ni humor is long-winded. One example is building a melancholy world or situation and immersing you in it, then suddenly breaking it and showing the cynicism to be completely pointless. Or it shows the long-winded journey of someone on a quest for answers they expect to change their life while the viewer knows that the answer they're seeking is simple and meaningless. Ya agreed. My office is a little insular - everyone does things a similar way. It's mostly extroverted SJ's. ESTJ's are surprisingly good at this actually, they can be charming when they want to be lolI'll take a look at that post! And if you're missing out on the wonderful world of intuition, we're missing out on the wonderful world of, well, the real world lol. Embrace your type!Stephen Colbert's an INFP apparently, and he seems ENTP-ish because the character he plays is very Ne-oriented. I also have some close INFP friends who seem super extroverted around me because our humor syncs up so well.

So basically, you very well could be an INFP - being outgoing around people just reflects your high-up Ne. 

I think this is a common struggle in identifying your type - type descriptions are often kind of mystical and don't explain that they're effectively painting a landscape of a type's mind rather than explaining how they behave, and then people try to translate those pictures into behavioral patterns that just don't really line up.Thanks, I really appreciate the advice. I think the networking is hard mostly because nobody really guides you through it. I'm starting to take initiative to figure that out for myself by joining a bunch of groups and going to events and just meeting more people. Well that's just some classic insecurity that you need to work through. I think what you learn over time is that you want to be accepted for who you are, but you can't force who you are. You can be outgoing and witty without diminishing yourself. I don't know if that function of personality relates to the MBTI at all, but it seems to be present in everyone to some extent. I think it exists to guide you towards people who really accept you, not to force you to compromise yourself.Ya that makes sense. They state to conclude, we state to test theoriesThat's certainly possible. To the INTJ type example, a LOT of people misidentify as that type, particularly ISTJs, and even many ESTJs. The INTJ stereotype kind of ignores Ni and makes then look like the ultimate Te machine, which the two above types have high up. 

It's a chicken-egg scenario though. Does the stereotype lead those people to misidentify, or does it exist because they misidentify? I always thought it was the former, as the so-called "sensing bias" seemed to be present in the descriptions of functions in common sources. I.e. the descriptions name ISTJs sound like a "worse" type than INTJsHuh. On the one hand I can be kind of clumsy at times, which I thought was partially because Se would be my 8th function. But on the other hand, I'm really good at noticing changes in my environment, i.e. a coworker gets a haircut or a new suit. I ALWAYS notice! 

I wonder if the latter is through use of Se as my 8th function, or just that I identify trends really well through Ne and notice when those trends are broken.Everyone tests variably for their mbti type, so I'm inclined to believe that it's not related. Types also don't change from what I've seen, though I know some people think they do. 

You may want to look into your enneagram type if you're interested in how personality types play into schizophrenia. I don't understand the condition, but I recalled some types tending towards it as their level of health/development decline so I looked it up. Types 5 and 9 (which is my type) are linked below, both can correspond to schizoid disorders. Take a look, I hope it helps you find some answers.

https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5/
https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-9/Basically it boils down to the fact that they don't typically subscribe to their environment by default, they rather defer to their own judgment in matters small and large. Ni gives certainty of subjective vision, Te is objectively rational, and Fi is very independent. So I as an ENTP, to contrast, may be no more or less "weird" internally, but I am generally easier for other types to accept. Ne communicates with the outside world more, and doesn't have opinions or internally devised standards like Ni. I also have Ti-Fe, which gives me a desire to boil things down to their simplest form and to communicate that info in a way that is broadly understandable.FAQ:

Q) What is my type? 
A) ISTJ

Q) But I tested as an INTJ!
A) ESTJ

Q) I just really think people view me as in control of my life, so I'm pretty sure I'm an INTJ.
A) ISFJ

Q) I said I'm an INTJ! The test says I'm an INTJ, how could you claim to know more than the test, you fool!?!?
A) ESFJ

;P

(Disclsimer: this was drawn more from real life experience than from the forum)I have two points to contribute here:

1) A lot of the SJ bias/negativity comes from the lapse in communication between them and N types in the real world combined with the fact that more N types gravitate towards the mbti system. SJ types, at least unhealthy ones, can really antagonize N's in the work force. It's easy for them to dismiss N-style thinking and articulation simply because it is unfamiliar. SJ types are also often type 6 enneagrams, focusing on inclusion and exclusion at average and unhealthy levels, and N types are more often placed in the excluded category just for being different. 

It's not a rule about how SJ's have to be, just a point of frustration for N types, who are more present in the mbti community than in the general population. 

2) Basically, what many others have said - it's not that prevalent in this subreddit, at least from what I've seen. All the examples I've seen have been sarcastic.A few points! 

1) Ne is your 4th function. You're generally aware of your 4th function and acknowledge its value, but it often eludes you as you aren't that in touch with it. So you will have some kind if draw to Ne dominants as they will to you. I'm an ENTP and get along famously with ISFJs and ISTJs.

2) ENFP is a pretty common type overall. About 9% of the population according to one thing I read

3) I'd bet a few of those 5 ENFP/INFP friends of yours aren't ENFP/INFP. It seems like you're using the number 10 not as a general "9 out of 10 times, blah blah" indicator, but because you have a defined "group of friends" with 10 people. Groups like that tend to develop similar mannerisms, styles, humors, etc., particularly when they're young. That can make it harder to type people.I think Si dominant and auxiliary types can feel more inertia as they age. They feel bound to continue existing in a way that is consistent with their history. If they are unhappy with elements of their past, I could see it turning into a wistful fixation on past events.

I'm not that old (25) and Si is my 4th function, but I not that long ago made some changes in my life that have required me to discard much of my past and to reconstruct my understanding of myself and my mind from the ground up. I think I was partially able to do it because of my Si, but it was also the Si itself that made it difficult, if that makes sense. Moving forward since then has been easy, and I think aging will not be emotionally tolling, but only because I addressed the issues from my past which negatively affected me and held my focus on the wrong placeI don't know much about quadras. Is that a socionics concept?It says that the tests are not that good :D.

Watch Michael Pierce's videos on INTPs and INFPs on YouTube; those types are actually quite different, and his explanations are very clearGood point. 

The tests are basically only bad because people are often very self-unaware and can't answer the questions objectively. This leads to people falsely answering questions to match some distorted version of themselves, and to people typing themselves as a type whose strengths are the weaknesses they're trying to hide. 

As far as the population data - it's probably not reliable to the actual percentages, but the gist of it is accurate. Humans across cultures really aren't that different, and I think the US would actually have a type mix most closely representative of the global population. Plus, looking at the general distribution of types, it doesn't seem arbitrary from an evolutionary perspective.Ti is more similar to Fi than to Te in some ways. It's a subjective, internal judging function. It's fed information by the perceiving functions, and judges in conjuction with Fe. 

A Ti user might reject objective data for a number of reasons. For example, he may be very invested in the way a thought system he formed works and shut out contradictory data. Maybe he decides that some moral construct in society is more important to him than the facts. 

I've found that some INTP's I know don't accept new information unless you put some real effort intuition convincing them of it. They're not interested in searching for new data, but once they've accepted it they work to assimilate it into their total rational understanding of the world.To extend it, we should make things perfectly even. Because we say "intuitive", we should also say "sensitive", right? :DCouldn't help myself lol. I do agree the distinction could be helpfulI was introduced to and began studying the mbti quite young (13 or 14), but I think one personality tend I noticed was the instinct stack in the enneagram. SO dominants in particular stood out to me for some reason. I can't recall if I notice other tendencies,There's some confusion about E vs. I because extroversion and introversion are concepts we use in other contexts. There's a correlation between the mbti definition and the cultural definition, but our minds are too complex to define ourselves with one or the other in the cultural definitionESFJs, imo. If they're not very healthy people, at least. They can be very indignant and rile themselves up by riling others up about rules being broken. One form of this is the onslaught of social media rage around elections (not just ESFJs but a reflection of Fe).I was typed by a Norwegian MBTI guru who was a friend of my father's when I was 13, and he happened to be right about my type! He had a company that focused on helping business owners implement the MBTI to increase productivityThe difference is your high up Fi and her dominant Fe. You want her to understand what you're going through on an individual level, and you feel like she isn't getting it, or that she doesn't care that deeply. 

She may or may not get it, and she may or may not care, but regardless her way of showing or articulating it will be out of sync with what you naturally expect.Always got a strong ENFP vibe from NarutoThat's an awful notion born from the mindset of a person who believes he or she has no self worth. If you value yourself you wouldn't believe you had to catch or hold a partner; you would believe that your partner, or partner to be, wants to be with you because they value you too.

I suppose the statement isn't inaccurate for what most people aim for in life, but my philosophy is that true happiness is the only logical reward we can strive to attain.1- I mean whoever chooses to live by these words rather than to live by their own volition

2- This was a broader statement. What I mean is that most people don't realize the extent of happiness we can experience in life, for various reasons. It's not a fault; there's no way to understand it until you have it, and society's general definitions of a happy life are lacking in some key ways. 

3 - it means that the happiness should be the focus and the goal of our lives. Focusing on "the work" rather than the happiness is like saying that every potential life partner is the same, and the only reason your partner could have for staying with you is the effort you put in. You should love your partner because you admire them and want to be around them, not because they show their deference to you by putting in massive amounts of effort to suppress their needs in sacrifice for yours. A relationship based on effort and work rather than love, mutual respect, and mutual admiration is one that precludes the people involved from being fully happy.There's a distinction you're not making here between showing interest because you're interested and feigning interest because you have an agenda. Wanting something from someone is fine. Hoping that they will want what you want is fine. Trying to make them give you what you want is not; it implies that you only care about what they do for you and you have no regard for them beyond the gains you can draw from them.That's not what I'm saying at all...I see little to no validity in either of the two types I know best: ENTP (my type) and INTJ (my wife's type). They seem to kind of blend common, inaccurate stereotypes with odd, inaccurate stereotypes that they themselves have developed. 

I'm an incredibly patient person, and was even often described as "stoic" by teachers through middle school. It's one of my defining characteristics. Also, is it just me or does the author have something against INTJ's? "Always stressed by feelings of inadequacy"? What does that have to do with the MBTI??

What really stresses me out in relation to my ENTP type are the following: having senseless limitations placed on me, being forced to do something that I feel is sub-optimal (sometimes the "way it's always been done", sometimes not), and being discouraged from sharing new ideas for improvement. 

I'm speaking for another type on this one so it may be less accurate, but I think the thing that stresses INTJ's out the most would be seeing a mistake that they've warned against or predicted made repeatedlyThere's actually a book written about this topic: https://www.amazon.com/Hitler-Biography-Ian-Kershaw/dp/0393337618

... :PI haven't looked into it deeply, but INFJ really seems to fit. What's the argument for ENFJ over INFJ? It's not relevant to the original post, in just curious lolI'm pretty sure he's in SlytherinI do what I can :)I also loved Inside Out. Saw it on a recommendation and assumed it was just gonna be a nice, fun, feel good cartoon movie in the general vein of mega fast paced, over-stimulating children's media. What I got instead was very special.Wow, long story. I apologize for not reading it, particularly because many of my favorite writers are INTJs! 

I just thought I'd mention that my wife, INTJ, gets along really well with ISFPs. Her mother and brother are both that type, along with many of her friends. I think it has a lot to do with Fi. Fi is ISFP's dominant function. While it's only INTJs tertiary function, Fi is generally very important to them. I've heard it said that the tertiary function is something that we truly, deeply value but is always somewhat elusive to us, and that people can often perceive that function as a key to the ultimate truth or purpose of life.I just got a notification that Michael Pierce released his second video on ENFP on YouTube, you should watch it! I haven't yet, but the other videos are excellent and follow a common formatLogic Error! The only difference between INFP and ISFP is that ISFP's can't read.

Hehe just kidding, couldn't help myself :)It sounds to me like you want things from her that she isn't willing to give, and she wants things from you that you're not willing to give. I don't think the mbti can explain that. My father-in-law is an INTJ and my mother-in-law is an ISFP. They live very harmoniously. They both kind of do their own thing, in each other's presence. Neither wants to change the other, and neither places demands or expectations on the other. My mother-in-law wouldn't tell my father-in-law to do something that's her responsibility for her without good reason, and he wouldn't get mad at her for using her time how she wanted to.Cool! That's an interesting point about how we can misidentify others based on inter-functional dynamics. It took me a long time to get a sense for INFP's. I literally thought I didn't know any, but then I realized that my Ne Dominance (capitalized for dramatization) drove their auxiliary Ne kind of wild to the point where I thought it was their dominant function too. It turns out I have two really close friends who are INFPs!The tests tend to be bad because, well, how could they be good? The patterns of the mind are very complex and go beyond what the MBTI accounts for. Things like fears and desires, traumas, personality disorders, overall health of the mind, etc. all play a big role in how you think. (Side note: the Enneagram accounts for many of those patterns). The tests try to isolate MBTI functionality in their questions, but in order for the test taker to do that accurately he would need to know the system in detail to prevent conflating MBTI function with other patterns. But, if you know that much about the MBTI, why would you want or need to take the test?? 

In general, the longer the test the better, though. If you think of each question as creating a data point, and you think of each data point having a wide margin of error due to the above argument (more of a circle than a point), then with a certain number of questions a relatively accurate pattern will still emerge. 

Eventually, someone should work to consolidate the MBTI and the Enneagram; they work well as compliments, and have a fair amount of overlap. Maybe the solution is just to develop a test that tests for both types so as not to confuse traits described by one system with traits that the other system must be stretched very thin to explain.

And as far as your being an ISFJ - you guys TOTALLY don't get enough credit! Maybe it's because you have the same exact functions as me in the opposite order, but I've always been incredibly impressed with ISFJ's and get along with them really well. I think descriptions wrongly make you sound mundane; descriptions tend to be N biased. You can do just as much that I can't do as I can do that you can't.My wife is an INTJ. Fi is a very central part of her thinking, just like Fe is of mine. I've heard the third function described as something you strive for. You may think of it more consciously than your first two functions; the first two are implicit in your being while the third is active, yet elusive. Think of Ayn Rand as the perfect example of this. She's an INTJ who created amazing works of fiction, developed a philosophical system of thought, and pushed for political understanding all with the central theme of the supreme importance of the individual mind (Fi).

As far as Se goes, the evidence is less clear. Conjecturing based on a comparison with myself, a repressor of Si, I would say that she has a very clear understanding of physical data she takes in compared to me. I tend to focus on my impressions of objects or events, or on how they effect me, whereas she doesn't search for depth in physical data but takes it plainly and exactly for what it is.Haha you're really on a mission here. Well just keep in mind that you're not defined by your type. You are who you are. The MBTI is a tool that identifies patterns in the ways we think, nothing more, no matter how many people misinterpret it.Well maybe it's harder with Fe high up in your stack, but you could try to not let the biased implementations bother you and focus on the system itself and what it can help you understand about yourself. I think the biases came from Myers and Briggs in many ways - maybe you could focus on learning from Carl Jung for a while instead. There's less of a distractingly active community involved in that so the information will be more pure, plus Jung is an INFJ and shares your two middle functions and you may understand his way of thinking betterYes you can. I try to take vibe as an initial theory when typing someone, then I use harder logic to validate. Sometimes it's specific, like an ENTP vibe, or sometimes it's broader, like "I'm feeling a lot of Ne energy here" or "this dude does NOT seem like a J." I'll start with the vibed type or trait as an assumption then try to fit the rest of the pieces of the puzzle around that base. 

Example. I was trying to type Henry Kissinger earlier after seeing celebrity types labeled him an ENTP. I launched a clip of him speaking on YouTube and instantly got an NT vibe. I recalled examples of other politicians, economists, etc. to myself to compare him to and quickly ruled out ENTJ based on a comparison with Milton Friedman, whom I believe is an ENTJ, largely because Friedman is much more abrupt, and seems more concerned with convincing you of his ideas than he is with the ideas themselves. I then ruled out INTJ while comparing him with Ayn Rand, an INTJ, because he is far less conclusive; Rand gives you  absolute answers, Kissinger gives you lots of broader information and solutions that he is detached from. Narrowing to INTP from there was harder since INTP and ENTP are quite similar, but I thought about what it would take for me, an ENTP, to speak that slowly and to hide my true desire to simply explore possibilities, and decided that it would be impossible. Kissinger is too reserved, to steady, and shows little to no desire to open up closed books just to see if he finds something new. 

So, voila, sample typing method based on vibe!ISFPs be like http://giphy.com/search/mic-dropIt's a debated point, but I firmly believe that mbti types are inherent and, in some ways, visible from day 1. Narrowing down a specific type I'm sure is much harder before the child can speak intelligibly, but the type is there. 

For example, I was obsessed with learning how things worked and building things from a very young age. I LOVED my Thomas the Tank Engine train track set. There's a video tape of 3 year old me on Christmas morning opening up a present and shouting at the top of my lungs "It's a viaduct!!" Now that alone could sound like some kind of STP, but the way I spent my time in these things was different. I would mess all the pieces up and rebuild the whole track in a different way each time; I built out the "possibility", exploring the nuance of the design as I went, and took it apart to start from scratch as soon as I finished. Adding a single additional piece (like a viaduct) to the mix literally changed my world; with any piece able to connect to any other piece, one new addition meant dozens or hundreds of new worlds I could create. 

So again, it may be hard to read from am outside perspective, but I believe the type is there. 

Presumably you have a kid or kids? How old are they? What do they like to do?I think people often gravitate towards systems like the mbti to help find themselves and their identity. Maybe for a time some people try to adopt a personality that isn't natural to them because of the stereotypes along that path of finding themselves, but acting differently than you are causes a lot of dissonance and will usually be dropped fairly quickly. Some people who are very distant from their natural state, perhaps because of narcissistic parents or other traumatic experiences, may cling to that false identity for much longer.I've seen a lot of episodes, but not in a while. "Asshole character" was a bad description lol, I just meant the way he accentuates his "I don't care what you think" attitude. The more important point of what I was trying to say is that he's more established by the time No Reservations roles around, and he's playing a character more than he was in A Cook's TourI think the focus on doing things/doing them well comes from his type 3 enneagram, but I also think plenty of INFPs (and ISFPs) have that enneagram type and/or the drive to do things and to do them well.I think ISFPs just tend not to be interested in the mbti so there aren't many present in the online mbti community asking about themselves like a lot of us other types doIt's because people often would rather feel that they're misunderstood than acknowledge they have faults.

INFJ seems, to those who don't know much about mbti, like a type of person who is so distinct that society will always tend to pull away from them. If you feel like there's something about you that people don't accept (regardless of whether there really is or isn't), then you find this thing that says you're just misunderstood because you have incredibly deep empathy and vision that others can't relate to, you'll want to believe that that's true rather than face the fact that you're just a little insecure. It's easier to believe that you're different than to believe you have problems, even though everyone has problems, and even though you can't solve those problems without really understanding yourself. It's the same reason so many people want to be INTJs, who are perceived to be misunderstood geniuses*clears thoat*... I believe you mean.. "whom" do I admire most? 

Hehe

I'm an ENTP - I'd have to say Nikola Tesla, though Benjamin Franklin is a close second. Franklin is the ultimate ENTP - self-made man, making both simple and complex inventions, learning many languages, mastering chess, writing prolifically, making general improvements to all societies he was a part of. I admire him as an example of the "best" a normal person can be in terms of acquiring knowledge and using it for good. 

Tesla, in the other hand, impresses me on a very different level. Simply learning about him put me in awe. He is an unquestionably unique and unmatchably capable man. He's the only person I've read much about I can really call a genius.I've actually found that the SJ types really like the MBTIWhat?In the relative dawn of my MBTI-knowledge refinement, I used to think every INFP I met was an ENFP because I (being an ENTP) basically made their Ne go insane, making them seem like over-the-top cheerful, bubbly types. I even had an INFP roommate I was really close with whom I didn't realize was an INFP until I, a few years after he moved to a different city, got married and saw that he wasn't smiling in ANY of my wedding pictures. I started to think about how he is always soul-searching and spends a lot of his effort thinking about whether he's doing the right thing for himself. It should have been obvious from the beginning, but because he "socialized" with my dominant function I came to identify him by the way he used that function. (Long story short, I agree with you)

Another thought - it's possible that non-MBTI psychological trends, such as traumas, personality disorders, or lower levels of enneagram health could affect social extroversion or introversion. But the way those things work (based on my observations) is like a force that the individual enacts constantly upon himself. This would cause dissonance, and there's only so much of your natural psychology you can repress, so I don't know how far this factor could go. An example would be something like an extrovert who was hit by a parent every time he spoke. Call him an ENFP for argument's sake: the concept that using his Ne actively causes pain will be inculated in his mind, and he will turn to his inner world and come to rely on it while suppressing his dominant function. Again, I don't know how much of his Ne that person could really hide, but it would certainly distort his psychology in a way that makes his social intro/extroversion in relation to his MBTI type more ambiguous. I don't know if there have been studies, but in some families it seems random and in others it seems to be passed. For example, my family:

Father ENTJ
Mother ISFJ
Sister ENFJ
Me ENTP

But my wife's family:

Father-in-law INTJ
Mother-in-law ISFP
Brother-in-law ISFP
Wife INTJThanks! I appreciate the broad, all-encompassing scope, and I agree that work can't be your only focus if you want to be happy. 

Fortunately for me, I met the love of my life and married her last September, and we are very focused on our relationship and our health. Also in terms of work-life balance, I have a few hobbies which I love. I play classical piano and compose music, and I read a lot and study topics that interest me, and I play video games a bit (usually only when a particular game catches my interest. I'm not playing anything now, but I'm really excited for No Man's Sky!) My wife and I also spend a lot of time typing virtually everyone we meet in enneagram and mbti. While it sounds like a lot of stuff to be doing when it's listed together, I actually just do it all at a fairly relaxed pace and don't pressure myself to "perform" at any of my hobbies. I just spend my spare time doing things that I enjoy. 

I think the emphasis on balance will be very important for me in my career. I face a lot of rejection on a daily basis, and knowing that the job is not the only realm I exist in helps me detach from that rejection and keep going. 

P.S. As far as your type goes, I'd be more inclined to think you're an ENTP than an INTJ. Your communication style seems similar to mine in that you kind of section things off and elaborate then break for a new section. Also, rather than making a series of individual points which add up to a Whole, you seem to be communicating the Whole which is made up of a number of constituent points (an INTJ would do the former, an ENTP the latter)

Thanks again!Yes. There are monotonies involved, like cold calling, but the work is engaging for me and I am well suited to it. Thanks, this is great advice! I hadn't thought of focusing on my own style as detracting from a focus on the client's needs before, that is really good insight. In fact, I'll try that out today while I'm on the phoneIt's not by choice. You're either born with it or it develops in infancy, before speech. It also doesn't change, like some people claim.Sharing a dominant function with the opposite direction, plus sharing an auxiliary preference (T vs. F or N vs. S), works well. 

Other combos can work well too, but it seems to me that couples with this configuration tend to set off on a mutual growth path more consistently. The dominant function I think is more important, particularly if you aren't *extremely* T or F.

I'm an ENTP and my wife is an INTJ, so we have that configuration. We actually met at an mbti discussion group, but we didn't pick each other because of type or anything, we just naturally gravitated towards each other. Communicating is really easy, and the same kinds of things are important to us. My brother-in-law and his girlfriend are another good example - ISFP and ESFJ. He's seemed happier than ever since they got together.

So for ESTJ (Te-Si) it would be ISTP (Ti-Se), and INTP (Ti-Ne) it would be ENTJ (Te-Ni)Anytime!Someone once told me Hillary Clinton is an INTJ, that was pretty funnyAnyone can be balanced and likable, or imbalanced and unlikable. The"reasons" would likely have to do with a blend of enneagram type and the INFJ cognition. The overlying INFJ aspect would likely be that their Ni dominant function works outside of the "real world", while their Fe gives them a strong desire to align with others.

For example:

An unhealthy INFJ enneagram 9 could be too detached from the present and spend a lot of time dreaming / idealizing to the point where they neglect their responsibilities towards others while simultaneously making promises they forget to keep, causing those others not to like them. 

An INFJ 1 could form very rigid moral principles entirely in their minds. The principles by definition would contradict the way a majority of people behave, causing the INFJ a lot of stress and likely anger when he observes this "wrong" behavior in others. That in turn makes them overly instructive, demanding, and possibly pretentious, and hence unlikeable.

An INFJ 6 could similarly have strong beliefs about how a greater power (anything from a parent to a boss to a God) should treat and care for their constituents, placing strong and unexplained expectations, both on that "power" and on the other "constituents" (coworkers, siblings, devotees). These people, who have likely never agreed to abide by the invented standards, could become very frustrated with the INFJ.


Of course, a well balanced INFJ can be comfortable with the differences between himself and others, and live by his own standards without conflict, and could even grow to inspire others to live by those standards by choice, or to devise standards of their own that suit them better.Thanks! It's funny you say that because my descriptions of 1 and 9 were based on observations of INFJ's I know personally, whereas my 6 description is more speculative. 

I'd love to hear you elaborate a bit about your 6 stuff since I don't know any INFJ 6's personally! Sure! I'm mostly curious about how your type manifests in a work setting, and in your relationships with coworkers, if you could focus there :)Maybe having Fe third makes their insecurity more apparent if they are younger, or not really in touch with themselves. But there's no reason anyone would actually be more or less insecure based on MBTI type. That has more to do with their early life experiences. Once they reach adulthood, those experiences could continue to plague them if they don't make an effort to develop beyond them.I'm pretty sure this is Carl Jung's type!Look into the enneagram if you're curious about personality disorder tie-ins. There are correlations in enneagram and mbti types that may give you clarity. For example, types 3 and 7 generally degrade to narcissism in lower levels of health. 2's can display convert narcissism / codependence. I think you'll find the enneagram world explains this kind of stuff a lot better than the mbti! I've generally observed that mbti type brings color to the personality disorder, but doesn't dictate which disorder the person has.ENTP!

Interestingly, the most humble type is also ENTP! :DHaha ya it could actually be true!LoveThose sides of people are always negative. Nobody is pure and positive inherently, but healthy, happy, balanced people work to neutralize that side of themselves, whereas unhealthy, unhappy, bad people work to hide that side of themselves from the people in their life. Take the accounts of many people who, amidst this uncovering of the abuse of power, have said things like "I have met Harvey Weinstein many times, and he was a perfectly normal, charming man." 

I went to a Catholic school when I was a kid, and the general attitude towards evil could be approximately summed up by saying "the devil is always looking for a way in, so he can make you do bad things." I think it isn't wrong to think of your dark side as a separate being, but rather than it being a being that is trying to push itself on you, you can think of it more as a negative being that you are attached to and who will not leave until you actively reject it. 

That said, to your questions: if I am close with a person, I react to their dark side by either helping them grow past that side (if they are willing work towards that), and I react by distancing myself from them (if they are not willing to work towards it). The darkness grows if you sweep it under the rug (sometimes to an extreme, as in the case of these powerful abusers we're reading about), but it weakens if you face it head on, openly and honestly, and work to move past it. 

I wouldn't blame yourself too much for idolizing some of these people. You don't know them, you only see what is projected at you by them and the media. You had no information aside from that, and no reason to think these things about them. That said, your guilt over your tendency to idealize is valid, because it is causing you pain now that it is revealed that those fantasies are false. It's not as clear as a "right and wrong", "good and bad" distinction, but clinging to ideas that don't reflect reality can often have this result, so it's good to be conscious of that and to stop yourself from doing it when you notice it.Cool. I use it as more of a framework for understanding patterns that may not be obvious rather than a label or box. There is much more to personality than the systems, so even if you can peg down a person's type you won't really know that much about themHaha I've thought about this before, sometimes my wife and I use the elements to describe people before we have their types figured out. I think the enneagram types and instinct stacks have more to do with bending element than mbti, but there are a lot of correlations between enneagram and MBTI, so it's definitely worth looking into.

Some people I know and their types in all three systems:

Entp, 9w8 SX/SP, air (me)
Intj, 5w4 sx/so, fire (wife)
Isfp, 9w8, sp/so, Earth
Isfp, 9w1, sp/sx, Earth
Isfp, 9w1, sx/sp, air 
Infp, 9w1, SP/so, air
ESTP, 3w4, sp/so, air
Intj, 5w6, sp/sx, fire
Intp, 5w6, sp/so, air
Esfp, 7w8, so/sx, air
Isfj, 6w5, sp/so, air
Infj, 1w2, sp/SX, Earth
Infj, 9w1, sp/sx, air
Estj, 8w7, sx/SP, fire
Estj, 3w4, sp/so, air
Estj, 3w4, SP/so, Earth

Wow I know a lot of 9's... And a lot of air benders. I guess they aren't extinct after all :p

Come to think of it, I can't think of anyone I would identify as a water bender

That was fun!
I'm just gonna back up for a second. It seems you are frustrated because you are putting too much weight on the system. That you want the system to tell you who you are. It can't do that, hence the frustration. Try to analyze yourself on a more personal level, without use of systems. Don't step outside yourself and assess from there, turn your eye inward and find what you see there. It seems that you know a lot about the system, but I think you will be able to find your type only if you find yourself first.Right. Istj's are dominant perceivers (Si). Give them something open, and it can stay open unless there's pressure to close it.

That said, Si has a lot to do with basically cataloging past experience, an relating the new thing to the old before forming an opinion. If you ask him a question about something he has a lot of experience with, maybe something technical, I bet you'll get a quick answer regardless of how open the thing is.Hah! That must be fun. Kids totally have the MBTI (and enneagram) aspects of their personality developed by that pointJust think about the system, and think about real peoples' behavior, and decide for yourself whether you think it's valid.Also, it's not really about belief. It's a framework for describing and understanding behavior and cognition. It's a tool to use, not an idea to believe in.I think the road to comfort has less to do with stimuli, and more to do with identifying what creates the discomfort. If you reflect on the discomfort, you may find that it starts to weaken or cease when you identify the internal source. The stimuli may seem like they're the cause, but your experience is internal to you. You may find for example that the people you're socializing with aren't good for you, or that you feel discomfort due to false expectations you've built up for the interactions.Haha I chased after my wife from the moment I met her, and it was like 10 months before we started dating. Guess who's the Fe user and who's the Fi user :DUsing it could be good in theory, but never in practice, because you need to understand the system incredibly well to make good real world judgements with it. 

Part of this is that you need to be very good at typing people in person, since tests can be inaccurate. 

Another part is that there are no reliable rules to pair types with jobs, so it's better to rely on your own observations. *revised title: 19 out of 20 ____s online seem to be mistyped*

... :DCool observation, thanks! 

I find that my Ne is triggered no matter what once I'm immersed in an activity (making music, playing chess, stuff like that), but it definitely doesn't happen on command. It's almost like the less I focus, the better it works! Too bad love demands that we focus on stuff 😬Cynical outlook, possibly true. But I don't think personality differences account so much for differences in political belief, or that personality differences lead to conflict. I used to think that, but now I think that those issues have more to do with concrete history. I.e. if you have a lot of negative experiences through developmental stages of life, it's harder to interact peacefully with others because you have deeper sensitivities that can cause you to behave negatively. Personality comes into play by informing how those reactions manifest (anger, fear, depression, etc.).

As far as politics go, that just seems to be the place where it's socially acceptable to vent those frustrations. Political beliefs have 0 to do with morality, but people tie moral value to it for whatever reason. Political right vs. left, for example, just has to do with the question "do I want to make my own choices and live with the consequences of them, or do I want someone else (government) to make choices for me and have to live with those consequences." Ultimately, 99% of people lie almost entirely in the middle of that spectrum, because the extreme sides would be absurd and illogical. But there's a lot of indignant finger pointing relating to politics. But anyways, that's not really related to personality type conflicts imo.Maybe if you average shyness / quietness across every member of each type there will be some kind of answer to this, but I just want to point out that this is not a consistent pattern in people that relates to their MBTI type. Meaning, there are tons of chatty ISFPs, ISTJ bes, INFJs, INTPs, etc., even though you may be tempted to label those the "quiet" types.Ah, there's plenty of thunder to go around, I don't have to steal yours :)Good observation! I definitely had this mentality too for a while. I think you're right, it could just be part of learning the system. It's amazing how many people there are in that phase who actively try to propagate their ideas though! It's like an Ayn Rand novel where the less capable insist on overpowering the people they really rely on for information lolNo problem, and thank you! 

If you want, I'd be happy to help you try to figure out your type, here or in DM. Let me know!🤐Hi! I have some random notes here and there, but nothing comprehensive. I think learning from people is always best too. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to give you answers that reflect my understandingWell put! And in line with that, learning about the Enneagram really helped simplify the MBTI for me. There are many real-world behaviors the MBTI doesn't address. Behaviors that just lie outside the realm of cognition that the MBTI described. Basically, understanding the Enneagram helped me isolate behaviors that made it hard to MBTI type people so I could focus on the relevant parts.Thanks for the feedback! I definitely did it in that high school / college period I described in the post. One of the first comments shared an interesting idea, which is that this phase is just part of the process of learning the MBTI. I think for the folks (like you and me!) who think about this notion and address it eventually come out on top of it and are better for it. The quality is like being stuck in your own head, but being willing to get out of your own way when confronted directly by the truth in the outer world. The world has a way of proving its truths to you no matter what you do. So you can either accept those truths and grow because of them, or fight the truth and dig deeper into your own headspace, and become isolated from realityLol! Well we met because of our mutual mbti interest, so maybe that's a good place to find soul mates! But that said, we only went back to the group once or twice, because the issue I just posted about was too annoying 😑Hi, thanks. Your profile says ENFP - how did you arrive at that type? 

I'm happy to help you figure it out. I don't really have different theories about the system itself, I just think it takes a long time to learn to apply it. I think that goes for learning anything actually.Cool. Outside of functional descriptions, what can you tell me about yourself?Haha maybe ENTP's get a similar level of value out of it. I feel like I've always been empathetic in many ways, but struggle to put myself in others' shoes. MBTI gives me a framework with which to do just that, and I don't know if I could have developed that ability without itHitting the MBTI books young! Good for you. It definitely helped me understand others better, which helped me understand myself better.

So based on that, I could see you being any NP type.

Procrastination seems common in NP's I know. Ti and Fi are both very "in your own head" type functions, but they're judging functions. All P types use one of these as their primary judging function, meaning their active focus is aimed inward, and the outer world can seem less compelling. Hence, "procrastination" - you care more about determining the ideas than you do about putting them to work. 9 is also a common enough enneagram type for NP's that it could contribute to the overall trend. (That's my enneagram type btw)

The fact that you're thinking about forming habits rather than thinking about specific goals is more P reinforcement.

The fact that you identify a "refined sense of morality" sounds more like Ti to me than Fi, but ultimately it could be either. 

Also, unless you are working very hard to control your tone (which doesn't seem to be the case) I would have a tough time believing you're an extrovert. Even at my most shy or withdrawn moments, I'm pretty enthusiastic, and that has been true my whole life. And as an enneagram 9, I'm a more reserved version of the ENTP archetype.

So ultimately if I had to guess a type, I would say INTP. But that's based on like 7 sentences of online interaction, and no real world observation, so take it for what it's worth.

Also, to the point about being gifted, I just want to sort of frame that for you as someone who was the same as a kid, and who is older, but not by so much that my experiences are no longer relevant for you based on the education system / the work force you'll be entering in under 10 years. View that as an advantage you have, not as something that will guarantee anything for you. Through my whole life, including until now, I've had pretty constant praise for being smart, talented, mature, insightful, etc. My IQ is high, around 135. But in spite of that, I've gotten into a few risky financial situations in my adult life as a result. "Wishful thinking" is something I had to train myself out of. The thing that will really lead you down a path that is happy, healthy, and stable is to identify the things you want in the real world, and to make sure you're spending time on them. If you tune yourself into what is really important to you, you won't have to worry about cultivating habits, because the good habits will just evolve naturally out of your desire to get the things. Basically, just discover what interests you and get really good at it so that, when it comes time to take 100% responsibility for your life, you'll be able to make money doing something you enjoy.

Anyways, I thought I'd throw that in there because I see some similarities between us. Hope this all helps!Totally! I've actually gotten pretty good at translating MBTI to English as a way of sharing my understanding of people without getting deep into technical stuff. It's really useful!Thanks, glad you liked it!!Ya totally. I think the people who use it to judge others basically would just be mindlessly judging others regardless, and they pick up enough mbti lingo to use in their irrationality lolIt's more complicated in some ways, and less complicated in others. I think it gauges more "human" things than the MBTI, so it's easier to understand in real terms, whereas with the MBTI it's easy to over-intellectualize and actually forget about people in the real world while using it. 

That said, there are more complicated dynamics to the enneagram, it's not as cut and dry as "here is your type". There's your primary type, your wing type, your instinct stack, and your level of health / development. The instinct stack is probably the hardest part to understand.

But it actually works well as a complement to the MBTI. They cover different areas, with enough overlap that it's really helpful to know both when typing people.Cool! It's just a local group organized via meetup.comCiao!

Fortunately, a lot that written about it is in fairly plain English, so you should be able to use the built in "translate this page" function in Google chrome to get decent translations.

As is sort of reflected in my post, it can be very useful, but it takes time to establish a deep understanding of the system. That said, from the start it can help you think about how others think in new ways.Nope! 

Haha but really, probably all of them. Basically, just read a lot, think about it a lot, try to make connections without forcing conclusions, and focus on building your understanding. Think about the information you intake, and determine if it makes sense, and how it fits with the rest of your understanding.Lol! I wonder if 1 is common for INFJ. I know a few INFJ's, none of them that well, but one is definitely a 5, two are 9, and one is a 1.

The instinct stacks are cool! There are three, and you have them in a specific order. They are: self preservation (SP), sexual / intimate (SX), and social (SO). SP is about safety, SX is about connecting with others on a 1-to-1 basis (not just romantically), and SO is about group mentalities and people in a broader sense rather than an individual sense. They're confusing because they manifest in very different ways in different types, but that's part of what makes them so cool!When you Google stuff about the enneagram, the enneagram institute comes up. It's actually an amazing resource. I don't know of anything like that for the mbti - it's an organization dedicated to the enneagram that sort of serves like a centralized source of info on it. I think they link to good tests, and all of their information is reliable.Hey! I don't have specific recommendations, but I would say to read as much as you can, and to try to connect the dots between behaviors described and behaviors you recognize in people you know, rather than just focusing on types, labels, and terminology. Haha no I'm not. I work in real estate, I just happen to love this stuffCool! As for the instinct stacks, they would manifest very differently in a 1 or 4 or 5, so I would table that until you're more sure of your base type.

For a light explanation of each possibility:

1 would be very driven by ideals, what you think is right and wrong. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about your beliefs?

4 would be driven by a sense of identity. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about who you are? Where up for in the world? What defines you?

5 would be driven by the truth, finding answers. Do you research a lot, is it hard to get something out of your head before you understand it completely?

It's tricky because you'll have elements of each, but if you think about the strongest patterns that have followed you your whole life, one should rise clearly above the rest!Cool! I married a 5, which is a big part of why I understand this stuff so well, so you could always try that too :DMy wife? INTJNope. I think it's best to share dominant functions in opposite directions (Ne Ni, Te Ti, etc) while also sharing judging preference (both T or both F).

That's the magic formula that units me and my wife at least!Correct.Lol what? What do you mean?Oh ok. I actually like having the Te reality checking power to help balance me out. I think as a Ti person I can "miss the point" a lot because I'm focusing on what's in my own mind more. Bouncing my thoughts off of a Te person, particularly one who knows me well, helps me narrow down the possibilities and find a best course of action in a lot of situations.I psychology and typing is generally stressful for people. Once you reach a strong level of self understanding, it doesn't hurt to discuss your shortcomings. But if you think if yourself, say, as a "strong" person, then you test as a type that's described as easy-going, but you don't want to face that about yourself, that can stress you out. The idea of being a "strong" person is super vague, and can really apply to any type, but the descriptions of some types wouldn't use that kind of language. But anyways, some people respond to that stress by lashing out or whatever. 

So that could contribute to ebbs and flows of general bitterness in the group.Hey arch! That's interesting, I would have thought an ENFP would get along really well with an INFJ? Both dominant intuitives, and both feelers. Sort of covering both sides of the same coin with their functionsThat makes sense! Like if you meet a person I'm confident is a certain type, then you meet someone of the same type, even if that person isn't annoying to you it could bring up memories of the first annoying person.

New theory about the SJ bias: maybe a lot of teachers are SJ's and some people develop a disliking for those traits at a young age? LolThat makes a lot of sense. As a kid you're patted on the back for being good at a range of things, and for showing"potential," but the older you get the more important it is to generate results in a specific areaI don't think that's 100% true. But regardless, I'm just looking for info from people who have something in common with my friend who can give some perspective that I can share with him.Cool. What's your type?

I'm wondering what types I'm "supposed to" have trouble with. I tend to communicate well with most people. When I can't communicate well, it's usually because the person is very closed off and basically don't openly communicate with anyone. But there's no type pattern I can see amongst them.That's interesting, what do they do that rub you the wrong way? Hah thanks for the info and smiles. 

So just to clarify my point of view and the kind of info I'm looking for:

I'm really not asking "can ISFPs enjoy and be good at video editing?" I don't know why the question came across that way. I'm just looking for perspective from people similar to my friend. I don't think it's a stretch of the system to say that other people with the same Myers Briggs type would have similar views, strengths, and weaknesses. If that weren't the case, there would be no point in discussing the MBTI at all lol.

But MBTI aside, I truly don't believe that "anyone can succeed at anything." There are plenty of things I'm bad at, and plenty of things I'm good at. Some of that can be accounted for by my type, some can't. At the end of the day, hard work is the most necessary component of success, but there are jobs that you are well suited to, and jobs you aren't. You're a kick-ass video editor - would you be just as good as a military officer? Or a veterinarian? Those are just two random examples, but assuming equal amounts of hard work in either of those jobs, one person probably could not succeed equally in either job. And beyond the idea of success, would someone who makes a great vet be happy with a military lifestyle?

Clarification of my views aside:

I'd love to hear it if you have more to say about being a video editor in general. Do you like the workflows and lifestyle? Do you work remotely or at an office? What are the best and worst parts about it?Wow, thanks so much! Ya, this was exactly the kind of stuff I was hoping for! I'll forward this stuff along to him. He studied film in school, then had a couple of jobs, some related to what he studied and some not. After a while, he started his own small video production company. He's never done any of the shooting or editing himself at his company - it's a one-man company, and he gets third parties to do this stuff. 

But recently he's been doing some self reflection and discovery, and is realizing that he doesn't really like being a business owner. It's stressful for him because he doesn't like the sales aspect of it, and his income is unpredictable. So ya, I'm thinking editing could be good for him! 

Thanks again!Haha I don't know why but the title of this post made me laugh!

I know a number of INFPs who are either uncertain of their type, or are convinced they are another type than INFP. 

INFPs tend to have strong imaginations, and strong ideas about themselves / their identity. Because they are judging dominant (in spite of being P types), and that dominant function is introverted, they focus inward, into their own heads when coming to conclusions. This can reflect a style that isn't as receptive to new information as it processes (this goes for Ti as well). If they're pressuring themselves to establish their type, they can end up with the wrong type, but if they're not in a rush, they might just be unsure of their type for a while and defer making a conclusion until they know enough about the system to be sure.Makes sense to me! Counter-weights balancing out, with the higher function weighing a bit more then the preceding one.😂😂Ya I don't think EP's are stubborn as a characteristic. I think that as functions, Fi and Ti are stubborn. What you're describing makes sense with that in mind, because you as an ISFP have Fi first and Se second, where your brother as an ESFP has Se first and Fi second. So basically, your "stubborn" function is a higher priority to you than his is to him.Haha ya the first one. I'm just saying the functions are "stubborn" in the way they interact with information, not that those types of people are stubborn. I'm not stubborn at all as a human being, and most P's I know aren't either.Conceptually, yes. It works like the analogy you drew, but you don't have to destroy it to change it. You build it, then tinker with it, changing one piece at a time. The structure is never "perfect" or "finished", it continues to evolve as you learn more and more. 

You're right, because it is a structure, it can resist quick change, and it can be skeptical of new ideas. But it's a balance with other factors of the personality, and most aren't so rigid overall.I'm talking about on Reddit/the internet, and random people in passing, like at work. Learning is a slow process, there are no shortcuts. If you think you've found a way to do what you're asking about, I guarantee you you will be wrong about the person's type 15/16s of the time.Technically ISTP would be best. Same dominant function but facing the opposite direction (Ti and Te)I'm curious if there are other MBTI enthusiasts here who work in real estate. What is your type? How do you think your type influences your work?

I'm a broker in NY, and I'm an ENTP. In terms of my work, I've found that I'm very good at communicating, understanding what they're trying to accomplish, translating that info and customizing my services to their needs, and really clearly articulating how the process works, and getting good results for my clients. What I'm not very good at is finding more people to speak with. I cold call and advertise in volumes that compete with the best of them, but I don't yield results from those activities on the levels that some of my peers do. 

Thoughts/comments? Thanks!So I've noticed that ESFJ often mis-types as ISFP, and ISTJ often mis-types as INTJ. I'm talking about self-typings by people who are relatively new to the system rather than tough types to distinguish between objectively, such as types that share a dominant function.

Do you agree with those two cases? Have you noticed others?I watched like 6 episodes of A Cook's Tour last night and typed Bourdain as a classic INFP and a 3w4, but everyone has him typed as an ESTP on the internet. I feel like that typing is based on his hammed up "asshole" character / unrealistic stereotypes of ESTPs. 

He seems very focused on his own perspectives on his experiences (Fi). He has this internal combat between presentation and authenticity which I see a lot in Fi-3's. He's pretty emotional too, or focused on his personsl emotional experiences. At one point, for example, he was tearing up in a fish warehouse in Japan because he was so awestruck by the quality of the fish and by how seriously the hyper-skilled workers took their jobs. (For the benefit of the stereotype police: I'm not saying crying = INFP. A T type, or at least an ESTP, probably wouldn't have their emotional side tapped in this way). He's also really into words and wordplay, which points to Ne.My wife (INTJ) is constantly trying to convince her ENTP boss that certain problems they encounter are more serious than he makes them out to be.  He seems to hold the belief that many problems are either not dire, or that they will solve themselves. She believes that many problems are signs of impending doom and must be planned for immediately. 

What do you think?I'm looking for some career advice from other NT's. I'm 25 (ENTP, 9w8 sp/so) and establishing myself in the real estate world in NYC. I've recently self-galvanized and decided that I want to be the best real estate broker the world has ever seen. 

I would love to hear what experiences other NT's have had in the working world. What do you do? How long have you been doing it? What challenges have you faced and overcome? What lessons have you had to teach yourself that contradict the textbook approach, or that contradict the stock advice that people seem to love giving?

Any tips would be greatly appreciated!Title says it all!I just type everyone I meet in both the MBTI and Enneagram. 

Sometimes it's useful at work as I can get a flavor for how coworkers and clients think, making it easier to work with them, even if I can't establish a concrete type right away. 

It's always useful in my personal life as it helps me understand and grow closer to the people I care about. It also helps avoid communication-based conflict with those people.

How do you use it?What weaknesses does / should someone who's Se last have?Disclaimer: This may be read as a mini-rant, but really I'm just sharing an objective observation! I don't post here often, largely because of this, so I wanted to share my thoughts and see if the community will receive them.

I love the MBTI. I was initially typed when I was like 13 and, against all odds, I was typed accurately. After a 400 question test, I was given a 50-page report on my type, customized to specifics of my test. The kid me, who had been stealing his older sister's book reports and handing them in with changed name and date because he didn't have the attention span to read a book, read this report cover to cover no less than 20 times. 

I became obsessed. Through high school and college, I tried to type everyone I met. I read about other types constantly. Hours upon hours of study, and more hours trying to apply that study to my knowledge of people in the real world. I thought I knew everything about the MBTI.

Then four years ago, I met my wife (at a Myers Briggs discussion group). She blew me away. Everything she said about the system made perfect sense. It was like encountering that first test again, and I've spent the past four years learning with and from her (in addition to falling head over heels in love, getting married, etc :D). When we're together, MBTI is part of our vocabulary. We don't talk about issues at work without giving our best guess at the types of everyone involved (both MBTI and Enneagram). If a person involved is new to us, we don't pressure ourselves to"conclude" their type at all. We narrow it down, and remain open to all possibilities until the full picture makes sense.

So here I am. I've been thinking about how people think through the lens of the MBTI for more than half of my life, actively studying it for 15 years, and I'm still learning. The system is incredibly complex. People are incredibly complex. And yet (here's the basic point of the post) most people encounter the MBTI and, after reading a few type descriptions, think they understand everything about the system. Then they go and tell their friends what their types are and, when their friends say "oh I think might be an INFP, not an INFJ," they so "no, you're an INFJ! I know more about this than you!" (Simplistic example). There is a tendency for people to get incredibly defensive when it comes to personality typing, and that leads them to draw lines in the sand and say "look no further, the answer is here". But the system is incredibly complicated, and takes years and years and years to master. So why would you stop looking for new information and deeper understanding after like three weeks? Why pressure yourself to have the answers? 

(Aside: this is, I think, the source of "stereotypes" in the MBTI community. Stereotypes are much easier to understand than the true type system, and you don't have to go far to be able to lable people from a position of perceived intellectual power if you rely on them)

This of course doesn't apply to everyone, but it does apply to a large margin. I would say a minimum of half, but it's probably more like 80%. I just feel that when I discuss the MBTI with people, even fully educated psychologists, I rarely get something out of it, and that's because they spend their time trying to convince me the first thing that came out of their mouth was right rather than trying to see what I know and compare notes so we can both learn from the interaction.

TL;DR

The MBTI is super complicated. It takes years to understand at a practical level. And you're wasting time if you're just talking about the MBTI to validate your incomplete understanding. You need to understand how little you understand in order to grow your understanding. Understand? :P

Thanks for "listening", let me know your thoughts!

Are you an ISFP and a video editor? Do you like it? Are you good at it?

An ISFP friend of mine is in video production and looking to make some career changes, and I'm wondering if that could be a good area for him.I've been reading and commenting a bit more here recently, and I'm seeing a lot of people saying things like "I don't like INTJ's" or "ESFP's are the best!"

I know at least one person of each type that I like, and at least one of each type I dislike for various reasons. I think maybe there are trends in MBTI types I like to spend more time with, but there's no one type I would label universally awesome or terrible.

So I'm just trying to understand that notion. I do happen to be a pretty accommodating, accepting, live and let live kind of guy, so maybe that's part of it.

So what are your thoughts on this?I was just commenting on another post and had a thought about the introverted judging functions.

They're self-contained, which makes them kind of stubborn. Conclusions are slower than with their extraverted counterparts when faced with new information. These functions are focused on understanding over action, and are not inherently concerned with time.

So for example, as an ENTP I use Ne followed by Ti. While my primary mode of interacting with the world outside by mind is Ne (dynamic, creative, fast-paced), when I am faced with a problem to solve, a new topic, etc., I can take a while to come to a conclusion because I'm not willing to accept as fact anything that I don't consider proven.

My Ne is willing to consider any possibility, and is incredibly open to information, but my Ti is the eternal skeptic. I guess this could be a funny duality existent in all P types (which all have introverted judging and extroverted perceiving). Ps are supposed to be more "go with the flow" than Js, but maybe we're just that way because we want to buy time to form our real opinions!
Material, ie the seemingly most common metric whereby Te dom/aux measure success hehe.  I like teaching people things and getting them excited about practical life changes :D  I also have a fair bit of wanderlust, though not as much as most of the ENFPs I've known.  Buying a house actually somewhat appeals to me hahahah...  It wasn't a joke.  I'm also not 18 which seems to be the age of the average redditor.  A lot of people get pretty funny ideas about types, seeing people who are supposedly of a given type, on sites like this one.  An 18 year old entp is not the same person as a 36 year old entp.  Aww it tried to make a burn :)  Why is it following me around though?  It wasn't a comeback... you're an idiot.  Haha I find it amusing that in his mind ENTPs should want to argue or banter with him or something.  Do you think all furries are like this? I had always kind of assumed that people who like to dress up like animals and have awkward sex would be kind of shy?  I have an ex or two who could likely explain that pretty well.  Are you sure about the ENTP typing?  The way you responded emotionally here towards someone presenting an abstract idea which was a direct response to your question, is highly uncharacteristic.  Also giving fucks for downvotes, and talking about "Fi vibes", handwaving about "what it feels like", rather than parsing out the reasoning is very un NeTi-like.  Oh sorry I happen to have a life outside of reddit lol.  I will respond later.  Super late for work today.  Nice feels though&gt; Eh you don't even know me How was that emotional?   

You're being emotional now and your previous post was also laden with emotion.  This is not to say that ENTPs have no emotions or never respond emotionally... however you're having an emotional response to people questioning your ideas, and arguing against their perceived motives/morals or expertise.  Further you seem to be threatened by the idea of being a different type, and support your argument with appeals to authority as opposed to analysis, which is much more of a FiTe pattern.    

&gt;  I'm a thinker and emotions come after thinking for me.  

That's not what being a thinker/feeler means.  It's what you consider and how you consider it, with "F" being the moral/emotional/human content/considerations, and "T" being the analytical/impersonal considerations.  An Fe feeler will most of the time consider the group dynamic, well being of the group, opinion of the group first and with greater weight.  That Fe is an extroverted function means that its locus of consideration is subjective from the outside/inside.  An Fi feeler will most of the time consider subjective moral/emotional considerations, either of self or the individual in question first and with greater weight.  Given that it is an introverted function the locus of consideration is subjective to the individual, ie inside/out.    

Your responses seem to indicate a locus of consideration beginning with how the ideas as presented reflect on you subjectively... granted our particular discussion is concerning your type, but this is what I noticed in your response to the alleged ENFJ.   

&gt; I don't even know what you're getting at there because anyone can pick up vibes no matter what type so that's basically just you pulling in a stereotype and trying to say an ENTP can't pick up vibes because they don't have Ni in their stack  

No, and frankly if you were more interested in the ideas I had/would present rather than defending the identity you've chosen you would ask me what I thought rather than leaping to a number of conclusions which to you render my thinking invalid.  

What I was saying about the "vibes" and "handwaving" is that INTP/ENTP tend to address ideas and assertions very specifically and precisely because they use Ti first/second in their stack.  Ti is driven to begin with a fact/assertion and build an argument from there.  Building an idea around "vibes" and "feelings" is very imprecise and subjective to the self (a la Fi), rather than subjective to a precise idea.   

&gt; Not saying this has any significance but I was typed by an MBTI consultant finally after having so much trouble determining my type.  

So an "authority" is the final word?  Not a careful analysis of the available data and ideas?  

&gt; Are you sure you're an ENTP? Because that was pretty judgemental of you to have to point that out and make judgements about me when you don't know me. But who knows. If you aren't sure you're an ENTP and so you have to pull out stereotypes to make others "question" their type, then maybe you should see a consultant too. They make you take multiple tests and then they just ask you questions about yourself. It is the best way to go.  

Feelings.... and attacking the authority of the source again.  FiTe imo  
Eh reasonably sure, though it doesn't matter so much to me, as I believe the process of trying to evaluate oneself and others via various frameworks and perspectives is where the actual value lies in MBTI/etc.  I am not "an ENTP".  The concept of NeTiFeSi is simply a theoretical framework by which I might analyze my own metacognition in relation to others, with a high degree of inaccuracy.  Along those lines I think it interesting to consider that were I to use FiTe higher in my stack I would allegedly be more likely to give a shit as to which "bucket" (Te) my super important concept of self and individuality (Fi) I fit into ;)  

&gt; I don't want to start a fight   

Why should it be a fight.  Come on by /r/entp and I think you might notice that we discuss ideas without getting emotional about them all the time.  It's what NeTi delights in.  

&gt;  More than likely you won't reply because you don't know what to say and you have no more to argue, which is not something a stereotypical ENTP would do considering your oh so "vast" knowledge of type theory. That's all.  

I'm sorry I hurt your feels, that was not my intention.  
For me it primarily looks like:  

Forgetting I have a body for hours at a time.  Having a hard time forming habits.  Forgoing sleep while I feed my Ne.  Being drawn to order the same thing at a given restaurant (and liking it).  
Can you explain to me how that's even funny?  I honestly don't get it.  Maybe I'm just too old.  Is it because of the SJW obsession with Israel/Palestine?  I find most sports boring, though I do like to play some.  I enjoy watching american football on occasion, though I rarely go out of my way.  I do like tools and hardware, and I want to have my own woodworking shop some day.  I know how to build some things.  I know how to hunt (with a rifle), shoot bows, dress a deer, start a fire, split wood, fish, build a shelter, ride and care for horses, etc.  I'm no doomsday prepper but I think I'd be ok if the roving bands of sensors didn't get me (jokes I make jokes).  I have renovated a run down house, know a few things about cars, furnaces, and can handle my own in a fight.  

Most my friends are women. I have a much easier time getting close to women, I think partly because they aren't bothered if I'm a little domineering and don't look like a potato.  I dislike men who try to seem overly "macho" and wonder just how insecure they really are.  I do what I like.  Doing what you like is "manly" to me.  Being tough in the face of difficult circumstances is "manly".  It's also womanly.  Confidence and capability are hot af.  I also think it's "nly" to understand your inner world.  To have a relationship with your ego to the extent that you understand what might be motivating you.  To try to be aware of your weaknesses.  To be strong enough to offer compassion.  To be welcoming of criticism as an opportunity for growth, and so on.  

Anyways I don't think this is so much an Ne thing as it is not an unhealthy Te and/or Si thing.  (unhealthy ISTJs are the WORST) The majority of people you're going to find with traditional, and frankly childish, ideas about "what a REAL man is" look to other people to tell them who they should be.  Also typically they are underachievers, though not always.  Bigoted thinking increases as people feel unsuccessful in life.  Studies on request, but these sorts of rigid thought patterns are red flags for being kind of a failure.  At least in the US (where the studies were conducted).    

"My group is better than yours because of my skin color.  I'm smarter than half the population cause I pee standing up.  I'm ok because I eat red meat... that makes me ok.  I have a really high IQ!..." etc.  I mean ffs guys can you even hear yourselves?  It's like a little kid saying they're cool because they have a sticker.  Fucking retarded.  I've seen ENFPs go either way with their values even if their actual pursuits are less gender binary.  

I think that Ne dom/aux are most likely to gather alternative viewpoints (as that's what Ne is about), but those viewpoints must still be judged/valued.  Te/Ti/Fi/Fe are the judging functions.  If an ENFP has internalized "traditional gender roles" alternative viewpoints may be weighed against that value system.  Te could then "support" those value judgments with commonly held beliefs about "why" men are like 'y' and women are like 'x'.  

I was married to one of you and though she was less traditional in this respect than the average bean, she was far more influenced by these ideas than I was.  It bears mentioning that my family was far more conservative than hers, so I don't think it was that I had less of that influence in my life; it was more that she internalized those values more from her family or other influences.  In fact her supporting arguments for these ideas were couched in Te and Si.  

There is a reason why ISTJs are known as "the guardians".  

By extension then shouldn't Ni users be more likely to hold stock in traditional gender roles, regardless of judging functions?  I hardly think INFJs fit that bill precisely.  There must be other mechanisms at play.  

I propose that Ne perhaps offers more different perspectives, followed by Ni.  The available data must then be judged, and Ti only cares about logical consistency.  Some Fi users would have their own internal values which mirrored more traditional concepts of gender roles, though there should also be an influence of respecting the value systems of others.  

So far we have INTP/ENTP, ENFP/INFP in that order (with NTPs and NFPs occupying the same "ranking" here).  

Now Te and Fe are the judging functions primarily concerned with what the group thinks/values.  Fe is more about maintaining harmony so it's really going to depend on the dominant culture the Fe user was exposed to.  Te is going to depend on the dominant ideas about how "things work" and "why".  Fe is more flexible than Te as the objective judging functions must reach conclusions.  Things are either "this way" or "that way" conclusively.  

Based on this reasoning between INTJs and INFJs you should see more INTJs who value traditional gender roles.  And I think that's hard to deny.  With Te being higher than Ni in ENTJs, and Fe being higher than Ni in ENFJs they should be relatively more traditional.  
Now we have NTPs, NFPs, INFJs, ENFJs, INTJs, ENTJs.  

Among sensors Si is going to exert an influence on seeing the value in traditional values, as they will have gathered more of that data over time.  Se doesn't give a shit cause it's too busy having fun :D  

So incorporating the above re Fi/Te etc, we should have STPs and SFPs being more laid back than SFJs and finally STJs in that order.  

The final proposed listing from NOT giving a shit to giving a shit being 

NTPs, NFPs, INFJs, ENFJs, INTJs, ENTJs, STPs, SFPs, SFJs, STJs.  

This is just a fun thought exercise but my life experience lends it weight (look ma I'm using Si!)  She did but we still argue about this shit good naturedly haha.  I am judgmental in my own ways and we have had plenty of those famous Fi/Ti clashes over the years.  I will sometimes pick apart her Fi reasons for doing/thinking things, she'll get explosively pissed, cause a goddamn scene, and text me the next day.  This is a recurring pattern "I'm sorry I blew up last night.  I was being an asshole."  I know ;)  "WELL YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE TOO!!!"  I know sheeze stop wasting bandwidth on obvious shit asshole.  

It's much easier when you're not married though hahaha.  I don't have a wolf pack currently.  I usually pick one up through whoever I'm dating at the time lol.  It's hard to find the time to make friends when I'm working full time, and harder still for many dudes my age who have kids, etc.  I have a couple of dudes I could probably call to hang out but that's as far as that goes.  

Also you should try horseback riding sometime if you get a chance!  It's like hanging out with a big magical dog who likes apples a lot and can run really fast.  Shit is fun.  In fact I highly recommend taking a horseback camping trip at some point in your life.  Go play cowboy.  OH also fuck man shooting at targets from horseback is like the best video game ever, except it's real.  Pew pew pew.  Code?  Cause if so me too haha. I also like fixing rl shit though.  I made the desk I'm writing this on haha.  Nice!  I've yet to play with an arduino myself but have interfaced with them for work projects.  They're pretty amazing little pieces of tech.  

So the desk haha... I needed two desks (for an ex and I) for under 200 dollars.  And i needed them to be enormous because that's how desks should be.  

[So I bought four of these (shorter models) for super cheap](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/commercial-grade-4-tier-shelving-unit/116577?skuId=15685751&amp;mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand_storage_online&amp;product_id=15685751&amp;adtype=pla&amp;product_channel=online&amp;adpos=1o5&amp;creative=224124676749&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=&amp;network=g&amp;mrkgadid=3245555065&amp;mrkgcl=609&amp;rkg_id=h-86e8dc8c28794f9f45dcf5c3cd595b30_t-1525980330&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw28_XBRDhARIsAEk21Fjbzf8lYnAJGXwcZlLvPH8rmS1g73TcYsWW8pI-5FmVj73imTPCmSMaAosPEALw_wcB) I sawed the tops off, got two big pieces of plywood (which we sanded, stained, and waxed), then drilled into the bottom and used some female connector (which was meant for car parts) to attach big bolts in each corner.  I wrapped each bolt in electrical tape to provide friction, and stuck em down into the metal poles for the shelves.  

They actually turned out really great, though i should have measured the heights better.  They're about an inch too high for the chairs.  

But yeah they're huge, have a ton of storage, don't wobble, and you can pack em up in like 3 minutes.  Also so cheap that when I get a new vr rig and want to add a HOTAS setup I don't need to care about drilling into it, or setting it on fire if I want to.  

Also that's awesome re the cars and dirtbikes!  I bet once you learn some robotics you'll be able to make some really cool shit.  Have any projects running atm?  They are great!  They have to be trained specifically for that, but remember they were used in battle for thousands of years.  Probably still are in parts of the world.  Amazing creatures.  Also I read recently that they remember faces and hold grudges for days haha.  Which... doesn't surprise me at all.  You can definitely develop a friendship with a horse.  A horse who likes you will be careful to avoid scraping you on trees, etc, but a horse who doesn't like you will try to do the opposite.  

On a trail ride in Fiji I had a recently gilded stallion try to scrape me off on a moving truck!  He also tried to take me through these massive fucking spider webs hanging between trees, with spiders the size of your head.  Not exaggerating.  I had to limbo in the saddle to avoid them.  I did get him to chill out after a couple of hours.  Bringing apples and carrots is a good idea.  Also side note: riding recently gilded stallions is NOT safe. Do not recommend.  

Anyways yeah I have had a couple of bro-forces from highschool and college, but I moved around a lot afterwards.  It's... probably going to be as you suspect.  But I do meet people and if i put in more effort I could probably embro some.  As you know though it's also hard finding people you really want to talk to.  

&gt; Do you have an easy time getting any kind of close to these different groups of dudes through your SO? Takes me a while to trust guys enough to actually fully drop my guard. I guess I usually get along with a good majority of openly open mind dudes, but that isn't always easy to find.  

Lol well said.. and it depends on a lot of things including type.  If they're N's and not unhealthy?  Immediate friends.  Otherwise it really varies.  Haha maybe there's a thing with ENTPs building desks...  that shit was genuinely fun.  Using a tabletop is a great idea!  Part of why I used plywood was to try sanding and staining something, as I never had.  Now that I have tested and feel comfortable with the process, my next desk will probably use a really nice piece of wood, and some legit closed shelving. I need thta workshop though :(  

I'm so jealous you have the space to work on this stuff.  I live in the heart of Boston and there's just no room for anything.  You can rent time at maker spaces, but I procrastinate even more when I have to travel to work on things.  

Man and that workbench sounds awesome!  Must have felt so good when you got it all put together!  I sometimes wonder if I should have been a carpenter.  The first time I really gave this some thought I went back to school to learn to code haha.  But yeah. Building things mmm.  

Do you have any pictures?  

Also "veggies" haha.  How big are you gonna make that thing?  Yeah I am very similar I think regarding dudes.  Was your dad a narcissistic asshole growing up?  

Either way I think a great many men are the same.  All of the solid broforces I have been in each of us was strong in different ways.  I think that's one reason these is such a trope in literature and movies.  There is perhaps some innate tendency for human males to organize into battle squads.  Hmm well there's one possible similarity.  Both of my parents were unhealthy Ts and I got all of my affection outside of the home.  I had a pack of degenerates I ran with, and girlfriends who taught me how to human haha.  So I dunno.  I have experienced an awful lot of betrayal from fucked dudes over the years so i think that's part of it.  But there are a lot of guys who immediately try to play dominance games, and have some really fucked up ethical codes.  A lot of women do this too but I think they normally keep it between each other.  

Perhaps you and I are simply less in the grip of this particular human primal construct.  

[Check this shit out about chimpanzee war](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150811-do-animals-fight-wars)  

I went to a really interesting lecture on this a few years back.  It was fantastic.  Re veggies are you building the whole thing from scratch?  Or are you gonna buy the pumps/etc?  

Lol yeah or JP maybe.  I know for sure they have maker spaces in Central, and near Porter.  You from here?  

&gt; Learning to make notches when woodworking and assembling with glue instead of fasteners is super rewarding, I am only just getting into this next level woodworking.  

Dammit so jealous!  I've watched videos.  I think there's something really Ti about that but in a sensory way.  Making something so incredibly precise, making a lot of somethings so perfectly precise that they just fit together and work perfectly.  I want to do this with my hands, not just my brain :P   

I do think they have some really good equipment at some of these spaces I mentioned.  Do you think there might be something like that close to you?  I don't know enough about CNCs to know what's good and bad, though I get the concept.  Oh and I just remembered there is a place here which basically only sells the services of a high power laser cutter haha.  Just in case you need to kill james bond or someshit on the weekend.  I love it.  

&gt; I need to go back to the Ni/Ne drawing board  

No you don't.  You can't type people based on barnum statements.  That you refuse to accept that, is a very strong indication that you don't use Ti.  

I see you getting into disagreements with other Ti users and while what they're saying makes perfect sense to me, I read from you a loosely woven fabric of subjectivity, and appeals to the group to validate your thinking.  

Ti doesn't go running to a group of people who are uncertain to apply sufficiently rigorous logic in solving a problem.  It tries to gather actual data, at as low a level as possible, in order to construct as airtight an argument as possible.  This has its own problems, but again here you are asking other people to tell you "who you are" by presenting them with your own purely subjective data points.  

I often don't respond to you after a few rounds on this topic because it doesn't seem to make much of a difference, but I think the way you're approaching this sows confusion in others.  Here's an example of your seeming thought process from earlier, which is not at all Ti:  

&gt; But anyways, lets say you're right, what other Fi users are there?

&gt; ISFP - Not possible, ISFPs don't have big egos.  
&gt; INFP - Not possible, INFPs don't have big egos...


The system says nothing about whether or not ISFPs/INFPs have big egos.  Those statements are objectively useless, and Ti would immediately reject them.  For that matter I have known people of both types with massive egos... but that's completely irrelevant because it requires that you trust my ability to type people (which you clearly don't), requires that I trust my own ability to definitively type people (which no one should), requires that I also accurately gauge the "size of their egos" which is unquantifiable, and so on.  &lt;--- That is how a Ti user determines the veracity of an idea/statement, and you don't use it.  

I could see TeFi, and perhaps N.  Why?  Because Te looks for what is logically plausible to the group on average, which is exactly what you're doing here.  Since you're dealing with a "people problem" you're employing your F function.  Since you're using your own subjective perspective and experience, you're using Fi, then constructing a "good enough" argument and presenting it to others for validation.    

One final point of evidence that you aren't using Ti is how you reversed the meaning of Fi and Fe here:  

&gt; But you don’t control your Fe right? I mean I don’t, whenever I find something funny, I laugh/smile but when it comes to greeting someone, I don’t see any reason to. That’s how Fe works does it not? A Fi user in this case would do it regardless.  

Getting those mixed up wasn't even worth acknowledging when I pointed it out.  Being as accurate as possible with every piece of your argument is what Ti is obsessed with, and you just don't seem to care.  Further you don't seem to care that this might be a strong indication that you're wrong about your type, because you're far more focused (again) on group consensus to support your conclusions.  

I imagine that this is again lost on you, but hopefully it helps someone else.  Who told you you have too big of an ego for being an ENTP?  It's not even relevant.  

&gt; resonates with me really accurately and confirms I can't be an ENFP. 

God this is such an Fi statement.  It burns.  That statement could be applied to almost every single human on the planet.  It's a useless subjective "factoid".  It isn't a question of true/false.  What you said isn't falsifiable objectively.  However that you are using a **subjective** statement to determine true/false is precisely what Fi is all about.  

"Resonates with me" is meaningless outside of the context of your experience.  That is a fact.  A Ti derived fact.  

Also I should mention that I'm pretty familiar with enneagram.  Let's not muddle systems.  Like I said: let's not muddle systems.  They're two separate models, with different base assumptions, which have overlapping areas of personality they attempt to describe.  Logically they are incompatible as proofs because they do math using different systems.  Ti says "no".  

&gt; None of the type me posts can ever be objectively true because they rely on subjective experience which there is no way to objectively judge to be true.  

That's why we got rid of them in /r/entp.    

&gt; Yes, but that is how people type right?  

No you do it by applying the functions to your own, or the thought processes of others.  Try [this guy on for size](https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveSuperPowers/videos).  It's his own system, derived from functions, but the "math" checks out.  Pff ego runs on ME.  I run on a purely objectively derived knowledge of how awesomely superior I am.  Bwahaha I have an 8 wing.  Again it's irrelevant, but Fi is pulling Te for support in the form of bringing enneagram into this discussion.  You have decided on what the "truth is" here, and your Te is backing it up with whatever it can find.  You have seemingly decided that **you** being right is more important than whether or not you actually **are** right.  That's what I'm talking about.  Right?  FiTe all day longFucking lol.  One of my favorite things about Fi &lt;3Yeah haha.  /r/entp is sometimes at least half ExFPs.  I imagine you lot get your share of IxFPs.  I don't think it's particularly NTP to look for dank memes, which are basically just a tiny little bite of N.  They're more likely to be falling down a wiki-hole, or arguing about something hardly anyone cares for.  

But yeah NTPs are extremely similar, though the differences can be pretty stark when you get them together.  That Fe being lower in the stack, and the Si higher makes for more than differences in shyness haha.  I find myself much more drawn to think in terms of meaning/ethics and symbolism than the INTPs I know (TiFe vs SiFe last), which is something they tend to struggle with, and even be somewhat obsessed by.  They know that Fe is there, it just always seems a little out of reach.  I also find that I tend to have a greater range of interests, while they tend to be extremely knowledgeable in fewer subjects (NeTi vs TiNe).  Anyways I love INTPs.  They're some of the very few types of people I never get sick of.    
Is it an ENTP thing or just my Fe being an asshole?Or completely unrelated to any of that?I was thinking that. He seems NP for sure.My girlfriend's mom is too good at trivia. She's an ESFP.Fe-Si is a motherfucker, dude.To me
Elliot - INTP
Darlene - ESxP
Mr. Robot - ENTP
Tyrell - ENTJI would almost agree. But then I don't at the same time. I have days where, yes I do come off as the stereotypical ENTP. All of my functions just kinda do the shit they're supposed to. Other days one function is like, "This is my day motherfucker." and it's weird. I have Fe heavy days where I'll tear up watching that video of that little girl giving her food to that homeless guy. Other days it's all Ti and I'm cold and detached. Si gets me sad because I just think back to shitty parts of my past. So I don't like that too much. Then, Ne is kinda just every other day.There's no joke. I was high when I made t.Yeah, I get that. I used to really get ntp vibes from him. I thought he was an ENTP for a long time.Especially that Song/Video.Me: ENTP
Girlfriend: ISFP
Best Friend(s) - ESTJ(m), ESTP (m) INTJ(m)
Other frineds - ENTP(m), INFP(f) INTP(m)


Family - Mom ESTJ, Stepdad INFP, Step Brother ESFP, Step Sister #1 ENFP, Step Sister #2 ESFJ, Grandmother ISFJ, Grandfather ISTP.Same.I can see that.50/50

I'm curious. But I also want to get more comfortable with sharing my ideas.Sometimes I think I'm an INFJ as well. EhI've seen him typed as entj also. "Bruh" definetley shows his lyrical ability very well. "Molly" is another good one: He actually talks about his emotions and shit. His freestyles are pretty good. "Too High" is funny, "White Dude" is one of his bestExactly, I also think he's either 4w3 or 3w4Mein Kampf by: David Lerner

all i want to do is
make poetry famous

ali i want to do is
burn my initials into the sun

all i want do do is
read poetry from the middle of a
burning building
standing in the fast lane of the
freeway
falling from the top of the
Empire State Building

the literary world
sucks dead dog dick

I’d rather be Richard Speck
than Gary Snyder
I’d rather ride a rocketship to hell
than a Volvo to Bolinas

I’d rather
sell arms to the Martians
than wait sullenly for a
letter from some diseased clown with a
three-piece mind
telling me that I’ve won a
bullet-proof pair of rose-colored glasses
for my poem “Autumn in the Spring”

I want to be
hated
by everyone who teaches for a living

I want people to hear my poetry and
get headaches
I want people to hear my poetry and
vomit

I want people to hear my poetry and
weep, scream, disappear, start bleeding,
eat their television sets, beat each other to death with
swords and

go out and get riotously drunk on
someone else’s money

this ain’t no party
this ain’t no disco
this ain’t no foolin’ a

grab-bag of
clever wordplay and sensitive thoughts and
gracious theories about

how many ambiguities can dance on the head of a
machine gun

this ain’t no
genteel evening over
cappuccino and bullshit

this ain’t no life-affirming
our days have meaning
as we watch the flowers breath through our souls and
fall desperately in love

this ain’t no letter-press, hand-me-down
wimpy beatnik festival of bitching about
the broken rainbow

it is a carnival of dread

it is a savage sideshow
about to move to the main arena

it is terror and wild beauty
walking hand in hand down a bombed-out road
as missiles scream, while a
sky the color of arterial blood
blinks on and off
like the lights on Broadway
after the last junkie’s dead of AIDS

I come not to bury poetry
but to blow it up
not to dandle it on my knee
like a retarded child with
beautiful eyes
but

throw it off a cliff into
icy seas and
see if the the motherfucker can
swim for its life

because love is an excellent thing
surely we need it

but, my friends…

there is so much to hate These Days

that hatred is just love with a chip on its shoulder
a chip as big as the Ritz
and heavier than
all the bills I’ll never pay

because they’re after us

they’re selling radioactive charm bracelets
and breakfast cereals that
lower your IQ by 50 points per mouthful
we get politicians who think
starting World War III
would be a good career move
we got beautiful women
with eyes like wet stones
peering out at us from the pages of
glassy magazines
promising that they’ll
fuck us till we shoot blood

if we’ll just buy one of these beautiful switchblade knives

I’ve got mineENTP gets me every time. ENTP in a 3 year relationship with an ISFP. Interesting to see what socionics has to say about it/Really? Like, I know Hunter Thompson was an ENFP. But I always saw Raoul Duke as more of an ENTP.

Unless you're talking about the overall feel of the movieI kinda of fit into all different groups, but me and my INTJ best friend always sat by each other in Psychology and Sociology. Our teacher said we were the "eccentric" crowd.r/intpI fidget 24/7My grandmother told me I was better off when I wanted to be a preacher. I was like, fucking, 4 when I wanted to do that. &gt; a guy's SoundCloud track

Alright. ;)Honestly though, no clue m8. I don't really look at lyrics as evidence of Type. Reasons, for example, Serj Tankian from System of a Down. His lyrics can come off as a very critical ENTP observation of the world, but he's an INFJ. 

I've seen Daron types as extp. Equal arguments for both. But  understand how one could see sfp as well. Post Modernism always appealed to me. But I think I like Meta Modernism a bit more..wEThe TricksterHell yeah :*I always saw him as ENFPisfj my dudeI'm an ENFP and I've always been told I'm very facial expressive. Also did this once and got ISTJ The most annoying people I know are esfjNo.20I can always tell when people have been arguing recently when I enter a room, without having to hear anythingLol, yeah you're right.  I'm not sure why I put that here. Definitely estj. istpRobert California?

I just feel high Ni from himINFP

I love the spring, everything starts blooming and you have a nice mixture of damn and cool days. The occasional hot day. But the RAIN! I'm a slut for some rain, man. Posting here. Didn't get much help from other submissions. Maybe I didn't ask a direct enough question. But anyways. 


The summer between my sophomore and junior year of high school was interesting. 

I mean, this really started in 8th grade. I would write poems and short stories about like...the apocalypse and stuff. Government corruption, lies, propaganda. I had this vision of how the world would be. Visions of what i could make it. I had always had thoughts like this. I would dream about it. I had this plan to bring people together and fight against all of the corruption and oppression in our society. It carried all the way into that summer. 

It was hard. I was writing about it everyday. I would play god games and games like civilization. I always wanted to see how I could bring people together in the games and try to make a "perfect" society.  

There were times when I would listen to "Right in Two" by Tool and it would make me cry. 

I was reading this post on Huey Freeman, talking about his type. Someone was talking about how he's an INFJ. He just has that cold exterior because I may have realized that his vision may never come true. And I read that and all of these memories came back to me. 

Maybe in an infj. Heh, kidding. 

Anyways I just felt like sharing that.

Add: I only added this here because after thinking about it more and I don't know. It's weird. I've entertained the thought before that I might  be. But I usually dicarded the idea. Thoughts?Why do I have a problem with finding the most fucked up people and being attracted to them while at the same time wanting to like...help them or fix them?He took the test and got INFP, but I get a bit of an xstp vibe from him.

"In my humble opinion, there's nothing more empowering than confidence in your ability to confront a violent situation head on. Diehard intellectuals will lead you to believe that violence is never an answer, but quoting Socrates isn't going to get you anywhere when the rubber hits the road. Sometimes violence is the only language that people will understand. And to deny our primal nature is to deny the very essence of what makes us human. This is directly applicable to all walks of life. People in this world are unhappy because they suppress what they are at their very core: predators. We were designed to be hunter-gatherers, self-sufficient killing machines, animals in their most basic state. And now that we're indoctrinated into this society of forced self-loathing and self-hatred, materialism and masturbatory consumerism, what are we supposed to do with ourselves? The answer is simple: master ourselves. Create the greatest version of yourself possible. Accept that you have flaws, but never stop attempting to improve them. Civilize the mind, but make savage the body. Learn your limits. And push them. Fight for yourself. Keep the iron in clenched fists and blood on your knuckles."Anyone ever watched the YouTube channel "This exists"?

What type do you think the host is?I found this on Tumblr. This person says they're an ENTP, they seem like it too.

Is this post a rare emotional outburst? Are they in some sort of Si loop? Or do you think they're another type entirely?

"I’m at that weird point in my life where I’m starting to realize things that happened in my childhood were actually really fucked up. I thought they were completely normal.



Nevertheless. I fucking hate growing up. I hate the looming fear and doubt. No matter how happy I become as an adult I’ll never be the happiest I could have ever truly been. That’s what makes me feel worse. I want o badly to be naturally happy. I listen to these songs on repeat that take me back to a time when I was in a different place. Like, songs that took me back to my Sophomore year in High School. Sure I was in a mentally abusive relationship. But the music was great in 2013-14. But now I listen to it and feel so fucking sad. Just listening to it I can feel my throat swelling up. Everything changed when I turned 18. 

I know it’s a shitty stereotypical thing to say, but I never asked for any of this. I never asked to be given life. No, instead I was thrown into this world without warning. I was given a sub par childhood and even that was taken from me when my dad left. I had to grow up early. Then my stepdad came around when I was 12. Fucked that up even more. He tried to change me. Turn me into something he wanted me to be. Instead I became an anxiety ridden piece of shit.

Now I’m 18 and I’m stuck in this loop. This loop of, “I want better for myself. The only time things are better is the past.” My own parents are fucking me over."Ne is so super obvious for him. I used to think ENTP. Not sure why, maybe just a naive hope that my favorite musician is my type, but after listening to his "Because the Internet" album, I'm almost certain he's an INFP. This is extra apparent in his song "[Life: The Biggest Troll] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqWo4fgbwnM)"
The way his lyrics seem to really just jump from one thing to the next in a let loose Ne fashion along with it all being lead by this Fi inner dialogue about trying to understand how the world around him works, along with these hint of some sort of identity crisis. It all really screams Fi Ne to me. 

"Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of"

It's my favorite song by him, but yeah. I think he's an INFP. Thought?I've seen him typed as an entp, but I think he's enfp. Thoughts?I've made this post a few times, just looking for feedback. Now, before, I used to type him as an INTJ, then later on INTP. Someone once said he was most certainly an ISFP. This person claimed to have personally known Maynard. 

At first I didn't really buy it. It just didn't really seem like a possibility. I mean, the Music and lyrics seem to give off an Intuitive feel.

But, for my birthday, my girlfriend bought me his (Auto) Biography, A Perfect Union of Contrary Things, and a lot of things in the book really make him seem like an ISFP.

Has anyone else read this book or have any feedback at all?

EDIT: Actual comment from /u/jermofo on [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/3tvmv9/maynard_james_keenan/)

*"I'd have to agree with ISFP. I've met him briefly a few times and grew up in the area that he lives and grows wine in. He really has that SP intensity in person and has a reputation around town as a difficult to deal with, egotistical, dickhead. He is a very physical person who was in the military, wrestled, run cross-country, etc. These are individualistic physical activities, which would fit the smart jock persona.
If you listen to the Marc Maron interview he tells the story of taking aptitude tests as a kid and always selected artist and soldier as what he wanted to be when he grew up and that is exactly what he did. This would suggest to me Se-Ni to have a vision of what he wanted to be, especially to realize such contradictory visions in a life time, and Fi-Te to make his inner world concrete and actualized.
The way that he describes how he decided to make wine in Arizona would suggest ISFP to me as well. He looked at the landscape and physical attributes of the area he lived in and intuited that it would be perfect for growing wine. He then made it happen. Again, this would suggest the nature of Fi-Te to me and did it with his own hands by jumping in and just doing it which would suggest Se to me. The way that he describes learning mathematics also reminds me of how I've heard that Ni users need to get the principle behind the process and then it just clicks. This is not to be confused with a Ti user's need to understand how it works, but rather to "get it" by perceiving the information in a way that clicks and can then proceed in a linear fashion.
In what way do you see INTP? I know one could see that, as I immediately and deeply identified with his music, but I think after closer inspection, he is not. I'd recommend listening to the Marc Maron interview listening for the functions. It is a pretty interesting interview anyway."*ISFP

😎😎😎I'm deffo not a sub
I'm pretty sure that's called real life. 

-An ENTPNot for me I'm more anxious than anything else listed and I still have a need for social interaction every so often. In a romcom about an ESFJ girl and an INTP boy who would be the tsundere?I don't know why seeing as that kind of makes sense. I was actually having difficulty telling if I was an ENTP or and INTP. So I asked a friend of mine who is in a psychology doctoral program and we found that I was an ENTP. It's not a scale at all according to my friend, and it depends on certain traits and such. ENTP here, for me its knowledge, I crave it like an addict craves booze. That's how I decided a career in academia was for me. Not really but I don't dislike it either. But I don't really consider that anime. I feel like show and movie preferences are acquired traits and have nothing to do with mbti. I personally like any story that can make me feel song emotion because as an INTP I neglect my emotions a lot and it's good to watch something or listen to something that allows me to get some emotional release. And that cna be excitement, fear, anxiety, curiousity, or even love or preferably some mixture thereof. Most likely!&gt;INTP (or ENTP, still debating which one fits more)

I'm ENTP but am somewhat similar to an INTP in some ways. And, I'd be interested in talking to you more about this if you don't mind. I used to be a libertarian until I majored in economics at the college level and changed to being a progressive. Nope I just wanted to know both which you so graciously provided. Thanks. I understand. There's really nothing simple about it and no ideology has a monopoly on good ideas. Most interesting...Most interesting observation there. I was also a libertarian at your age but time changes us it would appear. I'm so glad you agree!
The big question that I had if you don't mind was do you think the we the rational types value freedom more or do we value correctness more?

I personally think that as an ENTP I value flexibility and don't think there is an absolute right and wrong, ever. Thus I'm still pretty socially libertarian myself. I also think that we have to be atleast somewhat economically progressive because wealth distribution really improves overall quality of life in society according to research and if it isn't done than wealth gets concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer persons leading to societal problems. Democratic socialism, which is technically a form a capitalism allows for private enterprise. The only problem I have with free markets is that all business aren't playing fair since the ones with more money necessarily also have more influence. Thanks for taking the time to write this. I do appreciate it.Now there's something I can get behind. The flair is correct. I was borderline and now confirmed as ENTP. Ending racism and bigotry is something I support fully. Mbti type, please.I get what you mean. You don't have a flair right now. Well she's not the only one who broke that rule but I don't mind since I'm just doing a survey here. Thank you for your input!I was confused for a while until I realized that you would know if your Ti was more dominant than your Ne. You can't change flair on mobile. You'll have to do it next time you're on a PC. ENTP here. I lead with Ne and have auxiliary Ti. I have to be the most indecisive person I know. ENTP is also known as the debater...No problem. Welcome to reddit enjoy your stay...but not too much.I'd have to say it depends, which I realize is a cop out answer. 

I spent much of my summer alone just teaching myself programming and writing some creative stories. But I always go bored quickly and when I made a program or a wrote a story that I liked I'd always show it to my best friend(a very empathetic and outgoing personality though I don't know his type I'd expect it to be the opposite of mine) via skype to see what he thought of it and I always valued that feedback as part of my creative process. 

As for the second one it would largely depend on who the 5-8 people are. If they're all new to me I'd nope on out of there. But if I know them and am comfortable with them, then I'd chill for a bit and see what's up. Especially if the topic is interesting and everyone's pitching in interesting ideas. But if they're talking celebrity gossip, sports or entertainment news then I'd probably find myself getting bored and receding into my own mind.   Well in the moment I'd take every opportunity to pitch in what I could if I get into it. And that's a big if. But later on when I'm alone I might take everything I thought of and that others said and sort of give it some more thought. Or I might not and just forget about it depending on how much I care about the topic outside the environment of the conversation. 

If it helps you help me then I'll add that I often find myself bored in general and constantly seeking some kind of muse and often that can come from the ideas of others. But then what does that say about my recurring need to be social or to share ideas with others? I also feel like I'm sharp at breaking down and conceptualizing human behavior and that means that I can generally manipulate people if I analyze them enough. And can an INTP be as into argument and debate as I am? So if you don't mind me asking what makes you say INTP over ENTP? I mean most of the quizzes I've taken agree but I just want to understand the rationale behind it. I don't mean to bug you with this but my curiosity gets the better of me. 

Also are INTPs more indecisive than ENTPs? Because I always have trouble with second guessing my first choice on everything.I think that I'm blurred between both and therein lies the problem. I'm not physically detail oriented but I'll examine and reexamine an idea for as long as it holds my interest to understand how it works. I do tend to compare new things to things I've learned in the past and I believe that a person can only understand any concept by comparing it to another that they are familiar with, in essence I think that that everything is relative to everything else you already know. 

I can get along with people I already know but if I'm meeting someone new then it works best if it's only one or two new people at a time and either they have something interesting to enthuse about, and even then more likely than not they'll have to approach me or be introduced to me by a friend. So basically there has to be a very good reason for me to actually approach a stranger and talk to them, and it's not for lack of wanting to I assure you. I just tend to get nervous about it and that kind of thing makes me somewhat self conscious. 

&gt; if people are sad, they are sad. If people are happy, they are happy. They are expressive in the way they communicate.

I can feel empathetic to someone else's emotional situation but that's about it. I'm definitely not the person to go to for emotional support.  But to be honest sometimes I forget to even care to take the time to think about how others feel. 
 Everything I do once I realize that someone else is sad or excited or whatever is based on logic and on what I feel like doing so I kind of get how they feel but don't really take it into account in my behavior. But to be honest sometimes I forget to even care to take the time to think about how others feel. Instead I'll often find myself trying to get others to see things my way even when others seem to think that I've gone way past the point of futility. 

 &gt;INTP struggles that ENTP doesn't have: Natural charisma, Getting out of their comfort zone

Yeah I really don't have much natural charisma, and I definitely know where my comfort zone ends and have one eye on that line at all times. 

&gt;ENTP struggles that INTP doesn't have: Takes action/considers ideas too quickly without properly reflecting or learning from the experience, less detail oriented and non-methodical, causing them to make thoughtless mistakes where the INTP would not
I don't jump into things too quickly, in fact I'm always so indecisive. Also if I have to do something or go somewhere I ask everything about so that I can mentally prepare myself of the the change of pace. 

I tend to be detail oriented when it come to ideas and drawing connections between things but I do still definitely miss things. That's why I usually bounce my ideas, even the ones in progress off of someone to see if they see anything glaring that I missed.  In the physical world I miss a lot of things in terms of details but it's a lot less so in the conceptual world. 

So which do you think fits me better? 

So I'm okay with people I know already I have to meet new people slowly and I generally don't like confrontation either but I love me a good challenge and debating solidifies that. Also because I don't care too much about how people judge me I can say my piece without worries about the social repercussions  before they happen. So you peg me for an INTP (Ti + Ne + Si + Fe) then? I guess that sounds right. I must just be a more outspoken INTP. ENTP - C++If I've read this right then I am most definitely an ENTP. 

I'd beat back any attacks on my ideas and if anyone told me i was logically flawed I'd either show them they're wrong or admit it and fix it. 

When I'm consoling friends I always put their situation into perspective and give them at least one course of action they could take. But I definitely feel the logic here. I've only heard good things about it. How would you say it compares to other low level languages?Ne + Ti (They go together):

Everything I do starts with sort of creating a mental map of all of the possibilities of a situation or at least a few of the ones I can come up with quickly. After this point Ne itself has done it's job. That's where Ti comes in.

Once I've got my map of possibilities then I use Ti to sort of decide what to do with it. I use Ti to assess the situation very quickly and not at all thoroughly and then I sort of decide which option is the best. I tend to be very indecisive and because of that I sort of delay these decision as much as I can. And even then I still feel some major cognitive dissonance. Sometimes when I feel indecisive it's as if my Ne and Ti are fighting each other and that Ne spews out more possibilities while Ti is still trying to sort out what's what with the old ones. Eek!

Once a decision is made then it is very possible that Ne can come back and make a few more possibility maps for each of the details of that choice and again Ti has to sort of sort out that mess. So for me they both very powerful and inseparable. That inseparability of my primary and auxiliary function are what made it hard for me to tell if I was an ENTP or an INTP for a long while. 

But in the end I decided I'm on a quest for possibilities backed by truth (Ne + Ti) and not a quest for truth backed by possibility(Ti + Ne).

Fe:

I don't rely too much on feelings but they're there for me only when I want to connect with a person, or idea on a much deeper level than just thought or logic. I definitely do enjoy strong feelings and music, movies, and situations that evoke them but I don't really go around telling people that because I think it'd be socially safer to just let everyone assume that I'm more or less emotionally numb. 

Si:

I don't really know what I think about Si, it's there but it's really not. Like I'll indulge in things that are pleasing to the senses but it's not like that really influences my thinking or self-image in any way. I do tend to binge on anything that makes me feel good a lot and that does need to change for the sake of self control but I'll get to eventually.

Based on this does anyone have any life advice for me?Interesting I'll have to give Rust a look. And your analysis is pretty good MBTI wise. For me with Ne + Ti I just kept trying new languages, because damn that Ne. So anyways any programming language that limited me from controlling everything or precluded any possibilities for a project(like you really wouldn't write a 3D game in PHP) were off the list. I needed something that would let me be able to make anything and have full control down to almost the lowest level. C++ 's philosophy of "trust the programmer" which everyone hates for not making code easy to understand at a glance was exactly what I wanted. Now I'm not bashing it in any way but I'd personally take C++ or the new D language over Python, Ruby, or Java any day for simple reason that I don't like limits, and I don't want to limit my audience to those who have the right runtime or my projects to things that can be accomplished without low level control. 

&gt;I would be curious to hear your thoughts on C++!

So I am not a programmer, just a hobbyist who's come a long way. What I like about C++ is that it gives bare metal control when I want it or more abstract choices if I'd rather prefer to use them. It goes a long way in terms of accommodating programmer preference. So basically you can code in any sort of style you want and that flexibility can be very useful especially in large projects which is what C++ is designed to be used for, it certainly isn't made for writing quick and dirty scripts. Though it certainly won't stop you if you try and isn't really a bad option for that if you need raw performance. In fact CERN even has an REPL for C++ because it's one of their official languages.

From what I'm hearing about Rust and D comparatively C++ has a lot of benefits from being a mature language. It's standard library has gotten much better since C++11 and C++14 and the boost library also exists to provide even more features that the standard library doesn't along with a ton of other libraries for literally everything you can image and a lot things that even your Ne and mine combined couldn't think of.  

The C++ community is generally made up of programmers with a wide variety of experience since once you learn C++ I get the feeling that learning other languages become somewhat easier. I just think that they're a bit nerdier and not as hipsterish like the Python or Java communities and also that there are very few hobbyists or non-programmers who are learning or already know C++ since it's often falsely accused of being too hard to be worth learning. If you know the basics of imperative and object oriented programming then C++ as a language should feel pretty natural. 

I learned Java first but once I made the jump to C++ and learned it's idioms as opposed to Java's I just couldn't ever see a reason to use Java again. In fact a lot of the way Java does syntax idiomatically would work but not be idiomatic or not work the same way in C++.

Honestly I just think that too many people complain about the language when the cause of most problems isn't the language it's the programmer's lack of understanding of the language and this is a language where the programmer does almost everything and there are very few "training wheels". 
So yeah, even though it's been around for a while C++ isn't a bad language once you learn how to think in terms of it. And modern compilers and IDEs give you very actionable error messages so it's easy to fix your code too. 
Python is always a good choice. My favorite is C++ but Python definitely has its place and time. And since I'm studying a mathematically inclined subject knowing Python is extremely useful. Nice! I dabbled in everything and I still found that I like C++ the most!I think part of C++'s brilliance is that it can take object oriented programming which we can more or less say is a huge abstraction and makes all of that work with a low level memory model. Hey I like C++ so I consider you lucky though that may not be the word you might choose from what I hear about *working* in C++. But I like python for its simple syntax though I can't seem to deal with all of the type issue while not being able to explicitly see the types of everything written in the code.Good choice. I like Python I really do but I like C++ much more and as such it's really easy for me to get confused by things I'm used to being able to see explicitly written in my code like types. Still its C-like elegant syntax and many libraries do make it a tool of choice for many a task!Well let's be fair not exactly C level speeds. C and C++ still beat it in most benchmarks. Definitely no at first but they can grow on me. My fam!Most interesting choices and good reasoning to back them up. That's honestly a fair choice! If you want something equally easy to use but better organized and generally fun to use give Python a try. I feel like that is a very INTJ way to think. My mind doesn't like anything to be prematurely precluded. So I hold on the everything and sometimes too many things at once. Evidence of that is that I have dabbled in everything from Python and Javascript to Julia, R, Java, C++, Haskell, Clojure, D, and now Rust. 

C++ is still my favorite but I can't stick to just one language even if I don't know if I'll ever need to use the others. I don't think that C++ is perfect in general, no programming language or any other construct made by imperfect human beings can be, but it's perfect for me, that's really what I meant. 

And there are certain problem domains to which it is really not suited like making simple web applications. I do like C++ programs for task automation despite the fact that scripting languages are usually preferred for that kind of thing. For example if you need to constantly copy a file or parse one then it's easy enough to write a C++ program that can do that while including the file name as a command line argument to the program. Nice. I'm not a CS major and even the minor didn't fit my schedule. So I'm self teaching but by no means am I having any difficulty with it and C++ is my language of choice! I'm also looking into Rust and D since they both look cool and new. That's certainly interesting and I feel like if you like that sort of thing then you might like Lisp with its whole code as data mentality. &gt; You're an INTP, you should know that.

I love the type collectivism. ROFL.Don't worry about it bro, I was just messing with you to see what you'd say. Even though at this point I've decided I'm more of an ENTP, I'd still say that I have a very strong auxiliary Ti so I know what that feels like. And I kind of think that of the questions too since it sometimes makes you choose between things that aren't really opposites and could both independently be true. If there's one thing I don't like it's inconsistent logic because that's just more work for me to think about and I like to just let my mind wander than attempt to correct someone else's logic. Well if you think about it they're all weird languages. The only lisp I ever played with was Clojure and that was honestly so easy from the programmer's point of view. 

I'd personally try out Rust or Haskell instead. I'm liking the low level languages! Any reason why you'd say C over C++ or D?Don't count D out just yet. Sure if you want to use the standard library you have to use the Garbage collector but the GC in D is so much better than any other and it's designed to be part of a systems programming language. You can call GC.disable() if you have a piece of code where you absolutely cannot have the GC collect then GC.enable() after the critical code to start GC back up and you can manually allocate and deallocate memory at any time even when the GC is enabled. Also even with the GC algorithm linked into the final executable, D's executables tend to be a fair amount smaller than the same exact program written in idiomatic C++ though nowhere close to as small as if it was written in C or C-like C++.  And on top of that the language designers are planning to make future versions of the standard library usable without GC at all though these days a good GC algorithm can do a better job than manual management in many cases, or so I've read. I literally only started reading the documentation for it yesterday. It has an awesome set of key principles that it's design is based around and it has that sort of functional/pattern based syntax along with type inference which is new and interesting in the world of low level languages. So far I think I like it. It feels like it has the best parts of C, C++, Haskell, and Scala in terms of syntax along with that sweet, sweet native performance to brag about!I'm excited to start learning it but I've started thinking that Rust is so immature so far and it doesn't have the insane library support for literally any given task that I'm used to in C++. But then again, I've never seen any language save maybe Python or C that does. 

Also what IDE do you recommend for use with Rust? Code:Blocks has both C++ and D right out of the box but I wonder if I can get a Rust plugin. As of right now I'm using the Rust plugin for Atom. I've heard about Vim but I didn't want to have to waste time learning how to use the editor when I could be learning more about programming languages or techniques. But perhaps it does warrant another look. 

But I don't use Eclipse or VS. I use Code::Blocks. Well I was thinking of learning to compile from the command line anyway so I think I might just get a good editor and skip the IDE altogether but I'll keep it installed just in case. I've come across that thread and I found his comments informative but not really helpful in choosing which to add to my arsenal. C++ itself isn't unsafe in any way, rather it allows code to be written that is unsafe. That is a distinction that needs to be made, and that was not due to an oversight in language development, it was done on purpose.

As I said before C++ is built around the principle of trust the programmer to know what he's doing. And that holds true even if you do something that is unsafe. In that case C++ and it's compliant toolchains just assume that whatever "unsafe" thing you coded, you intended to make it as such on purpose, whereas I feel like Rust wouldn't allow you to do such things even if you wanted to for whatever reason. The bottomline is that if you want to code in C++, you have to know the parts of C++ you plan to use well, if you don't then the very parts of the language designed to give you detailed control over your program could well cause your program to malfunction or cause some type of security liability. So if Firefox had security issues it's not because the languages it was coded in, C++, has any security issues it's because the people who coded it didn't make sure to code it in such a way as to bulletproof their software against security issues. 

But I think the point remains that in Rust the language designers must have bulletproofed the language itself against safety issues so that the programmers who use it don't have to worry about doing so specifically for each of their programs. I think that different programming languages have different design goals and that both C++ and Rust have each met their own which are different from those of the other language. In my personal opinion if used correctly C++ 14 is a very elegant language that can create very, performant, efficient, and if written correctly even very secure software. I mean if the language itself had safety issues then military missile guidance systems probably wouldn't be written in it. But then again for the longest while the military and DoD only allowed Ada as their official programming language because of it's emphasis on safety. C, C++ and Java weren't used in the military for quite a while. But I do digress. 

So what do you think of that analysis? I apologize if it feels like I deflected the question. ENTP here, I'd never be that shallow. And believe it or not, even though we suppress out tertiary Fe, we still do understand your feelings and frustration on some level. You and me both. I'm definitely not as shallow as that. No ENTP that I know myself included would care for online dating. The way I see it I'd be going out of my way to do something that really won't pay off for me. After all we care most about knowledge and logic just like you guys do; we just think about it all differently. "He" isn't a realistic representation of an ENTP. And the way I see it I wouldn't go out of my way to bother with online dating. I don't need to date that badly or at all. It's not something I'd actively seek out but I don't preclude many possibilities either. TL;DR: Douchy ENTP tries to get girl by stereotyping her using MBTI. 

Sincerely,

A real ENTPAgreed. If there's anything I hate its pretentious people and that has nothing to do with MBTI, I've just had to deal with too many of them already. ?It's not about avoiding it but it's about not actively seeking it either. You have to understand that there is a great degree of variation within a given type. You have to account for not only nature but nurture as well. I already figured it out. I'm ENTP because my Ne is stronger than my Ti. And I don't completely agree with that. ENTPs are very in their own heads and we don't tend to live in the present or in reality even because we see the world from the perspective of what could be, not what is. Even though we can be very social when we want to be we can also be very focused and logical too. I feel pretty introverted in general so a better question to ask me is when do I feel like the extrovert that I am? For me and other ENTPs I think that we are every bit as stuck in our own heads as INTPs because our leading Extroverted Intuition function gives us a vibrant imagination which lets us reason about all of the possibilities and futures of any given idea. And we show our extroversion by enthusing about these ideas with our friends. I still don't like large crowds or too many strangers though. I am generally a somewhat nervous person unless I'm really in the zone with something like public speaking.  That's exactly true. When I'm in class at college everybody thinks I have no social life. But once they become my friend and come over to my place they realize that I can be very social when I feel comfortable enough. I can second all of this. And tbh in the colloquial sense, I am an introvert. Actually that's exactly true I was so nervous going into my internship that I almost never spoke but with my friends I can yammer on for hours. I also think it has to do with how much we feel we trust our audience. I mean in a way that the term would be used by people unfamiliar with the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator. It only sucks if you think of it that way. The way I see it that means that we'll only put in the energy to make dating work if we think that she's worth that effort. Which means we'll only date people who are worth it and not just some person who catches our eye. Actually when we're focused we tend to be every bit as analytical as you guys but we tend to take a more top down, deductive reasoning approach where we start by thinking of possibilities and then narrow them down using logic whereas you guys are more likely to analyze a given fact or scenario and then come up with a few possibilities of what comes next. 

The best way I've heard it told is that ENTPs are on a quest for possibility back by truth, whereas INTPs are on a quest for truth discovered through possibilities.In terms of MBTI extrovert and Introvert is just based on what your leading Jung function is. For example ENTP and INTJ have similar functions just the extroverted and introverted are changed for each. ENTP is Ne + Ti + Fe + Si while INTJ is Ni + Te + Fi + Se. Yet we aren't the same just more extraverted we think entirely differently than them. We are actually a lot more like you guys than them so that just goes to show that introverted and extraverted isn't something you can look at by itself. And trust me I act pretty damn introverted in the traditional sense of the word and mistyped as an INTP for the longest time until I read about Jung functions. ENTP will always have to share their ideas and the ideas are always way out there...Yeah but that's not just psychological, it's personal. Because I have a reason for it and before that I wasn't like that. I don't, I suppose. But my type is ENTP and I think that people always assumed that I just argued a lot for the hell of it but the thing is we tend to have an overactive imagination and we value possibilities over all else. I think that morality is sometimes constraining and that ethics should be objective and consequential in nature and I actually really enjoyed my ethics class in college. So basically I want people to know that you can be moral and still have a lot of possibilities for interesting things in your life. 

I don't know if that makes sense, if it doesn't then oh well it makes sense to me. What? That's Fe? I always thought that was my Ti balancing out my overactive Ne. Well how do you think my primary Ne plays into this. As an ENTP the first things that I think of when I think of anything is all of the possibilities which lead to a sort of logical conclusion if you will. Sort of like everything I think about is a cause I automatically come up with all of the possible effects. That is how I make choices. And actually that mode of thinking makes me a natural at my college major, economics, the study of human decision making. I feel for some reason that I wouldn't get along with ESTPs or any xSxx. For me intuition is so important that I can't value people who aren't attuned to it. I don't think you understand ENTPs despite claiming to be one. We are the most introverted E type. And we notoriously mistype as INTP or INTJ. We spend a lot of time in our heads and the only extroverted things that we do is share our crazy ideas and debate. He is definietly Ne dominant because he sees the possibilities of a situation and then rationalizes them out, that is exactly how I think. And his Ti is clear to see especially when he's in the psychologist's office.  &gt; I understand that Ne can appear very introverted, but it only feeds on the external world. Without new ideas, the Ne dominant type feels stifled and becomes depressed, as if they are trapped in a metaphorical cage.

Not true, Ne can create its own possibilities so much so that many ENTPs can get lost in their own imagination. And based on the fact that you're asking for so much information and putting this all together so logically instead of trying to find a logical conclusion I'd peg you for an INTP or and ENTJ. 

I think that Elliot just experiences a common problem that we ENTPs have which is falling into an Ne + Fe loop where due to stress we suppress Ti instead of Fe and that causes us to see only the worst possibilities. Whereas Ne + Ti normally causes us to see many possibilities about a given fact and then deduce which one is the most logical conclusion for it.  &gt; and are only aimed at making impressions on others (Fe).

You don't understand actually since that is not what Fe is. Fe has to do with morality and ethics not with making impressions on others. 

And seeing the worst possible future is exactly what Ne + Fe loops get you. I've been there. Actually I didn't pick a type at all. This is the only one that fits. I have very often been mistyped as an INTP but I doubt that I am one. I think in terms of possibilities to much for me to lead with Ti. So that's it, I'm definitely an ENTP. You are the one I'm not so sure about. I didn't redefine functions at all I read about them thoroughly and came to my conclusion. 

&gt;It sounds like you picked a type that has cool people and then picked function descriptions and defined functional dynamics in terms of what made it fit you the best. 

If I wanted to "pick a type that has cool people" I'd have faked being an ESFJ like my father actually is. The air of authority that comes with that would have been vastly better than being stuck as a shitty ENTP with great ideas but no execution. Hell I'd even take being an INTP and having much less social need and greater logical prowess over this, given the choice. So don't presume to know me. 

&gt;It's cool. If I weren't, I'd want to be an ENTP too.

I am an ENTP. Don't presume to know others you haven't even met. It's shitheads like you that make ENTPs look like arrogant bastards and seem like we all go overboard with MBTI. 

I have nothing more to say to you since when someone disagrees with you your first instinct is to slander them and call them a liar. And ENTPs can be like that too. The only times we come out is when we want to argue with you or when need to defend our viewpoint. We are the most introverted E type. I don't know what your point to prove is but I stand by statement when I said I'm done talking to you. &gt;With me, there's never any "point to prove", there's only a perspective to expose.

Pretentious much, darling?

&gt; That perspective being that you aren't any better than I am.

Loving the backpedaling.

&gt; You slandered me and called me a liar, at least I'm not a hypocrite.

Turning it into he said, she said gets me going. 

&gt;But it's okay that you don't want to talk to me, quitter ;)

And then doing it all again. 

And if you're a model ENTP, maybe I ought to retest to find out if I'm not one. I honestly don't think he fits one type well because his character is based more an archetype than an actual psychology and that archetype has facts of many mbti types and even some traits that I wouldn't consider human. I don't identify with him at all and I disagree with a lot of his views on life and his actions. I just figured he could be ENTP. I don't really see him as being on types seeing as he is a fictional character, not a real person. Just because he thinks like I do in some ways doesn't mean he is the same type as me necessarily.  And this is literally where you're being too inflexible about it. What you think is also defined by your previous knowledge.  The question was about how it would make you feel, not how you would respond. Would you care to elaborate? Or are you going to leave me hanging? I don't know that there's any person for whom an attack on their character wouldn't evoke emotion. To what degree you express it is another thing but to not have it is not human. That's interestingly cold and logical but you know what I can respect that. But isn't that a bit arrogant? You told me in the other thread that you think in terms of perspectives, while I think in terms of future possibilities which I then narrow down into logical conclusions. That was a most interesting read, for me its less that I don't have my biases and more that I have them but I get around that by realizing they're there. I have to see every idea to its logical or sometimes illogical but interesting and somehow feasable conclusion by generating one or more then logically analyzing it's feasibility and desirability and then moving forward like that. Because of this I often get lost in these kinds of extrapolations, if you will. And I love to share these crazy ideas with people who I hope will enjoy them or give feedback on them, perhaps opening up another view that I hadn't seen. 

So does that seem like normal ENTP behavior or would you say that's more like something else?I was thinking I could be an INTJ since I usually only come up with one extrapolation of a given idea and push it forward rather than come up with several and that sounds like Ni and as you said auxiliary Te. I don't think I really know.But that sounds like work. I'll get to it eventually. Too limited in scope. Whatever, we'll just call it "minimalist".The possibilities are endless! (Only ENTPs know what I really mean by this)A lizard? Come on is that the best your Ne can do? For all we know he could be a purely metaphysical being with no need for the restrictions of a corporeal form. 

Although my Ti says that the only beings I know that can speak with grammar this complex are humans therefore it stands to reason that he is more than likely human. But I won't preclude anything. Im not a fan of lizards. And anime girls don't seek out that kind of thing usually it just happens without their consent. And if you're into that kind of thing, I know a guy who could, uh, hook you up...

Works cited: googleWell I'm actually kind of glad that I don't know that much about hentai. Perhaps.&gt;You are comparing to the information set of a normal lizard, when we know that would not be the case here.

Well you have to start somewhere and using deductive logic seemed appropriate to me as a beginning point. I think the way we ENTPs use Ti is to untangle the logical inconsistencies created by the constant waterfall of possibilities coming from Ne. This results in a sort of "map" or flowchart, if you will of all of the possibilities, their likelyhoods of happening(as we gauge them, not always correct), and what fits together with what. Think of it as being able to more or less imagine the future with a sort of chaotic clairvoyance. That is what my mind feels like, and by conventional standards, I am definitely an introvert, though when I do socialize even a little it makes me feel refreshed. 

 That said, pardon my digression, your theory does sound logical and plausible but it doesn't sound likely, purely from a probability standpoint, given the information about the world that we have. As you said, this is all under the assumption that there was a lizard involved and that is a big if at this point, with nothing in the way of hard data telling me that that possibility is more likely than any of the other infinite possibilities for what that poster is. Well I'm not arguing against that. I'm questioning the "if there is a lizard" itself. What makes you think there even is a lizard?Well they could be a normal lizard that extremely coincidentally types out just the right letters to make what we perceive as text. &gt;larger stretches would not be possible. 

Wrong. They wouldn't be likely but then again we've left the realm of reality a long time ago with this conversation. How do you know it didn't push the keys with its tail?How well do idealists or you specifically get along with the rationalist types? Or more specifically ENTPs and our dominant Ne? I have a friend who is a ENFP 21/F who I'm really close with but we have a very strange and unique friendship. I'll come up with insane and amazing ideas and she will then sort of be a bit of a skeptic and tell me why an idea is either implausible or undesirable or otherwise if it's good. It's like I produce and she refines. But then we both also do stupid things as do many people our age but the best part is that we have both saved each other from themselves while not judging each other's life choices. I see her as a bastion of support but not necessarily in a warm and fuzzy way, but in a very tough love kind of way many times, kind of like a drill sergeant who just wants to keep his guys alive. On the other hand she sees me as someone to confide emotional problems in and for whatever reason to seek romantic advice from("You're a straight guys so you must know what all of them think like" eeek) but I'm an ENTP and therefore being social is more of a logical or mechanical thing than an emotional thing so I tend to not be able to help that way. 

The point of me telling you all of this is because I want to know how I can be useful to this person who has an idealist type while I'm a hardcore rationalist ENTP who is more of an introvert in the conventional meaning of the word. I'm hoping that as another idealist type and a girl of similar age you could help me figure all this out. What do you guys seek out of a good friend? And how can I be useful for that?Hey, I don't judge you. Honestly my view in life is to live and let live and not to preclude possibilities for others.First of all, thank you so much for helping me with this, I really appreciate it! 

&gt;We feed off of emotional vulnerability (share a worry, ask advice), so showing a bit that will flag you as someone to pay attention to or someone worth listening to.

I completely understand what you mean because I originally became close with this girl because we were both put into some tough social situations together and she was able to be someone I could share my insecurities with without a fear of being judged. And don't tell anyone our big secret but every ENTP's biggest fear is being judged(we suppress tertiary Fe). Having someone I could think about my deepest issues with without that fear in the way was a huge help. 

But what I wanted to tell you was that I feel like I'm the only one who has benefited from this friendship, and not her as much. It'll sound almost childish but I want her to value me as much as I do her. So what I'm asking is what can I do to help meet her mental needs? 

&gt;My advice to you would be to maintain that common intuitive ground. You already, naturally have what it takes to compliment us- don't over analyze it.

I don't quite understand, what do you mean by this? Also analyzing things is kind of what ENTP and INTP do. If I stop analyzing it, I'll just feel like I'm avoiding my problems and it'll bug me until I see it through to some kind of a logical conclusion. 

If it's not too much trouble to ask, could you please elaborate on all of this please?

I just quick wanted to remind you that my friend is and ENFP not an ENFJ so I figure there would be some differences there but so far everything you've said sounds pretty spot on.

&gt;Also, avoid compliments on looks, unless you want her to fall in love with you lol ...

She's in a relationship, but one that both she and I agree isn't a healthy one but she's chosen to stay with the guy(whom I introduced her to almost coincidentally) despite realizing that he has been taking advantage of her in pretty much every way you can imagine(sexually, financially, socially, and more). I also have a personal beef with her boyfriend but we've agreed to keep her out of it and I've even told her that if she gets dragged into it I'd advise her to take his side despite knowing her MUCH longer than him because it would lead to better outcomes for her(I know this via my dominant Ne). So yeah things are complicated AF in that arena and I'd rather not stir up more trouble and I don't think I'm even close to being in her league. 

&gt;In order to meet an ENFJ's mental needs, you'll have to give her what she lives for, which is to assist you in some way.

I've already done this but to me it just feels like I'm benefiting from her help. Are you sure that this is what the idealist types want/need? 

Also again thanks for helping me with this, it really does clear up a lot of things. 
&gt;As for her, ENFP types have a hard time leaving relationships because she believes she can make it better. She hates conflict, so she may tend to avoid it. She might think she can inspire him to treat her better and so on. Little does she know, that's not how it works...

Did you read my mind or something? Because that's exactly how I see this whole thing. 

&gt;If I were in that situation, I would want my rationalist friend to help me see the more rational outcome. 

If only she were so pragmatic. And I don't want to be assertive when that could cause her to hate me. It's hard enough to have a feud with her boyfriend(whom I'm pretty sure is an INTJ but I'm not certain. In any case he's a manipulative bastard and I say that as an ENTP). I have history with him since before she met him so that all has nothing to do with her; also I've known both of them since long before they met each other.

&gt;The best way, as to reduce the obvious conflict, I'd start asking her questions that'll help her realize that not everything is peachy keen and time is of the essence. 

She knows there's a problem but like you said she thinks she can make him better, or fix him and I see that as not being possible. And as for making her feel like time is of the essence, well I don't want to send the wrong message and because of that, I can't get myself to be assertive about it. ENTPs like me can talk a big game all of the time except for when we have skin in the game, that's when our minds start showing us all of the adverse outcomes. 

&gt;She will appreciate the fact that you're considering her situation- not for your own pleasure but for the sake of her well-being. You saying, "take his side" could sound like indifference to her. 

That's a good point, but I made absolutely sure that she knew that I wanted her to take her bf's side because it would hurt her less in the long run and if things got bad that she could still be close with him after all's said and done. 

I realize that you're not an ethicist and that you're only 2 years older than me but you seem like a responsible person so in my situation what would you do? 

&gt;Sit her down and explain your beef, and be as logical about it as possible. 

It's very complicated but she knows that gist of it. I try not to talk about these sort of things as they can ruin my company's mood in a social setting but it has slipped out in front her before plenty of times. Though if she asks about it which she does on occasion, then I try to avoid the question as much as possible because as I said before, I don't want her under any circumstances to take my side if by some ungodly terrible stroke of misfortune, she does get herself involved in it. She seems to think that she can fix all of this between me and her bf but she can't and the only thing he and I agree on is that neither of us want her getting caught up in it. 

This is all somewhat funny to me though because usually people think of girls as causing social drama, but guy drama is also a thing. Thanks, I really appreciate it. I'm really glad that I could vent all of this to someone and you ended up being the right person by some chance. I would be glad to, I really like your advice.I think I'm not a lizard therefore I'm not. 

-DecarteI couldn't have put it any better than this myself. Trust me you don't. Emotions cause us great pain because we feel them(or lack of them) but we cannot reason about them because at the heart of it emotions aren't logical, they're something that just is. And it gets more than frustrating to keep up with figuring out why people do or don't like you. 

ENTPs like me are particularly known for not being able to judge social distances. Our shuffled function brethren, INTPs, tend to become frustrated when others either don't understand or don't care about what they're enthusing about. INTJs come off as arrogant even if they don't necessarily mean to and they're notoriously sucky at romance. ENTJs, I'll be honest and say I don't know much about, but I can't image they'd be much different. 

&gt;I have this problem of caring about what other people think of me....like....grr...why must I be sensitive? Why must I care about what other people think?

We care about what people think of us too, we just deal with it differently. For me, this means that my Ne will show me that bad things that could happen if I don't keep up good appearances. And it can make me socially paranoid and scared of social situations despite the fact that I do need them as an "E" type. 

*If you want to know anything more about rationalists just ask...*&gt; Seriously though, I think in place of any emotions I'm supposed to be feeling at any time I just get anxiety instead.

I can kind of understand that. For me contentment comes sporadically and never stays long. Many times I just get really paranoid and think that all of my friends secretly hate me. So I know as well as anyone that being a rationalist is a daily struggle. &gt;Constant anxiety about what I should be doing and "what do I do next." I can't ever just stop and enjoy where I am or what I have.

INTPs worry about not having logical consistency and they are on a quest for truth and put everything into a framework. INTJs like yourself have a need to take everything to it's logical conclusion(Ni + Te). 

While for us ENTPs we live in a world that is in constant flux. We see the potential and the possibilities in everything that we take the time to think about. We have very rapid and vivid imaginations and then we take what we come up with and put that into a logical flowchart or map of possibilities(it's almost like seeing the future, but with much more fallibility). That is we live in a world of hypotheticals.  And when we feel good the possibilities we see are desirable ones. When we feel bad, damn, it feels like we're predicting Armageddon sometimes. 

Nothing truly feels fixed or truly real to us since we don't preclude even the most out there possibilities until we have to logically. So naturally we are your opposite. You guys(INTJ) start with a set of facts and reach a logical conclusion, we start with a basic idea(kind of like your conclusion) and generate an unending set of possibilities.  Depends on what you mean by "that". But most of what I said was Ne or Ti. Step 1: Be attractive

Step 2: Don't not be attractive 

That's very true. I was just joking in any case. T'was but a joke. Thanks. But trust me I'm not in the running for best looking man by a long shot so the joke's on me as much as anyone. Not really, I was just too lazy to make a better joke. An ENTP has to be interested in the subject matter to call you out on it. In most cases it's easier for me to be apathetic than vocal about such things unless debating them helps me in attaining some end that I want. Alse we are Ne dominant which makes us very open to what might be seen as unrealistic ideas. So I'd agree that ISTP would be much better suited to that than us. 

The thing about ENTPs is that despite being an "E" type we still live largely in our own heads and in our own imaginations. We are by far the most introverted "E" type and will not give you the time of day unless we think you're worth it. And the only reason we'll debate you is to get you to concede to our outlandish ideas. 

Sincerely

An ENTPThat's a good call right there but be wary, you just called an INTP out on his logic. I'd say Ti is better but Ti dominants(INTP) won't care enough to call you out on it. One man's bullshit is another man intellectual treasure, I say. I will not preclude any idea no matter how insane or outlandish.My point exactly. Intellectual end was what I meant. We tend to use other people to sound out our ideas. We aren't actually trying to change your mind, we just want to see how you react to our ideas when we bounce them off you because it helps us refine them. Possibilities, my worst nightmare is knowing everything because there are no more possibilities for what I can learn. Whereas I'm sure an INTP, Ti dominant, would love to know everything but to me as an Ne dominant it would just feel so finite and limiting. Ne thrives when it's allowed to generate possibilities with no limits.  I've felt that way in the past but we as ENTP types do best when we feel that nothing is set in stone and that there are no limits to what we can do. That's when we can let our Extroverted iNtuition run free and really show our creative-logical genius (if we happen to have any). I agree but we can each set our own purpose in life and it can change as we grow as human beings. And I love my Ne, so what are you trying to sayI'd rather be absorbed in the infinite possibilities than be burdened with knowing everything. I will definitely second that ENTPs are intorverted extraverts. I need social interaction more than some of my "I" friends do but they tend to be less reserved about it than I am so ENTPs can be very reserved at times. We really only debate or pursue topics in which we see some kind of potential and therefore have an interest in. 

But yeah Ne-Ti-Fe-Si look very different in practice than Ti-Ne-Si-Fe.I think that statistically borderline people are much more likely to be ENTPs as INTPs are generally very certain that they're introverts. Whereas ENTPs are just very reserved ambiverts. That remains to be proven, actually. There's no historical proof of any religious figure. Why do you think these religious nuts need so much 'faith'?Dominion. 

I'm ready to take the lead, not because I'm the most popular choice but because I will be logical where others will choose to be traditional or otherwise rely too much on their feelings. That said I can also be empathetic and understand others' pain. That can make me a wise and compassionate leader who understands and shares in his people's struggles on that path(s) to greatness. There's no goal in particular that I have but I'm sure that if my people and I get going, we're bound to end up somewhere!ENTP - Simula/C++/Rust

INTP - Haskell/Idris

INTJ - Julia

ENTJ - Ada/C (sorry!)

INFP - Racket/Clojure

ENFP - Java/Kotlin I like it. ENTP is Rust or C++ which means we're hard to figure out and constantly adding new features (ideas) but at the end of the day we are the fastest and most efficient and we're write once compile anywhere(we can adjust ourselves to fit in most social environments, not that it's comfortable per se but it's doable). Just like C++ code written for Linux can run on Windows but not without a little to a lot of adjustment. Complicated and not efficient? Sounds like my father, an ESFJ, to me. That's not a programming language. Also there are a multitude of assembly languages. It's all good, I was just messing with you anyway :)

And my friends would say I'm a hermit so I'm in no position to judge. No one's C++?

I love that we're Rust! Rust is the only truly(not tacked on) multi-paradigm language I'm starting to fall in love with it and Haskell. Rust makes a C++ user feel like they're in a strange new land that resembles the old one in a few ways but is beautiful in it's own right in many ways.  

INTP is definitely Haskell. An INTP's mind is like a wonder of the world it's like logic as data almost. I love Haskell and I love INTPs, they both make me feel like I can geek out and have fun and not get judged hard. Rust is beauty, I'm glad to have been compared to it.

As for Scheme I think assigning both Scheme and Racket to different types is weird since Racket is an implementation of Scheme. I think in the end we humans are all just each others' Unlambda. &gt;ENTP - Scala

Scala runs on a VM, I find that too limiting as an Ne dominant. Rust and C++ are more to my taste.I haven't used that, what is it?&gt;Do you do embedded stuffs?

I'm a hobbyist so no. That stuff's not as fun to me as application programming. 

&gt;Scala's type system is more advanced than both Rust and C++

That's a  bold statement but if I wanted a beautiful type system I wouldn't choose Scala which I see as a hermaphrodite of a language, I'd opt for Haskell which has a beautiful type system. Also I really don't think that Scala has a better type system than Rust or C++ by anyone's account. Also Scala runs on the JVM so I assume that Scala types have to map to Java types in some way, which itself makes Scala a lot less flexible in type design than Haskell, C++, or Rust which all compile to native binaries.  

&gt;Besides if we talk about VM, even the lowest level machine codes are actually a stream of opcodes (which has no meaning outside the context of executing cpu), and then the opcodes are evaluated by said cpu .... exactly as it's done by a VM ;)

But compiling to native machine code allows you to squeeze the most performance out of the hardware. VMs and GCs solve a non-existent problem as is evidenced by Rust while slowing down execution speed and introducing unnecessary costly abstraction. Abstraction is only good when it serves a stated purpose, in this case it is unnecessary. Rust and C++ on the other hand offer zero cost abstractions and abstractions that resolve at compile time, which can be a huge advantage. I don't think you going to see computationally intensive software like computer algebra systems(mathematica is C++), operating systems(Windows is C++, Linux is C), visually appealing video games(all of them are in C++), or financial trading software(I've heard of Haskell, OCaml, and Java being used but the majority is still C++ and other systems languages) being written in anything other than C++. 

Mathematicians, computer scientists, economists, poly sci guys, physicists, and many other academic scholars all use C++ for computationally intensive models and other programming. So gee, I wonder why, certainly not because C++ is easier or faster to learn than Scala or Java, that's for sure.     

&gt;The OS is a thick layer of abstraction that we don't really control. Isn't it lying to you about you being the only process responsible for memory? Or there being only one thread of execution, where in reality it's house-keeping, context switching, scheduling and who knows what else? And at the lowest level even the said cpu has full liberty (which it gladly exercises) to defy your order of instructions, shuffle it, speculate about it or even ignore it altogether. Absolute control is just an illusion.

Yes the OS is an abstraction but without it, you'd be writing even trivial things in assembly and that's impractical. The OS serves a very important purpose and is itself written in a combination of systems programming languages and assembly languages. Writing native code within the OS gives you the maximum control in the context of the computer system your working on. A VM is an unnecessary abstraction that gets in the way more than anything when you're writing simple things that don't need that much runtime overhead. Take the JVM for example, it's slow to startup, despite being written itself in C++, and it's limiting in many ways.

By your logic I could say every programming language is abstract. C++(or Rust) is technically a high level language because to be frank machine code nor assembly looks nothing like C++, the language itself is a complete abstraction over all of that but within that abstraction certain low level controls are exposed by the language and can be used which is what makes those languages so useful. 

Also if I made a call to the OS's API and it didn't respond as expected then I'd call that a broken API, just like if you made a call to the JVM API from Scala and it didn't respond as expected. Saying that the hardware or the OS would possibly not respond to a call made in a systems language is like shooting your own argument in the foot since your preferred languages are implemented in AOT compiled languages, the JVM has to make calls to the system API and if those kinds of calls fail to work from C++, guess what buddy, they're sure as hell going to fail from your JVM, which is written in C++ as well. So what I can conclude is that C++ and it's ilk do necessarily have greater control than VM languages like Scala, Java, and Python. But there are a certainly a time and a place for all of those to be used, else they wouldn't exist. 

&gt;Maybe we should to separate the language from it's toolings and only talk about linguistic aspects. Because it looses its meaning otherwise when even C++ can be on a "VM" and when even Scala can be "native".

You are correct, C++ can target any machine including VMs like the Java VM or Microsoft's CLR. I don't know what a C++ to JVM compiler would do with pointers because I'm not sure if Java bytecode allows pointers and references in it or if some compiler magic would have to happen. 

I don't know how Scala or Java would be built into native executables without packaging their runtime environments into the final binary which would lead to a bloated binary. C++ binaries are large enough as it is, I can only imagine how bulky a Scala or Java binary would be with it's whole runtime packed in. D and Haskell package their Garbage Collectors and other parts of their standard libraries into their binaries on an as needed basis and they don't bloat up so I imagine with enough effort you could make a decent native compiler for Scala, but tooling and community do play a big part in shaping a computer language so I won't just not include that in a comparison. And Scala was designed to be a JVM language not ported to it, so I don't know if it would be easy or even desirable to take it off of the platform it was made for. 

I personally like compiled languages that normally produce native binaries like Haskell and also especially, systems level languages like C++, D, and Rust. For quick stuff I use Python, but I will admit to having only a cursory knowledge of that language and the Python documentation website open when I code in it.     
 Just combine them together to make Perlang, a new functional language with horrible Perlesque syntax. It'd given Unlambda a run for it's money in developer lack of productivity.  &gt;Just villains? 

Your type says nothing about your moral character. For example I'm an ENTP. There could be one ENTP who is a saint and another who is an awful person. MBTI tells you how you think, not what purpose you use your mind for. 

As for romance, don't worry about MBTI, from what I've been told when you meet the right person, things will feel right. I think you're overthinking the whole MBTI thing in terms of your own life. I have friends across the spectrum, from brainiac INTPs to socialite ISFPs to strict ESFJs. Anyone can get along with anyone so long as they can find a side of that person that they can appreciate. Seeing the best in others can sometimes be hard but it's not impossible, you just have to find some common ground quickly and that just takes practice. And trust me when I say I'm not one to go out of my way to talk to others unless the subject matter peaks my interest. That just sounds awesome for me even. I love ENTJs, INTPs, and other ENTPs. Rationalist and idealists are my favorite types of people and I could see myself in a relationship with a woman who isn't afraid to disagree with me and push her perspective. And that sounds like something an ENTJ or ENFJ could do well. Be careful not to get bit...Try us ENTPs on for size and see what you think. I'm a guy, so I can't speak for ENTP girls but I will say that you won't ever be bored with us around. And I respect that but don't let it limit you. (That's dominant Ne talking.)Precisely, I like a woman who can hold her own in debate. In high school I was on the debate team all four years and my four person team was me and three beautiful girls, all of whom were really good at it to be honest and so was I. And I respected them a lot and we all became really good friends. I swear I would get along really well with a woman like that who can enjoy a good debate or intellectual conversation for a good long period of time. That sounds pretty interesting but I'm still learning the core language of Rust so I'll just use Rust for Windows for now. It does for sure. That why INTP is Haskell and ENTP is Rust. Alright ENTPs, INTPs, ENTJs, INFPs, and ENFJs. Let's defeat everyone else by dinner time and then dinner's on me. I can somewhat see what you mean, being an Ne dominant myself but for me it all works out since Ne is balanced out by auxiliary Ti and Inferior Si. I don't know why but I have a tendency to suppress Fe. 

Would you say that as an INTP you suppress Si more than Fe?&gt;For example: You observe people doing a particular behavior in a particular situation, so when you see a similar situation in the future, your Ni shoves into your consciousness the strong impression that something is going to happen or that a particular insight is true. 

Actually my Ne would just start taking wild guesses about what would happen next or trying to connect it to something I already know then my aux Ti would try to come up with the probability of each scenario and then I'd try to narrow it down that way. But I consider everything tentative and subject to change and that my well be due to dominant Ne. I think the difference between Ne and Ni is that Ne branches out possibilities in many direction while Ni tries to take everything to what the user thinks is it's only logical conclusion. 

Hence INTJ(Ni dominant) is called "The Mastermind" because they find intuitive ways to reach a predetermined outcome, while ENTP(Ne dominant) is called "The Visionary" for their ability to take a given idea and logically play out various possible outcomes from it and then even branch each of those out further to the subsequent possibilities resulting from each and so on and so forth. But doing that too much makes me personally feel out of touch with reality so I try to keep a grip on my mind to the extent desirable. It seems like you're a very matured INTP who knows himself and his mind well. I'm too young for that to be the case. 

See I suppress Fe(tertiary) a lot and Si(inferior) really isn't important to me at all. i want to be able to share my feelings and whatnot but for me that tends to be problematic since I think that I only have two settings: one where I don't share my feelings at all almost pretend that I'm a pure logical creature or I'll just pour my heart out and the other person will just be like okay I don't know what to tell you. That really stems from ENTPs' common problem with judging social distance though I think I can learn to fix it. 

I find it fascinating that you said that you control all of your other function by using your Ti. I wonder if somehow I can control all of mine using Ne. I think it could be very possible to rule my life through intuition. The only problem is that it makes me feel indecisive when I do that. 

As for Si my hygiene is about on par with the average college student, so not really that amazing. If anything though I do love to dress up nice in formal clothing and also to sink a fair amount of money into suits, shirts, and ties.  

Also since you're an INTP can you explain to me what does a Ti-Si loop feel like? And in contrast what would a Ne-Fe loop feel like. Because I think I may be suffering from one of the two quite alot. As of right now I hypothesize that it is the latter. It is speculation, just speculation based on precedent. It is speculation, just speculation based on precedent. Well you can only intuitively come up with ideas based on information that you already have. And I didn't have that information so I just assumed.Now it makes more sense. See I'm actually not too awfully well read on MBTI. So you're like a walking, talking wikipedia? 

As an Ne dominant, I'm quite the opposite I formulate a new solution to everything as I need it even if I know of a preexisting one I'll question whether or not there's an easier way. I was gonna ask this. Cmon don't be like that. I really like to make friends with ENFJs, even though they can be downright annoying at times, so too can I. 

There's no such thing as a perfect human. I have inferior Si which I kind of ignore. I'm better at remembering abstract things like facts, historical events, and mathematical formulas but less so at remembering what I ate yesterday. I'd have to think about that for a while to remember but I can recite the quotient rule of derivatives from memory. 

Ne + Ti is quite the blessing until I have to socially entertain people I don't know well. 

What would you say is your main social difficulty? I'm just asking since I know very little about realist types. &gt;Having a good memory doesn't mean you have a good Si.

Oh I didn't mean that at all, I just worded that weirdly. Having a good abstract memory could very well be my auxiliary Ti and the gaps get filled in using logical extrapolation by dominant Ne.

&gt;I don't know about social difficulty, am kind of uptight if I don't knpw the person well.

Same. I sort of go into formal mode when I don't know what to do socially and people kind of think that weird or write it off as me just being "cute". But then again for an "E" type I am rather socially anxious but I do need social contact often or I'll get depressed. It's a hard life to live.   Indoors most of the time, but I like winter since it gives you that warm cozy social feeling when you can get everyone together, have a warm meal and hot chocolate and cuddle and socialize. 

Summer is not my thing. I don't like going outside too much and the heat bothers me. Also I tend to sweat alot so that's also not that fun. I hate summer to but I like Winter since it's the season where everyone can get all warm and cuddly. It's pretty weird to hear an NT say that, huh? I think that geography has more to with this question then MBTI types. I live in the northeastern US and for me winter is beautiful. But the area I live in is marshy so the summer is disgusting, at least to me. 100% agree on the order. I agree with you 100% OP!I'm agreeing on winter though, so I won't complain. Winter is just such a cozy season, I can't see anyone not liking it. So just stay inside. Cuddle with all your friends. Make warm food and then eat it. Just some ideas here. Well I think sitting in a window in the winter in the warmth looking out is just as good. Also you could try to make some friends; it was hard for me growing up to make friends but if you get involved in activities around your town or area that you like, eventually you'll be sure to make some friends. If you're ever talking and laughing with people that you like to spend time with try to politely ask for their numbers or add them on facebook or a similar site. For me as a guy it's hard to ask girls for this without making it sound like I'm "asking for their number" for certain other things, but it usually works out if you make it clear that you want to try to be friends. I'm an ENTP. For me love is the ultimate from of external validation. I need the world around me to almost confirm every once in a while that it needs or wants me otherwise I'll start to progressively lose self confidence and feel really bad about myself.  And that emotional support is what I'd prize the most from a lover. I've never experienced love but I'd imagine that if I was ever in that type of a situation I could wake up every morning and be happy about the fact that no matter what she loves me and not because she has to or society expects her to, either. Yes that would make me a very happy man indeed, too bad I doubt it will ever come to pass. 

People seem to assume that NT types don't have feelings or ignore them but that's wrong I have feelings all the time but being a rationalist(NT) I reason about my feelings in rational ways, though often not in the moment but rather later on. Sometimes I try to pin down what things make me feel a certain way or why. Or I'll try to think, was that cute girl really interested in talking to me or not and being an Ne dominant I'll tend to draw out all of the possibilities for what happened and then subsequently what the reason for each could be. Also this process happens automatically, I don't actively have to think about it. 

That said I personally have a lot of self confidence issues especially as pertains to talking to girls even normally and my usual solution to this is to just avoid them to the extent possible. I also tend to have body image issues, and with inferior Si, go figure. At this point I've pretty much given up on ever having a girlfriend, much less a wife. Anytime I start to become attracted to a girl or become especially close to her, once I realize it I pretty much just push her away ever so subtly or I just put the thought out of my head as soon as possible because for whatever reason every time it happens I just think that she deserves better than me or I'm not good enough.

Also to me asking out a girl or confessing my feelings is a risk proposition, if I do it and get rejected I lose face but because of what I described above that would be crippling to my self confidence and I probably wouldn't be able to leave my room for days. On the other hand if I don't do it and just push that thought of attraction out of my head, I can just be content with no risk. I can also convince myself that the only reason I don't have girlfriend is because I don't try despite knowing full well that isn't the case. If I were to ask a girl out or confess and I did get rejected again I wouldn't be able to lie to myself anymore and I would feel undesirable in a very tangible way.

All this is obviously unhealthy but what else am I gonna do because the fact is that's what my intuition tells me and it's almost never wrong.

Sometimes when I'm really stressed out Ne will just start to show me all of worst possible causes and results of all of my interpersonal relationships and I've gotten paranoid about if all my friends really just hate me and are faking it all to mess with me. Let me be very clear: sometimes being an ENTP can be a living hell. &gt;Really annoying chemical reactions that we can't figure out and can't get out of!

That is such a cynical answer but I'd expect no less from an INTJ or INFJ. 

And actually it is chemical reactions, metabolism, release of biosynthesized compounds like neurotransmitters, hormones, and neuromodulators but also electrical signals and whole lot more. Neuroscience is quite fascinating really and its subject matter does more or less explain the reasons for human consciousness. Once we cross the bridge between biology and psychology, sayonara religion.Because I'm an internet stranger giving a psychological analysis of myself to other internet strangers and you clearly don't understand that analysis nor have anything to contribute to it. 

Or more likely it's because you lack empathy for someone you've never met. But I don't blame ya for not empathizing with what you pretty much only know as a block of text.  &gt;Here's some science! Science is cool! Sometimes I learn science. Also why religion.

Actually it's more like: lol INTJ. Here's some science, science science science. Can I fuck over religion in this post? Yup!I'm glad you enjoyed it.Well to me all of socializing is just social chess to me. I usually just try to entertain my friends by coming up with wacky ideas with Ne and letting them do all the sorting out. Everyone always seems to think I'm so smart and funny especially the ladies. 

But when it comes to girls I'm interested in or want to show interest in things get complicated and I find it hard to be my usual quirky, charming, gentleman self. And I'm just so scared the either she or other people will hold it against me for liking her or that I'll embarrass her by admitting that I like her which I see as being way worse. 

I don't know if my fears are justified or if Fe is running loose or what it is. I personally think Ne just likes to show me the worst outcomes with this stuff because I can't build a chain of logic that leads to a desirable outcome that I can believe to be feasible. 

I usually go to my one ENFJ friend for this kind of advice but she's a girl and I did get rejected by her in the past but somehow we remained friends, at her request strangely enough. It was almost like she was upset that I didn't continue pursuing her though. But yeah I can't make use of her mastery of Fe for this like I normally do and may have to learn to control my own. 

So yeah I don't have anyone to talk feelings or insecurities with and as a rationalist that's my major obstacle. But for me self confidence especially body wise was always something I had trouble with and being bullied by females around middle school right around the start of puberty didn't help. It's pretty decent. The 16 personalities one is dead wrong. It always pegs me as an INTP when I really am an ENTP by jung functions. It claims to be. Because we find it hard to read others' feelings and emotional needs and don't try to hard to do so yet we're very good at figuring out how you think and can easily pull your strings if we're so inclined. We also don't tend to have as much of a focus on objective things like morality which the Ti doms(INTP, ISTP) do. We can contort anything enough to make it seem like it is the right things to do in our own heads. Thats what makes us scary, even to ourselves. Well I think that framework is a Ti thing but I'm not sure which function edges out. This is really getting frustrating. I'd say that I could work on a project for a while if I had to but it wouldn't be energizing at all it would be draining. That said I tend to be very shy socially and don't let my guard down either but when I do socialize with a very small group of people I tend to enjoy it. Especially if we're talking about something that's intellectually stimulating.

I used to debate with people a lot when I was younger but I don't anymore since it's near impossible to sway someone else opinion and I tend to make up my own mind about my opinions. If anything when I socialize most of the time I just say things to see how the other person responds. The purpose of this is really just so I can make a mental model of how they think. 

I tend to simplify and categorize everything I run into and then retrieve it later when I need it. But I can usually also draw connections between things pretty damn fast too. Hence my internal framework is made using both Ti and Ne about evenly.That would be Fe. I suppose but I'd like it if I could be more precise. It would bring me some closure in a way. Ah thanks. But introverted isn't a good indicator since ENTP is the most introverted E type. I would say I can use both Fe and Si, I'd say my Si is pretty damn good since I can remember physical things somewhat well. And I'm great at visualizing what things would look like.  So Si is not an issue. 

Fe has been my problem child for a while. But I've heard that people tend to suppress their tertiary. So that might be why I don't use that. 

In terms of energy though long periods of being alone in my own head often leaves me feeling like I'm losing my sanity. I can't go long periods with out socializing though with a small number of people. Or rather I need social validation. Is that normal for an INTP? I think I'm probabaly an ENTP but I just want to not count out any possibilities to the contrary.  

Alsl your help is much appreciated. Nope sociotype.com just gave me Intuiting Logical Extrovert (ILE) which is equivalent to ENTP in Myers Briggs. On a scale of 1 to certain how sure are you? Then again that could just be a me thing. I am always under high stress. By that logic I'd say I fit the prior more so than the latter. And that means?More datapoints outside. Variety is good, very good. That sounds about right. I'm just not to social and I'm not afraid to use Ti in my daily life. Ne is definitely my dom though. I've accepted that online tests just aren't a good indicator at this point. 16 Personalities puts me as INTP but I know now for sure that I'm not. I think because of the nature of Ne we tend to appear to be a lot like other types. We have a lot of variability based on our own knowledge since that's what Ne draws on to make its connections. If you think about it Ne is the opposite of Ti. Ne connects externally derived knowledge together using absolute logic while while Ti creates a framework of internally consistent, though subjective, logic.I think it is. And at this point I've accepted that I'm definitely an ENTP. ENFP. I can't control Fe and I'd be less lazy with a Te in the stack. Lawyer. The socially anxious ENTP is still at heart an intuitive and will still attempt to solve any problem using intuition(Ne). If this doesn't immediately get results they'll try to use their internal framework of knowledge, Ti, to help out their intuition. 

An INTP is at the core a thinker type and will attempt to use their inner mental framework to see if they know an answer to a given problem before attempting to intuit one. 

And people don't realize it but there are plenty of social even gregarious INTPs and shy even socially mute ENTPs.   Well I wouldn't say guess but if you build new solutions by combining and synthesizing things you already know that's using Ne. If you do this and arrive at multiple outcomes all the time you're likely ENTP or ENFP. As an ENTP I need to be social but large gatherings and parties are not my thing. I prefer just small groups or just talking to one or two people at a time. 

My type is the most introverted extrovert. And that's true because sometimes I just get lost in my own thoughts. For me it's more of an intuitive trust that makes me comfortable. Time has nothing to do with it but I am more comfortable with people Ive known a long time. I can meet someone and immediately click with them. I just don't like large groups of strangers. ENTP is ambivert. INTP is definite introvert. But I'm a special case ENTP that is very socially reserved. Tests can be wrong. Most MBTI tests are wrong online. I use the Jung functions tests to determine people's types. Nope. It stands for memories. All the time but then I realize it's accrued information. VeryENTP and Ravenclaw. I like INFPs and ENFPs. They're very smart but their emotional intelligence is what makes spending time with them so appealing.  My guess is ESFJ. I'd change it to just be the first two functions for the type so that newcomers to the theory immediately realize there are no percentages for each letter and that types are based on cognitive functions as described by Carl Jung. Only one question. Ready? 

If you had all of the information in the world how would you feel? Satisfied? Or limited? 







If you'd be satisfied you're INTP if you feel limited then you're ENTP. I couldn't tell if I was INTP or ENTP for the longest time. Once I discovered I was the latter I decided it would prove useful to make a quick and dirty test to tell them apart for the benefit of others in that predicament. I'm glad you liked it :)Sounds like you're might be an INTP or Ti heavy ENTP then. I'm not very social at all but my Ne is still very dominant. Thus making me an ENTP. 

You have to remember introspection is an attribute of intuition not introversion. This is likely why ENTPs are considered the most anti-social or in-our-own-head E type. 

So long story short you can be an ENTP and not desire much social interaction especially with strangers. At the least I seem to be that way. 

-ENTP I know plenty of Ni users who are closed minded as fuck because the entropy pool that their intuition relies on is very small. Could be ISTP.We are ambiverts. You've clearly never seen an ENTP in low energy mode. Most people and even tests mistyped me as INTP because of it. But by functions I'm most definitely ENTP. &gt;Yes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;They're called immature ENTPs.

FTFY
Of course. Everyone's different the MB system is just a rough classification system anyway. I'm just saying our type definitely the most misunderstood. That part that you said about not wanting to argue but rather be logically correct is so true. Preach that to the heavens man and hope our stereotype changes. 

People worship INTJs but dont realize how intelligent ENTPs can be as well. Our type includes people from Heisenberg to Feynman to John von Neumann, Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo Da Vinci, Bertrand Russell, and Niccolo Machiavelli. 

That short list alone consists of the fathers of half a dozen academic fields. I just think many people don't like how we correct them or present them better options than they could come up with. I got so tired of it I no longer argue with or correct anyone. And frankly it feels good to only look out for myself. Mine. 

-ENTPGetting so lost in what could be that I miss the opportunities in front of me right now. That and being incredibly lazy. 

ENTPExtroverted IntuitionThat would be interesting. But its success would come down to the activities or competitions they have them do and how well they execute the idea. It's called a flair. Many subreddits have them. In the sidebar click the link that says edit next to your username and a little popup will allow you to choose your flair. I don't talk that much and people have actually complained that I never say anything and am anti-social. I used to talk, argue, and debate a lot as a kid. Nowadays, I don't waste my energy talking to people I don't know or don't like. Either that or I'm lost in my own mental wonderland anyway. I know what you mean most people get so bogged down in petty things that they dont either know or care to talk about anything interesting or theoretical or "big picture" so to speak. 

When I find people who do I almost instinctively fear losing them. My best guy friend is ISFP and two closest women friends are ENFJ and ENFP respectively. They're all great but I just hate it when they want to talk about feelings because I just dont like to talk about them. 

To be completely frank I disagree with the people who say that INFJ or INTJ are our ideal partner. I personally we are the black sheep of the MBTI world and that no type understands us quite like our own. Every person I've really deeply connected with has also been an ENTP. Not necessarily true. I'm antisocial but very much still an ENTP. I just thought I'd ask since I was curious if the two correlate at all. Also please let's not start a political firestorm here. 

EDIT: I forgot to put my own, sorry!

Progressive - ENTP

EDIT: [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/zO3Bk) a chart with the results of this little experiment. I realize that the sample size is rather small and it really can't be generalized due to a lack to control but oh well.  
What's got me hung up is that I feel like I display characteristics of both types though most tests peg me as an INTP some give me ENTP and very rarely INTJ/ENTJ.

That said here's a bit about me. I definitely don't think I have a problem picking a logical fight with others, though, I tend to do so just to see where it will lead most of the time and it's really not that hard for me to win these debates since my mind is usually 50 light years ahead of my opponent and is constantly re-rendering my mental map of possibilities for how the argument could go as new information comes in. All of my friends know me as the debater/instigator who's always out to make others concede to my logic. And, that habit has gotten me in a lot of trouble socially, because people don't understand that my arguing isn't meant to be personal or make them feel bad and is really just some much needed mental exercise for me. Sometimes if my opponent bores me in such a debate, I'll just say something to steer the conversation in a different direction to explore my my inner map that I mentioned before and in doing so I feel like I'm really just debating myself while using my opponent as something to deflect my ides off of. On the other hand if my opponent is challenging then I let them sort of open my mind to new ideas while fully savoring the challenge of debating with them. 

Despite all of this I also tend to get nervous around large crowds or when meeting a lot of people(like more than 2) I don't know. And around most girls, just forget it, all of my usual mental prowess just disappears and I tend to freeze up. And that can sometimes end up causing them to think I dislike them as people or that I'm avoiding them, not knowing that if anything I'm just doing that for my own mental benefit.

Despite all of this though, I get really bored if I don't have people too spend time with and I like to talk to smart people and just talk about wacky ideas and see what's practical and what isn't. In the short term I love to just share outlandish thoughts with people and see what feedback or extension to the idea I. I also like hear others ideas and see how they fit with what I think.  But despite this I have so many times when i just feel like reality comes crashing in and I realize that my actions do tangibly affect my life and my surroundings I have to deal with that in a why that doesn't change too much at once and that avoids situations I don't really want to have to live with. 

So then which do you think I am? A socially awkward ENTP(Ne + Ti) or an overly talkative/argumentative INTP(Ti + Ne)? Or is it something else entirely?

Weirdly enough I took the socionics test and it gave me INTJ which also seems to fit very well. Things just got a whole lot more complicated...What's up /r/mbti,

So I program as a hobby and long story short one day I was wondering if mbti type is related to the type of programming language that people prefer to use. So my question is: what is your MBTI type and what is your favorite programming language?

And before anyone asks please pick just one programming language and only choose on the basis of how much you like to use it or would like to use it if you knew if better. 

I'll put mine in the comment section so it doesn't unduly influence anyone's choice. 

Thanks, 

/u/lead999xBasically just the title question, my answers are below. Most tests give me INTP, probably because I'm not very social but I feel a lot more like an Ne dominant than a Ti dominant. I always think in terms of possibilities arising from a given idea and drawing connections between things something I do without even actively trying. 

I do also have an internal framework for how things work though which I am constantly growing and editing as new information comes in and new possibilities get generated. 

So how can I definitively tell if I'm an INTP with a developed Ne who is a bit more argumentative. Or if I am definitely an ENTP unlike what some of the tests say. 

25quiz.com pegs me as an ENTP. So does Sociotype.com. Everything else has me as an INTP. 

All help is appreciated. 


EDIT: I think I am an ENTP, just a socially awkward one. I think that along with certain other factors make me mistype in online tests. Thanks for the help everyone. Have a safe and happy new years. I realized recently that while I've heard many stereotypes about Extroverted Thinking and its users I do not really know what it feels like to use it or have it high up in the stack. Could a Te user explain what it is actually like to use this function and perhaps what's the benefits and drawbacks of it are beyond the stereotypes?

Thanks.That can also very much be ENTP.Except at humility. ;)Oh no. We know very well what those are because they plague us like diseases that you just cant get rid of but can hide the symptoms.It just wasn't her day.Guilty as charged.There are always alternate possibilities.YeahLet them keep telling themselves that, their egos need the boost.The one smart enough to know not to play.If that were true then given sufficient information it would be possible to predict the future with arbitrary accuracy. In fact Isaac Newton believed the universe existed as such. However, quantum mechanics shows that the most basic elements of reality lie not in one singular state at a given time but rather in superpositions of multiple measurable states. In other words, the very fabric of reality is built on multiple possibilities existing at once.

I'd hoped that the type hyped as the most intelligent would have the ability to take a broader, less absolute view than that.&gt;First of all we don't fully understand quantum mechanics, and by we I include all the most brilliant physicists.

Actually the core theory of QM is rather well understood and has been reinforced time and again by experiments. It isn't exactly a new theory either it's been how many decades now since Heisenberg put the basic pieces of it together? The major part that isn't understood is how to interpret the theory or to put it in simpler terms the *why* not the *what*. 

&gt;Secondly, if that were the case then given sufficient information it would be possible to manifest the reality you want

This is just flat out incorrect. Quantum systems collapse from a superposition of multiple measurable states into a single measurable state stochastically based on some probability distribution unique to that system and the particular superposition it is in. Because the process of collapsing into a measurable state is stochastic(random) the particular state that will be measured cannot be predicted ahead of time regardless of the amount of information you have about the system prior to measuring it. 

&gt;because you cannot exist in multiple realities at once

This is also not true. As I already stated all quantum systems including the elementary particles that make up your body as constantly in superpositions of measurable states. To put it in mathematical terms the vectors used to represent those states are linear combinations of the basis vectors that represent they states they can be found to be in when measured. 

&gt;your primary manifestation exists in primary manifested reality.

And there it is the biggest lie nature has ever told us: that there is a singular fixed reality. On a macroscopic scale we tend to think of things as being in singular fixed states because that is how our senses have evolved to perceive them. But the reality is much different and much more probabilistic than mechanistic though it may not at first appear as such. This where the phrase "God does not play dice with the universe." comes in. But Stephen Hawking, a man supposedly if your type is quoted as responding, "Not only does God play dice with the universe but he sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen." indicating that not only is nature fundamentally random but sometimes the results of that randomness cannot even be measured.

But I suppose this is why science relies more on rigorous logic and hard data than on mere observations and assumptions.

&gt;I will ignore your jab at my intelligence because I have already bounced it back at you.

If you think this

&gt;I'd hoped that the type hyped as the most intelligent would have the ability to take a broader, less absolute view than that. 

is a jab at your intelligence than clearly, you, like many denizens of this sub types notwithstanding, have a fragile ego and assume everything to be a personal attack. It is simply an honest statement saying that I'd hoped you'd be more open minded than you've proven to be. 

And frankly I'm not here like some others of my type trying to prove that I'm more intelligent or that anyone else is less so. I'm comfortable enough with myself that I don't need that kind of validation from strangers nor do I desire to put anyone else down to get it.&gt;&gt; Actually the core theory of QM is rather well understood 
&gt;
&gt;So it's not fully understood

I already explained this to you at length. I won't do it again. The part that you're arguing about **is** very well understood. 

&gt;&gt; This is just flat out incorrect. Quantum systems collapse randomly
&gt;
&gt;Randomness is the god of gaps in QM

It's not a gap when the theory itself is defined using a calculus of probabilities.  The probability of a quantum systems being measured in a given state can be determined from the ket-vector representing its quantum state. Which means stochasticity is a fundamental building block of the theory not a missing piece of it.

There is no canonical explanation as to **why** it works this way but the fact that it does is well established and it is also what I'm arguing for and you, against. 

&gt;You. Cannot. Exist. In multiple realities at the same time. Your alternate versions do. You as in YOU - don't.

You are correct but I never argued existing in multiple realities. I argued the simultaneous existence of multiple possibilities in the same one and the most basic particles that make you up do in fact exist in multiple possible measurable states at once i.e. in superpositions of their measurable states. This is not a part of QM that is in contention or considered unknown and it has been confirmed time and again by experiments. 

Superposition is also the property that makes potential applications of QM like quantum computing so incredibly powerful.

&gt;&gt; And there it is the biggest lie nature has ever told us: that there is a singular fixed reality. 
&gt;
&gt;The one you experience? Only one. Yours. Probable realities do not matter until they manifest themselves. After that, they become fixed states from the past.

I already went through the whole lecture on how what your senses have evolved to detect is not necessary how nature actually works so I won't repeat myself.

Going by what we experience as you suggested, the reason your hand can't go through a wall is because both are solid. The reality if you actually investigate deeper is that both the wall and your hand are mostly empty space but the electrons within their atoms repel each other.

Bottom line, your senses are unreliable when it comes to discerning the truth behind nature. 

&gt;&gt; is a jab at your intelligence than clearly, you, like many denizens of this sub types notwithstanding, have a fragile ego and assume everything to be a personal attack. It is simply an honest statement saying that I'd hoped you'd be more open minded than you've proven to be. 
&gt;
&gt;First of all, I didn't feel attacked. Not to mention personally. My response was simply an honest statement saying that this is a kindergarten level of communication. There was no need for your statement. At all. If you only hoped for me to be more open-minded.

You thinking that was an unecessary statement is your opinion and one you're entitled to. But ultimately you chose to interpret the original statement as a "jab on my intelligence". That still says more about you than me. The statement could've been interpreted as innocently as you wanted to. 

&gt;And now you are calling me close-minded because I disagreed with you. Classic. Confusing disagreement with closemindedness.

Not quite. I was calling you closed-minded because you take such an absolute and singular view of reality which is not what I expected from a fellow intuitive. It was an opinion and one that holds no more intrinsic value than yours above. I have no problems with disagreement at all. A world without disagreement would be rather drab. If nothing else I'm sure we can agree on that.My reaction is more like the INTP one. No social interaction? Sports cancelled? Free entertainment in the form of idiots fighting over toilet paper and non-Honey Nut Cheerios? 

Count me in.The internet provides all the social interaction I could ever want or need.I too am enjoying the social experiment part of it. Give people a crisis and you see their baser nature come out.Yeah that sucks for those who can't work from home. Hopefully your country has some kind of disaster relief fund that can help you if you need money.Yep except with less pointless small talk with people you hardly know.Me, an antisocial extrovert: The internet is all the social interaction I'll ever need.I can see why you're excited but what concerns you? The mortality rate remains low and there are vaccines in the works.I was literally about to say the same thing about doing whatever he wants once it's his before seeing your comment. I swear some of us are telepathic.I won't sell you corn but I will hoard all the things you need but didn't think to buy just to watch the world burn.Those are all very good points. I hadn't considered the  effect on people who need medical services for reasons other than the coronavirus. I hope your wife is okay throughout all of this. 

The availability of the vaccine probably won't be an issue given the partnerships between pharma companies and multiple governments unless the companies decide to create artificial scarcity. As for the price, I can't image it'll be pretty.Big facts.SiLolIf you die and they don't you'll have to wait awhile for them to join you in hell. On the plus side you can keep their fire pits warm.Make meAre you talking to the coronavirus?IDK if I've ever seen an INTJ looking that vulnerable.Bold of you to assume he didn't know how to set up a temporary message blocker.I think the bigger problem is that this group may as well be called INTJ circlejerk.I bring thee a shrubbery!You are correct and you should feel correct.It's almost like every type can be a major trainwreck...I would hate to be in a leadership position. An advisor who likes to stir the pot, sure, but never the actual boss.Shh. Just let it happen.Short answer: They're mistyped and enjoy the attention because they're supposedly the smartest type or whatever. I'd wager many of them are ESTJs.

The few actual mature INTJs that I know don't care much for that kind of recognition. External validation isn't what drives them.Why do you seek attention?Would you say that your not being listened to in the past has caused you to seek attention at any cost? Even when it might be unhealthy?And when you do get said attention what do you typically do with it? And how does that make you feel?So is the end goal of all this simply to get more attention? If so have you considered a career in entertainment? Comedy perhaps? Maybe acting? Or being a Judge on a courtroom reality show? (Judge Judy was the highest paid TV actor for a very, very long time making far more than she ever could've as an attorney.)So then what is your end goal? Also do you feel like you need external validation or is there another reason attention makes you feel good? Also is all attention good attention? 

Oh and btw just saw your username. Why do you eat ENFPs and do they really taste good?Fuel you for a week, you say? 

I'll have to try that. These ISTPs barely last me a day.You're living proof that people project type stereotypes onto themselves. Why don't you check to see if you're mistyped because I doubt there is an intuitive bone in your body.They're great to work with or for but if I was married to one I'd blow my brains out with an artillery battery.They're efficient. Te does that.Yeah she looks like an office boss who gets mad about every little thing and even when everything's right she makes up something to blame you for.Subs ;)Relax, 'she' is a drawing.My dad is ESTJ and he was and AFAIK still is like that too. It works for him in business but he doesn't get it when people tell him to knock it off. In short he is the corporate sector's ideal middle manager.

I'm friends with a few ENTJ girls and they're great for a fling and fun to flirt with but I wouldn't commit to anything with one.I would bet my net worth that you're a dude. Lol. 

Girls not agreeing with me on anything is an indisputable fact of life. Why don't you build me one of your famous theories around that.They're efficient with their money. In other words most of them won't frivolously spend your money like feeler types. But it would surprise me if one wasn't controlling. But one of them that I knew was very emotionally supportive when it mattered but she did have an ego to compensate.Sure.They're supposedly one of the types yours is most compatible with. Go into the world and find the woman you think you need, my dude. And be good to her. And don't die of coronavirus...or anything else.Make me a theory then Mr. INTP. From whence come my woes?Even the most insightful person isn't omnipotent. No need to hold ourselves to unrealistic standards.Lol.Someone's totally not an otaku.Wouldn't dream of it.I can really relate to that. As a kid I always argued with people and liked to tell people how they were wrong. After much introspection, I realized that what I really wanted to do was share an alternative to their idea or perspective and that I was invalidating their points of view while trying to do it. 

I try to approach things differently now and affirm a person's ideas and then calmly suggest that there might be other alternatives which allows us to explore the possibilities and the subject together instead of locking us into a clash of egos about who is right or wrong. Admittedly I still make mistakes in that arena and sometimes let kneejerk reactions take me over but I'm trying to improve. Slowly but surely.Oh I'm "understanding", alright.I'd steal, I'm mean borrow, her credit card out of her purse to buy it. The life insurance would more than cover it.Exactly!Wow that's really insightful. And you're right self improvement has to start somewhere. 

 Thank you Mr. INTP.I don't know if I believe any people are completely incompatible but I can agree that it often feels that way. I think we can still get along but both parties have to make a concerted effort to meet halfway.Let's not get *too* full of ourselves.You can't choose new parents or family members as much as I wish you could ;)Ain't that the truth. LolThis but unironically.Big factsOr no unless he's a goddamned teenager.This guy sounds like a teenager while the youngest millennials are 24 and the oldest are in their 40s.There will be a generation of quarantine boomers(Q-mers?) born from this and when they get old they will condemn future generations. So says the prophecy.Lol it's more than likely a mistyped teenager.That just means you're the only social interaction available and he has to settle.Or just *borrow* your kids' Legos and tell your girl you're helping them build something...you know for plausible deniability.I scare me too sometimes.Yep but you know this sub: 

INTJ, good

ENTP, dumb

LolAccurate AFMost tests are laughably unreliable. I think the best way to type someone is to have a trained analyst observe the subject for a while.

All the tests that don't use functions including the official instrument give me INTP. I'm not an INTP by functions. It's really kind of funny.  

My most recent function test gave me INTJ and my ENFP friend who was over suggested that I might be stressed and thus come up as my shadow type. I agree with her assessment I'm definitely not an INTJ either, just under stress.It depends on the type of edginess. Half the 'ENTPs' in these type forums tend not to have a single intuitive bone in their body but rather just say stupid shit and forcibly project the stereotypes on themselves. It's rather ironic. 

People also don't seem to realize that both your type and mine are far rarer than the numbers of people claiming to be of them in these forums would indicate.I understand that. I was an only child and pretty lonely as a kid so my highest introverted function, introverted thinking, developed much more than it might otherwise have since I didn't have as many stimuli to recharge my Ne's entropy pool, if that makes sense. I suspect that could be why I come off as being like an INTP at times and don't mind solitude too much.More or less.There are stereotypes. Then there are mistyped morons who project the stereotypes on to themselves which leads those stereotypes to be reinforced and so the cycle continues.

As I said in another comment there are far too many people on online forums claiming to be ENTPs, INFJs, and INTJs for them to all actually be of those types.&gt;The most common thread on the [r/intj](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj) is "dae: feel like the only intelligent being on the planet" with only two kinds of answers, either "omg, that's so me," and "ur mistyped lol" 

And that's precisely what I'm talking about. These subs and other social media forums quickly devolve into exactly that kind of echo chamber.Interesting. I didn't know that many mainstream psychologists used MBTI. I only got to take the official instrument at work because the government agency I worked for decided it would help our various teams learn to work together better.I agree completely. Thankfully there are people who use it effectively for the former purpose you stated.&gt;The problem with this whole personality categorization is that people who don't introspect will just assume the personality the test's given them. 

This how I think most people treat it. But then as I said before they're peer pressured into trying to fit their type stereotypes which I find to be counterintuitive if the goal of this whole thing is to use it to better understand yourself. It devolves into exactly what your described, astrology for nerds.Yeah. At it's core it's an ego thing. They need to feel like they achieved something and they won't be one-upped so they make up all kinds of ideas about why the next generation is inadequate and will never measure up to them. The ultimate irony is when they criticize young adults for not knowing life skills when it was them who failed to teach those things. 

I personally would just appreciate if they were mature enough to realize that not everything has to be a competition or an ego trip.Ok, Boomer.Yeah I guess so. I had friend in college who I mentioned it to. She was doing social work and she really, really had to explain all the reason why it was not scientifically sound etc. Which I suppose is true but if it nevertheless helps you understand yourself then I don't see the harm in it.I understand what you're saying and I didn't mean for it to sound like their intent was malicious. Basically what I was trying to do was understand why they feel the need to always disparage and disapprove of the younger generations, especially us millennials who have had and do have our own struggles. 

I'm not a researcher so I don't have clear evidence of anything but my best guess is what I said before that it comes down to ego. 

Now I realize that there are negative connotations attached to that word but what I mean by it is their sense of self and sense of pride. I think the reason they don't approve of the generations after them is because they're scared of all the changes we have made to things they considered to perhaps be more static than we do. And as a result they want to feel relevant in an increasingly alien world that changes so quickly. So I really do not blame them I just think that they're frustrated because they're not as sure of their own place in the world and this is their way of expressing that feeling. 

I may very well be wrong about this but this is what I suspect to be the reason for their views. It has gotten to the point where even the media has built a paradigm around it saying such things as "millennials have killed off X industry" and so forth to feed into it. 

Realistically we just all need to take a step back and realize that pointing fingers isn't solving any problems or improving anything and do our best to bridge those generational gaps so we can all move forward and avoid unnecessary social drama.Nah. I'm enjoying the solitude.Introversion/Extroversion in MB theory have more to do with how you project energy than how sociable you are. That said, I can finally be free to be my antisocial self without feeling guilty about it and I can project all the energy I want at the interwebs. :)Anytime. Haha.NoI don't. But my sample size has been small so maybe I just know the wrong ones.ISFJ-Mother

ESTJ-Father

No siblings. Lots of SJ sensors in the extended family. I really had to learn patience and got a *lot* of discipline early on. But I can't say that I haven't benefitted from it. I just wish I could make better use of Fe but it's hard to learn that when you grow up being told everything you do is wrong.SFsExtroverted means you get energy from outside of yourself. I don't know if I see most N types as being like that.My type is stereotyped as enjoying conflict dispite that not actually being true. I find myself drained by it often and tend to remind myself that socially as in other cases you have to choose your battles. 

That said, the best answer to your question is avoid, avoid, avoid. If people come to you looking for an argument just say okay and walk away. The vast majority of the time you won't be able to change their minds anyway.

Alternatively, if you're both mature enough, you could just agree that you have a difference of opinion and that's okay. I really like this because it changes the nature of the encounter away from adversarial. Does this mean you have to become a people pleaser? Certainly not. But it also means you don't have to waste time and energy pointlessly fighting with everyone. 

Bottom line: unnecessary conflict drains away your finite energy and for most things it isn't worth it.ENTP: The outside the box weird but surprisingly crafty kook(me). Very antisocial for a supposed extrovert but will engage with you if he likes you and you have common interests. 

ISTJ: Human computer. Nerdy pal that we don't let anyone even tease other than ourselves. He's legit and knows a lot of random facts and figures. He and ENTP have some interesting banter from time to time since they're both suckers for information. 

ENFP: The fixer of social problems. If we accidentally piss someone off, he'll smooth it over and then some. Girls practically worship the ground he walks on. He's loyal and puts his squad before anyone else unless he thinks he can get away with not doing so...

INFJ: The one with strange but profound ideas that we all try to get to come out of her shell. Lots of fun once you get to know her but very reserved. Is the one to go to when you need a muse. Most people think they like her but in actuality they don't really know her.\^ProgressThis is funny coming from a group that may as well be called INTJ circlejerk.Maybe he is one. There are priests who are scientists. \*shrugs\*TILIt's only useless until it isn't. ;)You're not wrong. But I saw it as a learning experience. One big takeaway for me was that as much as personality is innate, the way you behave is largely due to how your mind has been conditioned by your past. 

I guess with these things you just have to try to find the good in it.My mom is also ISFJ and my experience has been exactly as you described yours.I understand. I love my mother but the woman has to be less controlling. She's stuck in the belief that there's only one right way to live life and if you deviate from it even slightly you'll become a crackhead on the side of the road. And "for my own good" she tries to force me to live the way she wants me to. Even now that I'm grown up and moved out. 

It's been difficult to maintain a healthy parent and adult-child relationship with her and she gets all passive aggressive when I try to take time away from communicating with her to recharge my batteries so to speak.PreciselyDespite being an 'E' type I am also like this. I often find that I need to be alone for a while to process all the new information I took in and recharge.Very true. I like to ask people about their perspectives on things get exposure to ideas I may not have considered but ultimately my Ti needs time to take the possibilities that my intuition generates, or maybe discovers is a better word, from those new ideas and figure out how they fit into my framework of understanding and that takes time and solitude. I suspect this is because I was alone a lot as a kid so my introverted auxiliary function developed almost as well as my dominant one. 

My friends often ask me where I disappeared to for a while or why I dropped off the radar but really I just like to take a few mental health days, so to speak, away from social life.&gt;I'm not quite sure that's necessarily correlated with your spending time alone. Sure, I can see how Ne can be overwhelming but I've never seen Ti as an organiser like function. 

Ne needs input. Being alone means no stimulation or input which makes Ne inactive or atleast not very effective. I may not have had people but I did have the internet and the library and transitively a lot facts and figures which work better with Ti than Ne when you have no one to share them with and nothing to apply them to because you're a kid being raised by two xSFJs.

Ti is about creating frameworks and models of things and making sure they're internally consistent. Penultimately in my view it is also about creating the user's framework of understanding of the world around them. Or at least it is for me. So basically it developed because I was in an environment that was conducive to its development. I tried and failed to explain that in my earlier comment. I appologize for this.  

I differ from what you're saying about your BF that it's not the specific people or type of people that I need to recharge from but rather I have a finite amount of energy and I need to relax alone to get it back. There are very few people I enjoy spending time with enough that being with them helps that process.

Here's my theory, which makes sense to me but may well be horribly wrong. I think Ne works like a random number generator. It needs randomness, new information, observed patterns, or as I like to think of it all, entropy, in order to function properly. You put stuff in and it takes the patterns and the concepts and combines them in nontrivial and often  quite sophisticated ways and spits out novel ideas. But there's a catch, every idea it spits out uses up some of its entropy. As it gets used up the things it spits out become less and less sophisticated, less and less unique until the user ends up in loops repeating the same few things. At that point we are done for the night/day/social event etc. and after that much effort are usually tired from trying to come up with so many new ideas and hitting a wall. That's when I need to be alone, listen to music, watch TV, read, and just rebuild that entropy pool without any further energy expenditure on my part. 

In addition, at that point I have a tendency to reconcile any new information with existing knowledge and new ideas I want to talk about with it as well to see if they are 'internally consistent' with each other and my existing knowledge and for that I need to zone out in peace. Normally when I socialize my Ne needs to be tempered by my Ti (and ideally Fe too but that's an even bigger expenditure) or things get all out of whack and I become the stereotype of the immature ENTP and end up sounding like an idiot. These things can and do make perfect sense in my head but if I just start rambling about them to you it'll sound like I'm spewing random baloney unless I put them into a nice organized framework that facilitates your understanding as the listener. That takes Ti and even to an extent Fe to help adapt it to the audience at hand. 

 Well I can't do all that and do all the reconciling I mentioned before at the same time. If I try to the result is just information overload or I subconsciously prioritize what's in my head and end up externally saying stupid things because of the lack of attention. My preference is to leave the social situation before that happens because I have a lot of anxiety about saying the wrong thing and that too is a result of childhood experiences. Most others of my type may not have had those experiences and may not care about the aforementioned problem as much as I do. 

Bottomline, I think my type's biggest problem is that we can do all the most intelligent thinking in our heads and externally act and present as being complete idiots because we very often only have enough energy to really commit to one or the other and we subconsciously give the former priority. 

Based on our stereotypes and from being close to one of us I'm certain you understand the social toll that takes.&gt;can see what you mean by "Ne needs input" yet I generally think that that input is fed through the Ne-Si axis. I'm not dismissing Ti, I agree that boiling the inner working of the mind to primary-inferior is reductionist and that's why I want to try clear it up.

Yes this is correct but the role of Ti and Fe is to serve as filters. And a well developed Ti has led me to subconsciously caring about logical consistency everywhere. I can at tile be a stickler for Grammer for example. In contrast Fe for me is sort of like a social spider sense that makes me panic when I am about to say or do something risky. I tend to be socially risk averse so I tend not to do such around people I don't trust.

&gt;Oh and another thing I found interesting. The bit about thinking grandiose things but resorting to behaving like an idiot. I think that's the tragedy of all the enxps I've gotten to know. It doesn't bother me and it doesn't make me think less of them. 

I understand and appreciate that but it's frustrating to live that life. If you've read the Illiad, I can often find myself relating to Cassandra, the Trojan princess who was cursed by the gods to be able to see the future but if she tried to communicate it no one would believe her. While I certainly don't claim to see the future it's hard to understand certain things or especially see novel connections between things other would presume to be disjoint but be completely unable to communicate those things without sounding completely nuts and having to settle for deflecting a lot. 

&gt;If I want to know what they're thinking, I'll just ask and follow-up ask until I get it. 

Please don't take this the wrong way but it's just not that easy. You might not know the right questions to ask or even if you do I may not be able to give an answer that fully encompasses the patterns, connections, and combinations between things that I understand at varying levels of abstraction. And that is the problem. Language as we know it wasn't made for this and this I suspect is what draws many of my type to math and computer science which do have languages can to some degree encompass some of these things. But I still have to emphasize some, not all. 

Anyhow as an Ni Dom, I would think you'd understand what I mean when I say that there are certain deeply abstract things we can just understand or can piece together but there aren't really words to explain them. Think about a pattern for example that I might notice when observing something, my instinct is to abstract the pattern away and then manipulate it by applying it to other things I know about or perhaps combing it with other patterns I know about and then applying it to  some set of ideas that fit to create a concrete concept. It's really hard to explain that and I don't have to think about doing it, it just happens instinctively below the conscious level. Now I can communicate that concrete idea but many people will just want to dismiss because it just sounds too different from anything they're familiar with and I can't communicate the whole abstract process of creating that idea so I simply cannot get them to follow it. And oftentimes I'm not entirely sure how I came up with these things just that in my mind they make perfect and absolute sense.

The other problem as I said is that I might be able to explain a simplified version of what's in my head but then people will assume I'm as simple minded as the simplification I created for them. Now there's irony. 

&gt;What I can't tell is why it bothers them and to what extent. How is it for you? Does it sort of feel anticlimactic when the outside doesn't fill the shoes of what you thought?

To use the Cassandra metaphor again she could literally see the future of her people and their ruin but was helpless to change it. Likewise it's hard to really understand something truly profound and novel and not be able to have others make sense of it especially because I don't often come up with one new thing as such but rather picking up new abstract patterns mean vast numbers of combinations of new ideas to work with and a lot of time needed to really take them to all of their natural conclusions or dismiss them as illogical as may also be the case. 

Now take all of that have someone sitting next you who you simply cannot get to understand it the same way. Their understanding of this vast and amazing set of patterns and concepts and the interconnections between them will always be a necessary simplification of my understanding or a metaphor or analogy to mine. And because of it they'll think that my mind and my understanding of what I'm trying desperately to communicate is truly as simple as the simplified version I was desperately able to get across. And this does become increasingly frustrating because people assume I am a less complex thinker than I actually am.

&gt;Again, I'm not at all trying to suggest that you shouldn't think or feel a certain way just because I don't fully understand where it comes from. That's why I'm asking, really, to understand the mechanics of it.

I appreciate your willingness and patience in trying to understand conversing with you has made me think more deeply about how I myself work and challenged my understanding of myself and I will surely benefit from it so thank you for that. 

I can't say I fully understand the mechanics behind it myself. It's not exactly possible to slow down the process of intuiting as such to allow it to be examined. As you can see above I'm still struggling to explain it to you. 

I've talked to a few other real ENTPs, including a friend/mentor of mine who just kind of understand it all without having to explain much. But finding mature people who have learned to value personal growth among my own type is it's own struggle. And I don't mean to put anyone down by saying that; we do take the longest to mature. And I suppose the aforementioned struggles with communicating the full extent of our idea and thought process and the frustration that comes with that are major contributing factors. And it's easy to just waste your time joking around all day when you're frustrated with trying to convince people that you actually are intelligent and not a hack with no success, especially when you're a child or teenager. And that frustration stays with you well into adulthood.But Ne and Ni don't quite sound right.I just think it doesn't align with my experience but I suppose my experience is but one of many. 

I would say I don't want to make new ways of doing things but I just happen to come up with new ideas or atleast new to me. The word doing carries the connotation that these ideas may be applicable to something when that is often not the case.

I also do enjoy changes of pace and novelty but risk and adventure are not my thing. I'm quite risk averse because I get paranoid about possible bad outcomes. As with anything I find that I have my own sweet spot for risk and it's closer to safe than it is to risky. 

And for the last part I would not say that I don't know what tomorrow brings. Quite the contrary, I can usually narrow it down to 3-4 reasonable guesses given the information I have. I tend to have the opposite problem where everything I see feels like it's a combination or permutation of things I've seen before, hence my enjoying novelty. 

I'm sure other people may have had different experiences with but this is just my individual take as an Ne dom.5w4 

Don't ask me why or how because I'm not at all versed in Enneagram.&gt;logical consistency doesn't mean sensible action.

Ain't that the truth. I learned this the hard way many times. 

&gt;Then Te is so bent on efficiency, on getting it done that it can pardon logical errors to a fault. I found that Ti users are more prone to validating something by saying something like "that's correct", while Te users would use a variation of "that makes sense".

Thinking functions are really interesting to me. You would think that logic is logic regardless but they differences are intriguing. I would really cherish the opportunity to observe ENTJs and INTPs when they're in the zone so to speak just to contrast between them. 

&gt;I still think, however, that most things are doable with enough juggernauting. Getting one's point across included.

Getting a point across is one thing, explaining something that may not make sense to most people because of the convoluted, atypical thinking required to get it is quite another. Which leads to the two problems I mentioned before, simplification or concrete examples or outcomes that sound weird.

&gt; So, not straight up thinking of the perfect question won't stop anyone from probity probing until they get it. It's not a question of procedural simplicity. To me, at least. Whether the procedure is sniping for "the good question" or persevering until I'm dehydrated, if it needs to be done, it'll be done. I'm fairly confident that the most frequent offender of communication is the fact that people simply can't be bothered to persist, rather than language not being equipped to deal with the abstract.

This is an interesting thought process. Even if you ask all the right questions it can still be hard for me to answer it. I suppose you may be right that with sufficient persistence any communication hurdle can be overcome. In theory this is true. In reality we are human and we have limits as to how long we will listen to someone try and potentially fail to communicate an idea or on the other side try to explain it before giving in. Or do the two things I said before to simplify things. 

To use an example lets say I have a bunch of spaghetti in a bowl and you're on the phone with me. Let's say you're able to sculpt things perfectly and you're trying to recreate the spaghetti based only on my description of it. Sure given an arbitrarily large amount of time and number of tries I will be able to convey the exact shape of the pasta and every drop of sauce and you will be able to understand it and recreate it. 

The spaghetti is an apt analogy for my(or anyone's) mental models and webs of ideas. But trying to communicate it accurately would be very difficult though not impossible by any means. 

&gt;What I got from what you said is that the "how" goes sort of like this: abstract thinking is inherently difficult to convey.

Abstract and complex. These are two orthogonal causes of difficulty and together they are even worse.

&gt;Communication is a two way street so even if you'd jump through hoops and expressed the closest to what you thought, you can say it to people but you can't understand it for them. Most of them will dismiss the prospect of actually having to think because that's unpleasant and people are myopic like that.

I wouldn't want to judge people like that. I don't like to assume that I'm better or smarter than other people. I used to do that kind of thing when I was younger and less mature and I realized at some point that I don't like it and I regret that attitude very much because it held back my personal growth for too long.

People are different and think differently and that's okay with me. I don't think that they have difficulty understanding me because they're too stubborn to try or not intelligent enough to want to. Instead I think that it just that they're wired differently. But that different wiring means that it's that much harder for them to recreate my metaphorical bowl of spaghetti. 

&gt; Then, because of your tertiary Fe, you'll avoid conflict so you'll deflect instead of initiating a confrontation over the rules of active listening.

Not so much an argument over active listening but if you tell a person they don't understand more than twice they tend to take it personally and you're absolutely right that I don't like unnecessary conflict. If we NTs don't like unnecessary small talk, an argument over something that is emotional rather than logical is the worst thing ever. Not to mention that I am sensitive about what people think about me especially if I care about them.   

&gt;The "why" it feels bad: you don't get to enjoy communication's function to connect people.    

Basically. That and I get anxiety about people not liking me. I consider all of the likely possibilities inherent in a given thing but for some reason I tend to ruminate on the worst one. I don't know why. Some have suggested Ne-Fe loops as the cause but I couldn't tell you for sure.Yikes. Misogynistic much?That's one decision that's going to be painful to unmake.You'd think an intuitive especially an Ne user would be dissuaded by the possibility that they may regret it in the future. All I know is I would never make a decision as permanent as that.I'd go for that over a tat because atleast you can change it. I'm not a fan of permanent decisions because I'll always have the nagging thought of what if not getting it was the better choice and by then it's too late.Get on his wrist.RIPNe users and bad decisions that can never be changed or escaped from are not a good combo.How is that hedonistic? I don't think getting a tattoo feels good. Impulsive sure but permanent things don't mix well with me. Mayhaps that's just a personal trait though.I'm just paranoid but I suppose you're right. Maybe that does make me responsible. \*shrugs\*

&gt;alot of Ne users are prone to just dismissing important things in their life in order to not be bored, so hedonistic isn't a far fetched quality 

Certainly though I think we can agree that they're the ones who haven't matured very much.Ti is less a tree and more like a graph.Si señor.That sounds pretty cool. You could work at the GSIA if you're so inclined and can obtain clearance! 

I did my undergraduate work in economics and philosophy and I'm doing my masters in CS. A career advisor once told me to cast a wide net. I think I might have taken that one a bit too far. Lol.Wow you're lucky. It took me almost 6 months to get my first job. And even that I really didn't like so I decided to go back to school for something I already did as a hobby anyway.

And I don't know if there's ever such a thing as too late! There used to be a video going around about all these great people who didn't achieve success until their 50s or later. 

Either that or I'm trying to delude myself into thinking that I'm alright despite feeling like I'm behind other people my age. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.I genuinely appreciate the encouragement, friend. 

I hope you have a good day and stay safe during the pandemic.And no actual ENTP would say something that stupid unless they're kids. 

And no kidding any college kid can tell you that irrational numbers cannot be represented fully precisely in an Arabic numeral system regardless of its radix but they are certainly finite.  Not to mention infinity and infinitesimals are notions not numbers and imprecise ones at that. I would imagine that's why calculus was reformulated in terms of limits which are more logically sound.But then how are you going to get 12 PhDs like your stereotype says? *GASP*Way to point out the obvious, wise guy.I've always seen type as more how you process information rather than what information you have an affinity for though I suppose the two are somewhat related. 

I've always liked math but lacked the discipline to study it on my own very much.Constant, except when the underlying objects become warped.INFJ is right though.Good to know. Can infinity ever be a number?It's both AFAIK. There seems to be a belief that INTPs like to go into higher education so they can turn their obsessions into a degree. 

As for how accurate it is, I couldn't tell you.Love is more like ce^x : though indefinite, integral to itself.I was the same way but put enough effort to make it through undergrad with okay grades. I'm now back in grad school after working for the U.S. Treasury Department for a while and am killing it with a perfect 4.0 GPA. 

The difference is, this time I'm paying for school with my own money and loans, and giving up the opportunity to earn money at the same time.

Work and the real world were like a slap in the face that woke me up real fast. Work taught me just how much harder than school I have to work just earn my keep. And at my old job they had a strict rule against working outside work hours but there's no way you'd make deadlines if you didn't. So it's not like even government jobs these days are as easy as they're stereotyped to be. That rule was broken by everyone. 

In any case my whole thought process about work ethic just changed after all that.I don't think we act stupid per se but if I have to divide my limited energy between paying attention to how my words and actions look to others and the things I'm trying to think about in my head, on my own. I'll choose the latter every time. That said I'm very conservative when it comes to taking risks socially. I don't know what that says about my Fe. If anyone else does than please enlighten me. 

I tried to explain all this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/fn3rlb/who_are_usually_the_most_extroverted_intoverts/flhcuez) but I can't say how much this corresponds to my type as a whole as opposed to being just my own individual experience. Hopefully it gives an idea of all this to anyone who gives a damn.&gt;Yes, in the hyperreal system. 

How does that work? Is that related to the Riemann sphere and complex infinity at all?

&gt;there was a mathematician in the mid 1900s who proved that infinitesimals are logically consistent (provided some rules are observed.)

I read about this somewhere and was quite impressed by it. I think I read that he was able to completely prove all of the theorems of calculus that we know today without the use of limits. I can't even imagine how you'd go about proving something like the mean value theorem, for example, without using limits. And I would be very interested in seeing how they reworked all of the definitions of key concepts to work without them. 

All of this makes me wonder if there are yet other formulations for calculus that can arrive at the same theorems and rules in more or less rigorous ways. 

Sorry for all the questions. I'm an interested computer scientist, not a mathematician.I see. I'll have to do some googling on the hyperreals when I have time.CertainlyOnly in Minkowski space-time. Relatively speaking, of course. ;)I'll get the popcorn.You know nothing, INFP.Lol but not where to put it...More like he didn't even know the event existed until his friend signed him up he just shrugged and went along with it.Me too. I feel like you guys are underappreciated.Get drunk, you're home.Klingon?This looks like a sporting event. No intuitives should be winning this.Nooooo. They're so cute and cuddly and that guy's low-key molesting her.You guys were the ones profiting from holding this event. You're the real winners.And ugly tracksuit apparently. Like ugh. Get a fashion sense, fake ENTP.Sure you will. With great purported intelligence comes great ego according to Uncle Ben.Not really. They're known to be world class slackers. You have Te to keep you focused. We xNTPs don't.Except that its not realistic. That would *actually* be ESTP.ESTP mistype detected.We don't get triggered, hon, we do the triggering.Definitely not sports unless that's the lineup for worst players.I really like them but you can't force them to open up to you. I really enjoy asking them questions to get them to consider further alternatives to their ideas and seeing how their minds just light up given the stimulation. 

They're Ni Doms without the ego and that's a truly great thing. 

I like how sensitive yet surprisingly rational they can be. And all the ones I know have a similar sense of humor to mine which is great.Hence the word purported above.INFJ 

Dictators too.Nah. That's not creative enough.Lol. That's funny. You know what? You're alright. 

Stupid is as stupid does and so long as you've got a good sense of humor you can fail upwards as far as you want! The sky's the limit, kiddo.Hard passIs a stereotype really a secret though?I'm sorry I don't speak it. I've failed as a Trekker.I don't know what to tell you. Every INFJ I know has atleast been willing to hear me out. They're famous for their door slam or for ghosting but Ive never known one to be really rigid about doing things right or wrong. 

I only suggested the mistype option because that sounds like my mother, an ISFJ.And when we're stuck on an idea we choose to die on every hill from here to Timbuktu. Until we develop some maturity, that is. And then we learn to choose our battles and realize that most people won't change their minds regardless of the validity of our reasoning and choose to put our mental resources towards more pragmatic ends. 

I assume they have their own stages of growth as well. Is it possible that the INFJs you know are just immature and they haven't learned to pick and choose when to doorslam?

The INFJ I'm closest to is older than me and she's like my wise old sage friend even though she's really just middle aged. Maybe that accounts for our difference in experience with them.Probably but if your players are intuitives you recruited the wrong athletes.The /s was already implied on that one, bud.More like definitely. Maybe it's a reality show called America Lacks Talent?For P/J:

I've always thought that J types see everything as a comparison. They believe there everything can be categorized as right and wrong or better and worse whereas we perceivers may think those types of things sometimes but are largely content with just accepting that things and exist and understanding them but we don't compulsively compare them to some self-developed standard.On this sub it's definitely true.RIPRIPShh the Reddit kids won't understand.More like XNTP. That's low key me. Phone interviews especially make me so nervous.They spelled parallel wrong and it killed me inside.At some you have to stop arguing with people who don't care about reason and would rather just accept their unreasoned biases and shoot them an Ok boomer. 

If they won't change their minds when faced with facts, they're not worth your time.Just Do It™You're both a sport and a superior being now?I would hire you but I don't have money rn. Do you offer zero interest financing?The MBTI circlejerk.Not any remotely mature ones. As a P type we don't care about comparisons and categorizing everything as good and bad or better and worse especially when there are no objective criteria upon which to make such judgements. The only purpose of those comparisons is to evoke emotional responses from people in the categories being compared. 

*Shrugs*AffirmativeNice try...Make that bread ENTJs... because the rest of us sure as hell won't.That moment when you like water but water doesn't like you...I agree with this.Yes. But atleast the cat pretends to care.The cat doesn't really care. He just pretends to so you'll feed him.Me too.More or less the same place, I suppose.I guess so.Asking for a student's reasoning makes sense for teenagers or adult students but asking kids this young to explain *why* something is true is pointless.Word problems in grade school math are pointless. And yet teachers wonder why kids think math is pointless.For the average person, I agree. But higher level math is also useful for solving all manner of real world problems but you have to build up the foundations to get there. And therein lies the problem. Kids develop a dislike for the subject before they can even do anything interesting with it.You're certainly right about that but I think that becomes important at a slightly older age than when you're teaching them basic arithmetic. But I may well be wrong. I'm not an educator.Pretty much. It's like they want you to say because it's stated in the problem.Preach dude.

&gt;zero emotions will have eyes of a shark and be selected out of the gene pool unless they’re Mark Zuckerberg.

Or psychopaths who can fake it really well.Wish I had all of those except I want a kitty not a puppy.Nah. I'm carrying my team on a long term grad school project right now and don't even know what sleep is anymore.Me too. And I'm not throwing away my GPA because I was grouped with significantly less competent people. 

It's a comp sci project with combined grad and undergrad teams. As a grad student it's easier for me to write most of the code than it is to have an undergrad do any major part of it and then have me spend twice the amount of time correcting (and often documenting) their work as I would if I just wrote it myself. 

I hate people who try to skate by on others' hard work in school and at work more than any other kind of people.It's a damned if I do, damned if I don't scenario. If I tell them to write code then I will eventually have to go over and spend a lot of time fixing and documenting their code. Probably more time than it would take me to just write higher quality code myself. If I tell them to wait for me to write all the code and just do QA and testing then they get almost a free ride since all they would be doing is kicking errors back to me anyway since they aren't knowledgeable enough to correct most errors that might crop up in my code. 

Basically it's a lopsided team because they put undergrads and masters students together and we inevitably end up carrying them.Thanks. I appreciate the encouragement!I prepared a list of functions that need to be written in the planning phase. I'm thinking of categorizing them as easy, intermediate, or hard to allow for exactly what you suggested. 

But it still irks me that reviewing their work often takes longer than redoing it. Perhaps that's meant to be part of the experience, I suppose.These are indeed low quality.?Pizza haters exist?Incorrect. I would choose them in such a way as to optimize fo balance after each removal. I've had too many things tip over in life not to.Something about the knights who say Ni ?Me too. *Hugs*This is also me when something awkward happens.If you have to choose between sane and not boring...sameI concur wholeheartedly with both of you.Do you want it to be?Sorry didn't mean to put you on the spot like that. ✌️Were it to become the norm it would no longer be insanity.This is true.Then what?RIP fun.Is it though? The logic behind it seems rather straightforward.NGL that's my goal.This is some next level bs. Let me grab my popcorn to watch the inevitable arguments.That the best bait you have to offer young grasshopper?Word.I'm in this picture and I don't like it.He's the GOAT.ENTP here with INFP best friend. We surprisingly don't fight much but that's just because we happen to have similar worldviews.Hmm, I see your point. Feelings don't always have rational explanations. I know mine certainly don't.What is this art style called?They already do. The impact of colonialism in some of these places is that they depict white people using their products to make them look higher quality. White worship is definitely a thing in some non-majority white countries.Yes. The exposure was due to colonialism and after being told for a long time that whites were superior many people just started to believe it. And international media including all high end films, TV shows, many books, and AAA video games all almost always featuring white protagonists have only further reinforced that idea since colonialism ended post World War 2. Without colonialism that type of deep seated racial superiority/inferiority complex wouldn't exist.

Colonialism made the modern world what it is. Ever wonder why all of the so called first world countries today just happen to be former colonial powers? 

Contrary to type stereotypes, I have no interest in arguing with anyone here. It's just food for thought.I don't argue with racists and their sympathizers like you and I sincerely hope no one else here wastes any more time or lost brain cells on you either.Well they won't fall into your lap. If you want to live those you have to actually try. But I'm a hypocrite for saying so, so I'll shut up now.I'm sorry to hear that buddy. If you're in school though at least you're surrounded by a large number of people your age which makes it easier to find someone you can vibe with.

As an adult it's much harder to make friends. I know that's probably not what you want to hear but regardless keep trying and remember with these things it's quality not quantity. 

And above all just be yourself and don't be unkind and you'll eventually find people you gravitate towards and vice versa.Maybe those types understand you in ways that others don't.Mario?&gt;INTJs are just outright night owls that can live without communication

So they're basically what I wish I could be? My sleep schedule is already fucked if that counts.Who says they can't be?I can't afford my medication. Can AstraZeneca send help?:(INTJ is my type's shadow so falling into that is a bad thing. 

&gt;Dont feel bad, we think every over-sized ego try-hard sucks.

You also needn't worry. I think everyone who proclaims themselves a genius who always sees the most efficient solution to everything because of a personality test is a pretentious fuck. 

Am I doing this right?&gt;Edit: also, we arent as edgy or black hearted as you are portraying.

I don't recall giving a portrayal of your type at all. I tend not to play the type stereotypes game. I don't believe in generalizing groups of people because it's a slippery slope to the ecological fallacy from there. 

And not to instigate anything and it could just be Poe's law at work but the way you write does come off as arrogant. Just want to make sure you're aware of that.Look who's projecting now.Maybe someone out there considers you a friend and you haven't realized it.I'm sorry to hear that.I'm glad you've adopted a positive attitude. I think many of us NTs for whatever reason tend to think happy or optimistic people are unintelligent and we thus subconsciously choose not let ourselves come off as such. I'm not sure how well that observation generalizes but I can definitely be like that and it's worth looking out for that. 

One thing you might have going for you is if you're quiet and analytical then that might make it easier for you to be a good active listener. That's not something that comes naturally to me but if it does to you then it could allow you to be what I think of as the understanding friend archetype. I don't know about others but I really appreciate people like that in my life and they're hard to come by.I don't think you're a sociopath. I also struggle with responding to others' emotional needs though I will admit that I want to. I think all NTs do since that might be something we have to learn whereas it might be more natural to others. 

My day is insane as usual. My sleep cycle is horrible. I have way too much work in the backlog and by the time I finish someone will cook up more for me. And on the whole I just feel tired and a bit lonely. It's been rough during the pandemic. I understand that all the measures were necessary but it has taken a toll on my mental health and that of many people.I agree. That's a good way of looking at it. It is important to reflect on how those people have changed you even when they're gone.I don't disagree. Schools can be an awkward place to socialize and they do result in toxic cliques but when you're no longer in them it's so hard to find random people to talk to other than on the web which is oftentimes arguably even more toxic.Just do drugs instead.Thanks, man. I appreciate that.More like 99% of humans.Just make it look like a suicide.I love this.I usually make up an excuse not to go. I'm sure it looks bad but I'd rather not go and just be a wallflower who feels bad about his inability to socialize with random strangers. 

Sometimes it sucks to be an extrovert.Thank you for saying that. It makes me feel a bit better.I have owned a lot, lost a lot, and re-found a lot of umbrellas in my short time on earth.The handheld version of a roof.Give me a bowl of macaroni and I'll do what you want for an hour. Final offer.I fail to see the problem.Correct.That sounds like a good time until 379 of them are yelling at you to do their chores and another 57 feel like you haven't been giving them enough attention lately.Not really. I don't expect them to do anything. I'll get to it all eventually. And I go to the gym enough to offset my love affair with Doritos. 

Typical woman move to assume I want them to do anything. 

(Obvious /s)It's like they say in those airplane safety videos, help yourself before helping others.It's not necessary, just expected and it would really nice if it wasn't. I like people who can skip the bullshit and talk about interesting stuff right away. There's nothing elitist about feeling that way and I'm sure many people agree.Exactly. People get put off when I don't want to participate in shit talking other people behind their backs especially at work. I don't care. I prefer not to participate in much less propagate that kind of social drama.He never left his house.Who cares? I haven't seen it before.Yeah but then you have to find an excuse to leave without making it awkward and it sucks.Normie: The weather's been nice lately huh?

Me: Yeah sure. Really warm and whatnot. 

Me in my head: Fuck the weather and fuck you!Hahahaha. Things I wish I could say.Teach me your ways.Thanks for the LPT. It's not that extreme but definitely useful...I do like me some strawberry milk...

\*Googles where to buy strawberry milk at midnight\*Nah, I hold grudges.
Hm honestly idk I might just be an introvert trying new things. I mean I'm not exactly a crazy out going type but yeah I probably am an extrovert huh...Not necessary. I can imagine myself spending time with others for like a whole week straight and would still be fine. Same with being alone for a whole week.So I'm definitely an Ne doms? I mean I can see that if I'm an extrovert then I wouldn't have Ti as my dominant function and so by process of elimination, it has to be Ne. Does it work like that?Ah I'm definitely an ENTP then ahaha I was just kinda trying to get better understanding of functions. Thanks for your help I appreciate it :)I don't think it's wrong to not be social cause last year me wasn't very social but I honestly didn't care. I did have friends  that I hangout with at school but I don't really talk to them outside of it (these are real friends btw so they weren't just people who I talk to at school). But now for compared to last year I've been going out more and I do very much enjoy it. I still enjoy being alone as well though so I might be kinda socially flexible. Overall I'm not faking being social cause it would still be fine if somehow I were to be stuck in last year  situation again. Thank you for this typing all out and it really made me think whether I am a fake or not. Which I'm not :)I've never had a real debate before but if I did I think I'd probably enjoy a 1 on 1 debate more than a group debate. This is because I think it would be a bit harder to get my point across in a group debate and so would be kinda annoying. Still, it would be more satisfactory to win a group debate rather than a 1-1 debate. I think I focus more on the external world rather than breaking things apart logically. I do often imagine myself being in a position that gives me the ability to change things  on a society level. My ideas do get really wild but I just do it for fun and maybe sort of a lilttle bit philosophical. I don't analyse things all the time so I'd say I spend more time coming up with ideas and what impact would it has if it was to be applied. So ENTP for me. Thanks :)I used to be a non-social person and so I thought i was an INTP but now I've been going out much more and so i think I might have been mistyped. 
Also what are the differences between Ne/Ti dominant  and Si/Fe inferiorUsually normal but can be high when excited about something.
Maybe every few hours if I just sit around and play games I do tend to walk a bit and play with my dog.
Only at night before I go to sleep it usually takes me 1-2 hour until I can actually fall asleep cause I keep thinking about stuffs.
It's pretty easy for me to get up in the morning so no problems on that.
I am usually calm so i would not describe myself as fidgety and not slow either.
Definitely erratic because sometimes I just say completely unrelated random stuffs and people would be like...what?I am not as socially confideny as most ENTPs seem to be. In another word, I'm not a chicks magnet, not yet anyway ;)I'll give this a try

EDIT: Q 9 and 10 and lil bit more

1. Yes I am. Take my word for it.
2. No, not necessary but English is my second language.
3. Normally I don't
4. Definitely messy
5. Depends who. If I have a bad impression of them then I tend to be stiff
6. I either don't speak at all or can't stop when I do speak. So I suppose the answer is no
7. I do have empathy :)
8. ugh hmmm....No. Except on my crushes of course
9. I don't mind both but if I have to, I'll take the quiet room
10.  I can tell if people are not being honest with me but aside from that, I'm not usually suspicious of others

I'll elaborate

- I do like going to (some) parties but not invited to many :(
- It is relatively easy for me to introduce myself to others and I am able to keep the conversation after the intro going

I can add more so you can identify whether I'm T or F but I'd prefer if you ask more questions instead because that's kind of the point of this. Yeah I mostly just wanna play assassins or the one that does the most damageVOE-C Debater. Figured. Well I like how they use animals in ludicrous costumes and gestures to represent each types.  you know that's not reasonBecause they're different. L was never 100% sure that Light is Kira but Near was really confident that Light was Kira even when he didn't have that much info.
It's been awhile since I've seen the show so I might be wrong here but the only reason Lelouch sacrifice himself was because of Nunnally.  Lelouch wanted Nunnally to be happy, not for the whole world to be saved. But to achieve that he realized he needs to save the world. 

ISFPs. Not just movies but everything I recommended to themThe answer to your question is that you're an INTJ. Still, being an INTJ doesn't mean that you're 100% the same as other INTJs. It just basically mean that the way you think is like them.

MBTI is really vague and doesn't explain a lot of the stuff human does and don't forget that it's just an unproven theory so don't take it too seriously. 
 r/leagueoflegends

i'm addictedHi guys I'm kinda new to this mbti thing and have been wondering what type I really am. I'm only 17 and so it's a bit hard for me to type myself as I can understand that my personality hasn't developed that much but I still wanna do this just out of curiosity. 

I wanna apologize in advance for my English as it is my second language.

I realize there are lots of post that I can read to figure out which type I am but I don't think I'll ever be satisfied reading someone else's post and typing it out myself as there will always be a spec of doubt in my mind.

So I've first heard about mbti like at the start of this year and took some online tests. All of the tests I've taken resulted me in being an INTP and so I read the INTP's description and could see that it is pretty accurate for me. I read more about mbti and found out about functions. I read what functions are and read INTP's fucntion just out of curiosity cause i gotta admit, this thing is pretty intriguing but I didn't get much into.

From middle school to the start of this year, I was a kid who would just stayed at home and played video games, I barely stepped foot outside apart from school and when I did, it was just to watch movies alone. I did have friends I played games with though and played basketball with them at lunch time so I wasn't a loner. With strangers I was quite shy especially toward girls :) and so that might have resulted in me being typed as an I instead of an E. 

But throughout this year/ my last year oh high school, I've realised that I changed a lot and might actually be an Extrovert. I've been going out way more before like with friends and been to a few parties that I enjoyed. I've made lots of new friends/acquaintances and actually started to talk to girls and made friends with them (finally got the balls). I do still enjoy being alone and play games like I used to but also enjoying going outside. So I retook the test and turned out to be ENTP.

Both ENTP and INTP descriptions fit me but I've read you can't be both ENTP and INTP. Assumed that this is true, I studied more about functions to figure my type out and this is the part where I struggle. 

From my understanding, most of the talks about Ti and Ne doms are that Ti doms percieve things/ideas from Ne and analyse what it is though talking to yourself and breaking it down, while Ne doms discover ideas all the time to either change the world (in a way) or just have fun with...I guess. As I am only 17, my only job is to study which can be really boring and so the type of ideas I have are just shenanigans. I would just come up with ways to annoy people and get a reaction out of them. Though when I am alone or sit quietly on a bus I usually think about lots of things like the society, or the world in general...I'm not sure how to explain this cause I can't really recall the content of it but yeah haha ^-^. Since I was a kid I've always wanted to change the world somehow cause it seems the world could be change for the better but I have't really thought about how I wanna change it. As of what I want to do, I'm going into criminology for uni next year and hopefully I can become something like a detective cause I've always been interested in solving puzzles, detectives shit in general and can very much imagine myself doing it. I also despite evil doers and so I just wanna clean the world up (edgy I know but I honestly do). &lt;---This might seem a bit unrelated but I think it might gives some of you an insight to what I'm like. 

As of inferior fucntions im quite sure I'm an Si inferior as i forget a lot of things and have horrible memories. For example in engineering, it takes a lot of effort for me to remember about ceramics and metal but trusses calculation comes pretty easy to me. I hate having a schedule and never follow them, and also absolutely hate it when people tell me what to do (rebellious :) ). My English teacher actually called me an anarchist once lol when I said I would not conform to society no matter what even if the whole world might hate me for it. It's just that I'd rather trust my own judgement than agreeing with the society's view about something when I have not look into it myself. It can be hard for me to focus on things that I'm not interested like when I read a long paragraph of wavelengths then none of it would register in my brain as I read through it. But when I'm interested, it'd only take me one go to understand something to a certain extent no matter how long it is. As for Fe, I can sympathies with other people but I don't tell people how i feel about things. I am a good listener (developed this "skill" when I started talking to girls) and can usually make comments that would make the conversation flows. I realize that I do feel lots of emotion like anger, sadness etc but I just don't really show it, accept when I'm happy, I smile a lot when I'm happy. Strange thing though, I remember when I finished the Withcer 3 and I just bursted into tears even though I got the best ending. For some reason I just cried, I didn't even know what I was feeling but I just cried. Also I once heard of an anime that make people cry and so I tested myself to see if I did cry or not. On the last episode, there were lots of feels throughout the anime but i never cried once until last 10 mins of the anime. It got real feely and I just started crying even though I didn't expect myself to. So idk my emotional can be real weird but most of the time i'd say its pretty normal.

I have considered INFP and ENFP as what I might be but nah, I definitely use Ti a lot in my everyday life even if it's just to figure out about stuff around me. I'm also an intuitive for sure cause I comes up with lots of ideas, even if they are silly and make smart-ass comments and can be really sarcastic sometimes. I also have an ESTP friend who 100% fits the description of ESTP. This guy legit just want ww3 to happen cause it would be fun, he said he wouldn't even cared if he died and he meant it. He also acts as if he was smart but he's not lol, he's an idiot ( I'm sorry if i offended any ESTP, its just that this guy is a simpleton, which I'm sure most of you aren't). I compared myself to him and 100% sure I can't be an ESTP cause we are so different in so many ways.

This leaves me with ENTP or INTP cause both can fits me pretty well. I've taken ennegram tests an im either a 5w6 or an 8w7. From description, I'm leaning towards 5w6 cause it fits me a bit more and I don't really trust people even though I like going out with them (make sense..?). In all my life I've always been somewhat of a shut in until at the start of this year. I've read that mbti is more like your nature rather than personality and just wanna know if I'm an ENTP or INTP out of curiosity.

I realize that all these paragraphs might not be the best way for you guys to type me with so if you want me to clarify/elaborate more about something then just ask me questions. I would appreciate any comments and I greatly respect any of you who read the whole thing.I'm sure some of you have played the game and I'd like to hear what you think

Jacob is an obvious ESTP. Rebellious, reckless, doesn't plan, doesn't really consider consequences of his actions and very heavy SE in general but can also be quick witted, good at thinking on his feet (Ti)

Evie is an INFJ(?). I'm not too sure on this one. She obviously prefer keeping conflict to the minimum(Fe), even politely refer to her enemies as *Mister...*. A quote of her from the wiki page said *For every mission, there is a right way and a wrong way. Barging thoughtlessly into combat is, more often than not, the latter.* This seems like Ni to me....but I'm not too sure
What do you think?What are things other people do that would make you smile?
I think this could be an interesting way to see how each type differs.
Her type is teenager.Entp girls usually can't stand F men.

For me is a no no. But love is irrational so..Enfp is the worst type i can think of.

(entp here)

Also i would hate to be esfp or esfj 

Brrrrr.. I shiver.All the enfps I know are like self-sabotaging Entps. The N provides to both of us great fertile minds but the F makes you come to all the wrong conclusions. Makes you loose sight of the big picture and focus on trifles. I see Enfp scattered all over the place in search of the "happiness", and that very search keeps them from committing in life and from being happy and content for real. They can't really find jobs, they lie to themselves and indulge themselves in idleness. Its just a big cake of emotions and head in the clouds that can easily hinder a person from a successful life. I just would never like to be like that. Im sure they are happy to be what they are so this thing won't mean much to you.
But my country is stuffed with enfp and to me they are just annoying self spoiled artsy brats, if i have only to name their worst parts.
That's the reason: overpopulation, uselessness.
Hope i wasnt too harsh for your F. I'm just talking about downsides. You surely have good things too.Thanks for your reply. I know good enfps, I just would never want to be them cause even if they are good they have downsides that I really rather avoid. It's very good that you are still studying. Its the only way an enfp can survive: force yourself to study something that will give you a job. Then you can think about all the unicorns and love stories and passing clouds and meaning of life. But please force yourself into a thing that will give you money.
My best friend's father is enfp. He is a doctor and his father forced him to study for ages but right now he is one of the most fuctional enfp i know. 
I told you, a lot of enfps here (italy). I know personally and well 12 of them and many others are acquintances.I know, I know. Still it doesnt sound like a cool person to be.
But I'm a T extremist so I'll never understand :)That's an amazing description! Thanks! Really! First time I read smt so understandable and accurate about Se.

Can you also explain Si users with this clearness and accuracy?
Mbti is the land of N users and its hard to find good descriptions for Ss, in my opinion.
Thanks again.

(entp here)I really understand, but the post is about who we don't wanna be. So that's why I said that it "doesnt sound cool". Meaning: i dont wanna be that :)
Enough now! You guys are filling my Enfp understanding bar! I need it for the other Enfps in my life today :D

Thanks for the opinions :)Ahaha thats so horribly arrogant. Fucking entps i hate us all XDSorry, silly question, but why i read "esfp" next to your name? Are u trolling Fs on their on sub? XDSeriously, try to explain Si now!Hi, entp and love to dance everywhere :)As long as the actual day to day job changes often enough so the entp doesnt lose interest. Otherwise, if its basically the same thing everyday, dont get entp: they'll start soon enough playing computer games and doing their own business. Worst thing is hard to notice cause they can always work faster than the proposed average that they usually show. Yeah it feel intj to me. But i'm not yet good at understanding types reading about people. (mostly cause.. Ya know.. Tldr... Ehehe)Like, everything. Quite normal down to earth resonable type.. Nothing weird about them.INDECISIVE IS PERFECT.Entp: CarelessAh.. Wasnt as brilliant as the first :/ 
Too bad! Thanks for trying :DI know :) thanks anyway, its just i only use reddit on my phone and very very rarely remember about it when im at the pc :)Entp girl got Intj.
I could have seen it coming. Anything IxTx would do for me but INTx is the best choice of partner.

Trivia: the worst is any ExFPyes girls entps are awesome! Choose us! Do it!They are just all over the place.. Waaaay too irrational for me. Can barely have a couple as friends.1 Entp - 100%

5 Atm i have an INTP

6 I have cats, they suffice. 

7 Yes. I'm moderate with it cause I've been a teenager and now im not.

8 Yes, only sometimes. I'm not particularly interested. I don't need any aid to have fun in my social nights.

9 Monthy Phyton for humor, recently Orange is the new Black for an excellent script and dialogues.

10) No, religion is just being delusional. I dont like lies. No santa claus, no god.

11) I feel ya :) 
Nah, he is humble, not full of himself, very selfless and doesnt like spotlights at all.I really dont normally like them :/
Brrr...I'm ready to do anything to reach the bottom of this mystery!! :D


So, we met in our early teens and we immediately liked each other. We lived in different regions so we couldnt have a relationship but we idealized each other for a long time untill we were old enough to move and be together (i was 22 i think). 

I decided to bend to the breaking point my need of adventure and crazyness to be a good partner and he got more patient with my messiness. He always idealized me as the princess to whom dedicate all his successes. 
He never wanted to get out of the house and he worked a lot at impossible times. He much rathered stay at home amd draw or watch tv. He's always been more than jelous but in such a way that any hint of unfaithfulness would just mean that i was no more an existing person in his life.
We loved each other a lot. A lot. That's how i could endure his personality and he could endure an entp.
(that proves that there are no real mbti matches imho).
He would drive me nuts with his heavy traditional manners and I would let the cat sit on the dining table (that made him mad)
But i admired with all my heart his samurainess, his steadiness of intent, his big heart, his seriousness and his art. 
And i think he loved my intelligence and quickness of wits.

I dont know how this will help you. I hope it does. :)No, and I know just a couple.. But they can irritate me very easily on first approach.
They have that aura... :(
But any NF is a bit like that for me.. What can I do..
If it can help, im entp and i love test (cause they make me.feel intelligent)
I found this hard and just tiring (a very new feeling) and i abandoned it.
Sorry :/Ehi, that's why I need help guys :)

He could be anything, even Enfj, cause "it is known" that we are very different and uncompatible personalities. 
We've been together a half lifetime but if we met today we would probably not understand and maybe even like each other!

So what do you think? Nevermind my bias, whats your opinion? :)No, he doesnt live the moment at all. That was a bad explenation. Its that he is *aware* of his surroundings due to his job. He pays attention to the reality around him. But, aside from the job where he.must be reactive, he is a slow thinker and evaluator (that makes me think introverted). 
He still jumps to gut conclusions that i dont understand, but that's another matter..

Its hard. I told you :(Yes. Surely F. :/
Isfj?No guys, my dad is istj and another kinda close friend. He is not Istj. I bet my pants on that. And I like my pants.No he is just impulsive with his judgements and acts on his scheme of principles.

I dont think he never made a logical decision in life XD

No, the planet where he comes from doesnt know logic and rationality at all.I personally think either isfj but he says they are described as too remissive to be him.
What do you think?IxTx.
Do you see yourself reading the infp description?
You seem a very pleasant person anyway, whatwver the result will be :)Very different vibe than any istj i've ever met. They are predictable, he is absolutely not.
He surprises me constantly in good and bad ways.
And i understand istjs, we get along easily. He is a mystery to me.still today.
No but.. It was literal: Estp HAVE a big dick. Like a proper one.
That's how you weponize them.

They could do anything with their dicks. 
Turn on tv, open jars, save small kids, vote righteously at the elections, stop illegal shark fishing..

They'd love it.If i wanna get laid i dont care about the type.. Do i? :)Trump is shit.Mmm.. Cmon that's a long shot.
Give me an example not involving estp.Ahahahah not ahaahHow did you score so far? That might help.Try to decide what you are *not*. Did you read those profiles anyway? Anything sounded about right? What is the thing the infj has that you dont think you have? And the others?How old are you?i think you should tell more about yourself, and maybe I am too lazy to ask all the questions written.
Also being 17 it's a bit hard to tell but not impossible, but there are many things that might unbalance any impression I'm having.
Try to speak about what's important to you. Are you a teamworker? Do you value harmony around  you? What irritates you?
Do you read instructions before building something you bought or do you try to guess? Do you value all the options before acting or do you just go for it?
Do you think you have your head in the clouds? Is it difficoult for you to change your mind?ISTP in my opinion. Def a Ti user, absolutely P.
Id say either a disfunctioning intj (stuck a bit in a bad loop) or a just teen infp. I strongly suggest you this link. Look to the section "how to know if somebody is NOT an.." and check both of these personalities.
http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/howtotellifsomeoneis
Too lazy to make a list. First thing that comes to mind is that you logically describe why you can change your perspective. You seem pretty flexible in all the cases presented and that is P material. You way to use logic seems.laid back and not bossy, so you dont seem in dire need of organizing the world around you cause you have order inside. Thats Ti.
Seems like a S user simply cause u wrote absolutely nothing that calls for N as far as i noticed.
Do you *really* see yourself in the xntj?Well its a generic thing. I know really well educated intjs that would be nice and round their angles to make people happy/content/easy. The thing is that Fi always cares more about "myself" and whats important to me and my principle. And when that clashes with the others intjs wont change just to please. They'll probably walk away or storm away. 
An infp on the other hand is more prone to understabd other points of view.Hello Reddit,


Since I discovered mbti I’ve always tried to type my ex-partner (my partner by that time) but never truly successfully. I’ve been thinking many times to ask the internet and now, even just to try this last card, I wanna try to summarize his very complicated personality to you. I know it’s a long wall of text but I can’t make it shorter so please bare with me.


He is 34, fyi. So it should be pretty settled.


First of all, he took the test many times and the results were more or less a lot of **ISFJ, ESFJ and a couple of times INFJ**.
The very fact that he types differently is part of his personality. **One thing is absolutely certain: he is an F.** If he could be *BOTH* Fi and Fe he would be. That’s how F he is.


So here’s my fist problem. Is hard for me to understand if he is using Fi or Fe.


He cares a lot about other people, he wants them to be happy and he is prone to sacrifice himself even for someone that he doesn’t know that well. At the same time he is full of opinions on the others based on his personal morality and he is super quick (i’d call him superficial) in establishing wether the person in front of him is worthy or not.  He acts on a **very very personal scale of values** and it seems to me that this scale too is easily changed accordingly on how he woke up that day. 


**Things he regards as virtuos**:* tradition, respect for the family, intelligence, creativity, discipline, culture. In girls he likes when they are not too emancipated (aka, slutty). In men he appreciates chivalry and honor. *



I think that all this regard for tradition would call for and Si user, but at the same time he seems to live pretty much here and now. 
**He is a security guard and his job is his vocation.** He is not just passionate about what he does, but he truly devotes body and soul in his mission. No matter the sacrifices. (In certain ways, he sacrificed our relationship too to be the best at his job).
Being in security he is really really skilled with his awareness. *He notices details of everyone, he remembers people’s faces, he’s always ready to act.*
Also, he studies and teaches martial arts. His favorite is Jeet Kune Do, which might be for N users, but the martial arts in general seem more a SJ thing. Are they?


**He’s probably 99% J**, he’s stubborn as hell and its very very hard to make him change his opinions.


I would have thought he was an introverted cause he really likes his time alone to draw comics and invent stories and play video games, and he almost never wanted to go out, but at the same time when we had somebody over or when he met new people he would open the river of chatting and would be super super chatty also about himself, pretty much ESTJ style.



He scored a couple of times INFJ and now *(being ffff stubborn)* he is convinced to be one (since he read the description on some internet meme and he finds it fitting). But -as much as i understand mbti is something we need to recognize once we read it- I’ve know this man for 16 years now and to me its not fitting at all.



Going with exclusion:



**So, why is he not ISFJ?**
He is not quiet, kindness doesn’t appear as his first feature (although he IS kind, in a very formal way). *He is almost impossibile to boss around*. He is always the boss when work is involved. He is not an easy soft personality. He’s all sharp corners and sometimes is very hard to make him see sense.



**Why not ESFJ?**
He’s not that outgoing, he’s not such a people’s person. He doesn’t care much (or at all) about what others think.
He the strongest sense of duty I’ve ever witnessed, but he’s not that practical. Actually, it feels like his F messes with his head pretty badly and makes him being all over the place. (but i’m a T, this things really escape me).



**Why not INFJ?**
Cause he, in my opinion, doesn’t understand much things that are not down to earth. But I don’t know about that. He is just too traditional to be INFJ, too conservative. He has a vivid fantasy but I’m not sure that means anything. If he sees himself in this one I start to doubt, but he really doesn’t vibe N to me. I don’t know.. 


**I finish saying, he is a mixture between a knight in shiny armor, a fierce guard dog, a samurai, a man in god’s hands, a very very charismatic work leader and a family and home lover.**


So, what the hell is he?

*Solve this puzzle, internet.*

ENTP
I've been pretty eclectic for several years, but lately I've been skittering around the Blues Rock genre as it has all the elements of music that I like-- intense sound, loud bass/drums, complex rhythms and melodies, lyrics that are volatile or puzzling-- music that keeps my attention, basically. 

My current fave artists are more eclectic than my general genre interests, but right now I like AWOLNATION, Hozier, Glass Animals, Hollywood Undead, Red Hot Chili Peppers... 

Even more random are current fave songs. I'm currently obsessed with [Glitter and Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GySIToHCPac), [Six Shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkFZn4oPMqE), [Clint Eastwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UclCCFNG9q4), and [Drink the Water.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXFK82TGh7c)Off the top of my head, my home would probably be a mesh of an industrial, repurposed building and a cozy Hobbit cottage. Warm, low lighting, lots of exposed brick, and fluffy shag rugs in front of roaring fireplaces. Functional but magnanimous at the same time. The general vibe is something between a Viking mead hall and Tony Stark's man cave. Lots of warm and neutral colors-- creams, browns, reds, and greys, primarily.

Regarding interior design, I'd have a cozy floor plan with the living room and attached kitchen/dining room in the center-front, and the bedroom, bath, and study areas forming a boxy semicircle behind them. (I like my entertaining spaces together.) This part of the house would be quite open, with wood floors and reddish brick walls and a huge fireplace (probably wood, since I'm a sucker for the classics) as a centerpiece. Coffee tables and nightstands and sofas everywhere. Very low overhead lights. In fact, most of the lighting would come from tall lamps placed basically everywhere, so you could light up your corner of the room as much or as little as you please, though I'd want the entire house to be pretty well lit. Something to strike a balance between a) my fear of the dark and b) my photosensitivity.

The bedroom(s) would be quite small, with enough room for a good-sized bed, a decent closet, and a desk, but little else. The bathroom would be the brightest room in the house, probably, with a mostly cream-and-red color palette. Large enough to lounge in during/after a nice bath.

I couldn't care less about the landscaping. In fact I'd prefer no lawn, since I'm allergic to most plants. Being close to the city and within reach of public transport would be nice, though. I want to be close to the action.

-ENTP (female)I think I just fell in love. Holy shit.I'm an ENTP and this is really interesting to me and I immediately want to map out my own decision trees.

You might be one of me, friend!I started wearing makeup probably around age 11 or 12, when I got one of those cheap Pixi brand eyeshadow palettes. Never wore it frequently and still don't (except for work and special occasions and times when I feel like I need to change my outward appearance.) I honestly have no idea what constitutes a 'full' face for me, but I think the longest I've taken to put makeup on is about a half hour for formal events. My favorite part is concealer-foundation, because 90% of the time it's all I need and it's really easy to spot-check. Least favorite is lips because I hate my lips being highly pigmented and it wears off when I eat anyway.

Lip color: as close to my skin tone as possible. I like the appearance of having pale lips. I don't know why.

Eyeshadow: neutral tones, preferably desaturated browns like the ones in my mini Naked palette. I don't contour unless I'm going for a more masculine look, but I do like giving myself a smoky eye. It's pretty easy and looks okay if/when it smudges.Exaggeration, telling fewer fish stories. (At least relegating them to the right situations!)

Also coming off as less confrontational/argumentative when I'm interjecting to add my opinion in a conversation. :p That one always bites me in the butt because I get so excited about discussion.A) As a rule, I feel that I form very few *strong* parasocial relationships. The only ones I can think of off the top of my head are with real persons (through YouTube, either livestreamers or political commentators) and with cartoon characters or my own original characters that I've made for creative projects. I am least interested in reality TV, magazines, and any other "shallow" media, and therefore am least likely to develop PSRs through those forms of media. I can't say I have many negative PSRs at all, so I'm not sure through what media I could form them. I suppose my parasocial "life" is mainly characterized by learning about people with whom I feel I would enjoy speaking in real life (as in the case of real persons) and to whom I feel I am very similar or whom I find deeply interesting (as with cartoon characters.)

B) With real persons, no, not beyond imagining how a conversation with them would go if I had the chance to meet them. With fictional characters, yes. I do draw fanart for aesthetic purposes, but mostly I imagine how said characters would act/react in/to certain situations unlikely to be explored in canon context. I love looking at possibilities, AUs (alternate universes), etc.

C) Not very much. I will talk about persons/characters with my friends if we already have a mutual interest in them, but very rarely do I foster a parasocial relationship because of the actions of my friends.

D) I definitely have an easier time being social with others as a result of shared parasocial relationships. I am a little socially awkward and have a tendency to infodump or ramble if I get excited about a topic, but things go much smoother if we're capable of having a back-and-forth about a person or character we're both interested in and knowlegable about. I interact with others online occasionally, mostly for the purpose of providing information that another person might not know or may want explanation of. 

E) When I was younger, I had far more parasocial than social relationships, since I had a lot of trouble interacting with others socially. As I grew up, though, I noticed that I used my PSRs to "break the ice" and make social relationships easier to come by. Nowadays, I believe that my focus on parasocial or social relationships depends on how much mental stimulation I feel capable of-- if I am feeling down or less confident, I retreat towards the stability of parasocial relationships. If I am more confident or energetic, I reach out towards the variety that social relationships provide. Overall, I see parasocial relationships as a "guilty pleasure" that I shouldn't indulge too often lest I become a hermit, and social relationships as the norm that I ought to strive for.

F) ENTP! =D No trouble at all~!

I see the 'guilty pleasure' as more of a negative thing once it strays into large doses. Growing up I've always had trouble making friends and would usually keep to myself, and the adults in my life have always tried to encourage me toward social relationships and away from parasocial ones, which although easier for me to maintain are less socially stimulating and less "normal" -- that is, I've noticed it's more socially acceptable to have many social relationships and few parasocial relationships than the other way around. 

I also feel as though fueling parasocial relationships creates an environment wherein I can explore and distill my own personality, and given that I already have a very strong, quirky, "weird" personality, I don't need it to be any more intense than it already is. :VI know that whenever I'm at a party I'm doing one of two things:

1) Joining conversations and waiting for the precisely perfect moment to strike with knowledge/advice on a topic I am well-versed in so everyone sees me as the witty, useful genius that I am.

2) Bartending. Alcohol or not, if someone has a couple of liquids lying around and a general idea of what they like, I will make a show of making the best damn drink they've ever tasted. I have like 10 weird/off-the-wall/D&amp;D-campaign-friendly drink recipes memorized off the top of my head. Ask me to make you a drink. I dare ya.Sometimes if I'm teaching someone else about a topic I know very well or if I'm "in the zone" working on something, I feel like my brain runs a little more smoothly and others will comment on how I just seemed to "know what I was doing." That's about as close to "smooth and cool" that I think I can get as an ENTP naturally. The rest I usually chalk up to being a decent actor and a person who is adaptable in most scenarios.

But yeah, no, you're right. I'm almost certain that we're all awkward lovable dorks.ESTPs and ESTJs are freaky, man. 

The Ps because they're usually very intense people-- I have a lot of trouble holding eye contact with them especially because it feels like peering into the core of the SUN and trying to hold a conversation with it. 

The Js because they just seem to KNOW. Everything they do. Every decision. They are so fucking CERTAIN. As someone who will feel actual physical pain when someone doesn't consider all their options, these people are torture... and the fact that they're usually RIGHT makes it even WORSE!!!'ENTP.

I've had a long journey too: 4 years, 2 therapists, one counselor, and next week a psychiatrist. :)

At first it was just general anxiety I went in for: I had panic attacks and anxiety attacks all the time, I had severe, embarrassing crying spells that made me paranoid about feeling any negative emotions, I had nightmares, I had a series of masks and an alternate persona, etc, etc. 

Then I came to college and the right person asked the right questions and we found out it wasn't just anxiety. It was PTSD from sexual, physical, and emotional trauma I had sustained throughout my preteen years. (I was still friends with the main perpetrator of this and I was not entirely innocent, so it never came up with the first counselor because of my own shame and belief that "everything is okay now!") 

Now we're digging deeper and finding a blossoming psychosis that might require medication. So next week I get to find out for sure what it is and what can be done.ENTP:
when people assume I'm lying, either because I change my mind all the time or because I'm still mulling over the situation and can't give a certain answer.

Yes, I know my favorite color was goldenrod yellow yesterday and now it's maroon. Maroon just looks better today.

No, I can't tell you FOR CERTAIN how I feel about the movie we just watched. Yes, I was paying attention. Kind of. I was thinking about how the color scheme would look with my pet webcomic project-- not that great, now that I think about it, but then again it's not HORRIBLE in this film-- and also considering who else could have played the main protagonist and whether or not I would have enjoyed ranch flavoring on my popcorn instead of white cheddar. I need time to mull it over. It was a thing that happened and I am neither awestruck nor traumatized. Shoosh. Let me think.Awesome.


1) ENTP

2) 3w4 (sexual variant)

3) I think I was doing some career-readiness testing in middle school and stumbled upon it. Found it infinitely interesting, and started using it to 
analyze my friendships and relationships with people.

4) 90% certain my mother is INTJ, and my dad is ENFP. They have a little trouble getting along.

5) INFJ

6) Well, I dated the INFJ for awhile, which went wonderfully. I've also been interested in an ISTP. I think the general theme is that I need introverts in my life who love to talk one-on-one.

7) I'm not quite as funny or socially graceful as the standard ENTP. I have the arguing thing down, sure, and I can command a group if I absolutely have to, but when it comes to relaxed group environments, I struggle. My sense of humor can be a little more sharp or morbid or esoteric than the average person's, so any jokes I make tend to fall short or come off as mean-spirited unless they're well-rehearsed inside jokes. I'm usually the person lurking around the outside of a conversation, waiting for the perfect opportunity to waltz in and impress people... which usually means I can go 20+ minutes without speaking. Which is torture.I've definitely learned that I am not obligated to be friends with people. It took a long time to swallow this lesson, given that I don't have a lot of close friends at this time in my life, but I'd rather have a few good friends than a few more friends that don't make me happy.


As a secondary lesson, I also learned that I prefer talking to people one-on-one, and that a small group of close friends is the best thing for me. I get way too easily distracted to keep up conversations with more than one person at a time. I think and fixate too much! I must be some kind of vodka-tequila elixir.

Or Everclear. Maybe Everclear.As far as I'm aware based on what other people have said, there's no correlation between personality type and what mental state they're most likely to be in, or which mental illness(es) they're most likely to contract. People have made connections between personality types and the mental illnesses they can *resemble* when they're stressed out, but that's about it.

Based on my own experiences, my mental state just takes my current function stack (NeTiFeSi) and tweaks it-- in my case most obviously, the connections that Ne makes can be completely nonsensical to the point where even *I* don't know what the connections are, and the models that Ti uses to process information can be heavily flawed or be nearly nonexistent in certain common contexts, i.e. socializing with others. But, then again, I think the same or similar can be said of everyone.

edit: should probably specify what my mental state is: PTSD and possible trauma-induced psychosis. currently seeing a therapist 3x/month and a psychiatrist for testing.I would probably begin plotting their death before the end of the first day.

I have never met an ISFJ that did not irritate me to the point of madness. (Sorry! :( )
Agreed; she's ISTP. Additionally, I have heard the Martian to be with an ESTP, not ENTP, character, though I can't back that up well as I'm taking the word of my ESTP friend who is really into the book, while I've only seen the movie. 
I have an INFP 9w8 friend and his small talk actually makes me laugh out loud every time. He has some way of being relatable yet brazen at the same time that leads people to "this guy is nice" to "what the fuck?"Not bad. I'm not sure if "internet troll" fits for ENTP though.According to socionics ENTPs have 4d Te - essentially meaning that ESTPs and ENTPs are as skilled with Te doms, ENTJ/ESTJ. The difference is that ENTPs undervalue Te for Ti.How old are you? I used to think that I got along better with Fi types. Dated an ISFP and ENFP. I still get along well with Fi types, there is just more mutual understanding between Fe types for me.&gt;I watched Pawn Sacrifice the other day and it takes everything in my power to not run out and buy a chess board, and go nuts learning chess strategy, join a club, play it online and trying to master the game, totally living and breathing it. Then I remind myself... dude you have to learn chemistry, not all of that other shit, and the only thing that reassures me is the thought that after the semester I could do all of these other things, or maybe I could slip things in between study if I work hard enough.

Sounds E:7 but also sounds like an Ne dom, tbh. Maybe you're overvaluing your Ti to think that you're a Te dom. 7w8s are huge realists, frankly. If you associate yourself with being pragmatic, you may have muddied your idea of Ti to think that you have Te.

A 7w8 Ne-Ti type is going to use logic to create their vision. Incredibly realist. ENTP 3s, 6s, 7w6 and 9w8 are the goofier ones, with 7w8 and 8w7 being the more serious "goal-seeking (whether that is experiences and indulgences or literal like career goals)" of ENTP. 

7w8 sp instinct is literally called the "head type 8" by some. If you have sp in your stacking at all then you will have some of these traits.This subreddit has somewhat of a sensor-typing bias since we've had such an intuitive bias, there are people that feel it needs to swing in the other direction.

I would look at the sidebar descriptions and see if you identify with inferior Fi or PoLR Fi. I would also look at PoLR Ni and Mobilizing Fe (these are on the sidebar descriptions, alternatively you can google "ESTJ dualizing Fi" and "ENTP PoLR Fi" as well as "ENTP Mobilizing Fe" and "ESTJ mobilizing Ne"

These will give you the little tidbits of knowledge that help distinguish between types. Sometimes looking at the lower order functions helps.

Generally, ESTJs do things by the book and what is accepted as a consensus for being accurate and effective. More realistic, generally more successful by traditional terms of success.

ENTPs would prefer to find a new way to do things, using their personal subjective logic for why it would work. Not unrealistic, but prefer to do things a different way, or its uninteresting to them. Has more of a penchant for being different, than being successful in traditional terms.

ESTJs have issues with the desire to bridge closeness in personal relationships. Sometimes, being too objective draws them from their feeling sector.

ENTPs have issues becoming scattered, they fall out of the real world and get too inside of their heads. Neglecting organization, where they placed things, forgetting crucial appointments or dates. They have a hard time not getting distracted by a highly potential new topic that has drawn their interest.

An ESTJ would call an ENTP unrealistic and unnecessary, an ENTP would call an ESTJ boring and uninterested in truly mixing things up. (because an ENTP wants to mix it up, everytime, an ESTJ finds this annoying and unnecessary)&gt;One of my old friends was an ESFJ. I liked her a lot, people used to say we were like a married couple, super positive, like we'd go and get marshmallows and hot chocolate and make the epic memes :D.

This is very interesting. Do you feel like you had activity relations or business relations with them?

**Activity**

&gt;Activation is a very common relationship for friendship. Activation is similar to duality in that each person provides those kinds of information that the other most expects, however, the emphasis is always somewhat different than subconsciously expected. Partners are able to provide each other with an abundance of useful information and assistance, but lead separate lives and make decisions based on criteria that don't seem too important to the other.

&gt;Activation partners who become close and discuss their goals and personal worldviews often are struck by how radically different they are, despite the relative ease and benefit of communication. As opposed to duals, who tend to strive for the same things but from differing, though compatible angles, activation partners' approaches to achieving their goals tend to be fundamentally incompatible, due largely to the difference in rationality and irrationality. This means that while activation partners can talk and share their common hobbies with ease, they tend to view each other as separate entities with separate lifestyles and plans. 

**Business Relations**


&gt;Business relations (also known as look-alike relations) are similar to identity and kindred in that partners have half their functions in common — in this case, all the even-numbered ones. This provides a certain commonality of methods and approaches and somewhat similar communication styles. Business partners rarely have serious problems understanding each other and don't need much time to get to know each other and find common ground (or define their differences). The psychological distance is naturally large enough that partners do not generally seek to know each other deeply. Rather, they are content to pal around with the other on a relatively superficial basis. A change in location or life circumstances is usually enough to interrupt the friendship.

&gt;Business partners usually don't see each other as serious threats or competitors. Their preferred spheres of influence, their basic attitudes and purposes — defined primarily through the leading function — are very different, diminishing potential competition. Furthermore, neither partner can easily stimulate the other's vulnerable function, meaning that partners can loosen up around each other. However, the fact that the first function of each corresponds to the third of the other can make time spent together feel like a challenge and an effort. Each becomes a bit more like the other and a bit less like his usual self. 


Which one do you think adds up more?As a 7w8 ENTP - I find other ENTPs and INTPs annoying if their ideas aren't rooted in practicality. I often also find them willdly speculative. If we can't realize this vision, whats the point? I mean, that being said, I love talking about things just to talk about it, but I still kind of have an end goal. I enjoy talking about radical ideas and systems as a way to change my reality and affect the way I live or do things.

For example, quantam mechanics, relatively useless study for the common person. But I disagree. Quantam mechanics shows that even our greatest scientists, have been wrong. We conceptualize reality to such an extent that our belief blinds us to other perspectives. I care about quantam mechanics because it shows us that reality is much different than we believe. I feel that having such fundamental consensuses about reality affect us personally as people. That is how quantam mechanics is applicable to me. Well, I did read a book connecting quantam theory with buddhism so I may be biased. ([Mutual causality](http://www.amazon.com/Mutual-Causality-Buddhism-General-Systems/dp/0791406377), if you're interested)

Space travel? Worm holes? I don't give a fuck about that really. Unless you can connect these to a broader talk about human consciousness and an affect that can have on me or society. Don't care. I could learn about it, sure. But I'm not going to learn in depth to the extent that I could explain it to someone else.

That's where a 7w8s pragmatism comes into play. A 7w8 not only wants to dream, they want to realize their dreams, while a 7w6 or E6 ENTP is going to be more content staying within their heads moreso. A 7w8 wants to see it happen.Meh. There is a core group of people that have this sentiment.

&gt;are like 10x as likely to be sensors as intuitive types?

That doesn't mean they're 10x a likely to visit a subreddit to talk about personality types. It's a topic that applies to all people, but trust me, ESFJs and ISFJs aren't about getting obsessive over things like this. N types generally are moreso.

Look, I think there should be NO typing bias, people should take each individual as a special snowflake and type them that way. We have *no* proof, that S types are 10x more likely, nor do we have proof that they are just as likely as N types to get on a forum to talk about typology. Additionally, there's going to be people that just see a little personality profile and say "cool" and never read about it again, whereas its potentially more likely (not saying this is true) for N types to try to discern the hidden meaning behind all of this. 

When people referred to sensor bias, they generally meant the negative portrayals of sensors. This is due to, some extent, a higher majority of N types thinking they're so cool and dignifying sensors as basic, because of all things, they may not be interested in typology as an N type. Therefore, basic. The anti-sensor bias goes more towards portrayal of them, rather than typing people as intuitives, although I don't suggest the latter has also happened.

This is an issue thats happening, *right now* as the culture of this subreddit, amongst some users. They tend to jump towards S as the common answer because they're "10x more likely" I think this is a faulty assumption, and its better to assume everyone as type neutral, rather than looking at every typing thread and thinking (ok let me take into account that its 10x more likely for a person to be a sensor) if we look at things like that, we're going to get mistypings.

(btw im not the one downvoting u, i respect ur opinionz)

I would look into type 6w7 enneagram, and see what's up with that. 6s have the hardest time typing themselves besides 9 from the enneagram. If you're a 6, it would make sense you could mistype as a 3. Since you seem to look at these things in depth, it's generally unlikely for a 7 to type as a 3. 

I'd be looking at ESTJ 6w7 and 7w6 and see how that fits with you.Calling me an Se type is such a joke. I have no physical presence, whatsoever.

[This is me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f21jt17eUBQ) "What I actually have to fight them?"[Another example of my lack of Se](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4lacc9/drake_esfj_or_enfj/d3m6ogq) With /u/thiswontdo describing dancing styles. That is me, how I dance, right there. It's embarassing.I'm just calling the bias where I see it. I'm letting him know if he's talking about between ENTP and ESTJ here are some resources for him to look at it.

People tend to have great arguments for why someone is a certain type, but often times the people typing allow their own biases and perceptions to get muddied into their typing of others. None of us are unbiased when we type someone. The best we can do is give them the resources to understand what the types they are deciding between are. We can then point out fallacies or inaccuracies between possible perceptions they may have had of types (for example, someone deciding between an INTJ and ENTP needs to look at things a bit more) then we can help them get a better understanding of there type.

It's of my view - short of knowing someone or meeting someone in person, there is little to mediocre evidence for suggesting someone is of a certain typed simply based on internet discussion. To a certain extent, we are trusting the random person on the internet doing the typing based on the perceptions on their text. Everyone can read their own selves better than other people can. Most people here, that are experienced in typing themselves, self-typed themselves. I bet we could have many users that are sure of their type create threads opening their typing up to discussion, and tons of people would be suggesting off the wall types based on certain things. Doesn't mean those people are right.

We've had multiple people here such as Vixen (can't remember full username) who have recently been typed as sensors when they're not. Turns out that person is seeming to be pretty set on being an INTP that overestimated their social ability.

All I'm saying is, #1 there is no evidence that sensors are more common on /r/mbti or more likely to post typing threads. and #2 we tend to overestimate our own ability to type other people.

Typing needs to be a communication between the typer and typee, so that the typer is giving relevant information to the typee to aid their own introspection. What we don't need, is people being deterministic of telling people they are of a certain type, muddying the confusion, getting into arguments over people's different perceptions of type. Finding their type is important for the person being TYPED whereas us who are more knowledgeable tend to use it as an exercise to test our prowess, which is in some sense, a biased notion.

&gt; I said we shouldn't be surprised that dignifying sensors with basic intelligence, personality and deeper interests would turn out into a lot of sensor typing results. 

Agreed

&gt; I, and most people I know, type by calling it how they see it. In this case, I at least think ESTJ fits great so I don't see a reason to say otherwise.

That's fine, I just don't think that our perceptions are the best resource for typing someone else. There needs to be a line of communication, rather than typing on the limited amount of information that is given.Yeah, I don't use Se. I know plenty of other ESTPs, we have typical business relations as Ne and Se world views essentially conflict. ESTPs don't understand my point of view, and I don't really agree with theirs. Se types generally rely on their physical actions to create an end result. I tend to rely on inspiring others, getting people to buy into my vision, and connecting and cultivating others interest to buy into my vision. (Although, I generally speak of it as if it's their *potential* vision, disregarding the fact that my inspiration is also a self-serving endeavor for my own ends.) I inspire others through novel ideas and by describing the inherent potentials of materialization of certain goals (that many believe they didn't even have, but I convince them it is *possible* they could achieve this long term vision)

But as a 8 wing for Enneagram, it ads a more "realist" flavor to you, even if you're an Ne type. So, generally I'm attracted to Ne perceptions that are more *realistic* rather than just chatter. I can sure as hell bet you than an ESTP calls my "realistic" visions as chatter though. Just because it seems real to me, doesn't mean it would be valuable to an Se type at all. In fact, ESTPs are the hardest type for me to inspire or mobilize. They tend to get their own in different ways that make more sense to them, its relatively useless for me to describe vision to them, likewise with ESFPs (though an ESFP may benefit more from the logical side rather than intuitive side).

Also, 8s and 8 wings have a more "physical" energy to them. It's kind of hard to explain, they just have more of a "precense" to them. My father is an INTJ 8, and despite not being an Se dom, he has a groundedness to him. As you learn more about enneagram and discover types among friends and acquaintances, you'll see what I mean. I don't mean this in a condescending way but really, you'll see what I mean. Eventually 8s become hard to miss. Enneagram can be easier to type than MBTI eventually for multiple reasons, one being that there is only 9 types. (Though if you tried to type based on central type, wing, and instinctual subtype, you'd have a harder time)Yeah, this is meant as satire. Acornzyall is an ISTP.ISTPs tend to have a sharp ability at being painfully accurate. Especially in regards to MBTI. Actually tend to be some of the best at discerning types through social cues and expressions, IMO.ESFP was "stick around long enough, itll happen"Yeah I mean, it's pretty good rationale tbh. If you lived near me and we could hangout in person I'm certain I'd be able to figure out your E type, but that's probably pretty unlikely. 

Have you bought any books and read them in depth?

Maitri and Beatrice Chestnut are my favorite, as good as enneagraminstitute is they don't get everything 100%.LOL. This is great. Thank you.Which do you identify more of these choices?

&gt;The individual longs for situations where people are having fun, laughing and joking, and feel emotionally free and spontaneous. However, he is generally unable to produce this atmosphere himself and uses other means to create situations where there is a good chance that others will take the emotional initiative and create a fun and emotionally stimulating atmosphere. Failure at such attempts are met with dismay, which the individual either hides or reacts to with frustration and annoyance.

&gt;and 


&gt;The individual does not normally pay attention to the nuances of interpersonal relationships; he is either overly suspicious or overly assuming of his relations with others when they are not clearly defined. More importance is given to these relations as they pertain to objective mutual benefit; entertaining one another and accomplishing mutual goals are seen as the main focus, rather than seeing the relationships as rewarding in and of themselves. The individual does not expect others to be actively aware or concerned with his own personal sentiments, and so sees little reason to be concerned with those of others, unless they have direct consequences for the individual. Statements by other persons reflecting their inner feelings are not fully registered by the individual if not accompanied by external emotional expression or actions. Suggestions that the individual may have acted unethically in the eyes of another person who has not clearly expressed disapproval are met with bafflement by the individual; those that are expressed without tact are either dismissed or reacted to aggressively. Expressions of deep personal sentiments are awkward for the individual, whether coming from another or himself. He does not see it as his "right" to place the burden of his true emotions on another, both because he knows how uncomfortable those of others make him (even when they are positive and genuine), and because of his own awkwardness in expressing them.


**OR**

&gt;The individual is very adept at perceiving, establishing, and maintaining personal bonds between people. However, these bonds are often perceived as being situational and flexible rather than static. The individual is inclined to focus on establishing personal bonds with other people in the context of realizing or following perceptions from his base function. The person easily creates a sense of closeness and kinship between people by expressing like and acceptance, but these sentiments are situational rather than an expression of permanent feelings. If the person's mood or external situation changes, he or she may "turn off" the feelings instantly, even forgetting whom they had created the feeling of kinship with.

&gt;and

&gt;The individual appreciates situations where people are enjoying a positive emotional atmosphere as in having fun and joking together, and is quite adept at creating them himself, but does not see creating or promoting them a top priority, nor does he actively look for people who maintain or need such an atmosphere; too high a focus on that is seen by the individual as overdone.Check out ESTP and ENTP then. The first one describes feeling functions for an EXTP and the second one describes feeling function for an EXFPIf you explain why we can give you a better answer. And why the second one isn't correct. Explain "to what extent" the first one applies, and the second one does not. That being said, ENTP was my gut instinct from your description, this is taking into account if you are ONLY an ENFP or ENTP. I would also consider other types.Just highlight certain parts of the description that you agree or disagree with. Talk about how that part agrees or disagrees with your life. I'm not going to hold your hand here. By giving specifics people can get insight into your cognitive processes. Seeing how you react to statements is often times better than how you would directly describe yourself.That's not really an accurate description. Type 7 enneagram has the highest priority for "adventures"(however enneagram doesn't really describe it this way) - it just so happens that Ne and Se doms tend to coorelate the most with type 7.Honestly, reading their post seemed to point more to immaturity, rather than judging or perceiving. There are many people that are closed-minded, it isn't exclusive to Je doms. I think this person is just very convinced that they are an ENXP so they don't want any other perspective besides discerning between those types. It's an immature perspective, but does this determinedly decide that this person is a Je type. I doubt it. But this person should certainly be open to other types because nothing of what he says truly sounds "textbook" for any time, in general.You were going to need to put more into this if you want to better help from people to be honest. Isn't much to go off ofSounds like EXFJ I'm going to agree with fuccfas. Leaning towards Si but some things in your post seem potentially like tertiary Se.

Do you identify with Si PoLR or Ni PoLR or neither?

Si PoLR-

&gt;Individuals who possess introverted sensing as a PoLR function tend to be negligent of its effect and have the view that Si aspects are of less importance than others for achieving their goals. They put a low priority on the physical, short-distance, here-and-now in relation to longer-distance and longer-term considerations. A typical manifestation of Vulnerable Si is high need for activity and change, inability to feel the "heaviness" of one's internal physical state as well as surrounding world, poor capacity to relax and take it slowly, a lack of concern for one's comfort and relaxation, as well as aesthetic details, since a greater focus is given on the opinion that, in the longer term, taking care of this is a never-ending and pointless exercise. Weak sensing also manifests as a relative lack of awareness of the immediate makeup of surroundings, as in noticing and remembering locations of objects, even if you don't have to deal with them, and denoting their characteristics granted their internal physical qualities. A lack of concern for small aesthetic details is more visible in the ENTJ; in the case of the ENFJ, the low focus on Si is more noticeable as a dislike for performing low-level upkeep activities and practical chores, which are set aside in favor of activities of informational and immaterial nature (reading, writing, debating, theoretical discussions, browsing the net, etc.) Due to individuals who possess introverted sensing as a 4th function believing that Si aspects are of less importance, they tend to be thrown off course by neglected and newly emergent 

Or Ni PoLR

&gt;
The individual prefers to focus on immediate tasks, taking things as they come, rather than try to foresee present trends. Usually such individuals have an inclination to tell stories or narrate events on a sequential basis with all the pertinent detail, rather than compounding the information and relaying the main point. He perceives time in an undifferentiated manner: the past, present, and future are all perceived as being in or near the present. When talking about the future, especially one's longer-term plan), the individual treats it as if it were accessible today and often is not aware of all the developments that must happen first. He generally has a poor sense of how long things will take and what the best amount of time to spend on things is. Therefore it is difficult for him to stay on schedule without some planning.

To what extent does each apply to you? Or does neither? You seem like an Fe dominant but this should narrow things down further. I'm going to lean towards ESFJ but you're going to have to read about introverted intuition and introverted sensing and see which is more identifiable to you.

Do you consider yourself an Fe type?

&gt;The individual is always in tune to the unifying and harmonizing aspects in the constant flow of reality that he perceives surrounding him, and responds to these sensitively, spontaneously and directly. He seeks out and creates activities where people are totally invested and engaged in what they are doing, as well as concepts and ideals that will allow people to feel united in their values and purpose. Something's value for him is directly tied to how much coactive zeal it inspires. He is highly proactive about steering the flow of events into the direction he himself considers ideal. He may, for example, try to lighten a tense atmosphere with jokes and optimistic statements, as happens in case of ESE, or, conversely, get people to be serious and concentrated if they are too carefree during a crisis situation or try to instill a sense of purpose if they are too demotivated as happens in case of EIE. Nevertheless, he believes in full investment, for him there are no half-measures.&gt; INFJ: the psuedo-spiritual, internet demagogue and elitist who vomits various "absolute truths" at the drop of the hat, and usually has only his jarring conviction to back up such conclusions. Typically very reclusive, angsty and nihilistic about the state of humanity.

yup, I know one of these.Not necessarily if they're not given the right material, but if guided correctly, yes. I think personal introspection will yield a more correct result. The best method would be a "teacher, suggester role" and a "student/introspector role" if the style is of "guru-typer" you end up with higher biases on the teacher due to confirmation bias. The teacher should be open to learn more because the types may display in many different ways (however body language is greater indication of type than text/talk style IMO). I am highly skeptical of anyone who suggests that someone is a type "just because" I find that view somewhat arrogant as we are all capable of mistakes. We should always be open to reasonings by other individuals that isn't deterministic. We would get better at typing that way.

In person is the best method, because intertype relations is taken into play, intertype relations isn't really usable through text or voice communication as body language is a huge factor and even a webcam talk can't really capture the dynamics of an in person conversation. But even an in person typing should be met with scrutiny and introspection from the type to see if it's consistent or we run into the same guru issue.

I think anyone who wants to become truly better at typing needs to study enneagram(and socionics) in depth so they can type others on that system. Inconsistencies between MBTI types can be seen by different enneagrams. Additionally, correlations can help confirm and suggest types for MBTI or enneagram. Being able to discern functional uses versus enneagram motivations can help you become more clear in identifying functions instead of accidentally identifying enneagram motivations as functional orders. 

I think we should have more modesty in general. There are hella users that are experienced with typology, potentially far more than you or I, that choose not to post because of the redundant nature of the forums (typing threads and rehashing old content) which doesn't provide any value for an experienced user. This is why I always applaud users such as /u/whatineversaid, /u/jermofo, /u/blueottersocks, /u/entr0pic08 and there's a ton more I'm missing such as those describing VI and typing via . When you get to your dancing styles post you'll be providing something of 10/10 quality to it. If we foster discussion like that, archive notable posts, attract people to post good content we can potentially reach a point of critical mass such that we decipher unknown understandings of typology. Connections between Big5, MBTI, Socionics, enneagram. 

Look me and you may not necessarily need these resources since we can examine MBTI as an everyday reality to people and interactions, however it's like the NBA NFL. Players get better and better and there's more of them because we foster an infrastructure that allows people to get really good. I say we make the next genius a typology enthusiast and foster the benefits in time.I don't disagree with anything you've said. I just wanted to highlight the strategies of the different types. ESTJs are more practical, ENTPs err on the side of unreasonable for the sake of it. In person its actually quite difficult to confuse the two. It's pretty real. However most people reject it because of its spiritual nature which rubs secular people the wrong way. It actually has a good connection with neuroscience and has high test retest reliability (something MBTI does not). Shit send me your PayPal or whatever and id buy one of the books for you that's how confident I am in enneagram. Yoga studios and partying abroad like in hostel situations. self-describing themselves as "wanderlust" *trollface* 

ON a serious note, you should change your question to "how to spot an ENFJ"Donald dump isn't FFG if that's what you were thinking thoughSounds like you're a 6 based off this haha. This is a pretty 6ish response. The relations to "sins" is just connecting enneagram with archetypes throughout history. It shows how enneagram archetypes have been discussed in different words such as, 7 deadly sins, the illyad, Dante's inferno, etc.Read up about group think on Wikipedia, also on confirmation bias. Read my whole comment history. Please find some sense of "proof" of my glaringly ESFJ attributes. I'd love to hear it. Activation mistypes are common enough so I don't blame y'all too much. The only reason I even entertained your chat is because I thought it was funny and I respected a few of you enough to take your considerations seriously. Also a video doesn't really encompass full on body language interactions it mostly helps you determine "do they have Fe or Fi." Typing in person is far better because it represents dynamic interactions which is much more complex. And no you guys asked me two questions and then FFG started yelling at me like he was trying to fight me, telling me to prove I'm an ENTP, and I left. I'm not going to get on an internet fight with him that would be embarrassing to my soul. I've known I'm an ENTP for a while but I actually considered ESFJ and analyzed deeply because I'm open-minded like that. It's just not accurate. You find that the more you learn the more uncertain you become of things. Often times, those who are more confident are less knowledgeable and experienced because they haven't challenged their views (FFG won't even attempt to learn anything about enneagram or socionics and leaves chat immediately when it comes up from what I've heard) sound like a smart guy to you? He's a fucking charlatan. He makes alternative accounts telling people to kill themselves and enjoys himself with "typism" calling INFPs cry babies. Sound like a well adjusted intellectual to you? It's a facade dude. Enneagram is truly a psychological application to archetypal concepts. Religion used to turn me off in general I was raised in a Methodist Church and was quickly atheist however in my 20s learning about Buddhism, Jesus(not Christianity), and Sufism has done a lot for my perspective of the world. The separation of science and epistemology is a recent phenomena that caters to the pharmaceutical industry that wishes they could cure every ailment through medication. Pre-modern era intermixed epistemology and science. 

Enneagram is what made me more open to religion because of the truth of its fundamental concepts. I wrote it off as hocus pocus when I came across it at age 17. The reason less people are interested in it compared to mbti in my view is that it's nature fundamentally challenges our view of reality. It's scary. People don't like their Rock solid foundation being challenged, especially those who have generally rejected religious study due to its modern associations. I consider myself a spiritual atheist rather than just atheist since my studies in college leaned towards philosophy of different cultures around the world.  

However to really make any sense of this it requires an in-depth look. I re read my first enneagram book like 9 times and gained new understandings each time.There is a prominent user on /r/enneagram that has done some significant studies on enneagram and neuroscience. There's a lot more to it. Enneagram is essentially epistemological psychology. If you're a 6w7 or 7w6 you'd share traits with both types btwHowever an 8 might get others to gang up on him, brought upon by a 6 that sees that they're gaining too much power ;) sometimes being too strong can be a weakness. I give the edge for completing challenges to the ESXP though.I see the Te here. Doesn't seem like a feeler dom or auxilary based on the style of writing. I don't think he has inferior Fe though based off this. I'm getting more of an ISTJ 1w9 or 1w2 vibe. Seems a little too idealistic for a Te dom in terms of writing pattern.

However, his big5 test does't necessarily line up with this. He has a strong N bias which - but in favor of perfectionism, and "duty" persay. He originally tested as an INFP, and nothing he says is *anti* INFP.

I'd take a look at INFP 9w1 also based off this. I've known plenty of incredibly studious INFP 9w1s with banking as well as energy industry jobs. However, nothing in this post suggests he's a 3, and 9s typically test high for 3 traits depending on values. (It's hard to see how you really are, versus how you actually act for an Enneagramtest in relation to 9s) - Since his friends view him as an ENFP - (in relation to social chameleonness) this would suggest that he has a tendency for the abstract and "dreamworld" so to speak. Which is Ne and Fi related in general. It's assumed that you might be more like "yourself" when around friends than adults or parents.

I'd take a look at INFP 9w1 (and even 9w8) as well as ISTJ 1w9. I'd specifically google these types as well as Enneagram styles. I'd take also this short [enneagram test](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test-2.php) again. Enneagram tests are notoriously innacurate for 6s, and 9s specifically. They tend to embody more types than others (they're also at the centre of each Enneagram triad) I like this test because it allows you to negate answers you don't have a preference for by selecting the middle option. Options which are "clearly" you, you can rate as "higher" than options that you're unsure about. The results give you some top types and I reccommend reading www.enneagraminstitute.com's profiles to see what you think of the top 3 results. (I tend to score high for 3, 7, and 8, for example, so it took me a while to figure out the right one)

Definitely seems like [Delta Quadra](http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/quadras/Delta) (be warned, this is a socionics link, things aren't as consistent with MBTI here. ISTp stands for ISTJ and INFj stands for INFP in socionics)

Do you identify at all with Delta Quadra?
Interesting. Thanks for the informative reply.

This sounds to me more like ENFP 3w4 then. Your strike of abstract nature connects with a 4 wing. If you don't identify with 9 at all and are sure at that, you're probably not a 9. It can be hard to identify specifically simply off text.

Tell me what you think of the [ENFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2ebm4s/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_enfp/) functional descriptions (another socionics link) as well as the [INFP](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2c2yug/socionicsmbti_description_by_functions_infp/)

Take a close look at the leading function, inferior function, and vulnerable function. If those don't hit somewhere close to home for you then you may not be that type. Despite sharing same functions as INFP and ENFP they tend to be quite different because of the difference in leading functions. 

If you can identify strongly with the type 3 Enneagram, its probably more likely that you're an ENFP than an INFP. However, I wouldn't say a type 3 INFP is impossible. Let me know what you think.

Also, if neither of those are fitting take a look at the [ISTJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2rzahe/istj_socionics_mbti_description_by_functions/?sort=new) and [ESTJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2ro2fe/estj_socionics_mbti_descriptions_by_functions/) socionics functional descriptions. Since you seem to be in Delta quadra, these are also potentialities. I think ISTJ would be more likely since you seem to be hesitant in being a Te dom, but it's worth checking out.I think that if you identify with Te as a dominant function - you're most likely an ESTJ. If you don't identify with Ne as a dominant function as much, you're probably not an ENFP. Type 3w4 is also a common type for ESTJ. 

What is your Big 5 letter score in the 5 letters?

Do you identify with [SLOEN](http://similarminds.com/global5/sloen.html) or [SCOEN](http://similarminds.com/global5/scoen.html) or neither?The correlations help with typings to see if something is off. People don't have to do it but it can be helpful with finding people's types. INFPs tend to be 4s and 9s, and ENTJ tends to be 3s and 8s. For example.There's like 3 of those. Just search subreddits for MBTI. No one subscribes to them and no one posts there. They all end up posting here anyway. If we made a sticky thread it would remove a lot of clutter. Typing threads don't annoy me but it does annoy a lot of people.MBTI can essentially be broken down into big 5 so it's useful(although big5 is not nearly as interesting as mbti)

An enneagram test results would still be useful, giving top3 results for types. However some people already know their enneagram type already, it wouldn't be a requirement to post it, but it helps anyone who wants help typing. It's not helpful to you but it doesn't mean it wouldn't be helpful to others. Like I said, it's not a requirement, merely a suggestion for people to add it if they are familiar with the other typology systems.Yeah but what if someone wants to type themselves outside of the 3 day period. Bet they make a separate thread anyway. A sticky thread allows for people who have typing skillz to see it all in one thread and take them down one by one essentially. Makes for a good archive as well.One sticky thread isn't clutter vs 9 typing posts. Most popular and quality subreddits have them.Each comment thread is its own thread within the post. The issue is typing threads being too personal makes people afraid to make a thread typing them. When 80% typing posts is what's on the subreddits (and half barely give enough information for a good typing) then we need to rethink how we're doing things. A stickied thread once a week would reach probably 100 comments which is quite succinct actually. If the post becomes so popular we could do biweekly typing. Half of typing threads are just one paragraph and waste people's time. If someone can't put in the time to fill out a while typing questionnaire they don't deserve to be helped. 

Another issue is some people have minor typing questions that they don't feel warrant a thread and this would allow those people to postI'm not saying people couldn't make their own thread if they wanted. This is a pretty live and let live sub Not a bad point. Why not both?It's never been done here, we won't know until we tryI don't think of it as a solution but rather a way for those who don't prefer their own thread to use. Whenever peppermint made her own threads they seemed to be pretty popular.It's a guideline not a rule. It's now so we don't get people who provide too little information. We can't *force* anyone to do anythingEssentially /thread. Good breakdown. ENTPs and ESTPs can have some really awkward loud excited emotional states. (Awkward because sometimes it doesn't fit the mood if they had just walked in for example or can't tell if things are slightly somber)The issue is duality isn't a concrete reason for a good relationship. It just means you generally have no communication mishaps whatsoever which can be extremely beneficial in a long term relationship. However, duals tend to hangout in different places in society and you are less likely to come across your dual than other types. Additionally, enneagram compatibility is also important. If your enneagrams don't match up but you're duals you won't expect things to workout great. Also, your dual may tend to have different life values and goals. It's really a tricky process but dual relations are incredibly fulfilling and tend to get stronger over time rather than other relations that tend to deteriorate without active work by both partners.If you're looking for personal development you're better off focusing on your enneagram type. /r/enneagram has helpful users if you have specific enneagram questions. 

I think  Beatrice chestnuts book as well as maitri's book on enneagram give the best information for personal development. They're both available on Amazon digitally and physically. Enneagram institute is also not a bad resource.Beautiful answer. Saving this post

What's your E type?I think type 8 ENTPs are more likely than type 3 ENTPs. I have however only me 1 type 3 ENTP and he was a bit more ~smooth~ 8s and 7s tend to be aggressively independent, whereas 3s push their energy towards what is "productive." 7s and 8s don't really care how they come across to people, whereas a type 3 ENTP would be more likely to fit into the high achiever academic social circle. I think that 7/8 ENTPs come across as less "cute" than a 3 would.

That being said I could've been completely wrong, maybe there *are no* 3 ENTPs. I would highly doubt this though. I just think its less likely. ENTJs are far more likely to be 3s and 8s and as quasi-identicals (in socionics) they tend to have similar qualities despite being totally different. I already have come across a few mistyped ENTJs that were 3s and 8s.Because some types are more likely to conform to general societies version of "success" traditionally, ESTJ, ENTJ, ESFJ, and ENFJ and to some extent ISTJ/INTJ are going to have the most ease of transition into "let me make money and be successful" type of lifestyle. I say this is mostly due to a Te and Fe orientation.

Regardless, there are plenty of ENTPs/INTPs that have a "successful career" but you're probably right in the sense that it's not the goal for all of them in comparison with other types. The statistics i've seen have ISFJ/ISFP/INFP/ENTP/INTP making the least amount of money yearly, with ENTJ the top with ENFJ=ESFJ=ESTJ being equal right behind.

You also need to take into account that in general the middle class in the USA is shrinking where the majority of people are lower middle class. So, in general, you're going to see more people of all types in the lower classes of society as our society becomes more and more inequal. Most wealth goes to the top 1% because they own the capital in forms of land, financial capital, and connections. 

The middle class comes out of college 40k-80k in student debt and can't find a job that pays more than 40-50k a year so people are getting pretty fucked. Even people who go to top tier state universities are having to settle for jobs with less pay, less benefits than their parents.&gt;Selling bullshit isn't fun, but it's the most profitable thing out there.

What do you mean by this? I feel the same way. I don't like getting drunk. Once I push past 3-4 drinks I feel drunk-depressed. Tipsy is a fine spot. This is the same for me, funnily enough. I enjoyed the feeling when I first started drinking and it was a novelty (age 18 in college) but after that the novelty wore off, and I really dislike being drunk.

The feeling for me is, my mind is slow and clogged, and I feel kind of depressed/sad and just want to go to bed or be alone. Being drunk doesn't make me more social past a certain point.Lol no he's not. It's funny that we have similar usernames. I thought he was me too ;DTe as PoLR

&gt;That is manifested as a skepticism and dislike for basing your beliefs, arguments, and actions on external sources of information. For instance, a ISFJ will rather trust the expertise of someone who seems to have hands-on experience, even if limited, than of someone who demonstrates to have read many books on the same subject. INFJs will base their opinions and views on their own personal insights and be, again, skeptical of "second-hand" factual information that contradicts it. "Don't trust everything you read" is a typical sneer of this function, especially when applied to sources of information otherwise seen as neutral and reliable, such as encyclopedias and handbooks. Another manifestation is a dislike for dealing with issues involving efficiency, productivity, and factual accuracy of statements made; statements are made according to input from other functions, not from double-checks against external facts which are seen as of lesser relevance to the issue at hand. Types with this function lack confidence in their ability to find relevant information in outside sources.That's what I thought when seeing his Vice interview. But, you can also see in that interview that he has serious issues with empathy.Being an Ne Dom E7 it's extremely easy for me to open up ISFJ and ISTJ 1s to do different activities or percieved new potentialities.

ISFJ and ISTJ seem more closed minded to non Ne types IMO. ENTP and ENFP should have much less trouble with the introverted sensor types (as long as they have reconcilable values and goals)Definitely. Se inferiors get along quite well with Se dominants. Similar type of thing. Read about duality and semi duality in socionics if you're interested more in these ideas[That's just your opinion man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c)&gt;My questions are two, one, one someone experiences what they might consider 'flawless communication' with another person, would that be a strong clue they're users of the exact same functions (sans different order) or would that be irrelevant? Is it possible for two people who use different sets of functions to experience zero communication mishaps? What about vice versa?

In general yes, you will only have "flawless communication" with people within your quadra (same valued functions). According to socionics, it would be atypical for types of different quadras to have 0 communication mishaps. That being said, that doesn't mean you won't have incredible relations with people of different quadras. Generally, quasi-identicals (like INTJ-INTP or ESTP-ESTJ) are able to communicate without stepping on each other's toes - as well as supervisor &amp; benefit relations being somewhat error free if they have similar values. Even then, it's nothing like communicating with someone within your quadra. Interacting within quadra *even if you disagree* is still psychologically comfortable, and it may seem heated from another's perspective, people within that quadra may feel *angry* or *upset* but psychologically comfortable, in a socionics sense. 

The issue with duals, such as an INTP-ESFJ like /u/lergerhs mentions is not that they have "communication errors" but simply that *just because someone is in your quadra doesn't mean you'll automatically be best friends or romantically attracted* in fact, generally dual relations (as described by socionics) do not occur in a straightforward manner in which both partners are immediately interested in each other romantically. The issue between duals and within quadra friendships is that despite psychological comfort, they may have completely different values. For example, an ESFJ if raised in a super-christian atmosphere, might be more likely to retain an element of at a later age. Their INTP counterpart, potentially rejected organized religion early due to Ti stripping down the logic (note I'm not making an argument for/against religion) - an INTP who is vehemently anti-organized religion will be immediately turned off by the church-oriented ESFJ. Generally, duals exist in completely different arenas. The ESFJ is frequented in service type organizations, whereas the INTP is smoking weed talking about Marx and Kant with other intuitive friends. So in modern society we actually get less of dual interaction than we would hope.

&gt;Two, would it be wise to use Socionics' countless articles on how different types and functions interact with each other and apply it on my relationships with other people I've managed to type?

Yes, and no. If you expect a certain type to act precisely as Socionics describes, you may be putting yourself in a self fulfilling prophecy. How socionics and MBTI is useful in real life is up to the extent at which you yourself can see. Many people like to use these ideas to give themselves a sense of superiority for why others may not understand them, or why they think someone else's opinion is invalid.

In my experience, Socionics/MBTI can serve as a tool to improve your relationships through allowing a few things:

- When relating to opposite quadras (Gamma-Alpha and Beta-Delta) you will have misunderstadings. You will experience moments in which you're both explaining your position, but neither of you can get through to each other. Take it in stride. It's ok that it's a different perspective for you and them. No reason to get frustrated about it.

- When speaking to an opposite judging function type (Ti-Fe vs Fi-Te) listen and respect their view as you might have something to learn from it. Don't argue that their perspective is invalid, try to find where their ideas can improve yours, or yours to theirs. If you have entirely different views and they are irreconcilable, there is sometimes little you can do other than avoid topics that create animosity.

- When motivating someone or trying to persuade someone, try to take the view of their dominant functions, and what would be appealing for them to hear. Don't expect a type to understand your perspective *as if you were them* - you're not them. Unless they're a good friend being truly explicit with your feelings may come across as brash to them. Talk to them as if they are themselves, not someone you wished they were.

- Realize that Ni types desire little just for talking about multiple potential ideas. They want true ideas that don't rely on fantasy. For Ne types, realize that they don't necessarily believe their bullshit, but it's a good exercise for them to sort out ideas that may or may not have validity. Sometimes, they may just be goofs and bring up other points to be a dick, they probably don't really think that, don't take the bait if it's going to make you upset.

- Realize that Fi types will lament to you. Generally they want you to understand them and support their feelings. Don't argue that their view is subjective - because to them that is irrelevant. 

- Realize that Ti types are slow to reach a hasty conclusion without multiple paths of evidence that are consistent. Giving them one explanation for something based on a few tidbits of consensus knowledge can easily be torn down if you are too aggressive of your opinion. For Te types, realize that despite logical consistency of your idea, it doesn't matter to them unless it has some practicality to it. 

When relating to PoLR - don't dwell on it. Don't try to make an INTJ or ISTJ pick themselves up and express themselves (they hate this). Don't try to make an ESTP or ENTP express their true inner sentiments about something (they don't really have them and this makes them feel like defective humans) 

INTP or INFP - don't encroach upon their space without giving a bit of fair warning. Don't pull practical jokes on them. Don't open the door to their room aggressively, don't make them feel bad about being lazy.

ENFP or ESFP - don't berate them for logical inconcistency, they don't care. They don't expect it to be logically consistent because that would take the human element out which is their purpose.

ISFJ or INFJ - don't berate them for "not getting" the fact that something is a widely held consensus based on studies, books, or knowledge. They don't trust them

ESFJ or ESTJ - don't be skeptical of their planned typical ideas, don't berate them for not clearly seeing your vision that is for the taking if they leave behind their methodical plan. They like the comfort of what they've already setup.

ISTP or ISFP - don't berate them as being closed minded about not seeing the inherent potential for something. They like potential that exists in the now, for them to do. They don't care to just talk about it

ENFJ or ENTJ - don't berate them for having bad lifestyle habits and bad maintenance of their living space. That shit just gets in the way of their mastermind plan. They will have their laundry everywhere and no sheets changed for a half year, they don't care.

By understanding the underlying perspectives for people's motives and feelings you can be more understanding as a person, and less inherently reactive. Instead of being offended by someone's position, you can reach a new understanding yourself by considering how one or others may think about a topic. 

Also, cherish your friendships within quadra. These have a likelihood for long-term friendships if you attempt to maintain them. Take advantage of the ease of communication. Don't let one type within your quadra serve as a representative of everyone of that type. Furthermore - seeing those of different values within quadras can help you understand things in a way that no other type can. An ESFJ/ISFJ can help bring about a more mature Fe in a ENTP/INTP as well as a more mature Ti for ISFJ/ESFJ. Cherish that. No other type will improve your understanding and strength of weaker functions than those within quadra.



&gt;When spending time with a group of all thinking type friends, say for instance online gaming, we can relax, let our guard down and just have fun. The ways in which thinkers talk to one other can seem cold, and even rude to feelers. Not too long ago on the entj sub, I made a comment to another thinker. A feeler spoke up to intervene. "This remark was very condescending!". But the recipient of my comment was perfectly fine with it. I held my tongue, but I wanted to say: THIS IS HOW WE SPEAK TO EACH OTHER!

Good point sir. I have not much else to say other than that. However I might say that thinkers IRL compared to online are more likely to offend each other. When it's regarding something like - playing a game (and not just talking in a social setting).

ps. you're a bitchENTJ and ENFJ imo.Also, for example: an INFP 9w8 is *far* different than an INFP 4w3. Most people in this subreddit have a lackluster understanding of MBTI and Socionics. MBTI types = Socionic types - they just order the functions differently... If you think you're a different type in each system (lets say ENTP MBTI and ENTj socionics) then you have a clear misunderstanding IMO. 

Jermofo breaks it down best I think:

&gt;Consider if you will that MBTI is a subjective attempt at classification based upon genotypical observation. Socionics is an objective attempt at classification based upon phenotypical observation. Neither is right or wrong, but without both you understand neither. This same type of relationship exists everywhere you choose to look. MBTI is motivation or intent, the core. Socionics is interaction or behavior, the expression.I like jermofo's opinion on the matter (he's a Ti type) so maybe this will help your understanding:

This same type of relationship exists everywhere you choose to look. MBTI is motivation or intent, the core. Socionics is interaction or behavior, the expression.You aren't really understanding the issue.

There is no "wide-held consensus" of "what is MBTI" in fact MBTI has evolved in the past 6-10 years through discussion on forums *and we have found out that keirsey, and typical MBTI ideas are inaccurate at best, and misleading at worst*

There is no MBTI canon. Socionics even has mutliple models that not everyone agrees on.

Everyone, in some form or another, has different definitions and ideas of what the functions mean or consist of. Some people use more socionic ideas that others. Some people only care for quadras and intertype relations from socionics, but prefer pure-jungian definitions (read: Pyschological Types).

You cannot get a "fully consistent" system of socionics or MBTI because these ideas are inherently mixed together in the way that the forum culture uses them. It's a study of the theory of consciousness. There is no wide-held consensus for MBTI vs Socionics in one "being better than the other" and most users have found to some extent that there is value in both MBTI, Socionics, as well as pure jungian definitions (not to mention Enneagram)&gt;And while we're at it, enneagram borders on the spiritual, and its archetypes have never seemed like good, realistic fits for people. It's outright soft.

In my view this means you just haven't taken a close enough look at it. Enneagram is in some part related to Jung's archetypes, in a different manner. Jung and Enneagram have similar origins which include esoteric knowledge from the greatest ancient philosophers. If "enneagram bordering on the spiritual" causes you distress, than Jungian theories should cause you distress. Before modern times philosophy, spirituality, and science were intertwined to the extent that they may be indistinguishable from each other. This is something that western science lacks to some extent 

&gt;My problem with socionics is that it relates to genetic facial features for visual typing which is bs.

This isn't actually accurate. People who are certain types tend to have similar facial expressions, over time, these facial expressions mold your face to have indentions in similar ways (and also, your resting face is related to type). That being said, I'm not a fan of pictural VI typing. It's not very accurate. However, socionic theory and typing via expressions and interactions is one of the best things you can learn from socionics. (To the extent that Jung-purists have co-opted socionic visual typing to relate to expression of Jung's functions)

&gt;It has the eight-functions model which expands descriptions past the relatable, and devalues the whole point of sorting people by which functions they use.

The 8 function model is representative of what makes socionics slightly different than MBTI. To quote Jermofo:

&gt; What Socionics is, is an extroverted approach aimed at describing how objects interact, these object are often people. It is also based upon the same Jungian source as MBTI, but also Kepinski's concept of information metabolism, as they fit very well together.

This is why the 8 functions are necessary, they have to include how everyone relates to these functions, whether they are a valued part of their "stack" or not.

&gt;If all our values and goals oppose, sharing the same language only makes us very effective affronts to each other. The MBTI model keeps the N/S, and that works much better in my experience.

MBTI language in forum context is a hodge podge of information that is not anywhere close to the original context of MBTI because many people find that Jung and Socionics (which is based off jung) give deeper insights than just a simple MBTI test which has limited description and definition of functions. The MBTI you know of has improved in the past decade due to forums and communication like the one here.

MBTI types and Socionics types are equally relatable. Your confusion of types being different in the systems may derive from your idea that thinking www.celebritytypes.com speaks for all MBTI or any one socionics site speaks for all socionics. Socionists disagree on types, just as MBTI people do. There is no "official page" where "everyone agrees" on what type people are. This is still very much a science of conciousness which has no firm conclusions really on anything.

ESFP MBTI = ESFp socionics

ISFP in MBTI (Fi-Se-Ni-Te)  = ISFj in Socionics (Fi-Se-Ni-Te as valued functions) (in socionics the j/p are flipped for introverts)

The fact of the matter is, people have disagreements on celebrities typings. There is no concrete way to "know for sure" someone's type except through interactions in person as well as having them confirm to you their type through introspection.

People disagree on typings within MBTI framework as well as Socionics framework. It's not that a type is "one type in MBTI" and a "different type in socionics" its just that people used either system to come up with a different type. People disagree on typings *all the time*

MBTI is simply a test, that tests for the types that Jung has described. Socionics is a system, that combines information metabolism with Jung's ideas of types. 

Going "back to MBTI" doesn't make any sense, because our forum-culture of MBTI includes many different concepts, that no one really agrees upon. MBTI does not have a "unified system" that "everyone agrees on"

If you want to know the origins of MBTI discussion/culture and origin of functional descriptions, you have to read *psychologcial types* by jung, at the very least. Since socionics is in part based on that book, there is far more similarities than you think. It's just a difficult topic to understand regardless of "MBTI" or "Socionics"basically everyone. almost no one here is a strict socionist. If they were, we would call them ignorant.............. just the way we would probably consider an MBTI purist somewhat ignorant.sx, sp, so. it's own typology that merges well with enneagram.&gt;fter a recent discussion with a redditor here, I nearly gave up on typology all together. I reviewed their arguments. Found some of my perceptions were clearly wrong and was faced with the choice of eliminating large portions of my model of typology. The portion that I called into question was the opposite of what they intended, and thus I've distanced myself from some key Jungian concepts. 

I'm curious, which key jungian concepts have you distanced yourself from?I'm essentially referring to [mutual causality in Buddhism](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=JXMqPJ-_eY0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=buddhism+mutual+causality&amp;ots=YVaE6Puv2z&amp;sig=3vAWnWzPTsP0EmJGKGgVYRlCZE0#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhism%20mutual%20causality&amp;f=false)

I think that quantam systems relate to these ideas, but I wouldn't call them "proof" of that. I may be misunderstanding however, it seems like the closest current link of typical western science to philosophy/consciousness.&gt;Basically, what quantum theory says is that fundamental particles are empty of inherent existence and exist in an undefined state of potentialities. They have no inherent existence from their own side and do not become 'real' until a mind interacts with them and gives them meaning. Whenever and wherever there is no mind there is no meaning and no reality. This is a similar conclusion to the Mahayana Buddhist teachings on sunyata.

Essentially, this. I don't claim this as the "truth" as people have different perspectives on the issue of quantum mechanics. But I find this view helpful or having potential.There are multiple interpretations of quantum mechanics. For any one of us to say that there is a definition of what quantum mechanics is is slightly foolhardy. [take the many-minds interpretation for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-minds_interpretation)

Look, I don't really want to get into a whole theoretical argument on *what* quantum mechanics *is* or *isn't* - I'm quite casual in my knowledge of it, and AFAIK you are an expert and I am completely ignorant. It's a hugely complex topic and I am only skimming the surface.

All I'm saying is that quantum mechanics proved that classical physics is not entirely foolproof. To some extent, there is an effect of "an observer" (whether that observer is "life" or not) which leads to the question - does physics exist without biology? Does our perspective create the universe or does the universe create our perspective? I'm not saying there is one answer one way or the other, just that our exploration of quantum mechanics is a way science is attempting to tackle that fundamental question. I think it's going more in the right direction, than before, when we viewed the universe as a completely caustic phenomena, to the extent that we believed if we could use perfect math to explain or predict the whole universe.

Translating this into typology and psychology terms - we tend to view the mind or consciousness as a deterministic function that could be modulated with math or empirical science (behaviorism) - whereas MBTI and Enneagram take the more "quantum" approach that is counterintuitive to empiricism.  #fuckkeirseyAlso ISTPs have Ni as mobilizing function as well.
I think to have a "perfect" test, you would need to have something that accounts for multiple variables and also gives a top 3 likely types that links to descriptions/functional descriptions to protect for the margin of error. The only way to get close to true types without having to display high potential types would be to do a multi-step test.

A fundamental issue with tests is that they are only as reliable as the person taking the test. The traditional MBTI test is *accurate enough* considering the fact that the person taking the test understands the questions and answers them in an honest manner rather than a answering for the person they wish they were. 

When first taking the test I got ENTJ which after some exploration I knew didn't truly fit. After taking another test and getting ENFP I identified much more with the type, but still felt something might be often. Realizing that ENFP and ENTP share dominant functions had me choosing between those types. As a tert Fe type I definitely felt that my feeling was better/more important but I knew it's strength was not what I wished it to be. 

For every person taking this test, there is somewhat of a struggle with their "idealized self" and their true self. So, the questions would need to be highly objective to a point, almost behavioral. It may be advantageous to use socionic functions in order to determine typing as they focus more on the 'outward expression' of the functions rather than the internal mechanisms of MBTI. 

I think that a system set up in this way yields promise:

1. First part of the test divides you into valued functions/potential quadras. Therefore, you would need extremely accurate wording for determine Ti/Te or Fi/Fe as well as Ni/Ne and Se/Si. You'd want a good amount of questions in order to get this done accurately.

2. 2nd part of test would want to confirm [quadra values](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra). Takes the top two possible quadras and pits them against each other based on the previous data.

If you can determine the quadra, you've essentially narrowed down them into 4 possible types. At this point, you can have more specific questions to identify potential types. I think when you come to intra-quadra types you can more easily type for PoLR function which should be a better identifying factor than t/f or n/s and i/e. For example, within the Alpha quadra INTPs have Se as a PoLR function, and ENTPs use Se in a form of social mimicry. ENTPs are going to respond far less to a question pointing out Se as a weakspot (due to their ability of social mimicry of Se) than INTPs who would more easily identify with that. ENTPs will identify with Fi as a PoLR function far more than INTPs who have a more respectable relationship with Fi in social mimicry. ISFJ will respond to Te as a vulnerable function, distrusting resources, books, "common knowledge" whereas an ENTP and INTP will not confuse themselves for Te PoLR at all. ESFJ as well, having Te as a role function use Te in a form of social mimicry, and shouldn't respond to Te PoLR but rather Ni PoLR.

It's a rather round-about way, but I think it would be far more accurate than the current tests. The only thing is it's not a simple test, and would require a fair bit of coding to do. If you're the person that can code this I'd be interested in working on it.ENTP/INFJ relationship is completely overhyped. Same with ENFP/INTJ. Socionics got much closer to the answer with duals. Ni and Ne as dominant functions may be good for some interesting talk, but will also clash as they have fundamental world view differences that are almost irreconcilable. Not that those relations couldn't work, they just lead to more "banter" than they do seemless integration like dual types.I'm going to go ahead and disagree with your initial premise here. Ni dominants in business, especially INTJs, attempt to solve problems before the come into existence. If a problem arises that the INTJ was not aware of, they would be pushed towards modifying their system so that problem never happens again. 

I don't think that Si-Ne isn't capable of what you are describing, however, I find that Ni dominants are frustrated with extraneous problems that mess with their conceptions of how things will develop. It means they didn't take something into account.

For example, an Ni dominant will attempt to pack everything for a trip, for all situations that they expect to encounter. If they have to buy something when they get there, they would consider that somewhat a failure. Ne dominants on the other hand see many potentialities for things they might need, but tend not to overpack as that removes the "mystery" they would like to maybe be surprised by something when they get there.

An Si type would not be frustrated at not packing something that they didn't expect to need. They would be frustrated at not packing something that they thought they didn't need, but ended up needing it.They are complete opposites but they have the same valued functions.

ENTJ and ISFP both value Ni-Se and Te-Fi. You do have a point in the "repression" factor, but types within quadras (such as ENTJ/INTJ and ISFP/ESFP) tend to have flawless communication due to the use of their similar valued functions.I'm talking literally about a "trip" like as if you were going to a foreign land. I don't think Ni types are "heavy packers"

&gt;INTJs like optimizing their systems, they like making them efficient and flawless, they don't want any flaws in their system. However, if you actually work with an INTJ you'll realize they don't start out considering what all could go wrong, they have this plan they want to realize and they want it flawless. They're "somewhat realistic dreamers", they don't really give a shit if it's far fetched if they perceive it as conceivable

Exactly, i like this description. But if their plan fails because of an unknown variable, I feel that causes them frustration, as if their plan should have accounted for that, and since it didn't, it wasn't as perfect as they thought.Lol, sorry but the quadrants in socionics  are not based on "function axis" at all. It's based on valued and unvalued functions.

Socionics takes very little from MBTI and is based more on Jung ENTJ is actually your supervisee, you are the supervisor as an ISTJ. Your dominant function Si covers for their vulnerable function Si. 

It definitely works different in an ENTJ and you're right about that. I was attempting to give an example of an Ni dominant perspective that - they tend to consider their plans 'fool-proof' in a sense. Hoping to build a vision that will not have issues, even if it is assumed that there will be some. I was referring to the original post that argues that this is a an Si-Ne perspective... But Si-Ne and Ni-Se may do a similar thing, but go about it differently. Si-Ne may seek out to solve 'problems before they begin' but their whole plan is not contingent on not having issues. An Ni perspective attempts to formulate a vision that will not even have problems in the first place.

This leads me to understanding /u/dolandump2016 point a bit better they are right in that this is somewhat inaccurate:

&gt;seek out opportunities to solve problems before they develop into something worse

It's not that they seek opportunities to solve problems before they develop into something worse, but more that they expect their vision to account for any potential issues in the first place.In person interactions are far superior to understanding or typing someone than textual interactions. There are various thematic ways that people write based on type, but we haven't really hit any form of understanding that is more than intuitive (which can be wrong) It would be cool to compile a post on various ways that people write as indicative of type, but people are still different in many ways that may push them to write a certain way. Anyone who posits themself as some type of 'infallible guru' of MBTI or Enneagram for that matter is doing a disservice to the people around them. I might believe an 'infallible guru' if they demonstrated their understanding of interactions in person, but textually it takes a different type of analysis that requires more significant thought IMO than in person interactions.

In person you can identify types quickly based on manners of expression as well as certain body language. [Talking styles from Enneagram](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/179-Enneagram-Talk-Styles-Essence-Passions-Fixations) can give you a quick link to Enneagram types (if you have studied them well in person as well as in theory) and Enneagram types tend to coorelate with MBTI types, and you can make better guesses based off of these things.

Ti types tend to write very precisely, trying to accurately depict what they are trying to say.

I've found that ENTP (Ne) types tend to use parenthesis often as little tangents. I overuse parenthesis and end up deleting them because I find that they may detract to the central idea I am trying to discuss, and even if it is understandable to me in that format, it might not be that way for others.

There's a lot more to this that could be expanded upon and worked on. IXTPs with Fe inferior are consistently frustrated with their inability to sympathize with others emotions and disregard cold Ti analysis. Also, are sometimes unaware with how exactly they're feeling, can be moody or grumpy because of this. If you're an Fe inferior there seems to be a strong feeling of "fuck, I really wish I could interact properly and with ease"

If dominant Fe types make you feel good, and at ease, and you admire those who can keep that up in comparison to yourself, that's kind of the feeling for an inferior Fe type. If you aren't as neurotic with your Fe, and comes more naturally, you're probably not an Fe inferior.&gt;Among other things, you'll learn that Jung actually viewed INTPs and INTJs as having the same four functions (Ti-Ni-Se-Fe vs. Ni-Ti-Fe-Se) — and was apparently torn between those two types when it came to typing himself.

This is your "fringe" jung interpretation.

Lets take a look at socionics because you do have a point here:

In socionics you have 'valued' functions 'unvalued' functions as well as 'strong functions' and 'weak functions.

Strong and Valued functions for INTP: Ti-Ne

Strong and Unvalued functions for INTP: Ni-Te

Weak and Valued functions for INTP: Si-Fe

Weak and Unvalued functions for INTP: Fi-Se

So you are getting somewhere, according to Socionics - INTJ and INTP are strong in the same functions and weak in the same functions, that is what creates [Quasi-Identical](http://www.socionics.com/rel/qid.htm) relations in socionics 

How ISFJ and INTP are similar is in their valued functions, which makes a huge difference. INTP and ISFJ get along almost seamlessly, compared to an INTJ/ISFJ

You have some good points here, but there is a reason that types can be grouped into quadrants based on valued functions.It's like how an Se type walks into the world and percieves all sensory data, how they can act upon it, what can be done with it, its physical qualities that enable it to x/y/z.

Ne walks into the world seeing abstract potential in everything. Rather than being ultra aware of their surroundings, they are ultra-unaware, residing mostly in a sphere of their own minds conception of reality. Seeing something physically may remind them of something related to another abstract idea, potentially giving it a use. But an Se type is going to be superior in thinking of the the physical use of a tool that solves a certain task that isn't 'x task' but a more specific version of that task. However the Ne type may see the tool and think: Here's a tool that does x task(thats tangentially related to the task the tool is supposed to be used for). I know someone that could benefit from this tool for y project. If they complete y project, that means that I could attend z where I could meet 'some' person who would be useful for another friend. If I introduce that person to this friend, they might be able to complete their unrelated vision. This is the issue with Ne in that it's all over the place, and depends on certain things happening the way you predict. This is entirely relying on the fact that the person in question truly needs "x task" done, as they may be searching for only a specific task to be done, but "x task" solved by "y tool" is somewhat related to the specific task, and may serve the same function as that specific task. It seeks novelty and unused potential or possibilities that can be explored further


Now what the hell is Ni? &gt; I think the confusion for me came up with interpreting "attempt" as conscious. I agree with all the parts where you've said that they consider or assume that their plan will be fool-proof. Not that a Ni-dom would say nothing bad could happen,**but someone like my ENTJ supervisor seems to assume that they got all the important stuff worked out, and that anything terrible happening is really unlikely given their understanding/perception of where things are and where they are headed.** So it seems pointless to consider. That helps me to understand what you were saying about them being put-off if a major problem happened, because on some level, they'd have had the sense that they knew what to expect and where things were headed. (And I have to admit, they can be really good at that side of things!)

Looks like you got yourself a grade-a ENTJ right there. Lol. I think we have contextualized the point well. I like your description of it, it's better than mine which used a weird travel analogy.Socionics is a development of Jung, quadras are unique to their reserach (which focuses on the interactions between types, more of a phenotypical observation of behavior, than internal structuring of the psyche). Jung got many things wrong, for example, assuming a functional stack of same valued functions between INTP and INTJ. 

You're right that Ti is the furthest away from Fe. But a Ti dominant values Fe because it is their weakest function, yet highly valued. Ti dominants, will be attracted to Fe dominants, and vice-versa. Ni dominants will be attracted to Se dominants, and vice-versa.Yes, INFPs and ESTJs are duals in Socionic terms, the ideal relations.

ENTP-ISFJ

INTP-ESFJ

ENFJ-ISTP

INTJ-ESFP

ENTJ-ISFP

etc. etc.

These are the ideal "relationship" or even "friendship" types according to Socionics, and in my experience of seeing relationships in person, dual relations are generally some of the most successful. They suffer no communication errors. They value the same functions. They cover each other's weakspots and vulnerable functions. 

I'm going to quote /u/jermofo because he has an already well crafted written response that I egged out of him earlier showing the issues of the traditional *psychological types* Jung stack:

&gt;The core of the issue is that Jung's concept of what we call the function stack totally contradicts our modern concept of it, whether you favor four or eight.  In various places Jung describes the function stack as for an INTP as Ti-Ni-Se-Fe, Ti-Ne-Se-Fe, or even that all of your functions are extroverted or introverted, with the first one being the most likely.  If the attitude of the auxiliary is same as the dominant, everything we know about modern typology collapses.  You could no longer compare an ENTP to an INTP on a functional level that would make any sense for example, because an ENTP would obviously be Ne-Te-Fi-Si as they would not share a single function.  Jung' functional stack in any interpretation cannot stand.  You either have to scrap it or who knows how much else. 

&gt;I see messing up the auxiliary as huge.  From that point you have to call into question his various ideas concerning introversion and extroversion to an extent that I am not qualified to do.  What I'm thinking is that Jung over-emphasized the importance of introversion and extroversion at the expense of the details adding up correctly, as Ni is prone to do sometimes.  Perhaps he put the cart before the horse here and instead, the general attitude of the psych is determined by the dominant function and not the other way around as is his theory.  This is the difference between Ni-Se perception and Ne-Si. For Ne-Si, the whole has to be the sum of its parts.  Sometimes bottom up and top down thinking get similar enough results and sometimes one or the other is the only way to go.  

&gt;Now that I've realized that Jung's ideas are inherently biased by the global perspective of Ni and not balanced enough by his Te at times, I have to look at everything going forward to see if it jives with my localized biased perception. The Transcendent Function is my next stop of doubt.  As a concept, like almost all of Jung's concepts that I've seen, has a lot of merit.  Again, I need to question the implementation of it.  I wont say too much about it other than it is used in order to arrive at changing of type and functional valuation.  Again, I think the ideal is held too high.  It is not necessary to consider the container as that which changes, but the contents.  I stumbled on an absolutely fascinating thread on 16types that explains the idea of the Transcendent Function that adds a corresponding Rescedent Function, as well as the idea of the Immanent Type as opposed to the Transcendent Type.  So here again, I'm not throwing away or discounting the ideas of Jung, but I think that a literal, absolutist reading of his work can get you into trouble.  Like any idea that is at least somewhat philosophical in nature, you need to take the idea and see in what way applies to reality, not the other way around.  

&gt;That is my current approach and not a final judgment by any means.  Wow, this was surprisingly insightful to helping me understand Ni.

Thanks I still like your description here. It's probably better than mine. 

Maybe this fits better: "They expect their vision to proceed despite potential issues arising"&gt;Hmm, wow, so all the struggles out there by INFPs with ESTJs were all illusions, and they were supposed to get along so well, with virtually no communication errors. So much confirmation bias that it's getting ridiculous here

Firstly, this is under the assumption that these INFP-ESTJ relations were in an 'adult' context (not a highschooler context which is often a large proportion of MBTI proponents, especially on PerC and typologycentral. Not that I think they are bad sources, they just have plenty of their own immaturity and bias as well as this subreddit.) and is also under the assumption that these people are not mistyped

Secondly, duality doesn't mean that all INFPs will get along with all ESTJs. In fact, duality is charatarized by the fact that it is hard to find your dual type in the wild, because dual types are likely to be in completely different social contexts. For example, the INTP who is out smoking weed and discussing Marx and Kant with their friends, while the ESFJ is more likely to be involved in a service organization. You should [research duality in the socionic context for yourself](http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Duality). I'm not going to feed you every little detail for yourself. Socionics has it's critics, in which I am one of, however there is much to draw from the eastern-bloc's information on psychological types, which encompass the same 16 types described by Jung and MBTI. (MBTI is a bit of a misnomer in itself, it simply is refering to the MBTI test and subsequent function stack created from the MBTI, in fact, socionics is far closer in my view to Jungian ideas than MBTI because it shows that INTPs for example, are strong in both Ti/Te and Ni/Ne, this is why INTJs and INTPs are quasi-identicals, and 'more similar types' (which I agree with) than an INTP and ISFJ or INTP and ESFJ.  

Duality has to do with psychological comfort, not conflict-free relationships.

&gt;All of the above — as well as numerous other descriptions of dual relations — assumes that partners have an unfeigned, deep interest in each other and genuinely fell in love. In many cases duals do not form romantic relationships because they are indifferent to each other or there are important differences between them that keep them from considering a relationship in the first place. Dual relations only imply a certain close psychological distance and ease of interaction. If partners are not compatible with each other in other ways, but form a relationship anyway, they will have unresolvable conflicts despite the psychological comfort. 

Additionally, you have to take into account life values, goals, enneagram type, instinctual stacking. There are so many factors. Duality just is describing the psychological comfort between those of similar valued functions. Additionally, the valued strong functions for the INFP are the valued weak functions for ESTJ and vice-versa. I've experienced duality myself with my ISFJ 1w9 sp/sx girlfriend of 2 years. I have 5 friends in relationships where I have examined duality in their relations: ISTP/ENFJ, an ESTP/INFJ an INTJ/ESFP and two ISTJ/ENFP. They are not problem free, and in 2 of those relations they had broken up. However, the psychological comfort between these types is readily apparent
.
&gt;In his quote where he talks about Ni-Se perception and Ne-Si (We’re discussing on issues related to this and I am currently waiting for him to come back on my reply),

I don't disagree with this at all, you misunderstand me. People too often think that the the "function axis" as a determiner of type, and you are right, a Ti dominant is repressing Fe, and an Fe dominant represses Ti. This is core to Jungian concepts.

&gt;this is based on a popular misconception in online MBTI forums (In fact such a notion is pretty much obsolete in two of the largest MBTI forums which are personalitycafe.com and typologycentral.com, but for some reason things are slow here in reddit). 

You assumed that I haven't examined and participated with personalitycafe and typologycentral in depth? I think that reddit is just a better aggregate of information and is less prone to cliques which have formed on those forums. Additionally, personalitycafe and typlogycental are just as prone - if not more - to groupthink and confirmation bias as Reddit. You barely have any grasp of socionic concepts, yet you seem to peddle that these forums are more 'intelligent' than others. That's a silly distinction. This forum and users *regularly* discuss many topics and question the 'status-quo' - just because a few users subscribe to more basic forms of typlogocial understanding (which you are right in pointing out, the axis distinction is kind of misunderstood). This is a study of consciousness in of itself, and thus definitions will be different depending on the type that is writing the definition.

&gt;I could go on to explain about this if you wanted. In the meantime, I suggest you think outside of the box, and try to break your confirmation bias.

You seem to think that I am attempting to argue with you for the sake of proving that 'my view' is more correct than yours. I think there is truth to both of what we are saying here, and I am open to hearing what other views you have to say. I have defended that there are important core components to what I am discussing, but in no way am I dismissing what you have to say at all. In fact, you have a very good point that is defended by socionic theory. An INTP and INTJ are far closer to some extents than an INTP and ISFJ. However, ISFJ and INTP share valued functions, and would display psychological comfort and similar quadra values. 
I mean fringe among the people discussing the 16types. Regardless of modern interpretation of MBTI, Socionics, 4 function model, 8 function model, not much of it is compatible in a systematic way with Jung's interpretation (indicative of his Ni view clouding his tertiary Ti)

If you want to subscribe to the strict Jungian interpretation of psychological types, you're going to find very few people within MBTI or Socionics to talk about. 

You can however reconcile these issues of Jung's ideas with Socionics and MBTI if you take the fact that Jung was describing archetypes more than he was describing a 'model'

I think extrapolating a model from Jung's works requires that some renditions to be made. If you take a very strict approach that discounts any further research that has been done, you're looking at an incomplete model, in my view.Overall an intruging and informative post. I do not disagree - an INTJ and INTP are much more similar to each other than an ISFJ and ESFP respectively. However, INTP-ISFJ share valued functions, and ESFP-INTJ share valued functions. Those are their similarities, they exist within the same quadra.

&gt;As another example of type dynamics leading to expectations that go beyond the Real MBTI Model, the function-centric perspective says that, comparing an INTJ and an INTP, the INTJs' N will generally play a greater role in their personality than their T and the INTPs' T will generally play a greater role than their N — because dom/aux! — and that notion, too, has no respectable validity. INTJs and INTPs both have N and T preferences, with all that those entail, and whether the N or the T plays a greater role in any NT's personality will basically depend on whether one of those two preferences is substantially stronger than the other — and the data suggests that the N preference is no more likely to be the stronger one for an INTJ than for an INTP.

This is taken into account by socionic perspectives in the 'subtypes' positing that an INTP or INTJ may favor their intuition or logic more.You're kind of mixing things up here. Harold Grant's functional stack is not the same as functional axis. That was popularized by celebritytypes (which is probably one of the worse sources)

&gt;If the Harold Grant functions model was correct, and if Fi/Te vs. Fe/Ti and Ni/Te vs. Ne/Ti corresponded to significant aspects of personality, there would now be a substantial body of data pools reflecting those aspects of personality (by way of the TJs and FPs being on the same side and so on). And there isn't any such body of data pools, and reckful is here to tell you that there never will be any such body of data pools.

They coorespond to the fact that INFP and ESTJ both value Fi, Ne, Si, and Te. However you are right that there would be difficulty in extrapolating data that says that INFP and ESTJ are in any way similar.

&gt;At this point, the aspect of the Harold Grant functions model that says that an INTJ has "tertiary Fi" (i.e., has MBTI-related aspects of personality that they share with INFPs, and that INFJs don't share with INFPs), and that an INFP has "tertiary Si" (i.e., has MBTI-related aspects of personality that they share with ISTJs, and that ISTPs don't share with ISTJs) is past the point of being able to respectably claim "not yet proven" status, and should really be considered disproven by anyone who likes to think of themselves as reality-oriented.

I don't necessarily disagree here. There is an underlying formation of types that is better than the Harold Grant model.

&gt;Well, OK, except that sometimes typological constructs only lack validity in the sense that there hasn't yet been enough data gathered to validate them, and they later get validated. But they've been gathering MBTI correlational data for over fifty years now, checking correlations of MBTI preferences with everything from occupational choices and satisfaction to scholastic activities and achievements to values to interests to scores on lots of other personality inventories to creativity to you name it.

Data based off of people that have been mistyped. That's *literally* the biggest criticism of MBTI is that tests are notoriously bad at typing people. So yeah, any fucking data derived from MBTI origins is literally tainted. You can't really make any assertion for disproving or proving a Harold Grant function stack with that data.

&gt;The notion that INFPs and ESTJs have MBTI-related aspects of personality in common onnaccounta they're both "Fi/Te types" and "Ne/Si types" is, not to put too fine a point on it, a steaming pile of horseshit.

In that manner of writing it you are correct. However I think that claiming that INFP/ESTJ both value Ne/Si/Fi/Te is completely accurate. I think you're focusing a little bit more on the actual psyche here, and I'm not in disagreement with your positions, however when taking into account type interactions in person it becomes evidently clear that Socionics has a clear and provable method for determining quadra values which is indicative of shared valued functions (or something else, which you may be on to something). In observing Gammas, Betas, Alphas, &amp; Deltas you can see clear psychological comfort due to their choice of functions being used.

There may be something deeper underlying that, but if you are suggesting that, for example, that a Si dom is not valued by an Ne dominant in their interactions, then we are in disagreement on that point.

As an ENTP you're highly likely to be a 7 -"

7s in time of relaxation catch on attributes like 5s, and tend to go towards reclusion, reading books or such. That could be why you have been less social lately.

7s are also least aware of their anxiety from the anxiety center (5-7-8), if you're a 7w8 you would also share traits with "anxiety" and "anger" centers.&gt;Do you claim that INTPs and INTJs do not share similar "values?"

Yes, but their strength in both Ti/Te will be similar. INTP will value Ti and may use Te to strengthen their valued Ti. INTJ will be fully capable of Ti and Te, but value the Te and using Ti to strengthen their valued Te.

You make a good point in what MBTI fails to grasp is that ESTPs and ISTJs will almost be equally adept at sensing, extroverted or introverted. What's different is that ISTJs value the Si orientation, whereas ESTP values the Se orientation.
 
&gt;So, Someone who prefers Ti will value Ti/Fe, but devalue Te/Fi? Would you claim that there can't be a person who prefers/values Ti/Te over Fi/Fe?

Yes, but with stipulations. There would not be a person who prefers and values both Ti and Te. To someone who prefers/values Ti, Te is something they are good at *but is used in a subservient position to Ti*

For their inferior functions, if that INTP values that function, they will be comforted and happy of input from Fe, despite being weak it it. For Fi they will also be weak, but will be made uncomfortable psychologically if excessive focus is put towards it.

This is my understanding, and is derived from *Psychological Types* as well as Socionics&gt;Why can't the preference level towards Te/Ti be something like 60:40 or 75:25? 

I don't see a reason it could not, but in the essence of understanding the 16 types, it is one of the most obvious and prominent factors of each type, is that their dominant function (whether Ti, Te, Ni, Ne, Si, Se) predicates on a sort of 'dismissive' attitude, towards the opposite attitude. Ti dominants tend to view Te information as 'a means towards an end' of solidifying a Ti view of the world. Te dominants tend to view Ti as a 'means to an end' in vetting Te's judgment of the world. 

&gt;But, as I have already emphasized more than once, introversion and extraversion are not characters at all,but mechanisms which can, as it were, be inserted or disconnected at will. Only from their habitual predominance do the corresponding characters develop.

I have no qualms with this definition

&gt;Hence, there can never occur a pure type in the sense that he is entirely possessed of the one mechanism with a complete atrophy of the other. A typical attitude always signifies the merely relative predominance of one mechanism.

Indeed, this is the very essence of the dominant function and inferior function.

&gt;There is, finally, a third group, and here it is hard to say whether the motivation comes chiefly from within or without. This group is the most numerous and includes the less differentiated normal man, who is considered normal either because he allows himself no excesses or because he has no need of them. The normal man is, by definition, influenced as much from within as from without. He constitutes the extensive middle group.

I have no issue with this because I don't feel that it necessarily disagrees with a functional stack. I think that in general there is variances to how that stack is implemented. If you consider enneagram for example, which involes extroverted, introverted, and ambiaverted types, you can see how an INTJ could have an external or internal motivation for example, but leading still with Ni. An INTJ 8 Enneagram will have a more external influence, whereas an INTJ 5 would be more internal, for example.

Btw I read the whole article by (starts with R, can't remember) and it has a very clear point. There isn't a real rhyme or reason for the traditional Harold Grant stack, but I don't think that the article has the argument that can necessarily deter me from finding a phenotypical and social accuracy that socionics presents. (which is quite different from the Harold Grant stack, IMO)

Enjoying this conversation with youI really like this argument here. There's always trouble identifying fictional characters. I can see why people would peg her as an ISTP because she *appears* calculating. But you have good examples of dominant Se and inferior Ni that I can't deny. But her facial caricature isn't blatantly obvious in the writing of her character. She's super cold which gives that impression. I really like this argument for XSFP. 

Off topic: didn't you used to type yourself as ESTJ?
This is almost the essence of the tertiary function. ESTPs and ENTPs tend to do an Fe act job that almost makes them appear as Fe dominants but they never are great at truly determining the feeling atmosphere, for example: an EXTP would walk into a room jovially and not notice that they were discussing someones death or something equally horrible. An Fe dominant or auxillary would more quickly pick up on the proper context for their emotional expression. 

They tend to speak to loudly and confidently in situations they shouldn't as well, will accidentally say something offensive.Sounds EXTP if you identify more with a Ne and not at all Se then you're probably an ENTPSorry guys the fun stopped happening when I sat down as mod;) I was the only one that was like fuck it custom flairAnd it's not like removing the ability to change your flair to a totally wrong type. I definitely liked letting people select whatever the fuck they want because its more akin to a 'signature' a la forum style. Cooler, IMO. The color scheme is ok. I mean I think it's cool, its just the issue that people might want to include their Enneagram and instinctual variants (or even big 5, or just something fancy to give them style)OverwhelmingTop quality post A++&gt; I try to get around that by being more open to new info but my sensation is still Si. Why would I need an ISTJ to give me more Si?

I'm not sure if that does the inferior function justice. ENFPs (and all dominant intuitives) are weakest in sensation in general, Si and Se. In fact, according to socionics ENFP and ENFP have a more fluid ability for Se than Si. However they value Si and repress it whereas with Se they do not value Se but attempt it's use for social mimicry. 

Se however is completely blocked when Ne is in action. When an Se user says hey, we can do this *right now* an Ne user might think, "what's the point when I have all these cooler ideas" ENTPs and ESTPs as well as ESFPs and ENFPs may tend to agree on a certain goal necessary, but disagreeing on the method to achieve it. 

However an Si dominants argument for pleasure, comfort, doing it the 'right way' may strike a chord in an Ne dominant as nitpicky but also soothes their repressed desire to feel comfortable, relaxed, and at ease, in an environment that escapes their control due to the immediacy of their mental world and limitless mental energy.

&gt; I use Si to justify my ideas, basically as a reference.

That's not really what Si is. Fi is probably the judging function you are thinking about. Fi justifies, Si doesn't. Often times Si is mistaken for what is really Fi in XNFPs. EXFP are constantly using Fi, quite adeptly, to justify their ideas. Si doesn't justify. [I recommend this post's ideas of Si to dispell common misconceptions of the function](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/38n7cu/si_as_ritual/)

As well as [/u/blueottersocks post on Sensation according to Jung](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4dsun7/jungs_si_abridged/)

&gt;With regards to the "relaxed and comfortable" part, maybe, like I said maybe for the developing person that would matter but for me it's just more of the same.

The very nature of an Ne dominant is that they are seemingly restless. Maintenance of their well-being, comfort, and overall orderliness is an afterthought. The dominance of Ne requires the less perceived importance of Si. In fact, dominant Ne individuals tend to be overly impressed with their handling of Si like maintenance, having an amount of pride in their ability to care for themselves, cook, clean, work out, yet it is meager in comparison to an Si adept individual (ISXJ) who would consider our attempts cute or childishly good in the "good try" kind of way. Just as Ne dominant users such as an ENXP will find an ISXJ's 'somewhat different' approach to universal logic(for ISFJ-ENTP) or emotional aesthetic (in terms of ISTJ-ENFP) and ideas as 'cute' but not deeply developed and will easily be able to build upon their views better than the Si type despite it originating from the ISXJ.

&gt;With regards to the "relaxed and comfortable" part, maybe, like I said maybe for the developing person that would matter but for me it's just more of the same.  

I think there is much more to the interaction between Ne and Si dominants that you are undercutting here. The superhero like ability of Ne users is generally impressive to an Si user and vice-versa. I wouldn't think about your ESTJ interaction as the same in this instance. There is a massive difference between an ESTJ and ISTJ in terms of their use of Si.

&gt;To reiterate I think there is a difference between the type of people someone wants as they are growing vs. matured. I think duals/types with the exact same function are great as training wheels but the opposite perception axis is more useful for the experienced rider.

If you're attempting to challenge your ideas and expand upon them via Ne - of course communicating with another intuitive user, such as an INFJ-ENFP or ENTP-INTJ is going to probably spur more ideas in your head. 

In general, extroverts find their dual type boring, ordinary, and simple upon first look. It takes sustained interaction to find their value. Duals are based on psychological comfort, and they can promote this between each other more than any other type. It's not necessarily an intellectual relationship, although it can be. Duals cover each other's weakspots in ways that no other type can. An ESXP (and ISXP) are essentially equally capable at sensation as  an ISXJ, but only the ISXJ can promote psychological comfort in the realm of an ENXP.&gt;By justify I mean bringing up past experiences, stats, history etc (Si) to backup my speculation (Ne).

Si is not "past experiences" "stats" "history" in the way you're thinking. This is a misconception. Did you take a look at the links I sent you?

&gt;This is Ti/Fe bias. You are looking outside yourself for comfort and guidance because of Fe then basing your Ti logic on that. Although if this is true, which it is, then I must be doing the same thing. That makes sense. Fi wants personal growth and Te wants application. Hence why I prefer the asymmetry over the dual.

This just even make any sense. Psychological comfort is something that is defined by Socionics by the nature of valued/non valued functions and their differing strengths. It's not a personal thing that  affects people differently

Those who share quadra, such as INFP/ENFP/ISTJ/ESTJ communicate in ways that are easily understood by the other. Motivations are more clearly seen. Misunderstandings are rare. Doesn't mean they'll love each other or be great friends, but in terms of the manners in which they communicate and interact are mutually understood. In other quadra interactions are a bit more forced. Translation can often be needed. They may not clearly understand your motivation, implication, or hidden meaning (if any). 

I'm not saying you can't prefer asymmetry over the dual. Everyone likes what they like, your reasoning just doesnt make sense:

&gt;Duals will work well but it's too much of the same. The Kiersey pairs compensate much better for weaknesses.
As an ENFP my biggest weakness is sensation.

Yet you say that Si is not valuable to Ne dominants "as too much of the same", which is objectively not true and I have provided examples to why that is the case. You're also kind of contradicting yourself saying that our sensation weakness should be remedied by a Ni/Se type which in that case the Ni may be fun for your Ne to toy with, however Se doesn't really take play in that interaction as Ne dominants disregard almost all Se input while finding Si valuable.Or an Enneagram difference. Type 2 vs Type 4/6. I know a few INFJ 4s and 6s in Philosophy related subjects.&gt;Your example is "psychological comfort" which as I said is just Fe bleeding into your Ti. Again it's an axiom, subjective choice, it's not prove true. 

No, just no. Read about quadras. It has nothing to do with my opinion. I didn't make up the term psychological comfort. Psychological discomfort is for the example my valuation over Ti affecting Ti as your PoLR right now. An ISTJ can't affect you that way, an entp can. There's plenty of proof for this in daily interactions if we want to be real here. Like how Fi makes EXTP uncomfortable. It's evident through application.

&gt;This makes complete sense If you understand Ti. The idea of "psychological comfort" is an axiom. It's a principle that you are taking to be self-evident with no proof. Your proof is that it *appears* to be true because of the Socionics model. However this is precisely because Socionics is built on this axiom. This is why Ti is subjective thinking. It is making subjective decisions to make a logical framework that is consistent within itself but not necessarily true. 

The proof is tested everyday by those who understand the socionics model. Why find we have posts discussing the psychological comfort between Se/Ni and Ne/Si users? Because it's evident that is not true in real life. Did you know that *gasp* there are plenty of Fi-Te users who have been using these ideas for a while. I learned socionics from mostly Fi-Te users so saying socionics is only valid from a Ti perspective is just wrong.


&gt;Almost is the key word there. That little bit of extra Se/Ni info *can* make a huge difference specifically because it is different.

You're really reaching here to make a point that's not there. If you can develop this idea more you might have something but you're just arguing this with no reasoning behind it other than your personal feeling.

&gt;It makes complete sense. See above for the limitations of Ti. You need to learn Te. 


You need to take a closer look at first hand materials from Jung or socionics. You don't "learn Te" in fact all thinker types are more adequately effective at using thinking in forms of Ti and Te if you were to read actual source material for this subject you would become aware of this. The distinction of functional stacks is for preference and valued style of the attitudes for thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensing. Not strength. ENTPs, according to socionics are only bested at Te by ENTJ and ESTJ. Just as an ENFP will crush an entp at Fe, an entp is far more adept at Te than an ENFP so telling me to learn Te is ironic.

Your objective here seems to be to argue some subjective point of yours that Se-Ni users are.... Let's see, you aren't really making any point here except trying to apply your personal opinion as somehow objective fact which sometimes happens with Fi-Te users. Being extra snarky, I'd say maybe you need to spend some time with your ISTJ dual to find out a more appropriate use of your Te because it's lacking here.

Your reasoning makes sense in a personal context, but trying to extrapolate that to a universal we have issues. In general your information here is lacking. I mean you think Rick and Morty is an Ni-Se show and the show is written by an INTP and ENTP with ENTP and ISFJ main characters. It's safe to say here that you have a basic level understanding of MBTI that is good enough to maybe type your friends but certainly not effective enough to lecture others or apply personal experiences as some form of universal idea. Your understanding of functions is stereotypical and basic, I advise spending some more time reading than pushing your opinions because it's clear your knowledge is limited on the subject.Got an intp friend that did the same. He started with engineering, switched to computer science, then finally history though.ENTP - international relations and global studies focus on "culture media and the arts. &amp; minor in Latin American studies. 

At my uni IRG allowed a huge list of classes to take from. I mainly selected it because I thought it was cool. Switched into it second semester of freshman year from statistics upon realizing math was hard.

I ended up taking mostly theology, philosophy, and history classes. Also had to take a bunch of Spanish classes like 30+ hours worth but that wasn't difficult as I studied abroad freshman year and was essentially fluent at that point. &gt;From my POV this is what a person person that is still growing and developing might want, a person that doesn't understand the strengths and weaknesses of their functions. However as a person starts reaching maturity they might find that they want to start covering for inherent blindspots. That is when the asymmetric pairs make more sense. They allow a person to push themselves further beyond the dichotomy limit. 

You've better summarized your point here, but I still think you're overvaluing asymmetric pairs and undervaluing duals and in quadra relations. Both are valuable to "growing" and "matured" relations (which are completely arbitrary distinctions that you've made up)

Everything I've written comes from source material from both Jung and socionics, FYI. Jung doesn't even cover intertype relations so obviously socionics is more valuable in those discussions. Once again Ti and Te users alike use the socionics model. So discounting it as Ti mumbo jumbo is intellectually dishonest/threadNe types. ENFP, INFP, INTP, ENTP.

Also type 7 on the Enneagram.&gt;so I find it hard to believe that Ni is what the Role Function claims it to be. So yeah, I'd say that the 8 function model doesn't really explain my type well.

The role function is weak, and mostly used to 'fit in' so to speak. Using it requires turning off your dominant function which is painful for all types. 

&gt;Dominant Si in socionics' descriptions of ISFJs is pretty problematic for some people. Jung's Si just doesn't universally compare to what dominant Si looks like according to many socionists. Not to mention that it overlaps a ton with sp dominance. 

Yup. 

&gt;I don't see how the unvalued functions consistently have such a defined impact on people, whether it's their PoLR, Demonstrative function, etc. When trying to explain how a given type experiences these unvalued functions... I start to have more questions than answers.

The way I see it - the unvalued functions as described by socionics describe to the extent at which we relate to information regarding those functions. Not really their use of them. The unvalued functions become much more noticeable and pertinent when we are talking about intertype relations. For example, the impact an Fi dominant has on a PoLR Fi user, or the communication between quasi-identicals in which each other's role function is the other's mobilizing function. This is where I notice the unvalued functions coming into play in experience. In terms of describing the psyche of individuals, Se is to the utmost unimportant for an Si dominant like an ISFJ. *However* in interactions where an Se user is involved, I can see socionic concepts being relatable.Sometimes causes tunnel vision that may underscore the benefit of helpful relations from others, at least from my POV. Not that I don't think the ENTJ doesn't know what they're doing, but sometimes I feel they scurt off personal relationships that could've benefited them.I think I maybe felt an ENFJ vibe off of LebronI've seen some good arguments for Tom Brady being an ENFP.

I think that in general, you're going to see people with crazy genetics that allow them to be extra good at a sport (like being above 6'6 is really helpful in basketball, for example) and as such those people can excel at a professional level, despite potentially being outclassed by an Se user with similar genetics.It's considered the demonstrative function in Socionics. You rarely see it play out while alone, but in contexts in which the function is demanded socially, those users are adept at that function.

So in that sense, ENFP and ESFP show an incredible level of skill in Fe, they just don't find it valid.Aziz: ENTP 7w6There's plenty of introverted sensor athletes, they do better in personal sports than directly competitive ones: swimming, track, boxing, and even tennis and the like.&gt;I don't agree to disagree. Ali is an ENTJ. That is a fact. Not up for debate


You're going to need to back that statement up with an interview or demonstration of Ali functionality. You can't just say it's a fact and expect people to believe. Even if you were correct, typing other individuals especially celebrities includes a lot of guess work, so you must have done a lot of work typing him, let's see it.Fitting the stereotype perfectly doesn't mean he's that type. Most users are convinced, with good reason that he's an ESTP, you can find that in many the trump threads through search. You're going to need to make a better argument than what you've given.They must be explaining the same 16 type phenomena. You're exactly right. It doesn't make sense otherwise. We have some image that is "true reality" that Jung, socionics, Myers, beebee, and others are attempting to describe. There's no reason not to use all of them to some extent to understand these ideas. I think Jung himself gives best descriptions towards individual types and what goes on inside of their experience. I enjoy socionics for its take from a sociological perceptive that includes intertype relations as well as sociological interpretations of our reactions to the other functions not within our stack.The issue with public speaking is it gives off a contrived personality that is on display. To truly determine a type there also needs to be forms of saying ways of interacting in an at home like setting as well.

That being said I lean towards and enneagram 8 gamma quadra ESFP or ENTJ. However his history shows truly little to do with Te like manipulation of his environment, having more of an impact with his ethical rhetoric (indicative of Fi). Many 8 like traits seem stereotypically ENTJ like which is also a compounding variable. Throughout his life he's had to struggle a lot with personal identity, and rather than attempt to shape that through control of resources and environment, he tended to push a more idealist perspective, somewhat unlike an ENTJ. It's easy to find interviews with him speaking much about the importance of God, also uncharacteristic of an ENTJ. He seems to have a lack of bitterness for his divorces, suggesting he is not an inferior Fi type. His inability and lack of desire to talk about the nature of God may suggest Ni inferior leanings. Mostly focused on good works and in action awareness for spreading religious awareness through his personal appearences also suggest ESFP. The amount of time he spent training and competing for the love of that is additionally suggestive of a comfortable Se dominant.

Type 8s are commonly mistyped as ENTJ, ESFP also correlate with type 8 so that's consistent as well. I think it's likely he's an ESFP 8w7 who used his notoriety to spread his ethical feelings. The fact that little business was created from his name is also suggestive of non ENTJ.

I'm still haven't convinced myself but there's some good reasoning for ESFP&gt;ENTJ and since they're in the same quadra it's possible to mistake them for each other in interviews.&gt;As I said, Trump is a builder (Te)

That's debatable. He's more often putting his name on things already built to improve his brand.

&gt;He isn't proposing a brand new political ideology (Ti) 

Yeah he kind of is, anti establishment is his new ideology. Ti auxiliaries are amazing at deconstructing the stupidity of rules, and hypocrisy, but more often than not they don't care to replace the rule with anything. That's why he's so good in debates. EXTP excel far more in the type of scenario trump was in early on compared to an ESFP.

&gt; He isn't a "real conservative" and he is willing to change positions on the spot depending on what is advantageous (Te &gt; Ti). 

This isn't indicative of Te&gt;Ti at all, it's actually more indicative of a Ti type, especially aux. If an EXTP can see the value of logic to creating an Se or Ne vision they will quickly change their tune to adopt new logic. Dominant introverted thinkers are much more static whereas auxiliaries use Ti as a means to an end.

&gt;Alternatively you could compare Fe with Fi. Trump doesn't care at all about the general mood of others. He is willing to insult and attack everyone and anyone. The arrogance and self-absorption of Fi oozes out of Trump.

Narcissism is not the same as Fi. Trump works the crowd like any Fe user would. He doesn't get by on his amazing personality(lol) he gets by because he says the right thing at the right time to get the crowd going, fueling their anger (Fe)

You have some pretty good arguments here for an ESFP. I like it. I don't really follow trump that much so I'm not too familiar. Watching more videos you might have a good point with FiTe for Trump.I have him down as an INTP 6. While PoLR Se is pretty obvious with him (which is indicative of both INXP) - his Ti is a bit harder to notice.

The reason I don't see him as a FiTe user is because of his implicit attention to systematic issues as well as universal human values which is quite normal for a religious Ti dominant and Fe inferior. 

[This response on religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWnvBFwojNM) is extremely INTP. 

His overall 'grumpiness' associated with his personality, is quite normal as well, for Ti dominants. Despite not truly being 'grumpy' people - Ti dominants tend to be so immersed in their inner world of impersonal logic, that on the exterior they appear as 'annoyed' so to speak. Introverted feelers have a much more calming, soothing way of talking. Easily identifies with others. Bernie is much more identification on universal values, which you can find in a lot of his old videos talking about social systems like you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=troNR_wd0HI) he is speaking in a much more impersonal TiNe like way.

Hope I have convinced you of INTP for Bernie with good evidence like you have convinced me of ESFP for Trump ;)&gt;Fi users can put themselves in other people's shoes and emphasize with themselves which is what I believe Sanders is doing in that video. (He is also very wrong about all religions being about the golden rule but that is a different issue) 

His analysis of religion is a Ti style analysis finding the consistencies of religion across practices.

[here's an example of Sanders trying to empathize Fi style, it's quite lackluster](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z6IlGoeDIUQ)

&gt;Sanders primarily makes a lot of Fi value judgements: "starvation wages, 1%, top one tenths of 1%, Wall Street, etc." 

Campaign rhetoric does not equal his personality. Most politicians appeal to morality in someway or another. Sanders generally appeals to universal utilitarian principles which are heavily Ti-Fe. His one liners are simply factual statements to make people question their understanding.

&gt;Both of them are more like FiTe activists, I.e. short-term thinking, than Ti philosophers. 

If Bernie were a short term thinker he would have run as a third party. His whole rhetoric is "end of the battle beginning of the war" in regards to Hillary and is planning a long term 'political resolution' even Bernie couldn't predict the populist fervor he generated, he definitely wasn't doing it in purpose. His ideas are what caught fire. Not his personality like trump. His personal videos to his supporters are instructions for infiltrating the Democratic party for long term change. He's way more philosophical than you think, but I think you're more familiar with trump and me Sanders.

&gt;Akin to calm, Sanders is weak. He isn't willing to resort to the same brawl fights tactics as Trump to win. (e.g. "I don't give a damn bout your emails.") and I attribute that to  Inf vs Aux. Te.

This is actually PoLR Se. It is similar for INFP and INTP who have Se in the same position.

INTPs are the weakest Fe users besides INTJ and ISTJ.

&gt;He isn't trying to develop or explain a new philosophy to replace the current system. 

This shows you don't know very much about Sanders

Include some videos in your arguments with specifics of ways he acts, speaks, that is indicative of being an Fi dominant at least. I've provided a lot more here and you're simply asking me to take your word for it. You're simply posting examples of his stump speech, which is just that, a speech. He's going to sound like almost any other politician giving that speech. Using that as reasoning for Fi is lazy.It makes more sense when you consider the eastern European social context for socionics. Not everyone agrees on visual typing, but generally types to tend to have similar mannerisms and methods of expression.

Honestly quadras and intertype relations (which is extrapolated from quadras which is based on valued and unvalued functions) is the best part of socionicsI always saw Cenk/Ana as ENTJ &amp; ESFPDuals in socionics. Arguably best relationship for growth and understanding. Dual relations take time to build and rarely begin like normal relations where infatuation is immediate. Requires cultural values compatibility, life goals similar, patience in the radically different approach and different strengths. Enneagram compatibility is also a huge bonus. If she's a 7 (common for ENFP) and you're a 1 (common for ISTJ) that's a good sign.Yeah if you tried to tell me ISFJs would be the one for me 3 years ago I'd have scoffed at the idea. I was into ENFP, ENFJ, INFP. Despite relatively successful relationships with all 3 of those types, it wasn't really 'perfect' - now I've been with my ISFJ 1w9 girlfriend, living with for 2 year out of 2 and 1/2 and it's like I didn't know this level of compatibility was possible. We can communicate to the other with no misunderstandings ever. We've never got into a fight. Starting out things were way slower than I was used to requiring friend like interactions multiple times hanging out before it moved more intimate. Just as socionics predicts, I could've easily figured it was just a nice friendship without thinking about anything further.

With other relationships it's like I wasn't always aware of their thinking or motives, my help wasn't as useful to them. Different styles of clingyness that were weird to me. Such as Fi love style or Fe dominant need for 'everything to be okay.' With my ISFJ it's like everything I naturally need she naturally provides with ease and pleasure and likewise everything that she desires in my ability to research, find answers, and provide alternatives is soothing to her, and comes naturally and freely for me. In social situations she helps me maintain not saying insincere things or alienating people or makes my ideas seem not so crazy.You don't really put much stock into the idea that our inferior functions are weak. If Cenk were an entp you would want to show how Si manifests in a position of weakness. In that case Si as inferior would show itself as a distrust of traditional ways of going about things and rather a comfort in attempting radical approaches.

Ana seems nothing like an Fe dominant to me, preferring her own internal rants that often go overboard, ridiculous style humor that is socially questionable "there are people mastrubating to us right now" I rarely see identification with Fe, her rants are good examples. [does this video really look like Fe to you](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SoyO34A8D-E)

She has a poignant way of speaking, little warmth like an Fe dominant. Constantly referring to statistics, research, with little impersonal logical analysis. She's far more empathetic than sympathetic. Relative fearlessness is Se oriented.

PS you're not aloneInfjs more than anyone like the thrill of being chased. I know many beta dual relations and it does seem a bit intense like you say. The least frequent dual pair I see is ENTJ/ISFP which I've actually never seen. ESTJ/INFP a strong second. Something to do with the harshness of Te dominants I suppose. I think it's fair to assume all dual relationships have a whole different vibe to them. ESTP/INFJ tortured love seems totally accurate, not as accurate for ISTP/ENFJ however as I think the Fe dominant Ti dominant vibe looks quite different where there is a less aggressive chase from the ISTP who is primarily very happy with the Fe oozing from the ENFJ where the ENFJ enjoys the detachment the ISTP has and may find that a bit of a chase in itself. Maybe a lesser tortured love since it still kind of fits, but the feeler is extroverted and thinker introvertedCenk changed from moderate Republican to moderate Democrat. He's far more moderate than any of the other hosts. He seems to lack any Fe, additionally you seem to say you haven't even really paid attention to the show but really your typings are mostly opinions not facts and you don't seem to understand that.

Your only evidence for Ana being Fe is "fake?" What? She self references and rarely other references. Agreeing with the other hosts happens not very often if you've watched it enough. If she agrees she talks about how she agrees with it, not why society at a whole should. It's like anything you don't like is suddenly Fe? Honestly EXFP often view relationships as temporary and are quick to lower personal feelings with one as quick as they are to start, giving the appearance to others as fake.

&gt;No offense but you don't appear to be very good at tying people. 

I could say the same about you, in fact I'm constantly replying to you because I think your typings are shit, and it's not that, that really annoys me(since often times disagreement is common and expected), it's the fact that you consider yourself an expert at typing celebrities mostly(which is a joke because typing celebrities is hard without serious arguments, even then you don't know what they're like 'at home' essentially it's highly subjective) and you lack any serious rigour in explanations other than "because I said so" which doesn't bode well due to the fact that your understanding of functions is highly personal and is not applicable at all towards universal applications of those functions.

You consider yourself a know it all and chime up on things but display no modesty, no attempt to view other people's viewpoints in discussion, and defend yourself as *always correct* which shows a huge amount of bias to yourself. Your lack of open mindedness to other viewpoints than your own is extremely off putting, combine that with the fact that you generally have no idea what you're talking about (you just put functions in parenthesis to make it seem like a point when you don't even understand the functions) and you have provided no original material of your own to even suggest that you have a nuanced understanding of typology besides the bare bones. 

Sorry to tell you, but there are a lot smarter people on here than you who have demonstrated that a lot more clearly to which people may trust them more, but still are allowed to disagree with where you may see a good discussion. Anything you ever say is portrayed in a never wrong kind of way, and sorry to say I'm a bit skeptical of anything you say as you don't even understand many of the functions and rely mostly on stereotypes that you've made up yourself as well as your complete inability to conceive that you're potentially wrong. You're also probably a 7w8 due to your smug sense if arrogance in having everything 'figured out' but I digress. 

&gt;There can be only one. The fact is I am more right than you. I could tell Trump is an ESFP when most people, including yourself, mistyped him for an ESTP.

I never attempted to type Trump. I was just pointing out that you can't just yell out your opinion without something backing it up. I was playing devils advocate for you so you would actually produce a good argument (which you finally did, but for Trump only IMO.)

Sure, there can only be one, but you can't really verify that type can you? Unless you have an actual personal interaction with a celebrity, or if they type themselves and assert that. EVEN IF they assert their own type as something, you will have people debating whether that typing is accurate. Shit, you have people on this very forum who will tell people their typing is wrong, sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong. 

&gt;From personal experience learning MBTI, being able to learn the opposite judgement axis is the hardest part. I think it's slightly easier of for a FiTe user to learn FeTi than vise-versa. So this is probably your weakness. You don't have a good grasp of how the other types think, case in point being upset by a lack of modesty which you should expect in Fi users (expect possibly Fi doms).

Your lack of modesty in regards to celebrity typing just further shows you are more arrogant than you think. I just want to give you a little check here, to help you realize that no, not anyone, especially in the forums of typology *is always right.*

&gt;Again the fact that you are getting so butthurt by FiTe is good proof that you don't understand it. I was the same way with FeTi before I learned it.

I'm not butthurt by FiTe. I'm annoyed at the fact that you assume a superficial arrogance when there are plenty of users who are smarter than you, have demonstrated that, have contributed, yet STILL retain more sense of modesty than you. I've looked through your post history. You're still posting definitions of stereotypical designations of functions that are severely outdated. You don't understand that the functions work not on a discrete level (for example, an EXFP is a strong feeler, regardless of Fi or Fe, they value and see Fi as more valid however than Fe) you don't understand the notion of inferior functions and their pain on the psyche. You don't understand the implications of the childlike nature and weakness of the tertiary function. 

&gt;Again to reiterate. Your complaint is that I am an ENFP, not an ENTP. You mistyped Trump as FeTi instead of FiTe. Cenk as FiTe instead of FeTi. Same with Ana. These 4 points are enough to prove that you don't understand FiTe axis compared to your own native FeTi.

Just because you say things are so, does not make them so. FYI. Se users are generally much better at typing visually than Ne users. Since you're basing your arguments off the fact of celebrity typing, what you're saying doesn't even hold any value. "Here's 4 points that don't even make sense, you wish I were an ENTP not an ENFP, therefore you don't understand FiTe" I can't even begin to explain how that statement just doesn't make any sense in general, and is only a statement used to bolster your point that 'you're always right.' which is my key gripe with you.

Most people that respond as confidently as you, actually know far less than than they think they know. The more you learn, the more you realize what you don't know, [I'm sure you've heard of the Dunning-Kurger effect?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)

The thing is, typing your friends is relatively easy, typing celebrities is not, since you're typing a contrived personality that doesn't show the ease of function familiarity that exists in personal relations. So that's why your assurdness is annoying to me, you just have little understanding of your own potential biases, that talking to you is like talking to a brick wall because you're more concerned with proving yourself right than you are on learning or coming to the right answer.

On further inspection I could be convinced of an ESTP for Cenk. Still a hard tell. [This guy on TYT has always appeared far more ENTP to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=207&amp;v=JXQKCuqaY_k) 

I'd buy an INFJ typing for Ana, I think that it's difficult because her demeanor puts of a combative tone, which isn't inconsistent for INFJ or ESFP. I wouldn't consider her an ISFJ/ESFJ at all however. I see an Se/Ni axis. It still needs more analysis however.

I know a pretty fucking weird INTJ 1 sx type. Totally rebellious. Totally wild. People probably think he's an amazing genius psychic alien deep philosopher. But in reality he is also a down to earth normal dude. It's like the sx instinct turns it into peacocking.Please expand upon this. I mean, I've read that link multiple times, but how to you figure it gives a person hyper-emotional processing of events? I'm an sx type, so I can see where you're going here, I just want to see what else you have to say about it.Ne dom with a similarish experience at math. After Algebra 2 I felt math took a turn I couldn't really understand anymore. I took AP Stats the same time as pre-calculus, and I found stats far easier. Barely passing pre-calc made me say fuck calculus for my senior year and decided to take no math. Tried calculus again in college, once again, fuck calculus, switched majors away from stats because I didn't want to take other math courses. Should've known when I could barely pass the ALEKS test or whatever it was called which was some sort of test to let you take math courses at my university. 

That's just my experience with math, but if anything I did well on standardized testing because I had little test anxiety. Get me before a test and I'd be pumped to take it. Thought AP Stats (although this was the 2nd AP test of the day)/Bio tests were harder than the other humanities related courses. Thinking of an idea to write for a history/english/spanish prompt was far easier than trying to remember the correct mathmatical formula, or use it correctly. Gov/Macro/Micro were maybe medium difficulty being almost completely about pure memory. Psych was a complete joke. I also thought the ACT was far easier than the SAT.Which AP math did you try in 11th grade? The ultimate trollI think the bigger issue is that there is no concerted method for typing individuals based on 'forum personality' while I would welcome such an analysis that breaks down the different forms of typing based on types, for example, I find ENTP tend to use parenthesis for sidetracking(but I tend to eliminate parenthisis sometimes afterwards because I feel like I'm sidetracking and leaving others confused, like literally, I had the 'for example part' in parenthesis, and now I had to add this caveat which had to take the place of parenthesis, making this next sentence a new sentence.) But no such thing exists, so it's simply conjecture if someone 'seems like' a certain type or not. Often enough, you have people who will yell and shout at other users for being 'mistyped' which IMO should be more of a *discussion* or *suggestion* and if someone adamantly defends the typing that they have, despite what a user can nitpick about them, reasonably we cannot tell the inner world from these users, and who is to say we aren't wrong and they are right? No matter how sure we are of ourselves?

Something that this forum has done, greatly in effect, is realize that there is a large amount of differences within types that do not coorelate to stereotypes. We have INTP females who like makeup. ENFJ entrepreneurs, INTP men that are into fashion and style. 

Another thing this forum has done well is remove the well-defined lines we had for defining introverted sensation, which has had a terrible bias and steretyping since online typology became a thing. 

Anyways, I think it's best that in some cases we take a look at why a certain type may not 'seem' like that type, and if it is true that they are that type, that may allows us to modify our understanding of what that type consists of, as it has happened before many times. 

Combine the fact that there are totally different Enneagram types that may make a type seem radically different. For example, an INFP 4 and INFP 9 are very different. An INFP 9 isn't really going to understand the typical stereotypes of INFPs as mopey, depressed, etc. An INFP 4 isn't going to understand (potentially) the stereotype of an INFP who is relatable, empathetic, and lazy.

tl;dr fixing a mistyping, as well as understanding *why someone considers someone mistyped but is wrong* can help build a better framework for the understanding of what makes a type.

Also: some people are truly mistyped, but it should be suggested to them to check out that type, give resources why you think that way, ask questions for them to answer. There's a potential you're wrong just as much as they are, so it's better to take care with that action rather than immediately assert your position and potentially make someone defend an incorrect typing due to your aggressiveness.&gt;At this point in time, we've grown too different politically (shes a libertarian and I'm a staunch Sanders liberal) and I'm wondering how much time I should put in our long time friendship.

It's sad how these political differences affect relationships like this. It's like it becomes a sport game with teams except you're arguing about how the game should be played if you win, rather than actually agreeing to any subset of rules. Politics often becomes identity politics which almost eliminate the human element for a more basic tribal feeling of us against them, which can eventually alienate friends.

&gt;I can't help but see it as bragging and I get envious. When she shares her opinion, to me it implies than anyone else who thinks opposite (which I often do) is inferior. The last time I tried to talk about my differing opinion was when I was questioning religion (eventually becoming and atheist) and her appalled I would even question. 

I wonder if she feels the same way still. It certainly feels alienating to come out as having doubts to organized religion in a world where it's a major factor. Thankfully the internet let's us know there are people who have these ideas and you're not just crazy.

&gt;But the effort and the courage needed to do this is something I like. If you haven't noticed, I also a phobic type 6 on the enneagram. 

I have a great INTP friend who's a phobic 6. I think that often times 7s (which I'm assuming she is) don't understand the innate need to contemplate that 6s have. They find their active dissent challenging rather than realizing it's more from a place of insecurity. 7s would rather not hear about this insecurity as it puts a damper on things. Ironically, I think acknowledging this insecurity is healthy for 7s to do. (But also healthy for 6s to emulate courage in the face of insecurity that exists)

There's a lot to be grown from 7s and 6s but i think you're right in it requiring two healthy people's. Unhealthy they will drive each other away over time.Often times this can be a hard connundrum. They may both seem aggressive, person-people, with a physicality element (especially since ENTJ/ESTP both coorelate with E:8)

In general, the ENTJ will seem more open to discussion of the theoretical implications of long-term trends than an ESTP. Another difference would be an ENTJ much less concerned with logically deconstructing a theory, than they are in building or imagining a future vision. ESTP will be much more inclined to say why X makes sense or &amp; doesn't make sense, and explain in detail. ESTP will be more inclined to describe what their options are in the present, and will be pretty uncomfortable describing their future long-term ambitions or vision of what they think will come into play. They'll always move a future vision question into kind of what they're doing 'right now' where an ENTJ will have a bit more potential personal 'flair' to their vision of their future, with concrete steps at how it could be achieved. I'd ask this person what their idealized future would be, and that might help you get to the answer.

[Also consider than an ENTJ would have you with semi-duality if you're an INFP](http://www.socionics.com/rel/sdl.htm)

[Whereas with an ESTP you'd have conflicting relations](http://www.socionics.com/rel/cnf.htm)

I wouldn't view these type relations as determinsitic, or set in stone, but they may help deduce their type a little bit more. Knowing the potential intertype relations also will help you gauge the friendship better. For example, for the ESTP constant Fi framing may make them uncomfortable, whereas with the ENTJ will not be made uncomfortable with that nearly as much. I mean chased in the sense that infjs are hard to get so to speak. Thrill isn't really the right word I'm just playing off the adage. You're right, wanting the other to initiate is a better description. But idk! You're the infj you tell meThis is what I'm talking about, you have such a basic understanding of the functions it looks like someone who read about MBTI over one weekend and then you try to school users over something you don't even understand. It's incredibly arrogant and you look stupid. You really display the worst traits of a 7w8 which is acting like an expert in topics you don't really know in depth, acting like you have everything figured out and everyone else is dumb. When someone gives a deeper explanation your response, rather than attempt to understand, is that it's incomprehensible to you therefore invalid. Seriously just ignore bomerr. They've been parroting in here like some form of experts when they're giving stereotypical 10 year old definitions of functions as if they read one comprehensive function thread on a forum and are now regurgitating it like they have it all figured out. Mostly concerned with giving celebrity typings and defending their opinion until death. They won't listen and certainly don't understand they're barely scratching the surface with what they know
Nah bro you don't understand Ni is filtering Se for a concrete idea. Ne is expanding off of Si to create new ideas. /sYou're delusional. Just because you say you're "good at typing people" (I'm sure plenty of people would disagree with you) does not make it true. You claim that I have 'no Te' If you had any deeper level understanding of the functions, you would realize that thinking as a preference indicates an ability to use Te and Ti but with a value of Ti as more important, it does not indicate a weak use of Te. You've shown your incomplete level of understanding, and are somehow proud of it. 

&gt;So the entire point is to make a simple, basic, easy to use definition to understand the functions in application instead of overcomplicating things.

If you think you're somehow contributing something new, you're not. You're simply regurgitating what has been said for years. Despite your basic level understanding, you think you have some prophetic vision. Most of us in this forum are blatantly aware of the basic definitions of functions. In fact, I was in this forum 4 years ago giving credence to functions before it was popular - I even removed my own function guide post from the sidebar of this subreddit (it was sidebarred when I wasn't mod, but I removed it as amod) because I felt that the information was pretty outdated. Things change and get better, Most of us are aware of the ['definitions of functions' which have been discussed in depth, multiple times](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/48x9m8/my_analysis_of_functions/) Your information is basically inferior to many other basic descriptions of functions, so it's not even helpful. You might as well copy and paste from other peoples post. What you have said is nothing new.  Yet you try to school people who have a much more nuanced information and understanding. That's where my issue lies, its not that your information is necessarily incorrect, its that you somehow consider yourself an expert, will not listen to any dissent, and mock others in something that you have a noob-level of understanding in. You are displaying the most negative traits of a 7w8(acting as an expert on topics in which you have a synthesized lay understanding), which isn't something that I would be proud of.

&gt;Ni is intuition that takes a lot of different points (Se) and connects them all together into one focus (Ni). It's many to one. This is the key.

See here's the issue here. This is not a new concept, this is a very lay, stereotypical understanding of Ni. Most if not all of us are aware of this style of defining Ni. The thing is, this definition is almost unequivocally incorrect. It's helpful maybe for determining an Ni vs Ne type, but it's not something that gets to the heart of what Ni is. It's inaccurate. You say that you need to learn from Ni users, yet when someone comments towards you on this, you are completely not open to receiving different information.

All I'm asking is maybe you should listen more, instead of berating people for disagreeing with you, because it is blatantly clear that you have the little expertise, and none of your post history shows that you aren't someone who just read or watched youtube videos about the functions over a weekend and now wants to tell all of their friends that know nothing about MBTI about this. You have read no source material of Jung, Von Der Hoop, Socionics (which has many authors with different perspectives) You have created no original content, but rather regurgitate stereotypical definitions of functions in attempt to prove everyone who disagrees with you as wrong. Check out /r/mbtiarticles for some easy to synthesize information. Read on socionics because it's not a concrete system like you think, there are multiple models, and there is much to learn from all of them, even if you disagree. If you want people to listen to you, contribute something new, of value. 7s are good at synthesizing, synthesize some shit for us that you find new and interesting if you want people to value you your content. 

What traits do you consider of the ENTJ that are beta in nature? I think sometimes Te is misconstrued as Se because of it's "go get 'em" attitudeAre you a 4 or a 9? Or 6?Oh god, this sounds incredibly difficult. Probably far easier to type their enneagram type. Everything is translated, which may give bias to the translator in their manner of speaking. I highly doubt any of us could pin this accurately. Are you basing off of direct works or simply their described life via wikipedia? Rather than give just more information to how Ne functions as a dominant or auxiliary function, I will add-on you information for how Fi and Ti work in the dominant and auxiliary positions, in order to give you a more well rounded idea to help find your type. If you find you are dominant or auxiliary in Fi or Ti, you can determine where Ne lands.

An Ne dominant is going to view possibility and potentiality in objects/subjects as the end all be all. Possibility for possibility's sake. Since an Ne aux is a Ji dominant (Fi or Ti) Ne is used as a somewhat 'helping mechanism' to further justify a Fi or Ti judgment.

Ne dominants work the other way around, seeing a potentiality, the use Ti or Fi to justify or reason (logically or emotionally) why or how this Ne vision could come about. 

Thus, the Ne dominant views Ti or Fi as more 'situational' or 'means to an end' An EXTP (Ti aux) will more easily drop a logical system for another one that makes sense to serve Se or Ne means. A Ti dominant (IXTP) will rather examine the new data and try to encompass it into their already created intellectual structure. 

A Ti aux will more likely see systems in a space of potentially true. They see these systems as a potential puzzle piece to fit together and may be done more haphazzardly. A Ti dominant sees these potential truths as either 'not true' or 'true' without being conditional. Thus, if a puzzle piece doesn't perfectly fit, it must be refined to fit. A Ti aux (Ne dominant) wouldn't care as much if it doesn't fit perfectly.

You can apply this to some extent to Fi dominants and Fi aux. The Fi dominant sees something as 'correct feeling' or 'not correct' and they must refine this feeling to be accurate with their conceptual understanding of ethical truth. An Fi aux is not nearly as subdued by this, and will feel comfortable swapping out ethical truths to what will more fit their Se or Ne vision.

In a social perspective, here is Fi auxiliary in action:

&gt;The individual is very adept at perceiving, establishing, and maintaining personal bonds between people. However, these bonds are often perceived as being situational and flexible rather than static. The individual is inclined to focus on establishing personal bonds with other people in the context of realizing or following perceptions from his base function. The person easily creates a sense of closeness and kinship between people by expressing like and acceptance, but these sentiments are situational rather than an expression of permanent feelings. If the person's mood or external situation changes, he or she may "turn off" the feelings instantly, even forgetting whom they had created the feeling of kinship with.

In comparison to Fi as a dominant function

&gt;The individual sees reality primarily through static personal ethics and stable interpersonal bonds between individuals, including himself, where the status of such interpersonal bonds is determined by his personal ethics. The individual is very confident in evaluating the ethical or moral qualities, and their consistency, of other people. This makes the individual seem "judgemental" or "self-righteous" to people less so inclined. If he has difficulty in deciding the status of a personal relationship, he will take action to try to reach a conclusion but if that continues to elude him, he will regard the relationship as not worth it. His own sense of constancy in personal ethics and in his relationships with others is a very strong factor in his sense of self-worth. Fi in this position implies the ability to almost instantly recognize whether someone is a friend or an enemy, whether they are demonstrating good will or ill will, and whether they are drawn to or repelled by the individual.

Here is Ti as an auxiliary function:

&gt;The individual easily generates logical systems and formulations to explain a set of phenomena that he has experienced or studied. However, these logical systems or explanations are not viewed as permanent or all-encompassing, but can be improved upon or even discarded as new experience and information is added.

And Ti as a dominant function:

&gt;The individual views reality through the lens of logic, immediately recognizing the correctness and appropriateness of things and their proper place in reality and in his system of views and behavior. He freely makes logical assertions, often exaggerated, about new information and experience. He holds highest those rules to which exceptions do not exist, and is a habitual critic of people or things that don't follow a set of rules, whether they are those accepted by the community, or his own, or even the other person's. Although he is able to adopt others' rules, his own are always the last word, and these are subject to continual refinement. Often seen as "demanding", due to high standards. &gt;The fact is you cannot accurately type people so that says it all.

##**This is just your opinion.**I think he fits and ESTP soundly. ENTJ was a knee jerk guess from what I've seen. Doesn't seem like an ne type at all to me.

ESFP are also performers, in an acting position emoting might be their style. Not that I wouldn't be able to be convinced of ESFJ, just that's a potential caveat. 

&gt;Also, ESFJs (according to Socionics) have Se as one of their two strongest functions along with Fe; even though they consciously value their auxiliary Si, Se is a very strong function that expresses itself regardless. 
 

Very good point, hitting the essence of quasi identicals. We could also use your same argument to argue for ESFP. I need to find a good source of non performance situation of Anna. I think you make good arguments. It's difficult to type him because we see more of his campaign face than him in general, truly if you think Fi dislikes Fe you would certainly question why Jane his wife is an ESFJ. I need to find some pre campaign videos to show why his introverted thinking could be dominant. His ability to listen and interactions with killer Mike for example show potential Fi.

I'm almost certain that he's a type 6 social I'm quite better at typing enneagrams.

Stereotypical reasoning against Fi: he doesn't shine in the spotlight which Fi can tend to do, he tells his supporters they energize him in his moment of tiring in the rough campaign, he's clearly doing it for the people as a universal, he's constantly compromising and isn't fighting for his personal ideal as much as a pragmatic universalism. Alpha types are much more likely to be speak about uncommon views, ideas. I think he is quite clearly an Se PoLR watch him dance on Ellen show. That's really not Se dancing. So awkward. Also if he were an ISFP, you're saying he has Ne PoLR which seems highly inaccurate to me. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ThY52oL-S5I check out this video of Bernie talking in plain thought. "My view is" "here's the argument for this" "here's the argument for this" really looks like Ti to me. Watch the whole video. He seems to show role Fi here as well when talking about people "fighting the good fight"Very well made point. For what socionics opens up to us, it's completely underappreciated. I think the tone it takes due to East and West bias can rub primarily MBTI enthusiasts the wrong way. In many instances socionics ideas have been imported into the MBTI consciousness without people realizing due to their accuracy and people will have the audacity to claim all of socionics is bull because it's challenging and immense in scopeI know this is an unpopular belief. But my view is that ADD/ADHD is a cultural diagnosis. ADD/ADHD numbers are *far* lower in Europe in comparison to America. If you fit any number of specific criteria like: not being able to pay attention in class, having lots of uncontrollable energy, not following social norms. [I mean look here](http://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/guide/adhd-symptoms) getting a script for stimulants such as Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta - is SUPER easy. If you say the right words.

Basically, ADD or ADHD would not exist as a 'thing' that needed to be treated with serious medication if we didn't live lifestyles that demanded such rigorous attention to detail or social situations. Furthermore, ADD/ADHD is a diagnosis concerned with Dopamine not functioning properly. You can treat healthier dopamine levels with [exercise which has shown to normalize dopamine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12758062) in addition, [meditative states have been shown to have profound affects on neurotransmitters](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=meditation+add&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C44&amp;as_vis=1)

As far as I'm concerned, in most cases, medication for ADD/ADHD is not necessary, and perhaps detrimental. Long-term use of stimulants such as Adderall, Vyvanse, can result in inability to feel pleasure, clinical depression, and at the very least addiction and neurotoxicity. Ritalin and Concerta are safer in that they are reputake inhibitors rather than dopamine agonists, meaning they block dopamine from being absorbed meaning more dopamine in the synapse, rather than forcing more dopamine to be produced in terms of Adderall/Vyvanse which leads to a downregulation of your own dopamine production.

It's soothing to believe that a pill will solve your problems of attention, but in my experience (of being diagnosed with 'ADD'), I found much more profound lasting results with regular sleep, exercise, meditative activities (not necessarily meditation), and attention to potential nutritional deficiencies (B vitamins, magnesium, vitamin D) ADD drugs made me feel good and 'more of myself' but I was also concerned with the 'weirdness' that I felt on them. Upon reading more about the drugs I was taking (which everyone should do) it wasn't difficult for me to realize that it was better for the long term if I found ways to be productive without such potent drugs.

&gt;If you were to attribute a particular MBTI type as being more likely to suffer from ADHD, what would it be and why?

Back to the main point here - which is also an issue I have with ADD/ADHD diagnosis. For example, my parents wanted me to 'get checked' for ADD because they thought I was slightly careless. Would forget where I put things. Forgetting to bring certain things. Basically the WebMD list of 'symptoms of ADD'

&gt;Have a hard time paying attention to details and a tendency to make careless mistakes. Their work might be messy and seem careless.

&gt;Have trouble staying on topic while talking, not listening to others, and not following social rules

&gt;Be forgetful about daily activities (for example, missing appointments, forgetting to bring lunch)

This is basically a minor description of a potential Ne type 

You're making some clear errors here:

&gt;So first of all, let's establish that a cognitive function in this context is a form of information filter/processing. 

This isn't established. It is debated. This is maybe the perspective of Socionics, but not really Jung. The truth probably lies somewhere as a mixture of these ideas, but it's not reducible to 'information filter/processing.

&gt;Furthermore, this sort of dramatic difference would have to be visible in brain scans, a INTJ and an ESFP would have to show some signs of drastically different cognition, their default modes are opposites after all.

They do show signs of drastically different cognition. Have you ever even seen an INTJ or ESFP in action? INTJ is lazy, in their head. ESFPs are action oriented, out in the world, doers.

&gt;So in MBTI the dominant and inferior functions are opposites, and the dominant function represses the inferior. It's said that you spend almost all of your time "in a state of your dominant function", which means almost none in your inferior. This doesn't make any sense against reality. 

Actually it does. This is actually what Jung is describing. The dominant function of the type is the most important archetypal feature of each type. For example, Ne doms ENXP are likely to forget things, be unaware of their surroundings, fickle with the feelings of their body. The focus of the Ne state accompanies the weakness of Si. We don't know if it is causative, or correlative, but that's just how it is in observable reality.&gt;Except there are highly active INTJs and extremely lazy ESFPs.

Not really. There are INTJs who compete in sports and physical activities, but not at any level near an ESFP who is much more comfortable with it.

&gt;So you're arguing cognitive functions affect information yet isn't an information filter? Whether it's the sum of thousands of separate filters or a specific filter in and of itself doesn't affect the argument. You can abstract it all you want, but for it to have a cognitive effect it must filter/process information in some way.

I'm not arguing anything, simply stating that there is no consensus on this.

&gt;In which case I need you to tell me how reiterations of these filters do not create a massive difference in output. You either need intent (e.g. Ne works towards Si and vice versa) which doesn't hold up, or you need some heavy balancing dynamics that are entirely ignored in the theory.

Jung talks about this. Have you read psychological typesBeing aware of the multiple interpretations is the first step to asserting a different position. Your main point is that a dominant function does not necessitate a weakness in the inferior, correct?What is your meaning of repressed? I don't think Ne-Si is considered opposites as much as valued pairs. Valued Ne means valued si I think repression isn't necessarily the proper word for it. An Fe dominant views through objective emotional lens. Primarily. Therefore, Ti, impersonal and subjective logic can be at odds with Fe. In reality we find for example Ti dominants struggle heavily with Fe centered material.

I really suggest looking through socionics to see a structured take on why our functions work this way (according to their model)&gt;if for example, you are an INTJ that gets along with ENFJs, then are you mistyped?

Not even true. ENFJ is INTJ supervisor. Supervisor relations have high potential for bad or good. There's really only one relation that is inherently bad, but thats not even completely true. That being 'conflicting relations' which is all letters flipped except p/j so (ENTP-ISFP, ENTJ-ISFJ, ESTJ-INFJ, etc.)

&gt;I don't choose to read into labels such as "lazy" or "slutty" - that is pretty much the adjectives thrown around for INFJs in Socionics. Low Se they say: Aimless, impractical, Te PoLR, likes to go around saying how much everyone wants them.

According to who? Random forum posts? If you take everything everyone says seriously you're gonna have a bad time.

&gt;Socionics is fascinating at first, quite charming even. But if you think what you are in MBTI translates perfectly over to Socionics.. mm you're in for a surprise! Just because you read the description and think, "Wow, that's me" - it isn't enough.

Socionics has a eastern perspective, regardless, personality portraits are never completely accurate in completely describing all people of one of the 16 types.

&gt;Circling over to the beginning point, you need to be visually typed above all. One little deviation and you are not a certain type.

VI is only taken very seriously by a certain group of people. Pictures for typing are not very accurate in experience. You can see socionic threads where people attempt to VI and get it wrong like 60% of the time. In my experience, capturing body language and facial expressions in person are far more accurate for VI. 

&gt;One little deviation and you are not a certain type. MBTI at least gives some leeway that hey, you can be an INTP into acting or an ENTJ into art. In Socionics? Nope.

According to who? That being said, ENTJs are rarely into art, I wouldn't say an INTP is not into acting however. 
Always thought Tupac was an ENFP 7w8 sx. Not much to go off of other than his music and literally a few interviews though. Took him too soon man. Biggie I'm pretty certain of being a 7w8 sp type. Not sure of MBTI. ISTP potentially. Hard to find good interviews of him either.Great test.

48% ENTP
18% ENFP

Have you considered making an Enneagram test?Dude, not at all. Have you watched pumping iron? Such a fucking troll. ISTP if I've ever saw one. Way too comfortable with Se. Brazen. Literally talks about like hooking up with the other competitors mom to psyche him out. I'd buy another typing for him than ISTP. Maybe ESTP or even XSTJ. But I really don't think he's an INTJ. In my view, these differences may result in differences in how people would act. But that does not necessarily mean its a disorder. That something is somehow 'wrong' with your brain. It simply could be on the order of human variation that makes people different. My point is that, due to how we are socially expected to act in America (workaholics) these things are considered a disorder, whereas in a primitive hunter-gather type society, or different civilization, these differences would not be considered a disorder. That's the cultural diagnosis part. Regardless of the diagnosis. Why is the treatment almost always 'take a very strong psychotropic drug that increases dopamine a shitton' as if that will solve it? It's similar to depression, which, while an issue, it's treatment is quite cultural in that thinking SSRI will solve your depression (and in many cases, it does barely better than placebo). It's reductionist in breaking down ADD/ADHD as a dopamine issue, and depression as a serotonin issue.If you were ever around any large amount of coders you'd find that T types in general excel at coding but have different methods or strengths. I would certainly not call coding an exclusively Ti area. It may have a large representation being Ti, but that doesn't make the other uses worse at it by default.I can see an ISFP for that certainly. Have any good videos of him being an ISFP textbook?Very good analysis. As someone in an ENTP-ISFJ relationship for 2+ years this

&gt;By many standards, duals are opposites, but not polar opposites. They value the same traits, it's just that one dual is better at using the traits the other is weakest at. It is probably natural to feel repulsed by your dual at first until you get to know them because they bring out the parts of you that you are not confident in exposing. But once you get to know them, you realize that they help you improve the parts of your personality that are lacking. And thus, you both grow as a result.

Is very true. It's different than other relationships I've had with INFP, ENFJ, and ENFP where the relations tended to deteriorate over time without excessive work. And due to the nature of being highly comfortable quiting a relationship rather than fight through it because I fear if it's not working now it won't work later, I had ended those relationships.

Whereas with an ISFJ it's like unlimited growth potential without any uncomfortableness. 

I'd also like to add that if the enneagram and instinctual variant is off, duality won't come as naturally.This is really confusing without knowing what your actual type is. AFAIK activation is the second ideal after duality within socionics. Dude, do you not realize that anarchism was originally a socialist/Democratic idea? Really the capitalist anarchists only exist in libertarian state side ideologies. The idea is that if you dismantle the power structure you send up with democratically run enterprises that don't require government to step in to block corporate tyranny.

[listen to this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RxPUvQZ3rcQ)The ironic thing is what people consider MBTI here is actually a hodge podge of different 16 type typologies regardless of the introduction of socionics! If anything socionics discussion generally has a lot of clarity and isn't really contradictory to the internet collective idea of'MBTI.' 

Since something socionics contributes is intertype relations (something not discussed in MBTI) we are getting good discussion in relation to those ideas. In many cases MBTI users think that their descriptions are rigid and deterministic, despite having a somewhat high degree of accuracy.

There is no 'pure' MBTI that most enthusiasts and experts would agree on nor are any of these things people imagine would be pure MBTI is talked about here. In a large sense MBTI is in disagreement with Jung in substantial ways. However all these systems are in a major way describing *the same 16 types.* and I feel should be welcome in the largest typology related subreddit.

Enneagram on the other hand in my view is simply irresponsible to disclude as unimportant in relation to MBTI. An INFP 4w3 is far different than a 9w8. Or an ENFP 3 vs 7. These discrepancies can help explain differences in the variety of INFPs which helps see the spectrum of human behavior rather than 16 stereotypical variations.

I mean really half the topics here are type me posts we crave good content. If someone is talking socionics or Jungian, or about information metabolism, how does it help to stifle that discussion?Probably just people interested in the topics tbh. It's worth a shot, means you have something to talk about!I've seen it around but I honestly can't remember where I've read it. Anecdotally I've seen it work.I never said socionics was superior. Just that it creates interesting discussions. I've been here quite a bit longer than you and I wasn't even aware of socionics until some people pointed me in that direction in this subreddit, now I have a more nuanced understanding of this typology.

We've had people complaining about socionics for over 3 years and they're a vocal minority. Most people enjoy the extra information and nuanced discussion. Whenever moderators try to silence discussion or determine user generated content the subreddit goes to shit. Better to have an open policy so the intelligent people with things to share can share them.    

You have to understand, what we consider canon MBTI is not canon. The MBTI test is quite old but it's the name with the most recognition. As time has gone on our definitions have evolved without even considering socionics. By most standards what you think is 'MBTI' is not anything close to what the original foundation is. In that sense, it would be ridiculous to ban talk about socionics when what we consider MBTI nowadays in forums and message boards has evolved with input from other scholars other than Myers because MBTI as it stands with strict adherence to the original typology fails to be accurate under scrutiny.It's not only beneficial it's almost reckless not to. Enneagram differences between types explains a lot that goes unexplained in MBTI. People wonder why two INTPs are totally different and often enneagram can answer that question.&gt;Users in threads will join an MBTI discussion and start talking about Socionics being superior **in an /r/MBTI thread**. If that isn't creating a us/them mentality, then how would my post be any worse in doing so? My thread is merely a response to the users with that mentality.

Just because the subreddit is called MBTI doesn't mean it's strictly for MBTI discussion. It's more for personality typology in general. The community is too small to divide up among subreddits. This is the biggest one where the smartest users tend to contribute stuff. No one wants to talk to an empty forum. Additionally, most people who use socionics were introduced through MBTI and don't feel that socionics warrants creating an us/them mentality when it's inherently describing the same 16 types. Like flux is saying, you start cutting off branches and soon you're cutting off half the tree.

Some users feel this way, some users feel pure Jung is better. Some lay somewhere in the middle. It seems like you're the one creating the US/them mentality.

&gt;2. Being able to tell someone's type by their facial and body features is absolutely unfounded. 

Most socionists don't rely on visual typing or even agree with its 100% validity. *However* there is significant evidence that same types have similar gesturing, facial expressions, dancing style, and resting face. None of that is really captureable with a picture and requires body language to truly tell. Most experienced typologists, whether MBTI or socionics, will argue that they can get glimpses of type through body language including expressions and talking style.

&gt;The pointless confusion of types. MBTI has types in a way that makes complete sense for practical use purposes. INFP and ENFP are similar types. Why make it confusing and change it to INFp and ENFP being dissimilar types? It is another layer of unnecessary confusion regardless of the logic behind the change. 

True socionics typing uses the 3 letter system like ILI ILE, SEE, etc. The reason people use the lowercase p/j is for familiarity to MBTI crowd which most western socionists align with. It's an easy enough switch, introverts just switch the j/p. Not as big of deal as you think.

In fact, it's really Myers who messed up because when you think about it if an INFP is a perciever why isn't their first function intuition? Socionics makes this discrepancy fixed as an INFj means their judging function is first, Fi. Look, the discrepancy annoys me a little too but it's such a minute issues.

&gt;Quadras are such a terrible set of terminology. Alpha, Beta... come on. We are getting into Ancient Greek and making it sound like Astrological sign bullshit. The amount Socionics discusses the importance of Quadras is blown way out of proportion. Yes, INTP and ENTP are similar. Yes ISFJs and ESFJs are similar. No INTPs and ENTPs are not like ISFJs and ESFJs. Your two lead functions have way more dictation on your personality than your other two do. An INTP and INFP have more in common than an INTP and ISFJ/ESFJ do. 

You're essentially complaining about this because you don't understand it. Quadras actually have a lot in common, but if you understood Model A you'd know that socionics never argues that INTP/ENTP and ESFJ/ISFJ are more similar types. In fact it argues that they are quite different, but with similar values in some instances which align them in a quadra.

&gt;An INTP and INFP have more in common than an INTP and ISFJ/ESFJ do. 

What if I told you socionics describes an important way that INFP and INTP are similar? They both have Se as PoLR. However INFP and INTP are similar in ways, they differ in their values, preferred social interaction, topics of discussion in which quadras organize.

&gt;It is a pedantic use of terminology when you could easily just describe the functions being discussed. In no cases will I ever make a blanket statement that encompasses INTP and ESFJ where I need to list their quadra. 

There's so many examples of this that it is almost categorically wrong. For example, alpha quadra more than any other quadra enjoys lazily talking about novel ideas and also engaging in mild altering substances to aid interesting discussion without a push for action. Other quadras interact differently and have different topic focuses.

&gt;Encouraging it by having the terminology being thrown around perpetuates myths of these types having some exaggerated amount of noteworthy similarities.

They're not myths, we just have such sensor bias that intuitives shutter to think we have something in common with sensors. One thing socionics does great is cut through intuitive bias.I was referencing quadras with that statement

&gt;You're essentially complaining about this because you don't understand it. 

&gt;Which is funny because I could say the same about Socionics' view of MBTI. :PDuals are unlikely to begin a relationship except in specific circumstances. Just being an ESFJ doesn't mean you'll be good for an INTP. There's a lot more to it, but the relations for ESFJ-INTP have a lot of potential growth. 

Often times, people confused ESFJ and ESFP as well as INTP and INTJ, and mistake what would be conflicting relations for dual relations.

Duals tend to congregate in opposite atmospheres. They tend to not be immediately attracted to the other. They generally require a correct environment to begin relations.

Enneagrams also take a big part. For example, a type 5 INTP probably isn't going to have a good time with a type 2 ESFJ. A type 6 INTP would do better with that.&gt;Yeah the whole thing of 'you are incompatible with that type' like, 'INFJs inherently find INTPs boring' or whatever, thats very flawed. Individual personalities determine their type, not the other way round. And its not some rigid set of relationships whereby some types can't get along with others inherently. Despite how ESFJs, find my natural way of doing things intolerable, apparently they are supposedly the only type I should date. Its nonsense.

As an INTP generally you will be unlikely to come across many ESFJs. If you're in High School, I can assure you that there's a high likelihood you will not get along with ESFJs because neither of you have developed enough to appreciate the other's different take on things. Enneagrams also play a huge part.

Socionics is deterministic in their descriptions of intertype relations, but that's just the tone of the language. It doesn't mean a long-term relationship between INFJ-INTP won't work. In fact, benefit relations are probably better than 50% of the other type combinations. You have to understand that Socionics is coming from a traditional family-style relationship in Eastern Europe. Therefore, their descriptions tend to come from this arena. They tend to not account for individual differences nearly as much, or different relationship styles in a globalized &amp; western world where many people don't have kids, have little desire for long term relations, etc. etc.

How old are you?'Coming across them' isn't really good enough to get a feel for someone. Duals are characterized by generally not feeling immediate attraction to the type. If you told me ISFJ was my ideal partner type 3 years ago I would've laughed in your face. I was more into INFP and XNFJ. 2 years ago I befriended an ISFJ and it literally took like 3-4 times hanging out before even feeling like it was more than just platonic. Now 2 years later and I'm just as happy as the beginning if not moreso which isn't typical, and if you look at me I've had 4 semi serious relationships where I kind of felt in love but when it went bad I immediately wanted to escape (I'm a 7w8 sx type- literally the type least likely to stay in a long term relationship)

I identified she was an ISFJ and had been studying socionics recently, so I was like hey let me continue this friendship, and things developed amazingly. Our relationship is just sooo easy. There was no initial spark necessarily but it takes time for duals to feel comfortable with each other in a way. We've never fought, never get annoyed with each other, and naturally provide what the other needs. She's also a 1w9 and that is highly compatible with 7w8. Also our instincts are compatible me being sx/sp and her sp/sx. Enneagram, life values,  instinctual variants also play an important part.

Regardless this is anecdotal evidence but I also know two ISTP/ENFJ long term successful dual relationship, one ISTJ-ENFP, one INTJ-ESFP, and two ESTP-INFJ relations. They all communicate flawlessly and have good relations.

That being said, if you read about duals in a socionics context, the beginning is the biggest barrier to beginning dual relations. Once you're on the way it's the easiest thing ever. So the fact that you're appalled at the idea of having quality relations with an ESFJ makes sense.

Look, there's a lot more to relationships than MBTI type, but duality is accurately described, and you can't dismiss it because anecdotally you don't like ESFJs. INTPs generally have the most difficulty of any type IMO in being in *any* relationship, I haven't heard from any INTPs about relationships with ESFJs, negative or positive, but you can read about that type of duality on wiki socionics. 

This doesn't mean that any dual is the perfect person for you, just that your functions align in a compatible synergistic way(assuming similar values, cultural similarity, etc) 

If they're both describing the same 16 types what's the issue of them blurring together? It's mostly an issue for Ti dominants IME because they want things to fit nicelyI wrote that side bar entry so it's interesting that you think I'm advocating for only talking about socionics on that subredditTypology is not a sports team, you're the one thinking it like that. Most of us are completely fine talking about both topics. 

That's not even a good analogy since socionics and MBTI are describing the same 16 types. They're different interpretations of the same sports team. 98% of Western socionists began with MBTI to further show how your analogy makes no sense. Most if not all socionists don't think it's inherently better, just that it adds more to discussion in conjunction with MBTI, **not as a replacement** most are taking MBTI into context by showing a similar eastern theory that looks at it from a similar yet different point of view.Have you attempted to learn about socionics? It really feels like that I agree compadre. It really took me multiple glances to even get comfortable referring to things in that way. The whole information elements (functions) as symbols really turns you off. Especially how it rights a very specific portrait of types that are a little bit odd, kind of deterministic and different wording that makes it seem like we're taking an abstract science and attempting to make it like 'rule of law.'

Thing is, from what I've experienced, especially the tone of Socionics, comes from an Eastern European cultural context, for most Europeans, and people from the Americas, Socionics will seem a bit weird. Lets look at this quote I found on wikipedia

&gt;S.A. Bogomaz considers the socionic typology as a version of post-Jung typology and believes that on a number of criteria it is more perspective than MBTI for the study of the differences between people, because it expands the volume of the typological features and offers an opportunity to form various typological groups with different motivations, attitudes, temperament, perception of information and thinking styles. It is also important the existence of preconditions to study intertype relations, that are substantially not developed within MBTI. S.A. Bogomaz thinks that the creation of the theory of intertype relationships is undoubtedly contribution of A.Augustinavichiute to the development of Jung typologies

This in my view, is a pretty socionics biased perspective sounding to me. But it does have merits: While socionics *does* expand volume to include various typographical groups (previously not described by MBTI), it has tendencies for overexagerating the specific affect on type in certain situations, as well as attempting to define relationships as deterministic.

In some ways, the MBTI has created their own content which is what we consider 'MBTI' - if we are being strict adherents to MBTI much of what we collectively "know" will be diminished due to the generality of MBTI when discluding community analysis? So why would we discount Socionic content? Why can't socionics be used as a way to learn to better create our consciousness of our understanding of "MBTI" we're completely limiting ourselves by not broadening our understandings. MBTI isn't right, and Socionics isn't right. The truth is somewhere being described by MBTI and Socionics, but neither is describing it in the same way, or completely correctly. Enneagram is related, but somewhat describing a different idea, but it's close enough that it's quite useful in connected to Socionics and MBTI.

Socionics is used widely in the Eastern Bloc. It is given far better treatment than MBTI is in the west, which tends to coorelate with Big5, much more respected, so by that notion IMO we should allow peple big5 information with /r/MBTI to learn from that as well. It's a diverse typology community here. And it really has benefited us.

Maybe you're an INTP that breaks the mold. The theory still has merit although it exaggerates its necessity. There's a lot to grab from in the theory that, in conjugation with our community-created MBTI, can add greater consciousness to the understanding of the 16 types. We need to identify what is valid in Socionics, and what is not, so that we can grow the type of conversation we have here.I don't disagree. But I wouldn't say it's flat out bad. There's a lot of good information despite what you're listing.You said you haven't even looked at it or attempted to learn it. That's just intellectually lazy. Socionics was created independently of MBTI, so the fact that portraits of types seems to fit both "INTp and INTj" really means nothing because those types are actually quite similar in many ways. They are quasi-identicals which appear similar to the outside, but have substantially different modes of thought.

We have to choose? Are you kidding me? Do you not understand how what you think MBTI is, isn't really 'pure MBTI'? So you're abitrarily eliminating a potential mode of thought *that you admit you haven't even explored* simply because the personality portrait of INTp from one description is innacurate to you? 

Do you realize there are dozens of Socionics authors that have written personality portraits? Not everyone is going to like every portrait. They're still describing the INTX under similar function stacks so it's not like they have a completely changed the meaning of what INTP means for example.The users decide the content, not the other way around. Since socionics pertains to MBTI it's directly relevant, not sanctioned nor discouraged. That's what helps a subreddit grow, not draconian rules on acceptable topics.Often times I feel like the type 4 is conflated with what Fi is, and non 4 IXFPs are left in the dust for their description of Fi . Enneagram helps flush this out and create better understand of Fi as a function. Really good point you've madeFirstly, your premise is flawed because MBTI is largely community created. There isn't much that Myers and Briggs brought to the table besides e, i, e, i function ordering. In fact, most of what we consider MBTI has evolved through users speculation and changes to Myers Briggs theory by making it more in concordance with Jung. So, the 'original personality theory' is not really original and would be nowhere without community created content and renditions. In fact Myers Briggs is so open and general that very little conflicts between socionics and MBTI. The types are still the same, just because one socionist has a bad typing for Steve Jobs, doesn't mean socionics types are inherently different than MBTI types. ENFJ MBTI is still ENFj in socionics.

Users create content. Once you start dictating discussion content becomes shitty. Sorry, but you're in the vocal minority here. 

What are we going to ban enneagram talk? Big 5? Neuropsychology?

Socionics and MBTI describe the same 16 type phenomena, in different ways. Whereas MBTI was created as a corporate tool and to sell tests, it also tends to be too general and lacking application and suspect to the forer effect. Socionics while having more discussion between types dynamics(a main reason people learn about this stuff) it tends to have issues with complete accuracy, but that is expected with such a strongly built system.

Most socionic learners derived from MBTI enthusiasts and have no wish to segregate themselves from the MBTI community as they don't feel as if socionics is inherently better.  Generally, those people feel there is much to learn from both MBTI and socionics in their understanding of the 16 types. When people discuss MBTI do you want them to conveniently leave out anything they've learned from socionics? 

Censorship sucks, and the typology community is already splintered enough as it is. We don't want to thin out talent like that and the moment you dictate what users can and cannot post you're going to get a dead shitty subreddit. 

Fact is /r/MBTI is the biggest typology hub on Reddit, if you want to talk about anything, big 5, socionics, MBTI, Jung, enneagram, this is basically the best place to do it. 

I modded this subreddit for ~2 years and the only thing I did was stop bullying and ban trolls. I never dictated what could or couldn't be talked about. The sub grew from 3k to 10k members just by being more strict on harassment and low effort typism.

The community here creates the content, in many cases what we consider collectively to"MBTI" is not even true to form of 'MBTI' which in most instances is simply a test to make money off of corporations. There is no perfect system. Not Jung, MBTI, the community version of MBTI, or socionics. They all describe the 16 types in different ways. 

I think all should be welcome as it has always been a loosely moderated subreddit that creates good content. Simply because some members of an 11k+ subreddit want to tailor discussion to one specific topic is not a good enough reason for censorship.This subreddit has always been modded loosely, I highly doubt we will have high handed action from mods to delete comments and posts that dare mention socionics. Hows that duality working for you?Yeah I've dated an INFP 9w1 and ENFP 9w8 which have totally different expressions of Fi. Got some personal stake in that as well;)I found enneagram types for this easier:

Bojack: 4w3

Todd 9w8

Peanut butter: 7w6

Princess Caroline: 3w2

Diane: 4w3
Sounds like inferior Ne to some extentThat's wrong because INFp socionics=INFJ MBTII mean honestly this sounds like more a problem with him as well as life goals, and values being different. What you're describing sounds exactly like duality, but that doesn't mean every ESTP is perfect for you. For many people an SO that refuses to work out or stay healthy is a deal breaker.

There really is no 'perfect relations' that can be described via typology, and even if something goes against conventional wisdom(such as INTJ-INFJ) doesn't mean it doesn't have potential for success

Thanks for your thorough response though. Has a lot of personal insight which is nice.Sounds like similar reasons I've heard INTP/INTJ be 'jealous' of ENTP. It's called benefit relations where you're the beneficiary and they're the benefactor. Don't take too much stock into that small graphic, it's more general and you can certainly have good relations with ESTP but yes by nature they will seem more interesting to you than you are to them but that being said benefit relations can reach an almost spiritual connection if everything else clicks.

If you want someone who will be more interested in you find some ENTP ;)Those are super ego relations.... When they're bad they're bad, when they're good they're good IMO. mutual misunderstanding that works better if you realize you will be misunderstanding each otherThey don't have the same amount of rationality/emotionality. ENFP is primarily moved by emotional reasoning, ENTP by logical reason. Despite an entp thinking they're 'smoother' than an ENFP they still lack an amount of social grace that ENFP exhibits selectively. Despite an ENFP thinking they are objectively more logical, they lack the cold rational analysis an ENTP exhibits selectively. ENFP values Fi and doesn't value Fe but is more adept at both. ENTP values Ti and doesn't value Te but is more adept at both. The source of this being psychological types &amp; socionics, not MBTI which doesn't really comment on the subject (and is merely a test really). 

This doesn't mean either type is naturally more *intelligent* because that is not what the typology measures.

ENTPs tend to over identify with their emotional expression since it's more outwardly focused and ENFPs tend to over identify with their objective expression as it is outwardly focused.

The best way to determine if you're an ENTP or ENFP is to look at PoLR for each type.ENTP PoLR is Fi

&gt;individual does not normally pay attention to the nuances of interpersonal relationships; he is either overly suspicious or overly assuming of his relations with others when they are not clearly defined. More importance is given to these relations as they pertain to objective mutual benefit; entertaining one another and accomplishing mutual goals are seen as the main focus, rather than seeing the relationships as rewarding in and of themselves. The individual does not expect others to be actively aware or concerned with his own personal sentiments, and so sees little reason to be concerned with those of others, unless they have direct consequences for the individual. Statements by other persons reflecting their inner feelings are not fully registered by the individual if not accompanied by external emotional expression or actions. Suggestions that the individual may have acted unethically in the eyes of another person who has not clearly expressed disapproval are met with bafflement by the individual; those that are expressed without tact are either dismissed or reacted to aggressively. Expressions of deep personal sentiments are awkward for the individual, whether coming from another or himself. He does not see it as his "right" to place the burden of his true emotions on another, both because he knows how uncomfortable those of others make him (even when they are positive and genuine), and because of his own awkwardness in expressing them.


ENFP PoLR is Ti

&gt;The individual has a tendency to either completely reject or completely embrace a source of theoretical knowledge, but does not like to reveal the source or his adherence to it. He prefers to limit the number of theoretical categories he works with and tends to see new terminology, systems, and rules as being arbitrary and unnecessary until he at last discovers their necessity for himself through extensive personal experience. He may be able to express his views clearly when given the time, but he is not prepared to deal with people who challenge his views and draw him into logical arguments and disputes. For this reason, he is reluctant to publicize new determinations and opinions until he is absolutely sure that they are right and that he can support them thoroughly to anyone who challenges them.Depends on what you subscribe to but socionics thinks that INTJ/ESFP or ESFP/ENTJ (or ENFP/ISTJ and ENFP/ESTJ) have the best relations. Shortly after that would be mirage relations which is what you're describing. There isn't really a perfect type but some are arguably worse or better than others. It's more important that MBTI is not the only thing you take into account when making relationship decisions!Sally Rayburn: ENFJ (or ESFJ)

Meg Rayburn: I'm caught between IXFJ or IXFP. Leaning towards IXFJ though. 6 maybe on the enneagram, but haven't watched in a while could have that way off.

Danny Rayburn: EXTP leaning towards ENTP for some reason. Not sure about E type. I think they portrayed him a little more 'sociopath' like than was necessary which eroded personality traits. However like in the scene where Danny sees how Eric is making money from stealing the gas or whatever, he's almost like intrigued that he's making money this way. He has high hopes for making money at that point and eventually builds his whole empire. Seems quite ENTP more than ESTP and he seems like a Fe tertiary but with obvious issues. I say ENTP because I think everyone would quickly type him as ESTP because of him being a stereotypical evil character.

Kevin Rayburn: ESFP almost to a T. Good example of ESFP IMO. (At least example of how an unhealthy ESFP might deal with the massive issues that go on in the show)

Eric O Bannen: ESTP

John Rayburn: XSTJ leaning towards ESTJ

Marco Diaz: Potentially ISFP

Ozzy: ESTP E:8

Chelsea O Bannen: ISFJ 



I could definitely see an ISTP typing. That might be better actually. You would say he planned to get caught? Why's that. I'm not sure I paid attention close enough. You think he got caught in order to make his family look bad or get revenge?Is this like expert MBTI people onlyNot sure if I'd consider Shawn an entp his character seems to be a mix of ENFP/ENTP (not that that is possible in real life but they kind of portray him that way)Yeah you might be right, it's been a while since I watched the show but I thought he had something about him that makes him seem unlike an entp despite the obvious Ne Dom appearance. I think his flirtatious style doesn't seem entp like for example.Autism and other similar personality differences can make you untypeable in my opinion.

Source: sister has aspergers, seems relatively untypeable

I'd say for 99.9% of generally normal people can be fit into the MBTI categories.She's probably a 2 enneagram. My grandmother is the same way.Yup, they just want the changes to make sense. ISFJs and ESFJs will often listen to the NTP ideas of change as well as NFP.I've seen a few ENTP type as 5s, I think that if ENFP can type as 4 there's no reason an entp wouldn't lowly correlate with 5 as well. She doesn't appear like any of the types reallyShe's 26, she used to have terrible tantrums though. You're right on that but other characteristic nature's of INTPs do not align with her. I'm skeptical that INTP and INTJ are necessarily the only types that are consistent with aspergers I just think aspergers people seem to identify moreso with INTx, functionally she does not really show vulnerable Fe like an INTJ nor does she seem to have inferior Fe like an INTP (although I'd say that's more likely) 

She appears to use the functions in ways that are incompatible with specific types or she's just too different for me to find function order within herYes but I'm referencing the US versionENTP and ENFP have Se as a role function according to socionics, mean

&gt;The individual places very little value on the physical properties of his surroundings. He sees very little value in disputes over resources and territory and easily yields when challenged by individuals with stronger sensing, but not because he is afraid, but because he has little interest in the concrete and the physical and sees little intrinsic value and potential in this. When trying to achieve his goals and assert his place in society, he would rather rely on his creativity, imagination, erudition, social and verbal skills to move himself forward, rather than on blunt physical demonstrations, and vie to protect his intellectual and creative freedoms. He resents any attempts by others to physically "push" him to do things and rejects the idea of people pressuring each other to do things. He himself avoids the use of physical means of influence preferring instead to interest and inspire others. However, severe irritation and inability to change the situation by other means can lead him to sporadically resort to physical measures of influence for brief periods of time. **It should be noted that despite not valuing Se, this individual may speak of physical manifestations, or even threaten others with physical force, if this is within the conventions and norms of his social group, but the prime motivations here is social adaptation and mimicry.**

Since they're primarily outward perceivers, Se and Ne doms are generally interacting with the outside environment.

The role function for ENXP Se, although undervalued, does not exhibit a stress-like response as it does in INTP and INFP. ENTP and ENFP may hit moments in life where they are like, fuck, I'm so obviously unaware of my lack of caring for Se, so they relate to it in spurts of social mimicry. It's not completely uncommon for example to see ENXP in physical activities: weightlifting, competitive sports, etc.

Additionally, ENFP and ENTP coorelate highly with the 7 on the Enneagram. [Typically, 7s have been said to have above-average motor-skills or hand eye coordination](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7/)

&gt;Sevens are frequently endowed with quick, agile minds, and can be exceptionally fast learners. This is true both of their ability to absorb information (language, facts, and procedures) and their ability to learn new manual skills—they tend to have excellent mind-body coordination, and manual dexterity (typewriting, piano playing, tennis). All of this can combine to make a Seven into the quintessential "Renaissance person."

While I would not argue that ENTP/ENFP are on average better or equal to sensing users in their potential physicial abilities (such as sport) I would argue that they are, on average, more physically adept at competitive sport than the other N types especially INTP (who tends to prefer and excel at things such as biking, swimming, rock climbing, "personal sport") and INFP(similar to INTP's physical preferences, with more personal than technical flair) 

I would consider ENFJ and ENTJ to have similar potentiality to ENXP at physical sport but generally less likely to embrace sport for something else. I've seen a good representation of type 8 XNTJ in terms of weightlifting, competitive basketball, racketball, for example. And I see ENFJ frequently experienced at yoga, and often enough weightlifting. But I don't think they pick up things as quickly as ENXP.

In my experience as an ENTP 7w8 this has been largely true. I'm not really a sport guy at all but I've been able to learn a a plethora of sport-like or game activities and reach a level of proficiency quickly. I'm excellent compared to the average person in basketball, tennis, racquetball, catch(with anything), volleyball, cornhole, hacky sack, fast typist (100+wpm or ~120-130 if I practice) or anything I really attempt to learn for a serious(like 1 hour) amount of time. I don't expect this to be the experience for all ENXP especially non-7s but this is my general outline for what I think why ENXP *appears* as more Se than they really are.That's more of a type 7 enneagram thing, than it is for type.INTJ?I definitely understand the level of comfort with sharing functions or quadras but often time I have more interesting discussions with even diametrically opposed types like INTJ.... But not ALL INTJ. 

I think enneagram and instinctual variant can answer for some of these discrepancies, for example, sx types like talking about relationships, energizing activities, intensity. Sp types like talking about home building, comfort, ways of achieving monetary stability, food. So types like talking about social movements, politics, popularity, fame, organization.

I find that in general your repressed instinctual variant in stack can get bored with topics related to that.

Coming back to the INTJ, I enjoy communication and idea discussion with INTJ 1 sx and sp type. For business generally I'd prefer working with an INTJ 8 sx or sp. (I'm sx/sp 7 myself)I mean it depends on the breadth of what you define content with. I've generally found this to be true not as a defining factor but as a contributing one. Obviously when you look at these this way you're going to have a broad spectrum of INTJ life experiences. You have INTJ that may rock the long hair don't care hippy look and an INTJ that otherwise appears as the typical father figure white picket fence etc.

Within those contexts, you may find an INTJ  8 sp talks about their home comfort, reasons why they think their neighborhood was a good one to buy a house in due to monetary reasons, proximity to schools for their kids, peace and quiet from other people, the fact that they don't have a homeowner's association to tell them what to do.

Whereas a sx INTJ may describe white picket house location in terms of close relationships that they have nearby, or potential festivals or events that go on in their city, the fact that their girlfriend lives nearby or their ability to easily find drugs they enjoy.

So, whether sx or sp determines what type of house they live in is debatable, regardless the content relates to this house but how they describe it's positives will in some way be affected by instinctual type.

There's a fair amount of anecdotal evidence that demonstrates this but it's more popular talk among enneagram topics. In my own experience talking about pop culture, social groups, popular memes or products are a complete snorefest for me. I know more about Korean StarCraft pro gamers than I do about national Hollywood celebrities.


But I wouldn't expect that to be true of all sx 7s, but I can imagine that in the discussion of pop culture or popular items, they would relate these things to personal intensity, magnetic feeling towards one thing or disgust at something whereas a so type would discuss these things differently. However on average I'd assume the sx type is less inclined towards these topics.

But like many things related to typology, life experience and local influences such as parents and friends will direct conversation much more than instinctual variant, but at the very least instinctual variant is part of how content is discussed


Do you not believe me? I was like 2 weeks late on Harambe &gt;It also has the negative connotation of being pseudoscience rather than true science, which surely turns people away.

MBTI has this same connotation. As far as I'm aware enneagram is pretty respected in the academic theology circles. Far more than MBTI is in academic psychology circles. 

Just thought, overall I don't really disagree with anything you're saying. Approaching enneagram is not dissimilar to religious texts, in a generally materialistic, distracted, denialist society, approaching your deep fears and motivations is generally unattractive unless you're sometime inclined towards deep introspection for whatever reason.The enneagram we understand is actually based on a combo of Western psychology and esoteric Buddhism, Sufism, Christianity. The original book, character and neurosis by naranjo makes the connection between western psychology and the enneagram which is what makes far less woo than one would expect.

The symbol is Sufi, but Sufism is not a massive aspect to enneagram as we know it.

Other than that, enneagram has better test retest reliability, more clinical application than MBTI and more potential for concrete personal development.

I'm just playing devil's advocate here, I like both systems but there's arguably more people that consider MBTI psuedoscience than enneagram(partially because MBTI is more commonly known). 

Regardless, just because the western psychology scene is relentlessly focused on abnormal psychology, medication, and treatments for 'disorders'(attempting to break down any mental issue to biology and treatable through medication) does not make enneagram unreliable in a scientific setting. There's plenty of psychiatrists who use enneagram and that was actually the major draw that made more enneagram popular in the west (as compared to the spiritual aspect). Influences from the hippy movement is not at all accurate. The hippy movement and enneagram both are influenced by eastern religion which is why the terminology is similar. Any academic theologian would have no issue with the wording of enneagram as not intellectual, in fact I'd say quite the opposite.There's quite a few people that agree with him, me included. The only sources I've found for this concepts originate on personality cafe and typology central.This is far more an enneagram thing than MBTI. 3, 7, and 8 are apart of the assertive triad which makes them far more likely to take conflict head on. 9, 5, and 4 are likely the most conflict averse, with 1, 2, and 6 somewhere in the middle.

3, 7, 8 correlate most with EXXP and EXXJ.
9/5/4 correlate most with IXXJ, and IXXP meaning generally ISFP, INFP, ISTP, INTP, INTJ, INFJ, ISFJ, and INFJ being the most conflict averse if they are 9, 5, or 4.

Things get muddied with like an ISTP 7/8 or an INTJ 3/8 who may defy the reasoning I just made. This is why enneagram is a better answer to this question.

So to answer your question an ENFP 4 or 9 will be conflict averse, and an ENFP 3/7/8 will be more prone to conflict. ENFP 9 is pretty rare, but not implausible, I've known a couple ENFP 9s.

INTJ 2 though, that is actually incredibly rare. So rare that it begs further inspection to type.  Check out this link https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/36-type-misidentifications and you can look at every other type and its potentiality to mistype for 2. I've seen 6s and 5s with a T in their MBTI mistype for twos which seems like the first one to look at and coorelate well with INTJ. Also take a look at an 8 mistyping as 2, or a 1.  Think so? I wouldn't doubt it. Likely instinctual variants also comes into account. The sx 4 for example more prone to conflict than the other subtypes. I would say in general 1 is in the middle and not as drastically conflict averse as 9/5/4 which are essentially withdrawn types themselves and not inherently "conflict averse"...  

The good examples of 1s I know are two sp and one so.... the sp types are certainly less conflict averse than the so i know, but he's also an ISTP 1w9(slightly uncommon type) so and so he's pretty comfortable in physical encounters. 

Now we're getting down to what is the definition of "conflict averse" and to what extent does enneagram even answer that question depends on what the definition is.yeah I don't think they're conflict averse, just less prone to conflict than a 7/8/3 inherently.I guess then you're asking is conflicting meaning you're instigating, or sticking up for yourself and your stance/opinion##BOYS

Yeah I know two 7w8 ISTPs. I would consider them extroverts socially but with dominant introverted thinking stillI generally agree with your analysis however 7s have some ISTP representatives. While socially extroverted they still lead with Ti. Maybe those ISTP are mistyped ESTPs but I personally know two ISTP 7s as well as other internet people that type as such.

On the flip side despite not personally meeting an ENXP 4/5 I'm skeptical in the sense that it's impossible.

Otherwise I think your analysis is spot on and literally notable post worthy.
Short hand version


1= everyone but EXXP

2= all F types

3= everyone but dominated by EXXP and EXXJ as E3 is an extroverted enneagram type(this means you can have an INTJ 3 for example that shows extroverted and introverted traits)

4= introverted F types 

5= introverted T types 

6= everyone almost equally represented, considered ambiaberted in enneagram terminology

7= mostly EXXP

8= widely represented but dominated by XSXP and XXTJ (Se and Te types) with minimal representatives from ENXP and XXFJ

9= everyone but mostly IXXX with IXFP being the biggest representatives (the majority of INFP and ISFP are 9 or 4) less likely for extroverted types as 9 is a more introverted enneagramNot at allNow I wanna bang JohnAccording to socionics Ni is just as strong as their Ti and slightly stronger than NeHows does it feel to be on the flip side of this? 

I think people overestimate internet personalities which is a clear demonstration of what we would like to appear as.

9w1 is a super ISFJ type more than INTP which is probably why people think you appear ISFJ. Your tendency towards deliberation is a 9 thing. taking look at all angles, that's not really an ISFJ thing tbh and general ISFJ makes Ti statements that are heavily biased and not clear completely. You don't strike me that way.

Regardless IMO it's imperative that communities respect self typing because if this person cares enough they'll eventually discover the right type. Otherwise you end up with people with huge egos who think they can type anyone without taking into account potential personal biases. If you can't interact with someone in person, its far more difficult to discern type.
i would like to hear everything.. Pls tear me apart (also enneagram: 7w8 sx/sp)What are topics that you are excessively preachy about? I think you're probably an infj 1w2 sx/sp who just happens to be an ass hole(internet has a strange way of contriving us so who knows if you really are.. Though you do admit to being a bully)

If I were to pick an alter ego it would be ENFJ 1w2 or ESTP 8w9Do you find any issue with over identifying with your enneagram causing behaviors that you feel are justified?

What do you consider the best attitude and mentality? Or philosophyXXFP

XNFJBlazekin, cause he stays litRatatataI'm just saying he stays blazed and woke ya feel?Semi duals better than duals?? BlasphemyShe seems like a highly assertive type 8w7 or 7w8 (both more assertive than 3 variants IMO)9s are represented by virtually every enneagram type but are generally rare for extroverted judging types: ENFJ, ENTJ, ESFJ, ESTJ7w8 is arguably impossible as an INFP. Not saying you're *not* that, but if you consider yourself an INFP you might want to checkout 4w5 or consider an ENFP typing (in which 7w8 is far more likely)9w8 is far more likely. 9s can be blunt, they're not really timid, they just prefer not to disturb the peace. If anything 4/5/6 are more timid types (not always but generally probably)

In reality enneagram is like MBTI you can't just rely on a test to type you, takes quite a bit of introspection.That's very surface level, when enneagram is not surface level at all. 7s often mistype as 9s and vice versa because they're both positive outlook types. I think enneagram institute is generally a good source but getting a book is better (there's quite a few)IXFP and EXFP isn't a bad betI agree with Anna, Cenk and dore.

I think Amy Goodman is probably an IXFJ or ISTJ Harry is an ISFP and Ron is an ESFP just FYIBetas and gammas moreso. ENFJ, INFJ, ESTP, ISTP &amp; ENTJ, INTJ, ISFP, ESFP this is just my opinion though and I think ENTJ/ENFJ are generally the best answer for this question but that doesn't mean all people of that type have that type of aspiration. I've met ENFJ and ENTJ who meet the traveling, minimalist, religious/spiritual/artistic type archetype.Two establishment candidates run against each other.

There was no "correct" or "right" vote.

Until people realize this is not a left/right divide, its a 99%/1% divide they're doomed to repeat history's mistakes (thinking a sham election like this even matters, whoever wins, the working class loses)

114 million people voted, 30 million less than last election. Sounds like a good democracy in a country of 300m plus yeah?Yes? You're given two fake candidates that are anointed by big money and the media who colluded with them.. and they represent the same elite. They won't even let third parties get on the debate floor. If anything, many of the people who don't vote are the ones that are aware it's a sham. George Carlins famous exposé is the best. 

Also depends on what state you're in. In some states you can vote for good propositions like California and other states legalizing weed. In other states you can only elect people who come from a different corrupt party. So there are reasons to vote besides the presidential race.

Shaming people for not voting is never helpful, especially when most people disagree with both candidates. It's not about complaining it's about talking about the very serious issues that exist regardless of voting. It's not something you should tune in every 4 years and think you've done your duty by voting into a corrupt system. The more people become aware of the glaring truth, the better. Main takeaway is that the DNC and Clinton campaign colluded with the media to give rise to Donald Trump as well as colluded to destroy Bernie Sanders. The choices were never ours to make and the establishment runs on the fact that people think it's legit, and don't demand change.

They try to fit the debate/discussions/issues into an accepted discourse such as abortion, gun rights, and other wedge issues, in order to split the working class into voting into their elitist parties. Both parties have expanded war, undersaw increased wealth inequality, oversaw decreased personal rights, increased health care costs. I could go on and on.The system is designed to discourage votingMakes more sense now lolThis is more of an enneagram question in my opinionI imagine something like floki from Vikings for entp. Probably more of a religious like role despite modern entp penchant for atheismINFJIt's because vyvanse is a potent amphetamine stimulant. Probably one of the worser ways to improve social anxietyCheck out /r/nootropics for better alternatives. Anecdotally I like small doses of selank and semax Well the stack is not exactly like that, it's just a translation into familiar MBTI terms. Socionics separates by id-block, ego block, super ego block, and super id block. Which is really confusing to someone coming from MBTI, so the sidebar descriptions show what the blocks unveil in terminology that MBTI practitioners understand (shadow functions)

In socionics your functions that are part of your MBTI stack are "valued functions" and the ones that are not a part of the stack are "non valued functions" this begins to become important when talking about quadras.Basically this but I disagree with the infj, that's the ESFJ's supervisor in socionics correct?No worries :)Really EXTP are more confident in their tertiary than they should be if you look at it from a Jungian or socionics perspective. It's not as a weak point for than but still strides behind Ti And NeENTP, INTJ, ISTPYeah they're only similar because of the dominant and inferior function, but that does exude some serious similarities. I consider ENTP and INTJ closerI'm not sure if I would call the ISTP or ENTJ particularly pragmaticEntp previous meat eater now veganWish I could contribute since I took a whole damn class on thisCompetitive sport: basketball, tennis and weight lifting. Generally prefer HIIT to cardio for long times.Hey! I love the wire and the characters are generally typeable.

I agree with most of yours with some changes. 

Avon: ESTP (I can see where you say ESFJ though)

Deangelo: IXFP (I think the writers write this kindve ambiguously, I think ISFP is the better typing but I think he shows inconsistencies) 

Bunk: ISTJ

Freamon: INXJ (I lean towards infj)

Omar: ISFP Anyone can be immature, their immaturity is just put through a Fe style of talking. You may not see the same as them based on your perspective. Don't worry about it too hard, and don't feel victimized from their judgments, they are as much slave to them but you can choose not to have it fret youWell it's a style of judgment that's different. Between Fi and Fe. Your writing style looks far more ENTP than ENTJ to me. Have you considered maybe you're a 8w7 or 7w8 ENTP?

If you take into account that different MBTI types have different enneagrams and instinctual stacking, it's apparent that most stereotypical social extrovert/introvert behavior is far less likely to depend on MBTI .

For example. An ENXP and E7 social or self preservation subtype is going to appear quite social. The self preservation type will be more socially confident, but less committed to group causes. 

However the sexual subtype for ENTP/ENFP the E:7 is straight up the general archetype for the extroverted yet periods of "manic like" actions (periods of long aloneness at times but not missing a beat when hanging out). 7 sx fantasizes and broods enough to warrant a "sometimes introvert" title. But this is just a façade IMO. They're still extroverted. Despite this, you do have some E9 ENXP which may seem even more ambiaverted


Ti because Ti can easily and quickly call out the bullshit of society right now. Fi too when you think about it. Basically if you care as a person and want to make a judgment on socirttThis "until it is attempted" meme should die. We don't say things like "neoliberal democracy seems like an INTP sort of thing: super theoretical, makes sense in your head until it is attempted. Although that sentence makes sense for both terms, it's disingenuous to the complexity of the situationI honestly doubt there's a difference in that besides your perception. Also, anarcho capitalist is an offshoot of anarchist ideology which almost always leans towards class discussion &amp; abolishing class. Anarcho-capitalism does little to address class which is core to most anarchist philosophy. 

So to juxtaoppose communism and anarchist capitalism as the polar sides of anti-totalitarian ideology without examining the continuim of anarchist kindve diminishes the theory that Fi vs Ti values determine the the "type of anarchist/anti authoritarian ideology you subscribe to"Objectivism has a lot of flaws. Checkout /r/philosophy or /r/askphilosophy and read the critiques. What do you mean the Marxist junk isn't that far off?Well it sounds like "INTP is to communism what INTJ is to anarcho-capitalism" although I know this is not what you meant but I personally would be extremely more hesitant to categorize INTJ/INTP that way (due to the wide spectrum of anarchist ideas) rather than simply categorizing them both as potentially sympathetic to anarchismThe question then remains, how many of us subscribe to a form of capitalist ideology due to societal pressure, propoganda, and public education rather than subscribe to it due to thorough research and thought on capitalist as well as socialist critiques. I'm not sure if I would say existentialism really supports capitalism or socialism for example the way objectivism doesI don't haha speak in normal wordsPersonally it's always been a struggle for me to have any specific ideology that I adhere to 100%, I think it's most important to discuss and critique the merits and drawbacks to different ways of thought, rather than to pick one and really defend it necessarily. I've always been anti authoritarian in nature and existentialist in a way, but I've slowly leaned away from existentialism with some study in Buddhist philosophy which tends to find many "middle answers" along ideologies (like duality v non duality or determinism vs nondeterminism)

However, I think it becomes ever so apparent, the intensely strong critiques of capitalism make it extremely hard to find merit in objectivism, despite my younger years (like age 10-13) being obsessed with anarchist capitalism and objectivism and "create your own experience" existentialism.

I think that if you consider the Buddhist philosophy to have merit, the lines becoming murky along the idea that one's own actions solely determine their outcomes, considering kamma and Buddhist thoughts of cause and effect. 

Additionally, I believe that the discussing of ideologies creates a idea that finding the "right system" or "right ideology" would fix things. I think this is too much reaching out and distracts from a more important mission of examining ourselves and our perceptions. The fact is everything is theory until it's done, and one thing is for certain in my mind is that we contribute to our own oppression (mentally) and until we get out of the rut (collectively) then it will be difficult to address the economic oppressors and the power structure that supports themRead the sidebar entriesYeah I put those together because I think it's interesting to look at the functions manifestation based on order and supporting role of functions. You might like it but it might not answer what you want fullyOnly one I would question is Howard. Maybe ENFJ? Been a while since I've watched. 

I've always thought Saul was a weird ENTP. Maybe a 6w7 (as opposed to a 7 which is more common) he definitely is atypicalI'd buy that Putting Ayn Rand and Marx in the same sentence as if their accomplishments or intellectual contribution to philosophy is similar is an absurd notionIf you're talking about the historic Julius Caesar he was much more likely an ESFP. ENTJ doesn't easily characterize who he was, and Se dominants were generally the best generals. 

If you're talking about Augustus Caesar, he definitely fits the model for INTJCalling Ayn Rand a philosopher is inaccurate, hence why I make the claim I doA good true to form ENTJ Roman emperor was likely Justinian.


&gt;Unfortunately it's hard to find someone who is both an expert on an historical figure AND who really understands MBTI and cognitive functions to a degree where we can trust their typing. 

Very true, however Julius Caesar as an ENTJ is a common mistype, similar to Alexander the great as an ENTP (at the very least the reasoning for those are quite flawed) that tend to be typed that way because they are viewed from the perspective of us who see the greater effects of the actions of these individuals.

Julius Caesar was a great general which is how he became so powerful, upon returning to the empire he secured favor through personal relations in the aristocracy and political elite and had many loyal to him. The core of allying yourself to him was his big veteran army that would fight till death for him. 

This is why the dramatic change doesn't occur in all honesty with Julius. The bigger effect on his action is Augustus who fundamentally changed the trajectory of the empire. Augustus's rule was far more like Justinian's than the short dictatorial rule of Julius. Augustus was well known for not being a great warrior, but made sure to never seem like he was weak, selecting good on the field generals led him to success in beating his rivals. Julius on the otherhand was famed for being right in on the action and crucial to success, which is why he commanded such loyalty among the men. I believe that additionally an Se type would be adept at these quick situations, as opposed to the by NT types that would see the necessity in underlings who better fit that role


Well I base what I know on Justinian and the Byzantines on the history of Byzantium podcast as well as /r/askhistorian threads and the sources that were presented make me feel that his life trajectory resembles and ENTJ - excelling in intellectual fields, dabbling in philosophy and ethics but focused more on making a substantial mark on the empire. I think many times he exhibits inferior Fi and there are a few times he makes errors in judgment with personal relations and actions that would be welcomed or not by the people. Unlike Justinian, Octavian was gifted the ever expanding golden age Roman empire. Whereas Justinian was competing to be in the same name as the great emperors from that time. Byzantium is characterized by a gradual decline, and Justinian gave another brief peak. There were practical and innovate reforms that I can't mention off the top of my head that were a one focal point of Justinian's legacy. 

Another thing is how Justinian yielded power was indicative of an ENTJ. He had many times to make choices under revolts/rebellions and other issues. I may be wrong but I believe he also dramatically improved Constantinoples defenses and other things regarding that great city. His focus was definitely on lasting achievement and struggled to get his precise image to paper rather than struggling to find a long term strategy amidst the current strengths. I think that his focus on actions and yielding result as well as unquestionable delegation looks like ENTJ like than ENTP. I'm not sure of any great Roman emperors that were ENTP, so I don't have much to compare.I highly recommend the history of Byzantium podcastAll of the introverted types that happen to be 4s and 5s on enneagramINFP or ISFP but also INFJ Rare for F types to be 8 is completely untrue. ESFPs are well represented there.Where are these statistics coming out of your booty? 

There are plenty of 8w7 ESFP that saying "F is not 8s" is inaccurate. Well represented means it's not rare for me. In comparison, ESFPs which are almost if not never 1s or 5s would be "not represented"

8s correlate the most with Se and Te and thus are most common among ESXP, EXTJ, IXTJ, and ISTP. 9w8 quite common for ISFP


Also 7s are extremely rarely if never ENTJ or ESTJ. Mistyped 3s. EXXP constitutes the vast majority of 7s with a small % of ISTPNot that much tackier than all the other bullshit people wear. If someone wants to wear this who caresSuch a difficult distinction. He's an actor playing a role which makes it harder. His debate style is definitely not like an ESTP that's for sure. But he has all the physical presence/swag that an Se dominant hasNo idea why down votes your explanation is better than anyone elsesI just think it's silly that people think themselves losers or something for talking about MBTI. Botany, woodworking, art, performance arts, construction, trade labor jobs, nursing/doctor/ or assistant to those positions.Well quite literally, force exists to keep private property safe from the masses. Since you know, the elite 1% own almost all of the property and capital. So yeah, people value their property over people's lives (which is why we see the US government and big business go into other nations and mine their resources "free trade") generally the indigenous communities who's resources are being stolen get fucked because those resources are "technically" private property of the corporation, despite the fact that these companies have no connection to the local land. 

So yeah, the idea of private property causes a LOT of problems, because the government serves as an entity to protect private property of exploitative corporations.

Private property of normal citizens though? Naw. Found oil on their land? Mine now. Don't like that fracking is destroying your water supply? Too bad. Need to build a government project? Eminent domain. At the end of the day private property laws do exactly what they're designed to. Protect business interests against the working classRead about standing rock and you'll see what the true purpose of the police is.That being said I know an ESFP that over thinks everything I wouldn't ever suggest that destroying small businesses people's places is a good thing to do. However, we should take care of the people that feel the need to do these things because their life is such shit.He's an actor, actors are notoriously hard to typeIt's due to the auxiliary function being the others dual seeking function. The auxillary function is seen as malleable, impermanent, to only be used to satisfy the dominant function (in this case Ni and Te)

The benefactor finds the beneficiary somewhat too focused on getting the Ni out of them, which can annoy the benefactor because they don't want to make permeant Ni like statements, which would satisfy the beneficiary.

Although this seems negative, many benefit relations work wellIf you look at a that from a socionics perspective that makes total sense that you would test that wayAlphas in general prefer smaller multiple investments compared to gammas who are likely to fully put their eggs in one basket. 

&gt;  Alpha types are less likely to make investments that require long-term commitment and upkeep. They prefer short-term investments that offer a reliable outcome with minimal involvement.

&gt;Gamma types take a longer-term view regarding efficiency and profitability, giving lower priority to the short term. Likewise, they tend to aim at the broader benefits of decisions, rather than only at those affecting themselves, giving them an inclination for self-sacrifice.

Alpha is XNTP and XSFJ btw. Gamma is XNTJ and XSFPBecause ENTJs are Fi inferior and the most capable of mass control and domination thus they are often portrayed in villian roles. It's not that ENTJs are villains, they're just the best villainsI'm punctual generally but I prefer to set times like meet at 12-1215 in order to give myself and friend some freedom so we don't feel like shit if we don't get there at exactly the same timeSnapchat already has it all and they give all that information to the governmentESTP obviously but also ENTP, ESFJ, ESTJ, ESFP. To a lesser extent ISTP/ISFP and ISTJNo because I don't really know any other way to existAziz ENTP 7w6
big friend who I forgot name of: INFP 9ENTP. Sleep by 930-1030 wakeup around 6-730Who said we were actually trying to solve the problem ;)You're a better (wo)man than mostTinderThis is good lol and yes OCD ISFJ is the best long term partner for entp but not all ISFJ work with ENTP. Type 2 ISFJs will class with 7 ENTPs and 6 ENTPs likely clash with the 1sSocionics. Read about the duals Tell that to my live in girlfriend ISFJ of 4 years. We're a perfect unit. Never fought once. 

Duals don't work unless you care to take care if your inferior and tertiary functions.

The psychological comfort of duals presents an initial reaction that the extrovert finds the introvert kinda boring and the introvert finds the extrovert potentially "too good for them" just because an ISFJ is your dual doesn't mean you'll love every ISFJ and be perfect with them, there's additional factors in play, but in regards to what socionics attempts to describe and explain its quite accurateWell if you have fully examined duals you would know that it's not all flowers and candy. I suggest digging into socionics because it has much valuable information even if you don't agree with it all. 

Sure I like infjs but it's nothing like a solid down ass ISFJ. We've done lsd, shrooms, MDMA together, traveled to exotic places, discuss subversive revolutionary ideas. ISFJs aren't basic bitches, they just need an ENTP to show them where the ride is at.

That's not all ISFJs though. It just depends. But mine is dopeShe's definitely an ISFJ. She's not really theoretical, or ultra intellectual. She likes to keep things orderly and clean, make the bed, laundry, shit like that she actually enjoys. 

She has always wanted to do more wild Ne things but it's hard for her to figure that out for herself&gt;main worldview is rooted in a set of traditions which may or may not agree with the external world but seldom change for the subject over time.

The seldom change part of this is extremely inaccurate. Si dominants(ISTJ, ISFJ) are slow to to support a novel idea, but with evidence and reasoning are actually types likely to support something new. ISTP, ESTP, ESFP, ISFP, INFJ, INTJ, 

While Ni dominants are generally open minded to some extent, they tend to be hard fast in their personal conclusions. 

Se types generally will have to always see before they believe. This is not really true of ISTJ and ISFJ. While a novel idea might be interesting to an Se type, they really need to tinker with it to care about it.Polyamarous people are always the weirdest lol/r/shittymbtiThe guy that wants to sucker punch the guy but fails is an INTJ, his friend who's interested in the older guy, INFJGood post, but it does miss the point that ETPs are almost equally prone to saying incorrect or offensive things. In fact, IXTP tends to be more outright polite in order not to fuck up, the ETP thinks they won't fuck up but do anyway but might manage to not look like an ass hole. While their Fe is stronger than an ITP, it's not **that** greatETPs having a stomach or intuition that sets when things get awkward your things you shouldn't say is not accurate. At best ETPs think they have that ability, leading to a weird overconfidence in social settings and potential offensive things might be said, slightly misinterpreting the respective audience. However, their eagerness in social settings combined with excitement of Se and Ne is charismatic to many people,  strong Fe types think "aww cute look how he tries" and introverts (especially inferior Fe) think "oh look how much ease he has in social situations. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is just because the ETP tends to be charismatic doesnt mean they're actually that good at maintaining the peace through skillful understanding of the interpersonal relations. In fact, as weak Fe users they have trouble maintaining a good social interaction without help from a stronger Fe user. To call them as having a higher recognition of offensive speech, maintaining the peace or being conducive to social relations is not really accurate. Despite their charisma they often say offensive things more often than ITPs **because** their analysis of people in situations is flawedAccording to socionics, Ni is a stronger function than Ne for an INFPI think you misinterpret my post as maybe an attack on ENTP, I'm just being realistic here, your definitions are a bit exaggerative to the ENTPs prowess. ENTPs are not socially handicapped, and that's not really what I said at all. Socially, ENTPs rely quite heavily on Ne and tend to be extroverted enneagram personalities (7, 3, 8) which aid them substantially... and in no way do I think ENTPs or ESTPs are not charming. My suggestion is that their charm is not from an exceptional skill at Fe, but a rather basic and functional one that allows for ironic humor (aux Ti) and an extroverted fun attitude (Se, Ne). But has the potential to unintentionally offend (this is actually why EXTPs tend to be good comedians, it may be offensive but it wasn't personal and all in good fun right?)

At the end of the day EXTP are generally charming, fun, in spite of a mediocre Fe, rather than because of it. Despite mediocre Fe EXTP overestimate their ability, and that effort in itself is charming to others because it lacks the innate potentially manipulative language of an Fe dominant/aux. You are less threatening in that state. Similarly, it is charming to see ENXJ types pursue Se related activities, despite their mediocre skill. Likewise, the IXFJ will be charming to the stronger Ti types when flushing out their ideas, and will appear quite logical to the inferior Ti types. 

This is all coming from an ENTP who sees himself as pretty charismatic and charming, so I'm not really biased in this way, I'm just open to seeing faults that we haveNo that's not why, it's because an INFP (INFj socionics) has Ni as it's 4d demonstrative functionThat being said, an introverted type in MBTI can have a paradoxically extroverted enneagram type. Being an ISTP doesn't rule out 7. That being said it's far far more common for the EXXP types to be 7 than any other MBTICan you expand upon the entp critical skepticism in the 7w8 complex? As it relates to the Te as a demonstrative function?Sure it makes sense, so considering that a ENTP 7w8 type, you would say theres a paradoxical effect of demonstrative Te and role Se that conflicts with a wing 8s nature? 

I'm not sure if I believe that the 7-5 connection inherently asserts a 7-8 connection via the 5. According to some enneagram experts I respect, each type is to some extent a meeting point of the adjacent types. For example, a 7 is where the fear/skeptic of everything in a 6 meets the 8ish fear of nothing immersing completely. Leading to, archetypical, a 7, one who tries everything but tends to never fully immerse in one thing. Just an abstract example of the theme that each type is the connected to the adjacent types in some way regardless of wing. 

I want to hear more of what you think about how demonstrative Te and role Se has a paradoxical effect for something like an 8 type or 7w8 / 9w8Would an ESTP not be more comfortable with themselves as a 7w8 compared to an ENTP who deals with role Se? This is actually an amazing breakdown. Thank youRead about what socionics thinks. They are duals  (INTJ is written as INTp in socionics for reasons I'd rather not get into)Si dominants do things in the present so that the future yields the result of the previous action. Si uses how things are in the past to do things properly now to reach the sentiment they want from beforeI'm pretty sure that is how it works I co habitate with an Si dominant ENTP, INTP, ENFJ, ESTP, ESFJ, ISTP/INFP. In that orderTotally more of an enneagram thing. 

1, 3, 5, 9, 4 seems pretty irrelevant to authority comparatively. 1s the most out of here have issues with authority when it's not consistent or unjust 

6, 7, 8 have the most "issue" with authority. 6s don't know if they should trust it or not and may mistakenly support dogma and opress others, on the flipside their skepticism might have them distrust an otherwise trustworthy authority. 

7s have issues with anyone telling them what to do because they obsessively think they know what they want and dismiss others help for them. 7s have issues with authority if it appears to exist, if the authority doesn't exist in their mind comfort can be retained. 

8s have the most issues with authority generally because they see themselves in some way as their own authority - they will actively fight authority to establish what they believe is right. 

7w8 and 8w7 are you most anti authoritarian, I think I'd give the edge to 7w8 however. An 8 can usually function with an authority they respect, even the idea of authority to a 7 is uncomfortable and makes them question their idealistic and equality beliefs&gt;Maybe they're more just rebellion in general rather than against an authority.

I agree with this statement. 

Also 8s aren't in the thinking triad. The 5-6-7 is the thinking triadEnneagram 8 ESFP/ESTP followed by enneagram 8 ENTJ/ESTJTldr plsINFP by far, ISFP secondBasically thisWtf roots in Christianity? You need to reread the Wikipedia entry for the enneagram, the forth way, George gurdjieff, and Oscar ichazo. 

Enneagram is a Sufi symbol, Oscar ichazo father of the personality enneagram was a Chilean spiritual guru who studied under the fourth way school, he furthered the work of gurdjieff IMO. 

So it's mostly a combination of esoteric Sufism (Islam based ascetics which has influences from yoga and Buddhism) and you could say psychedelically based indigenous spirituality.

There is some esoteric Christianity involved, as well as esoteric Judaism (gurdjieff studied under many schools before becoming a guru, I used the term guru not positively but not necessarily negatively) HOWEVER the majority of the ideas are Sufi based for gurdjieffINTJs are basically the laziest type in physical terms besides INFJ (in general)They don'tISTP and ENFP are basically foils

You might be describing an ISTJ ENFP relation ?The function orders are different but they're still describing the same thing just in different terms. They simply organize the functions differently but an ESFP/ESFp is still SeFiTeNi in both systemsENTJs obviouslyThisAlfred is an ENFJ clearly. 

Rollo ESFP

Floki is an EXXP ISFP doesn't make sense

Everything else I agree with. Ragnar is an INTJ E8 surely. Whoever said ESTP I absolutely disagree withDoubt the socialists are even really socialists INTp in socionics is an INTJ in MBTISocionics addresses this.No, but your Si is stronger than anyone BUT a Si dominant user.

You might be relating Si too much to memory.

ISFP is strong with Si but considers it unimportant compared to Se&gt;Socionics and other stack theories don't explain anything the 4-stack can't explain.

Absolutely false.

A lot of the "MBTI" material here is rewritten information from socionics.I've been studying MBTI and socionics for over 8 years. Enneagram for over 6. Your time studying doesn't mean much, don't give me that.

Under the socionics framework, ISFP has strong Si ability but only uses that information to push their valued function Se. aaka all Si information is only used to back up the Se valued function.

No need to call me retarded. Grow up. Read about socionics if you're interested in this information. You clearly have not reached into the depths of jungian information because you don't know much about soconics.I never said ISFPs use strong Si in life.

It's an unconcious function that feeds into Se

ISFPs are strong sensors - that encompasses Si and Se (and this is directly quoting from Carl Jung the originator of this) --- but they do not display Si because it is unprefered. Disagree with Jung if you want 🤷🏻‍♂️

&gt; No need to, soconics from my experienece doesn’t correlate to reality (same thing with enneagram) 


That's your opinion and you're entitled to that

Socionics is, in my opinion, generally far more practical due to its intertype interaction information. I use MBTI and socionics for real life too, which is why you rarely see me post about this anymore. I've learned what's needed to be learned from it. Ne type 7 probably Traveling nurse

Foreign language teacher This is one of my favorite posts from the olden days. Lulz are to be had. This is the most extreme versions of intuitive bias, created by an ISTP to make fun of us N types.

&gt; This is just a quick list expressing my overall impressions of the intuitive bias that characterizes a lot of MBTI websites and message boards. I know that not all intuitives think this way, but I wanted to have some fun. - /u/acornzyall



If you are...



**ENTJ:** You are an amazing lightning-calculator of optimal allocations of capital and labor resources in grand global corporate or military undertakings. Your only weakness is that you are just *so* amazing and competent at everything that you often lose track of your ~*feelings*~

**ESTJ:** You can be middle-management of an assembly line or a construction foreman or something.

----------------------------------------------

**INTJ:** You are a strategic mastermind, quietly manipulating the course of external events from the shadows, smirking as your enemies trap themselves in your cleverly-laid invisible snares. Your mind is a labyrinthine complex of contingency plans and flexible strategies that allow you to overcome any challenges or obstacles.

**ISTJ:** You like to follow rules and you can organize calendars or whatever.

-----------------------------------------------

**ENFJ:** You are a giver, a wonderful friend, a diplomat using his intuitive understanding of interpersonal relations to manipulate the feelings of individuals and crowds for the greater good. 

**ESFJ:** You're good at organizing office birthday parties and book clubs.

----------------------------------------------

**INFJ:** You have the righteous introspection of Jesus, the charisma and principles of Gandhi, and you are amazing at internalizing the pain of others and empathizing with their true struggles. The only dark side is that you might be so good at this that you become HITLER because you're so devilishly smart and amazing.

**ISFJ:** You can bake cookies and take care of gardens.

----------------------------------------------

**ENTP:** You are a clever, quick-witted inventor, endlessly creative with loopholes in systems of logic and always fast with a joking retort during a debate. You're a whiz-bang lawyer or a famous entrepreneur, following your amazing vision.

**ESTP:** You can do x-treme sports and be a club promoter.

----------------------------------------------

**INTP:** You can be an Einstein, a Darwin, a Dawkins, an amazing thinker, producing a formidable corpus of thought and theory that will influence science and philosophy for generations to come.

**ISTP:** You can fix cars.

----------------------------------------------

**ENFP:** You are an inspirer, extremely perceptive of others' thoughts and feelings, a revolutionary champion of the downtrodden, able to bring the best out of everyone, able to get people to open up like no other.

**ESFP:** You can party and dance.

----------------------------------------------

**INFP:** Your richly developed inner values can blossom forth in an explosion of extraverted intuition to create new worlds and universes of indescribable beauty, and reveal an understanding of the workings of human feelings and ethics that is unrivaled. You are a beautiful soul that few can understand.

**ISFP:** You're really sensitive and you can paint pictures :)
Congrats to the people who have been able to stick around despite the yearly drama.

I wanted to suggest that we have a new, weekly, stickied "Type me" thread. I think that if we show support from this we can get the mods to institute this. This way, the subreddit doesn't get cluttered with "type me" posts, and we can have a standard format that allows people to give "type me posts" that are more than just a simple paragraph. There's a simple way to have automoderator create a stickied post once a week that way mods wouldn't have to manually do this.

I know there are multiple formats out there that people have used, I ask that people post their favorite ones and we can get multiple links for "type me" formats. I'm not exactly familiar with all the questionairres but there are some good ones, and better ones. I think ones that tend to get people to explain the most and point towards function axis do well, but others may have different opinions.

I also suggest we ask new users to include: Age, Country, Enneagram and Big5 type results, and MBTI type test results. That way we can have a better understanding of where people are coming from when they answer questions.

Also a stickied thread would allow people who are nervous about getting help for typing and don't want to create a thread, to create a post that doesn't draw as much attention as a thread.

Are people in favor?Fiona: ESFP (E type, 6 or 8 maybe?)

Frank: XSTP (E type 7w8) obviously frank is a narcissistic parent and extremely manipulative person that seems to defy type to some extent.

Lip: ESTP (E type I'm wavering between 6w7, 7w8 and 8w7) also see potentials of EXTJ with his character

Ian: ISFP (E 9w8, he acts quite ISFP and for example, military/police/etc. is often a common aspiration for ISFP)

Debs: ESFJ (E type too young to know, I'm only just finished season 1)

Carl: Looks like a budding ISTP to me, but he doesn't have enough screentime to be certain of that.

Kevin: ISFP (E type 9w1? 9w8? not as much sure on that)

Veronica: ENTJ (E type, 3? 8?) - she's heartless in the way I'd expect a Te dom to be, she may not show the same amount of 'epic master plan ENTJ' but I think thats a stereotype anyway and a lower-income ENTJ will look different for sure, that being said Veronica/Kevin are the ones often without money troubles and such.

Sheila: ISFJ maybe? Fe type for sure and a very clear 2w1.

Jasmine: ENFJ 3w2

Steve/Jimmy: Somewhat defies type for me. I'd appreciate input. If I had to choose I'd probably say EXTP 7w8 but he also has some weird ENTJ vibe or something.

I'd be curious to hear what other people thought of these people's types, obviously TV characters don't exactly resemble one type always, since it's acting and their characters are made up, but often times they resemble people in real life through E/MBTI type. People who watch get different perspectives and notice different things about them and get different impression. 

(Also, no spoilers would be nice, just finished season 1)
Hi there!

1.  I look at what the group intends to accomplish, and if their goals and means are sound (ethically and logistically) then I can respect them.  If they fail in either regard then I can't.  Same with individuals:  if they mean well and do well, then there's nothing to fault them on.

2.  I hate when people who are less competent than me try to define my methods (in any task) when I have already thought about the method they're presenting.  I don't like having to say "I already thought of that" when I know the other person means well.  Lack of social tact doesn't really get under my skin unless it directly hurts someone who I care about whose skin is thinner than mine.

3.  My memory for detail is pretty awful.

4.  I spend most of my time thinking about the future, theoretical topics, and defining the relationships and patterns I see in my environment, other people, and myself.  If I'm not directly engaged in conversation or performing a dangerous task, you can safely assume I'm daydreaming all the time.

5.  I would definitely rather listen.

6.  Could be anything, so long as it isn't about either of us.  I don't want to talk about my day or yours; there are so many more interesting things out there.

7. Depends on the situation.  I like being direct, but some people need some persuading and tip-toeing.  And yes; I wouldn't deal with an obnoxious party guest the same way I would deal with my manager.

8. I love trying new things, though I don't get to that often.  If I could spend my entire life just traveling, I would accept that offer.

9. I get a variety of responses: some people tell me I'm a dick, some people tell me I'm super average, some people think I'm smart, some people think I'm very charming.  Objectively:  I'm super deadpan and have a very dry sense of humor.  If you don't know me well, you will never be able to tell when I'm kidding or not (although I mostly am ;) 

My roommate thinks I'm kind of emotional (although only in short bursts).  My ironic nickname within my group of friends is "100% sober, rational decisions all the time".  

I'm quiet and reserved.  

If I only have to answer questions, I'll usually choose my wording carefully, but if I'm having a friendly conversation I'll speak in SoC.  As a result of always being in my head, I think much faster than I can speak.  It's a real problem.  

I skip to the next sentence once the other person shows that they understand.  I like getting all my ideas out quickly.  

I don't like to interrupt, but I'll do it accidentally if I think the other person is done talking.  If someone interrupts me, I let them finish.  They won't convince me any more readily by interrupting me, and if it's a friendly conversation, I'd prefer to listen.  

I'm usually slow to get out of bed, but once I start moving, I can't stop (productivity is a drug to me).  I have a love/hate relationship with my inertia.

10. When people follow rules for the sake of following the rules.  Also when I'm having a conversation and trying to understand an idea that they have and they think I'm attacking them.  The "point" is then, I guess, trying to play by the rules that reality constrains us by and nothing more.  I want the freewill to explore and learn and pick apart the world until it makes sense, and if anyone stands in my way, I'll gladly walk around them.

11.  It usually takes about a week or two to really understand the position that I'm in.  I've usually planned for the job/relationship/situation ahead of time because it always contributes to a bigger vision I have for myself, so I tend to grin and bear until it's time to move onto the next step in my plan.  That said even with all this future planning, I'm highly adaptable and I love when new opportunities arise out of the blue.  Literally better than sex.  But aside from these random occurrences, I firmly believe that due to circumstances of my birth (i.e. Being fairly well off), I have total control over the direction my life takes.

12. White, male, 20, liberal living in the Southern USA.

Thanks for reading this whole thing for me :) I have an idea of my type, but I want to get a second opinion.Me and Si doms do not get along.  I actually have a very hard time understanding most people with higher order Si.

But I'm interested still; why ISTJ?Haha, I knew you were going to say that.  Most people type me as a Ti dom (because they see inferior Fe I guess?), but I definitely agree with Ni-Te.Okay, but where do you get get Si from at all?  Peppermint's observations point to me having Se and Ni, not Si and Ne.

Edit:  My mom is 100% ISTJ and we've never agreed on anything ever.  All the ISTJs I've met are overly cautious for how narrow their scope is, and they're not very fun.  (No offense guys)Yeah, I'm typed most often as an ISTP in real life, but I think INTJ is a better fit tbhNah, it works like you think it would.  Dominant is your strongest, then aux, then tertiary, then inferior.  In ENFJs, Fe is first so they put more emphasis on Fe than Ti and more on Ni then Se.  Fe kind of drowns out their Ti except in certain highly stressful situations.  Same with ENFPs: Ne drowns out Si, and their Fi is a little bit better than their Te, but their Fi isn't strong enough to completely eclipse it.Even after the edit, I'm still thinking ESTJHi there! 20/m/USA

I'm studying computer science and statistics at my university because I've always been drawn to math and science.  Finding trends in data and the impetuses for the trends is super interesting to me.

At work I'm a pretty quiet guy because I'm always either in the zone or zoned out (depending on how busy I am), but outside of work I'm very social.  It's funny because I won't say more than like 5 sentences at work (over a 5 hour period) and I'm generally seen as pretty awkward (or at least that's what I think; my manager called me a dick once, and I've been trying to work out exactly what he meant by it), but then later the same night I'll be at a party and everybody will be looking for a chance to get my attention.

I was very into video games during my teen years because I was an awkward little fella with far too much (and too little) self-awareness.  I got burned out on them though, and now I get bored pretty quickly because they all seem too similar to me.

I thrive in chaos.  It seems like the more quickly I have to act the better my decisions are.  In the same vein, it's very difficult for me to get overstimulated or overwhelmed (which is funny because I'm kind of twitchy from being high strung).

I love chasing after new ideas that I have, but in the words of the Joker, "I'm like a dog chasing cars; I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught one!"

Small talk is difficult for me because it feels so static and conscripted.  We aren't learning anything useful or meaningful (most of the time), so we're essentially just masturbating to our memories.  I'm actually more comfortable in a heated argument with some depth than making polite small talk with someone who expects me to do the talking.

I'm as deadpan as they come unless I'm intoxicated.  My humor is desert dry, and I fucking love it.  The only problem is that new people often think I'm being completely serious while I'm telling a joke and my first thought is always "you think this could actually happen?"

I'm fiercely independent, but not for its own sake.  I usually just think my methods are better 90% of the time.  I also hate being delegated to.  I will hop up and volunteer to help anyone who needs it, but being assigned to do bullshit tasks annoys the hell out of me.

I'm extremely thick skinned, and because of this, I sometimes forget that I can't just throw words around and I need to wear kid-gloves with most people.  I bounce between being too accommodating and being too harsh.

I've never been in a relationship before because I'm ridiculously picky about girls.  I was kind of a slut last year during my depressed phase though.

I'm teaching myself how to cook (which is kinda hard on a college budget), but I love it!  I only use recipes as guidelines and I never measure out anything explicitly.  A little over or a little under never hurt anyone.  

My other hobbies include writing raps, playing bass guitar, playing chess, competitive Smash Bros Melee, reading, and getting fucked up with my friends.  I'll sleep when I'm dead haha.

Try me ;)Are you sure you're not an ISFP?  If you're typing as INTJ and INFP you definitely have the Fi-Te axis, your first paragraph is screaming "introvert with extroverted sensing", and the last paragraph sounds like inferior Te.You got it!Hmm... You don't seem like Te is high in your stack.  While it isn't necessarily indicative of low Te, being bad at grammar and math (extremely logical systems) tells me that you likely aren't a thinking type.

But remember, my opinion is not the end-all be-all of typology.  Check out Michael Pierce's Youtube videos for more information.Imagine all of the types working at their optimum level.  Of all of these types, it seems like Je types, generally, would have the greatest impact on their environment because that's what their primary mode of functioning dictates.  But what makes them different from the ESxJ types?  Assuming both the ENxJ and the ESxJ are working optimally, the ESxJ is trying to create structure in order to preserve what they've seen work well (Si).  ENxJs, on the other hand, create structures in order to change the world in the way they see it working the best (Ni).  As a result, ENxJs are seen as visionaries in addition to being naturally attuned to implementing these ideas.  ESxJs are equally well attuned implementation, but their ideas (in most cases, but not all) are seen as static and preservational (due to Ne and Si).I do this too, but it's so I appear slightly less dickish than I am.At the top of their game? ENTP.  In mediocrity or worse:  ESFJ.Idk.  If I'm not ahead of the pack, I'd like to fit in well.  There's nothing worse than a dumb ENTJ.ENTJ- C++We move to C in my next course at my university.  I'm siked!When you understand the functions, it's easy to say "this is how I want to be" vs. "this is how I am"I always forget that ENTPs do that (asking questions for the purpose of developing a pattern rather than for the answer itself)."Don't take this personally... "-&gt; proceeds to personally insult everyone who reads the thread.

Seriously dude?This won't be complete because I can't think of people for every type, but here are some:

Rationals:

ENTJ- Bill Gates

ENTP- Richard Feynman

INTP- Richard Dawkins

INTJ- Elon Musk

Artisans:

ISTP- Clint Eastwood

ESTP- Taylor Swift

ESFP- Richard Branson

ISFP- Michael Jackson

Idealists:

ENFJ- Jennifer Lawrence

INFJ- Noam Chomsky

INFP-

ENFP- Hunter S. Thompson

Guardians-

ISTJ- Warren Buffet

ESTJ- 

ESFJ-

ISFJ- I thought about Alex the Great, but I don't think historical examples are as relatable as modern day ones.  And I don't know anything about Tom Yorke.  The rest are good though.I get touch starved too.  A good hug always makes me feel dizzy :)I can't speak for the classic Spock, but in the new Star Trek movies he is 100% ISTJ.STJs usually have some words for me.  Like "you", and "are", and "a jerk".I just see these ideas floating around in the world, and I shove 'em in a bag and tell them "hush now, this will all be over soon".  Then they calm down for a bit, but sometimes they shout "Let me out! Let me out! I apply here!"  and I say, "okay there, little guy, just this once."While my interpretation is more socionics based, I think it applies equally well to MBTI.

When you try to define reality in terms of people, you can easily delineate certain discrete parts.  The parts that inherently involve emotion, and things that lack emotion (or you could think of it as a the set of values determined qualitatively (what we call feeling functions) and the complement of that set i.e. qualitatively determined values or what we call thinking functions).  This is logically complete:  either a thing is something, or it is not that thing.  

However, this does not account for the whole of human experience.  This only determines that which can be **judged**.  Keeping in with the tautology that allowed us to determine different types of judgement, there are things that cannot be judged.  These things are what we **perceive**.  

We know from subjective experience that we can consciously experience our environment in discrete, immediate parts *or* as a collection of patterns that relate these parts.  We call these things sensing and intuition, respectively.

Lastly, when we observe other people, we notice that some are more inwardly focused on their personalized impressions of things and some are more focused on connecting to what appears to be "objective reality" (experiences and ideas that can be shared and agreed upon).  We could also use a tautology: our experience can either be shared or it cannot.  This is what delineates introversion and extroversion in this context.  

So when we combine these sets of ideas, we notice that they take on a specific form:  you can have either introverted or extroverted attitudes towards the rational (judging) and irrational (perceiving) aspects of your experience.

We hypothesize that if you place more emphasis on one part of reality, you necessarily suppress another due to the limited capacity of the mind.  So if you emphasize your capacity for pattern seeking you suppress your experience of the current environment as it is because you are trying to link together these experiences indirectly.  This forms the N-S axis.  Same with the T-F axis.  We propose that the majority of one's energy is allocated towards one process, and less so to the other and we develop a primordial version of the function stack (N-T-F-S for instance).

Now comes the trouble of assigning the attitudes to these functions.  Why doesn't one use both Ni and Ne?  8 function stack models (which I like) say that we do, but we just find one attitude more preferential.  So while an ENTP may be good at understanding subjective universal trends in data, he doesn't find them particularly interesting or useful because he is looking for the objective patterns.  In the end, however, all ENPs and INJs are inherently pattern seeking.  

So then why do certain functions stack in certain orders? Why can't you be Ne Te Fe Se?  Because they contradict.  Determining actions through objective qualitative criteria means you are not deciding through objective quantitative criteria.  Acting on the present moment as it arises implies that you are not exploring the many possibilities present in the moment.  So then you can have Ne and Ni and Te and Ni, but these are different types.  Ne with Te is either an NFP or an STJ.  Ne with Ti is either SFJ or NTP.  And so on.

Here's some useful stuff I couldn't fit in in other places:

We also think that as one grows, our valued functions become more habitual and automatic, so we can put more conscious effort into functions we may be weaker in.  This is what we mean by "growth".

Since you can't use two different Je's (extroverted judging functions), Pe's, Ji's, or Pi's and everybody subconsciously recognizes all of the dichotomies I've discussed, we hypothesize that certain functions are linked naturally (Ne and Si, Ti and Fe, Te and Fi, and Se and Ni).  I'm running out of steam for this post, so I'll let you read up and draw your own conclusions about how these function pairs behave.

I like this system because it covers all its bases, but in the end, we have to remember the model builder's axiom: "All models are wrong, some are useful."  (This is due to the limits of our scope of reality, not because we are manipulating knowledge to our advantage, mind you.)These are just categories, they are by no means the end-all be-all of personality.   People are far too complex to be accurately reflected in this few number of categories.Oooh, I've been thinking about this for a while!

I listen to music for a few reasons:

I listen to rap to intensify my mood and so that I can learn different flows and melodies.  If I'm driving and I don't have access to music, I can always rap in my head.  Plus, I like going to parties, and rap music is always a good go to if all eyes are on me.  I listen to experimental music (Mr. Bungle) for the same reason.  If I'm by myself I'll listen to Tech N9ne, Notorious BIG, Jay Z, Tupac, and Snoop Dogg.  At parties I'll probably go with A$AP Mob, Lil Dicky, or Danny Brown.

I listen to metal/rock/reggae for the ideas they present.  TooL, Rush, 311, and SoAD have pretty well cemented themselves in my philosophies about of life.  Ironically, I listen to heavy metal when I'm in a chill, contemplative mode or when I'm trying to focus.  I think the your first impression is often the best to use to type someone.  If you use your dominant function most of the time then it should be obvious if the person you're typing is in a good mood.  The second adds flavor to the first.If anything, music helps me get out of my head more.  Parties without music are no bueno.Really? I think that about judging types.

I usually think of judging functions as having more criteria that they pick through, so they tend to stay in one "state" longer.Possibly, but I read over my post history (spread over a couple accounts) and I thought to myself "would an ENTJ write/do half the shit I do?"  Then I reevaluated.  It's funny because my understanding of the system is pretty much perfected at this point, but my level of self-awareness is still no better than the day I started learning.

It's not too bad though.  As big of a drag as it is to not be able to type myself, no one else can type me consistently either.  In order of most to least frequently typed I've gotten INTP, ISTP, ENTP, ENTJ, INFJ, and I was typed by a few people as an ENFJ for a month or so a while back (strange times).  It's okay because regardless of my type I'm pretty satisfied with who I am and who I hope to become.  So for the moment at least, I'm going to go with INTP.  You took my post too seriously, I was stoned when I wrote it haha.  I just thought it was a cutesy parody of the way NTJs think, but I don't actually have any sort of need to control outside of myself.  When I see it in others, I sort of take a step back and say "how is this situation actually hurting you deeply enough to need to subvert it?"  In some cases it's due to sensitivity, in some it's due to some abstract fear about of the future, and in some people it's just selfishly manipulative.  Obviously there are more explanations, these just seem to be the most obvious examples (and they likely account for most instances of controlling behavior).

In reality the way I think involves accounting for situational factors, I suppose.  In my mind, reality happens deterministically, but you're always operating on incomplete information.  The first thing that pops into my mind when confronted with anything is "what do I know?"  The list is created in my mind, and then my brain starts doing the fun stuff.  How do these pieces relate? What am I missing? How can I prod this phenomena to help me show if my hypothesized missing links are even applicable?  How do these hidden pieces (which only have a probability of being accurate) interconnect with what I know for certain?  Logical rules always apply, but is my information generalized enough to make logic a useful tool here?  Are my generalizations the best ones that can be made given the situation?  Etc.  But these things happen automagically and nearly instantly.  I might pause for a second before I start speaking, but when I begin talking again it's like a set of applicable ideas and interpretations is already fully formed.

Obviously, there are some places where this isn't useful or fun such as overanalyzing new people, adapting to new surroundings, etc.  There are just too many variables.  With that in mind, abstractions are extraordinarily easy for me to deal with.  It seems like the playing field is already set up before it's even brought to my attention, and I'm just commenting on the implications and flaws of a given framework.

And last thing, what type does my defense of typology point to?  That was what got me thinking INTP.It's logical, if nothing else.You have to remember that Kant, who invented Deontology, was also an INTP.  

Deontological ethics aren't really focused on the intent of the action, they are focused on whether the action itself is universally acceptable and applicable.  The essential question of Deontologists is "if I perform an action, would it be okay if everybody did this all the time?"  Consequentialist ethics, however, are entirely focused around intent.  Their essential question would be "do my actions align with my intended consequences?"

In this sense, Fe is more Deontological (due to its inherent focus on objective qualitative judements), and I would go as far as to say Te is more in line with Consequentialist ethics than Fi (because it is inherently focused on objective quantitative judgements whereas Fi is focused on subjective qualitative judgements).  Of course, neither fits either like a glove, because Fe can be used to manipulate others, and that is anti-Deontological.Verbal-linguistic; I'm not super surprised.  ENTP.Your post is totally inconsistent... 

Deontology does take into account how actions affect reality; it says that if everyone behaved in a consistent manner that was universally agreeable, the consequences would be as well.

Of course there are no "morality particles"; that's ridiculous.  That'd be like saying there are economics particles.  Both economics and morality are categorized as what we call "emergent phenomena".  Essentially, when lots and lots of itty-bitty subsystems come together, they create larger systems that cannot be explicitly defined in terms of the subsystems.  This is why we delineate particle physics from literature.  

You reference morality as the basis for why we should not practice utilitarianism, but as you said, there is no absolute morality, so why should we care?  If you frame it appropriately, according to your logic, anything should be justifiable because the objective moral backbone doesn't exist.  Sure, there are real results, but the results are something we impress our own subjective values upon to decide the moral weight, right?  I don't agree.

And rule consequentialism is essentially a hairy, hand-wavy version of Deontology if you boil it down.  Both say that there are sets of actions you should or should not perform (that's just ethics).  Rule consequentialism says there are subsets ("rules") of appropriate actions, but doesn't go any further.  Deontology tries to define the logical basis for which actions can be considered good or bad (i.e. the rules that define the rules).

To me, it sounds like you picked a philosophy to align with your actions out of some sort of self-righteousness without actually sitting down and thinking through it.  Please, don't discount ideas and then use them to support yourself within the same paragraph, and more importantly, don't shout down other people without a basis for it.Okay, so reasoning with you isn't working, and your logic is still filled with holes and contradictions.  Try this out: if I meet you in real life should I kick you in the chest, steal your wallet and disperse your money among the people I care about?  That would definitely maximize the wellbeing of the people I care about, and it wouldn't cause them any harm.  Do you you think this is okay?  Or do we have some kind of obligation to those we don't know or care about?I think they would appreciate the variety of different perspectives each family member has, and communication would be easy (due to the intuitive nature of their perceptions), although the dissonance in motivations between the parents and daughters may create conflict when there's some kind of pragmatic decision that has to be made (Te vs. Fe and Fi), especially between the mother and the younger daughter.Maybe lower Ni, but higher Ni would have been formulating and readjusting this idea for a long time.  If we think of our own perspective as a kind of filter which we use to understand reality, introverted perceivers (Si and Ni) stack filter after filter on top of each other to create a singular wholistic worldview.  Extroverted perceivers also accumulate this wealth of perspectives, but they try to keep these filters from overlapping each other so they can understand new situations in many disparate ways rather than one cohesive one.  

Here's a somewhat coincidental analogy:  

Imagine the workspace of a stereotypical J type personality (these necessarily have introverted perceiving).  Their papers are stacked on their desk according to relevance (date, time, subject, etc.).  If a situation arises, they know which stack of papers to sort through in order to get the correct information.

Now imagine the workspace of a P type (people with extroverted perceiving).  Their papers are scattered and without order.  To find the paper they're looking for, they would at least have to take a cursory glance at a lot of different papers, and even then, there might be another paper that pertains better to the subject at hand, and they'll continue looking until they've exhausted all of their options.Actually, I think there's a very strong connection between the two.

First, we have to ask ourselves "what are mental illnesses?"  The way I define it, mental illnesses are pervasive mental and behavioral habits that cause the individual and others distress.  This distress caused by deviations from mutually agreed-upon normal behaviors.

But how does this relate to MBTI types?  Well, all the types are are cognitive habits and pathways that more strongly define themselves over time (which is why we can't type kids).  What differentiates the types is the pathways that form.  When *certain* pathways become too entrenched (i.e. Only when specific habits are formed), the individual begins to deviate from "normal" behaviors, and we recognize these things as personality disorders (not to be confused with other classes of mental disorders such as mood disorders).

So in short, I think there is a connection between specific personality types and certain disorders, but not all disorders are related to personality types.ENTPs are the smooth talking, nerdy folks.  People always tell me how "stimulating" (not my words) I am to talk to because I'm quick to get a grasp of new topics, and I have the Ti-Fe ability to present cohesive, complicated ideas in relatable, easy to understand ways.

Is there any type you want to know about specifically? I could be here all day talking about the idiosynchrasies of each type.Tell me about your dream date.As an INJ, no.  They have significantly pronounced intuition compared to every other type except for ENPs who have equally significant (albeit a different type) of intuition.

The types that you may consider (if you strongly believe your intuition and sensation are both equally pronounced) are IxxP types and ExxJ types.  These are different from ExxPs and IxxJs because IPs and EJs have pronounced thinking and feeling.  

If you do strongly believe you are an introvert with similarly strong sensing and intuition and pronounced feeling, you should consider ISFP and INFP as your most likely types.  Oddly enough though, IFPs are more "judging" than INJs.Me: ENTP

Mom: ISTJ

Dad: ESTP

Older brother: INFJ

Younger brother: ESFPElliot is definitely not an ENTP.  He has no Fe at all, and as complicated as his insights are, there is no Ti structure.  There might be Ne also, but it isn't dominant by any means, and with all the time he spends in his head, I think it'd be hard to call him any kind of extrovert.First, if I'm not an ENTP, what type am I?  (Note: that's not rhetorical or facetious; I'm always happy to listen to someone else's perspective.) After self-study and getting information from others, everyone thinks I'm either an INTP or an ENTP.

I understand that Ne can appear very introverted, but it only feeds on the external world.  Without new ideas, the Ne dominant type feels stifled and becomes depressed, as if they are trapped in a metaphorical cage.

Do you ever see him sharing his ideas or debating?  All I ever see him do is amplify his own ideas in his mind rather than explore new ones, and he only acts based on the values he's created for himself.

His insights aren't logical by any means, he's just sharing is worldview, which reeks of Ne and Fi.  But it isn't the beautiful version of Fi, it's dark and twisted because he's just the Si "psychological mirror" (as Jung calls it) of the world that he perceives.  He speaks poetically from a very attached, very disappointed perspective; it's very unlike any PoLR Fi type I've seen.  Tertiary Fe is adaptive to external values (if only superficially) and detached from personal values almost entirely (personal values are a vague, flexible term in the eyes of an ETP).  He has his values, and the world doesn't live up to them.  He's too idealistic to be a Ti type.

So are you saying that if you're an ENTP, he must be one too because you identify with him so closely?The central philosophy of Ni is that everything is intimately connected on every level.  Developing Ni means that you more quickly or more deeply see the significance of events on a greater scale.  As an Se type, because you live in the moment so often, you should take more time to let events sink into your subconscious.

A great way to practice this is through focused meditation.  Remove all sensory stimulus that you can and try to remember an event that had a great impact on you.  What led up to those events? How has that event changed you from the person you were to the person you are now?  What does this mean for your future?  How would things be different for the people that you are close to if that event didn't happen to you so many years ago?

The ultimate goal is to build a highly detailed map of one possibility in your mind.  As you get better and better, this will come more smoothly to you as you become better at accounting for the details, and you will become better at using your instincts to foresee the greater implications of an event.

Think of it as attuning yourself to your environment.So searching for more possibilities and not forming a conclusion makes me a thinking dominant?  I think that in itself means that you have a poor understanding of what it means to be a thinking dominant.  Ne searches for possibilities, Ti tries to create a logically consistent system for understanding the world, and Te tries to obtain a vast expanse of knowledge for the sake of applying it.  Ne-Ti is exploring possibilities logically, and Ti-Ne is creating a logically valid system based on the possibilities.  I'm certainly not a Te type.

And I think you misunderstand loops.  Why would Ne+Fe result in only negative possibilities, in your mind?  To me, it means that these Ne possibilities are either shallow or unrealistic due to the absence of Ti, and are only aimed at making impressions on others (Fe).  Seeing only the negative possibilities is a result of inferior Ne.

I think you have a poor understanding of the system.This.  Whoever uploaded it obviously didn't realize that most people don't read reddit from their phone like he does.  What an idiot.Fe is defined as extroverted ethics by Jung.  Extroversion defines the outward flow of "psychic" energy and ethics is literally defined as principles that define one's mode of conduct with other individuals.  If a loop is described as a destructive cycle of the influence of the dominant and tertiary functions, then it's fairly easy to do the math.

It sounds like you picked a type that has cool people and then picked function descriptions and defined functional dynamics in terms of what made it fit you the best.  It's cool.  If I weren't, I'd want to be an ENTP too.When someone insults my top two functions I shrug it off because they're wrong.  If they insult my bottom two, I ask questions in order to get more insight into my weaknesses.

I'd say it's a matter of maturity and the type itself.No, my first instinct was to ask more questions.  I never called you a liar either, I just said you were wrong.  There's nothing bad about that, it's just a teaching moment.  But the second there was any kind of perceived contradiction from me, you just blew up.

And you're saying I'm probably not an ENTP? You just contradicted yourself, dude.  You don't know me as much as I don't know you, and you tried to tell me I wasn't an ENTP based on one comment of mine.  I, at least, held off for a bit.

Who's to say we're not either both ENTPs or not ENTPs also?  People are pretty distinct even within types.  

Now, if we can cool down a bit, the MBTI talks about functions as cognitive habits, it doesn't talk about prowess.  You can have highly intelligent ENFJs who have a better grasp of logic than an arbitrary INTP, it just means the ENFJ will consult their Fe more often than their Ti.

Edit:  Please don't call me an arrogant bastard or a shithead.  It makes me oh so very very sad :(Definitely not.  As an ENTP, if I were, I'd be omniscient.  I just don't think it's that big of a deal because I'm pretty confident in my Ne-Ti.  But if someone calls me illogical, I can cooly explain my perspective without taking it personally.Sometimes. If something bad happens, and I fix it, there's no point in stressing people out unnecessarily, so I'll act like nothing went wrong in the first place.  It lets me move on quicker.   With me, there's never any "point to prove", there's only a perspective to expose.  That perspective being that you aren't any better than I am.  You slandered me and called me a liar, at least I'm not a hypocrite.

But it's okay that you don't want to talk to me, quitter ;)Pretentiousness is in the eye of the beholder, *darling*.

I tried to imply some playfulness with the winky face, but I guess that backfired.

If you identify with Elliot, you probably should retest.That is very unlike your original claim that he "...is definitely [an] ENTP."

And didn't you say he thinks like you do?  That's enough for me to say that you're like him.  Don't go backpedaling now.You're right. I was struggling to find the right words, and I thought "qualitative" because it has the connotations of subjectivity, but subjectivity and objectivity are delineated by introversion and extroversion.ENTP: Very new people say my key trait is that I'm stimulating, but after seeing me a few times, they start saying that I'm confident.

My roommate tells me that it seems like more of a caricature of confidence rather than real confidence (although most people see real confidence), but I don't see either of these things.  It's just that I very quickly become interested/disinterested, and it shows too quickly in my body language.  I'm either at 0% or 200%, and I've been told it can be a little disconcerting, so I've been trying to modulate my expressions better.The only issue is that without some error checking on our part, we sort of blur the line between having fun and having antisocial personality disorder.From my experience it's a double-edged sword, which is equally badass.That is *literally* what personality typing tries to describe.  Now I'm done talking to you.  Bye bye.It wouldn't.Most people don't operate on enough information to accurately gauge the whole of my perception, so I don't let it get to me when people make mistakes in judging my character.  If it's accurate, then I made a mistake somewhere down the line and I fix it.The Day After TomorrowI mean, all a "perspective" really is is the way you habitually frame your environment.  These perspectives become more ingrained the longer you hold onto them due to the strengthened neural pathways that develop.  Simply, it's training your worldview.  The only problem with holding onto any one (which most people try to do, and I try to restrict myself from doing) is that it limits the amount of possibilities you *can* consider because after a certain point, your brain loses the potential to form new pathways.  This is why older people seem to be so set in their ways.  

I'm trying to train myself to be open minded by considering the possibilities inherent in different perspectives.  I mean, I've always been this way because I was the weird kid trying to be normal most of my life, but when I realized that that in itself isn't normal, I stopped trying and just started having fun with it.  When I was a teenager, I used to poke and prod people to elicit certain reactions so I could test these ideas I had, but that alienated me from a lot of people.  I mean, I already perceived myself as friendless, what harm could it do? (Spoiler alert: it can do a lot of harm.).  Now I'm still working out the kinks (you miss out on a lot when you alienate yourself), but I'm definitely back on the right track.

I really don't know where I was going with this, but the takeaway I had from my experiences is that every person (regardless of how similar they try to be) lives in a vastly different world with only a few tenuous parallels (the sensory experience that we can agree on) because of their vastly different experiences as well as the way they interpret these experiences.  I'm not necessarily considering future possibilities, but I am constantly aware that I am not getting the full picture regardless of how much of it I try to fit into my head, and I pursue it relentlessly.  (To summarize, I strongly believe that the red I see is not the red you see, and this principle should apply in other places as well.)

So if we wanted to relate this to the language of cognitive functions, I am constantly considering the possibilities inherent in my environment from a variety of perspectives (dominant N, more likely Ne but possibly Ni) to create multiple frameworks of understanding (N-&gt;Ti) by examining the way people interact and understand their environment (Fe), while trying (and failing to) become more in-touch with the world as it is on its own terms (inferior Si).I'm starting to get an idea... Mind if I ask some more questions?

Let's say that on this date, your SO (who is normally very outgoing, in this hypothetical) sheepishly tells you he wants to take you to a library.  How do you react?  What goes through your mind, what do you say in response, etc.Thanks, I always enjoy sharing my ideas :) That said, everyone has biases; I'm not saying I'm any different in that respect.  I just try to avoid mine like the plague.

It's pretty difficult to type people over the internet, so I won't say whether you are or not definitively, but the idea of "feasablitity" sounds more Te-ish (it has a "can we make this happen" connotation) than Ti-ish (we look for consistency; like mathematical logic).  So, while I'm not saying that you can't be an ENTP, you sound more like an ENFP.  There's a guy on Youtube named Michael Pierce who has some "Types Revisited" videos if you're interested in learning more.  I like him, but a lot of people think he's too monotoned to listen to for 20 minutes.1.  When I'm stressed I withdraw.  I'll become unnaturally quiet and I'll have a compulsion to do nothing but watch netflix and eat popcorn.  This normally happens after I've made a series of impulsive mistakes, and this period of reclusiveness is accompanied by self-loathing (it's not actually that bad, it's more like reflection and analysis) and recovery.

For example, over this weekend alone, I did a plethora of drugs, I got drunk and naked at a party one night, and slept with a girl I didn't plan to the next night.  

Sunday night and all of yesterday, the only thing I did was sit in my apartment, watch House, read reddit, and make sure that my vitals didn't drop to zero.

2.  I'm the idea engine a lot of the time.  As a result, I almost always take on a leading role.  It's fun because I can usually get my group to try out new approaches and we usually come out with the most unique ideas.  In an engineering class of mine, we had to build an instrument.  While most people were building easy contraptions (pan-flutes, bells made from water glasses filled with different heights, etc.) we built an instrument called a whamola.  Look it up if you don't know what it is ;)

3.  I'm usually slow to start, but I have unbreakable concentration once I do.

4.  Stimulating, inconsistent, rational, intelligent, and confident.

5.  I've changed friend groups a lot throughout my life.  Until recently, I've always had a "sidekick" who is more introverted than me who I drag into crazy situations.  It's fun :) Now my friend group is pretty massive and tightly connected (30ish people who are all super comfortable with each other).  Me and my roommate have a weird relationship where we'll always be doing our own thing, and whenever we happen to see each other, we always discuss our most recent insights.Possibly.  What kind of person do you imagine when you imagine an INTJ?Scout around a bit, do some research.  The cognitive functions are useful, but you don't really get a wholistic view of the types without some real-world examples.Those weren't the words he used exactly, but I think he's an ENTJ (possibly an ESFP).You sir, are no gentleman nor a scholar.  You should look to ENTPs for ethical guidance more often.  We are, after all, the paragons of justice and morality.I was just jokingYou sound tense.  Relax a little bit :)Imagine all of your sensory organs working perfectly, but your brain only taking hazy impressions of the these senses.  Now imagine these hazy impressions are ultra-clear and malleable within your own mind.  Now imagine that you naturally had the proclivity to structure these malleable, hazy, ultra-clear indirect sensory impressions in such a way that it very clearly and communicably explains the world around you.  Now imagine that in addition to all of these things, there are also an infinite number of these hazy impressions associated with any object, and an infinite number of connections between them.

My advice is: try not to think about it.Totally off topic.  This is what /r/music is forI was reading through the sub today and thought to myself, "this place has finally hit the fucking wall," and then I see this post and it's not even related to typing (except possibly tangentially).  Half the people on here don't know anything about typology and I have to explain every day or so about how tests aren't a legitimate source for typing, and we have people asking the same questions over and over and over again and the responses are usually pretty weak (save for a few people, there are some diamonds in the rough).  I guess this was the straw that broke my back more than anything else.Yep.  That is the definition of disappointment.I did misspeak when I said typology.  I was under-generalizing.  This subreddit is generally for the study of personality psychology in the context of the MBTI (which does stand for the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, right?).

Remote typing is awful, but this should be where we refine our ideas about in-person typing and other MBTI related things.

And no.  I don't troll, fuckface.Robert Downey Jr.Some people say ENTP, some people say ENTJ.This is where type descriptions and stereotypes come in handy.  For example, ESTJs and ENTJs both have a Te flavor, and if you watch some videos of them on youtube, you can start to get a feel for how Te acts.  Read up on the functions, listen to *how* they explain things (not as much *what* they explain; I have an INFP friend who's an Electrical Engineering student).I'm down.  Shred me to bits.N-infs use N when they've tried everything and nothing else is working.You are a TP type, but I'm not sure about anything else.Verbal Kint from the Usual SuspectsIt's all about the context that these words are used in.  By themselves they mean nothing.I don't think this question on its own is extremely difficult (the rest of humanity forever vs. 1 person?), but when you start to tighten the parameters it becomes more interesting.

What if torturing the baby only saved the current generation, and after that things went back to normal? Would you still do it?

What if for every baby you tortured, you could save one successive generation?  Would you torture a lecture hall of babies to save humanity forever?

What if everyone knows that you tortured it, but no one knew why? 

What if you were the only one who didn't benefit from the baby's suffering?

What if you were the one being tortured and you had the option of saving humanity or not, would you take it?Extrovert, Intuitive, Declaring, Decisive:  LIE/Jack LondonHaha, no.  Unless my understanding of Si is hideously flawed, mine is practically nonexistent.

Plus, I, for sure, have Ti/Fe.Okay.  I tried again with Declaring, Decisive, Negative, Constructivist, and Result oriented.  

It gave me SLE/Zhukov.  It's interesting because a while back someone tried to type me based on an interaction we had, and they typed me as SLE also.You should blow off some steam by moshing in the pit.  Metal concerts are really good for that.High Ti snugglebunny checking inI feel you.  For a long time I expressed things very liberally and poorly (thanks unconscious Fe!), but I'm good at expressing strong emotions now like anger, glee, or passion because I'm naturally very expressive, but the more subtle ones, like genuine gratitude, are still difficult for me (I'm 21).  Just like any other skill, you'll be clumsy handling your expressions at first, but with practice you'll be able to handle the easy ones fairly quickly (and that's subjective, I don't know which ones would you'd classify as easy).

It may seem dumb, but take selfies using a camera that corrects your left and right side (so it doesn't look like looking in a mirror), and try to convey certain expressions.  Then, after you do a bunch, try to label what you think they would be if someone else smiled, smirked, frowned, etc. the way you did and make adjustments.  Then practice.  That way when you feel the emotions genuinely, your facial muscles will have already been trained to move correctly.I recently posted a few comments explaining my ideas on a few topics.  Which cognitive functions do you see at play? (Note: you don't have to read all of them, I realize it's kinda long).

**Talking about mental disorders and MBTI:**

"Actually, I think there's a very strong connection between the two.

First, we have to ask ourselves "what are mental illnesses?"  The way I define it, mental illnesses are pervasive mental and behavioral habits that cause the individual and others distress.  This distress caused by deviations from mutually agreed-upon normal behaviors.

But how does this relate to MBTI types?  Well, all the types are are cognitive habits and pathways that more strongly define themselves over time (which is why we can't type kids).  What differentiates the types is the pathways that form.  When *certain* pathways become too entrenched (i.e. Only when specific habits are formed), the individual begins to deviate from "normal" behaviors, and we recognize these things as personality disorders (not to be confused with other classes of mental disorders such as mood disorders).

So in short, I think there is a connection between specific personality types and certain disorders, but not all disorders are related to personality types."

**Explaining Pi vs Pe:**

"Maybe lower Ni, but higher Ni would have been formulating and readjusting this idea for a long time.  If we think of our own perspective as a kind of filter which we use to understand reality, introverted perceivers (Si and Ni) stack filter after filter on top of each other to create a singular wholistic worldview.  Extroverted perceivers also accumulate this wealth of perspectives, but they try to keep these filters from overlapping each other so they can understand new situations in many disparate ways rather than one cohesive one.  

Here's a somewhat coincidental analogy:  

Imagine the workspace of a stereotypical J type personality (these necessarily have introverted perceiving).  Their papers are stacked on their desk according to relevance (date, time, subject, etc.).  If a situation arises, they know which stack of papers to sort through in order to get the correct information.

Now imagine the workspace of a P type (people with extroverted perceiving).  Their papers are scattered and without order.  To find the paper they're looking for, they would at least have to take a cursory glance at a lot of different papers, and even then, there might be another paper that pertains better to the subject at hand, and they'll continue looking until they've exhausted all of their options."

**Clarifying the differences between Deontology and Consequentialism:**

"You have to remember that Kant, who invented Deontology, was also an INTP.  

Deontological ethics aren't really focused on the intent of the action, they are focused on whether the action itself is universally acceptable and applicable.  The essential question of Deontologists is "if I perform an action, would it be okay if everybody did this all the time?"  Consequentialist ethics, however, are entirely focused around intent.  Their essential question would be "do my actions align with my intended consequences?"

In this sense, Fe is more Deontological (due to its inherent focus on objective qualitative judements), and I would go as far as to say Te is more in line with Consequentialist ethics than Fi (because it is inherently focused on objective quantitative judgements whereas Fi is focused on subjective qualitative judgements).  Of course, neither fits either like a glove, because Fe can be used to manipulate others, and that is anti-Deontological."

**Defending the validity of MBTI through Socionics:**

"While my interpretation is more socionics based, I think it applies equally well to MBTI.

When you try to define reality in terms of people, you can easily delineate certain discrete parts.  The parts that inherently involve emotion, and things that lack emotion (or you could think of it as a the set of values determined qualitatively (what we call feeling functions) and the complement of that set i.e. qualitatively determined values or what we call thinking functions).  This is logically complete:  either a thing is something, or it is not that thing.  

However, this does not account for the whole of human experience.  This only determines that which can be **judged**.  Keeping in with the tautology that allowed us to determine different types of judgement, there are things that cannot be judged.  These things are what we **perceive**.  

We know from subjective experience that we can consciously experience our environment in discrete, immediate parts *or* as a collection of patterns that relate these parts.  We call these things sensing and intuition, respectively.

Lastly, when we observe other people, we notice that some are more inwardly focused on their personalized impressions of things and some are more focused on connecting to what appears to be "objective reality" (experiences and ideas that can be shared and agreed upon).  We could also use a tautology: our experience can either be shared or it cannot.  This is what delineates introversion and extroversion in this context.  

So when we combine these sets of ideas, we notice that they take on a specific form:  you can have either introverted or extroverted attitudes towards the rational (judging) and irrational (perceiving) aspects of your experience.

We hypothesize that if you place more emphasis on one part of reality, you necessarily suppress another due to the limited capacity of the mind.  So if you emphasize your capacity for pattern seeking you suppress your experience of the current environment as it is because you are trying to link together these experiences indirectly.  This forms the N-S axis.  Same with the T-F axis.  We propose that the majority of one's energy is allocated towards one process, and less so to the other and we develop a primordial version of the function stack (N-T-F-S for instance).

Now comes the trouble of assigning the attitudes to these functions.  Why doesn't one use both Ni and Ne?  8 function stack models (which I like) say that we do, but we just find one attitude more preferential.  So while an ENTP may be good at understanding subjective universal trends in data, he doesn't find them particularly interesting or useful because he is looking for the objective patterns.  In the end, however, all ENPs and INJs are inherently pattern seeking.  

So then why do certain functions stack in certain orders? Why can't you be Ne Te Fe Se?  Because they contradict.  Determining actions through objective qualitative criteria means you are not deciding through objective quantitative criteria.  Acting on the present moment as it arises implies that you are not exploring the many possibilities present in the moment.  So then you can have Ne and Ni and Te and Ni, but these are different types.  Ne with Te is either an NFP or an STJ.  Ne with Ti is either SFJ or NTP.  And so on.

Here's some useful stuff I couldn't fit in in other places:

We also think that as one grows, our valued functions become more habitual and automatic, so we can put more conscious effort into functions we may be weaker in.  This is what we mean by "growth".

Since you can't use two different Je's (extroverted judging functions), Pe's, Ji's, or Pi's and everybody subconsciously recognizes all of the dichotomies I've discussed, we hypothesize that certain functions are linked naturally (Ne and Si, Ti and Fe, Te and Fi, and Se and Ni).  I'm running out of steam for this post, so I'll let you read up and draw your own conclusions about how these function pairs behave.

I like this system because it covers all its bases, but in the end, we have to remember the model builder's axiom: "All models are wrong, some are useful."  (This is due to the limits of our scope of reality, not because we are manipulating knowledge to our advantage, mind you.)"I'm trying to clear the clutter of Type Me posts by compiling the stories and self-typing methods of those of you who are very certain of your type into a helpful guide for newcomers who might not understand this complicated system as well as they might think.  My end goal is to help people identify their own behaviors and thought processes accurately and to help them to translate these things into Jungian psychology terms so that they can get a better understanding of themselves and others.

Because people correlate it with "smart"Yeah, no...&gt; If you're finding that you're exhausted and start to lose your social momentum and energy that is not your natural function

Social extroversion has nothing to do with the functions, other than a minor correlation between it and functional extraversion.  

Functions don't decide or control socialisation.  Function definitions, personal observation and first hand experience. 

You're supporting the guy making the claim. How about you show me the evidence to support your claim? Because at the moment, it's just some easy to make comments with no support. No, you're not...&gt; Burden of proof lies on you

It lies with the OP actually, as the one who made the initial claim.

&gt; What evidence do you have to support the conclusion that I'm supporting the OP?

The fact that you place a burden of responsibility on me to support my position that is apparently greater than the burden you replace on the OP

The fact that you show indication of having a position yourself, when you state my claim is "counter to MBTI and Jung" whilst refuting the OPs claims.

&gt; I've mostly been asking you to support your position

Which you didn't do to the OP...

&gt; From Jung, introducing the attitude types: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4s9whk/if_youre_socially_introverted_then_youre_also/d58112i

Firstly, that comment references a quote that differentiates between extroverts and introverts.  It doesn't do much more than that, and doesn't meaningfully tie back in to our discussion on either side.

The same is true of the discussion that flows on from there.  

&gt; MBTI on Extraversion: http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/extraversion-or-introversion.htm

I think we're both in agreement that there is some level of correlation between extraverted functions and socially extroverted.  However, that doesn't make them the same thing.  For example, that link you produced lists non social elements against E and I.

As a counter, I offer this, which includes some direct quotes from Jung on the nature of extraversion http://www.nyaap.org/jung-lexicon/e/#extraversion

Note how it is clearly and distinctly not social extroversion he is talking about.Then we're actually in agreement, because my whole argument has been that the OPs claim that your functional extraversion/introversion directly equals your social extroversion/introversion is incorrect. 

And you seem to be of the same opinion. &gt; When someone thinks they're a type, and you think they are not that type, why won't you shut the fuck up?

Because I'm more interested in discussion and debate than I am in creating a happy fuzzy friend land sub.&gt; Starting with "you're wrong and here's why" shuts down discussion and debate.

I hope you see the irony here?  You're basically doing exactly what you're accusing me of.  Doubly ironic, because your assessment of my approach is so off base...

There are ways of disagreeing with someone that encourages discussion, and there are ways that shut down discussion.  The former interests me, the latter does not.Ah, so troll it is...

Of course both, but I won't use to latter as a reason to avoid the former.  Secondary Ne means you have a dominant Xi.  And that's where you'll notice the difference.  The dominant function being introverted means you have a primary internal focus, with your Ne feeding in to that.

And introverted dominant judging functions mean that your guideposts for getting through they day are internal.  The "real world" takes a back seat to your internal world.  At 40, I'm learning Spanish.  I'm doing it because my mid life crisis is manifesting by me trying to vanquish things I've traditionally seen myself as unsuited to or not good at.  Learning languages is one of those things.I tried in school (so a long time ago) and found it incredibly difficult, as the learning style required is something I am particularly awful at (rote memorisation).

I'm finding it better these days, thanks to apps, but it's still not something that comes naturally to me.  There is no "big picture" that connects it all together, just a bunch of rough rules, full of exceptions, and ultimately, it just comes down to finding ways to remember it.Haven't tried it no.  I'm using duolingo and memrise at the moment, which are doing pretty well for helping me with the basics.  I'm driven by technology, so that's helping me keep at it.  

At least the president gets you...&gt; i tend to treat a romantic relationship like a friendship. i really struggle with showing affection, even the simple stuff like saying 'i love you' every once in a while. mostly i just love to tease and do stuff with them. which isn't any different from my friendships.

Can so relate to this...Infinite and open minded are not on the same spectrum.  Without context, it's a meaningless question...No one? Don't think I've ever experienced that...As in charmed by? I don't think I've ever felt that...  I've got things that interest me, some intensely, and I've got music and the like that brings back emotions and memories, but I wouldn't describe any of that as captivating...Incredibly importantThose are some wise wordsI'm an extrovert in MBTI and cognitive function terms, though socially, ambivert probably describes me more accurately. 

Socially I'm slightly awkward and struggle with small talk and discussion that isn't *about* something. I don't like parties or anything else where the point is just to enjoy being around other people for its own sake. 

Yet I love being around people. If we're talking about something I'm passionate about, or trying to solve a problem, I need people to experience it properly. But once shop talk is over and it's time for after work drinks, I'm suddenly uncomfortable with the people I've just enjoyed spending 8 hours talking withI pretty much have no mental image making capability. I can look at my own son, and when I close my eyes, I am unable to bring an image of him to mind. I get the emotions and the feelings, and I can manually list his physical characteristics if required, but i can't picture him in the literal sense. 

The same is true of reading and pretty much any other mental visualisation. Yeah, I read about it earlier this year, and I've wondered if I have it.  My mother seems to have the same issues as me.  She described trying to buy a pattern to sew something when she was younger, and being completely unable to visualise the final dress in a different colour to the one in the picture.  

That being said, it's not complete for me.  I can visualise basic 2D shapes and a sort of vague outline/silhouette for people.  But I don't have trouble recognising people's faces, which is apparently a common element of it.  

And I have no trouble navigating an imaginary 3D space in my mind.  I can manipulate it, deform it and all sorts of things, but I can't give it details or colours etcAn important and inevitable part of ongoing social change. We were asked to avoid arguing...Whatever.  My opinion is on feminism as a whole.  There are individuals and movements within the larger movement that I disagree with, but that doesn't decide my opinion of the movement at largeAnd I'd say that that is a distraction that plays undue emphasis on a part of the whole which in turn diminishes the whole movement. It is thus a useful tool for people who oppose feminism to distract from the real issues, so I don't get caught up in it. I'm an ENTP, it's in my blood too. But I'm playing nice&gt; The idea that gender roles can be flushed down the drain is completely unsubstantiated

So is the idea that they have to be protected and enforced...  If so ingrained, then there should be no need to explicitly protect them.

&gt; So much of what gives us meaning is embedded in these roles

So much of what gives *some* of us meaning.  For others, it's a constant cause of frustration and angst.  I've been faking gender normality most of my life.  

&gt; The dignity of a man working and providing for his family.

There's nothing inherently masculine about this...  Even if it's a biological drive hardwired in to most men, that still doesn't restrict it only to men.

And speaking as someone born male, personally, I've always been uncomfortable with this expectation on me.  I do it, but I feel trapped by it, not fulfilled.  I'd much rather have been caring for my son during his formative years by being a stay at home father and educator.  &gt; Does this mean that this type of person is more concerned with obtaining information than with using it?

That pretty much describes me...&gt; The way I do things - Ti

Ti could care less about doing things...&gt; For the most part Ti is about understanding things. But once I understand it, I *can* do things with my understanding which is outright bizarre to most people

I amended your comment to make it more accurate.  You seem to be placing emphasis on the doing, but in reality, that's an afterthought.  The emphasis in on understanding.  Sure, understanding lets you implement, but that's a bonus, not the goal.I've always wanted kids.  But suffice to say, I'm non traditional when it comes to parenting :)Not a problem I have.  People are welcome to try and type me, and I'm only too happy to argue with them if they mistype me :)Except for being lost in your head all the time, you could be describing me and my life.Very poorly. I generally pretend my emotions don't exist and then get grumpy and snappy to people around me.&gt; The T functions strictly have to do with raw logic

Sure, but no one is driven completely by them, nor does anyone have their values completely shaped by them.  You may like to pretend that you're not an emotional being, but you are.  We all are.  Even a preference towards logical thinking does not alter that.Your whole argument presupposes the idea that "logical thinking" is objectively better than feeling.

I hope you see that that very statement is driven from an non rational position. You view it as superior because it aligns with your own worldview, and you in turn believe that your worldview is superior.  To believe otherwise is to face cognitive dissonance, which we all try and avoid.

Were your position arrived at from a purely logical and rational line of thinking, you'd be able to elucidate *how* it's superior.  And you're going to have trouble doing that, because so much of humanities success comes from the fact that we are social, communal beings.  And that social cohesion is a direct result of the empathy and feeling that "feelers" favour.  

Yes, we get significant advances and advantages as a race from our thinkers, but the society that they exist in that allowed them to develop those advances in the first place is a product of feelers.

It really is a case of "different but equal" &gt; Society is also built by thinkers. 

Sure.  When they tap in to their empathic side.  Which is to say when they don't approach it from a rational perspective.  

Sure, they may rationally know that a cohesive society is needed to succeed, but actually fitting in to that society is not a rational process.  

&gt; And adding the fact that thinkers can socialize just as well if not better than feelers.

Sure, but some feelers can rationalise just as well or better than thinkers.  The functions are not a measure of ability, only preference.  

&gt; I don't see how being "social" or "maintaining a society" is an exclusive feeler thing.

It's a product of the "feeling functions".  Which all Thinkers have as well...  

And I note, your argument is still pre-supposing the idea that Thinking is better than Feeling, which is something you've yet to demonstrate to be true.  Until you can knock *that* issue over, your entire position remains one based on emotion rather than rationality.  &gt; Logic is the process of how things work. 

Yes

&gt; It is the most important thing in the world. Because without it, we'd still be in the stone/cave man age where humans had no idea how things work.

This doesn't follow though.  Sure, it was essential to get where we are.  But it's not the *only* part of the puzzle, so it doesn't follow that it's the *most* important part.  There were many other elements, one of the most critical of which is cohesive societies.  Like a stool with 3 legs, if you kick one out, it falls over.  It's hard to argue you're the most important leg in that case...

&gt; Without feeling the world can still function.

Depends what you mean by that.  If you mean the world would function much as it does now, then no, that statement isn't true.  Without a sense of empathy for and a desire for connection with our fellows, we would live in isolated silos, not sharing knowledge and not sharing resources.  And more worryingly, the only way to amass resources would be to take them from others, because pooling resources would be uncommon.  

The world would be very different, and the various products that you attribute to Thinkers would never have had the chance to be developed in the first place.  &gt; Thinker's also have Fe 

Yep.  And feelers have Ti.  What's your point?

&gt; I don't see how sharing would be a problem

Yes, you don't see how it's a problem, because you already have the empathy and sense of connection with the people around you.  That is to say, your "Feeling" functions.In effect, yes.  In practice, it's not quite that black and white, but suffice to say, if the world was made up of NT and ST types, then the bonds and connections wouldn't be there to enable sharing in the first place.  You'd need to create them from scratch, and when none of the people involved are naturally inclined to do that, and know very little about other people and their motives, the barriers would be large, and the connections short lived.

Cohesiveness comes from the fact that we're drawn to each other instinctively.  &gt; EXTP's seem to be pretty feelerish/warm to me. I'm sure they'd be inclined to because they are both extroverted and tert Fe.

I'm an ENTP.  I seem pretty feelerish and warm, and I'm really good at reading peoples emotions.  But I'm shit at offering sympathy and struggle with meaningful emotional connections with people.  Tertiary Fe is good, but it's not magic.  

And leaving that aside, pointing at tertiary functions as gap fillers undermines your entire position, because the same argument can be flipped to apply to Feelers.  If tertiary Fe users can be feelers when it matters, then tertiary Ti users can be thinkers when it matters.No nothing in my post suggested thatFurther, if you want this discussion to continue, you're going to need to address some of the points I've raised. I'm going to go out on a limb and say even though it may span all types, the distribution won't be even.  I imagine the way you perceive the world pretty heavily influences your function preferences.  And I'm the complete opposite.  I have aphantasia.  I literally can't think visually.  So synesthesia is pretty far removed from my experiences :)Yeah, that's pretty much my experienceI basically don't daydream.  I assume so. I've always been terrible at most artistic endeavours like drawing and painting (though I do a lot better when I'm looking at what I'm trying to draw). 

But it's possible that it's unrelated and I'm just bad at art.  I'm just as bad at music, dancing and other non visual art forms. Photography is as close as I get to an art form I'm good at.ENTP here with (never achieved) childhood dreams of being an astrophysicist 

&gt; I'm lazy af and a notorious procrastinator

This is why I never achieved those dreams :PWell, I'm an edge case, because I'm transgender and have always had issues with my body.  But here goes

For many years, from about the time I was a teenager, I simply didn't care about my body.  It wasn't me, it was just the thing I drove around it, and I'd trade it in if given the chance.  I never hated it or anything, I simply didn't care for it.  That was me for most of my life.  I was unfit and overweight, and I didn't care.

When I had my midlife crisis, I got a piercing (a prince albert) and that changed things significantly for me.  It helped with the discomfort I was feeling towards my body, and let me connect with it.  It was still the *wrong* body, but it was me, and it was mine.

That was like a light switch going off.  I lost weight, I got fit and developed a completely new relationship with my body.  I became proud of what it could do, and invested in making it better.  I felt love towards my physical self, which was a first for me.  I loved the feel of my calves as I became a runner, I loved the feel of my abs (though loose skin kept them hidden from view).  I loved feeling of being in the zone when exerting myself.  

I'm about to start hormone treatment, so my body will be changing in very big ways over the next 12 months, and I'm hoping that my relationship with it will continue to improve.  Not something I've been open about until recentlyThanks!  FYI transgender isn't a gender in and of itself. It's a pain I admit.  I'm not third gender for example.  I'm on the binary, as I identify as female, but I'm also trans.  I'm female first though, so "transgender" kinda misses the mark by itself.  And "other" isn't really appropriate either.  So edgy!Sure2, maybe 3.  People are basically good.  There are always exceptions, and everyone can be a shitty person in "right" circumstances, but all in all, we're keepers.ENTP (me)I'm a 41 year old transgender woman that grew up in a single parent family, in government housing.  I was sexually abused as a child, and I've lost my brother to suicide.  

Trust me, I've seen the shitty sides of life and people.  I still stand by my comment.  We're social creatures by instinct.  We work together because that's what makes us successful as a species.  Co-operating is literally in our DNA.  The shitty stuff just gets undue attention.With our powers combined!Yeah, kinda the same problem I have...I'm pretty quick to forming an opinion, but I won't do so without understanding the core ideas behind the topic.  I'm also quick to change my opinion as circumstances and my own knowledge changes.

And I'm also often at odd with other peoples opinions :)ENTP and not at allTo alleviate boredom mostly :)

&gt; Or do you simply like playing with systems that seek to explain things?

And this!  This is how I alleviate boredom in pretty much every aspect of my life :)ENTP.  Started with a double degree in information technology and electronic engineering.  Hated engineering, and didn't love info tech.  Failed out.

Came back 20 years later doing an education degree with Physics and Maths as my teaching areas.  Still a work in progress :)Sarcastic and full of bad jokes.  Or maybe that's just me...No, because mums and dads aren't opposites, many (most) traits that are positive in mums and also positive in dads.

That's a good point.

But no, ENTPs are still not quintessential dad types.  Yeah, that's me... Left leaning, SJW feminist atheist here :)I'm definitely in the midst of a personality change.  Like you, I've been repressing myself for a very long time.  My entire adult life basically.  I don't actually know who I am underneath it all, because she's never seen the light of day before.  

No idea what, if any difference it will make to my type.  In theory your type never changes, however it's entirely possible I haven't been testing accurately at any point.ENFP, but that's mostly because I'm becoming more and more convinced I am one...Go on.  You're not the first to say that, but function stack wise, ENTP fits me.  So I'm curious as to why people keep suggesting ENFP.  I mean I can see it, but it doesn't quite fit as well as ENTP.Honestly, Te is one of my weakest functions. I'm far more a Ti user (to the extent that I sometimes type INTP). 

Edit - Though I take your point on the way I present... Nah, I'm not certain I'm not ENFP.  

Function stack wise, ENTP fits me neatly, as do the generic "type descriptions" you can find littered all over the web.

ENFP functions feel close, but not quite right, as do the various type descriptions.  

What throws me though is that people consistently doubt that I'm ENTP, and consistently pick me as ENFP.  Which means that there is *something* that I'm missing.  I'm either dealing with a confirmation bias that I can't see past, or there is something in the way I present that is giving people an inaccurate perception of me.  Well, for Te, I am deficient in executive function in general.  I am disorganised, late, not goal driven, have no need for completion and can't co-ordinate people.  

Ti fits though, because I'm systems oriented.  I understand things through mental models.  Mathematics and programming appeal to me as hobbies because they are both focused on creating a mental model to solve a problem.  But I care little for *actually* solving it.  Just understanding *how* to do it is sufficient.  &gt; Honestly dude

Not a dude.  And that's one of the things that I've wondered about actually.  Does that bias people towards seeing Fi in me instead of Ti?  But it's evidently not something that influenced your perception of me :)

Ah well, it will remain a mystery for now.  But I will know one day!  It drives me crazy :)I don't like not understanding thingsSo how does the poor executive function fit in with Te? And what pushed you to eventually type yourself as enfp?It's not so much the theory that I'm trying to understand. I get that sufficiently to type myself as ENTP.  

What I'm trying to understand is the difference in perception between me and everyone else :)Te is such a stumbling block for me.  If Te is my tertiary function and from experience, it's underdeveloped.  Ti is my 7th function, and thus not utilised in this model.  But that just doesn't work.  I value Ti, it is a function that I do identify with, that describes the way I deal with things.  

I'm wondering if it's not simple a mature Fe that people see in me (As a middle aged ENTP, that seems reasonable).  

I'm wondering if that isn't what I should try teasing apart? Secondary Fi (ENFP) vs Tertiary Fe (ENTP).  

&gt; But I guess in retrospect I guess it's the obsession with my individual purpose and meaning

I just don't have that.  

Anyway, thanks for the input.  It's something more to mull over :)&gt; breathe, drink water, eat, and get sleep, folks.

I'm pretty sure chauvinists already do these things :)I don't think I've ever had one...I don't know whether it's a change of type, or just your true type being hidden, but it does seem that you can certainly change the way you present/test.

I'm transgender for example.  Since coming out, a lot of the depression and emotional distance I've had my entire life has just evaporated.  I now present as a far more F oriented person than I ever did in the past.  My type doesn't appear to have changed, but it's not much of a stretch from my situation to someone who tests completely differently.  My depression made me passionless and largely emotionless. I wasn't tired, I wasn't sad. I was flat. Functional depression. It's not a correlation with type specifically, but I have noticed a disproportionately high number of trans and gay/bi people on the typing discord servers I've joined...Makes senseI wouldn't do it.  The amount of money I need to be happy is less than the amount it would require for me to kill someone.&gt; And every transgender person I've met personally is also NFP

Not this one...&gt; vulnerable in the same way to people telling them that sex is just a construct and can be changed according to how one feels internally.

You have a mistaken understanding of transgender identities...&gt; ENTP here

Your flair says ENTJ.  Which one is correct?

&gt; On one hand I have horrid body image, on the other hand, gender is a social construct and nothing more than a group of associations around a main facet 

No, you're talking about gender roles.  Gender roles are social constructs.  Gender identity is distinct from gender roles, and is not socially constructed.

&gt; Also, coming out, personally, seems a bit much.

It pretty much saved my life...&gt;I don't wanna spill out my whole life story just for 1 person to comment

Well, that rules out Ne :pWell, to be fair, no one is going to put the effort in to trying to type you if you don't put the effort in yourself.  Very much soI'm not formally diagnosed, but I'm certain I suffer from adult ADD.  I have significant executive function impairment.

Here's a list of the symptoms I experience.

* Have unpredictable mood swings (not so much these days)
* Make careless mistakes at work
* Find it hard to sustain attention in work or leisure
* Not seem to listen when spoken to directly
* Not finish tasks
* Find it hard to organise tasks and activities
* Avoid sustained mental effort in work
* Lose things like keys, paperwork and things needed for tasks
* Be easily distracted by other stimuli
* Be forgetful in daily activities
* Fidget with hands or feet, or squirm in their seat
* Talk excessively
* Have trouble waiting their turn in queues and other such situations
* Butt into conversations or other activities.

Unfortunately, I haven't found effective treatment yet.  But, that's a work in progress.  I'm trying to get a clinical assessment and diagnosis done, so that I can find *something* that helps.  I like to think I'm a pretty good mum.  I focus on giving my son agency, and responsibility.  I've let him swear since he was 9 or so, but I've made it clear to him that I won't protect him from the consequences if he swears in front of the wrong person.  I don't police his computer/screen time, but I've let him know that if computer time starts to impinge on his ability to do other things or spend time with others, then we'll have to look at hard limits.  

He's too young to drink (he's not yet even a teen), but if and when he's wants to do that, I won't stop him. I'll let him make those choices, but I'll make the risks and consequences clear, so he can make smart choices.

I don't really care about the specifics of what he does.  I just want to make sure he knows how to make considered choices.I'm trans female, so maybe it's different for me, but I'm about 50/50.  

Edit - Downvotes? Go go gadget transphobia&gt; ExFP I think are the least "feely" of the F types while still being sensitive about other people

Fi, which is ENFPs Aux function is not about being sensitive to other people.  That's Fe, which is an ENTPs tertiary function.  So it's perfectly inline with being ENTP&gt; I'm just not extremely socially gifted like you hear about Fe doms and auxes. Nor can I relate to the whole just being able to automatically feel others feelings.

Nor would you be if you were ENFP. ENFPs use Fi, not Fe.

It's ENTPs that use Fe. It's our tertiary function.  And a partially developed Fe, use naively like you (and I) do is perfectly inline with being an ENTP.  I'm not a romantic, but I'm a softy and don't like conflict. It's amazing how often people will insist I'm not an NT. &gt; But yeah I get super sappy and emotional after listening to love songs, watching chick flicks, etc

Yes!  So much this :)Ne dom and I never remember my dreams to keep a journal. Not that I'd keep a journal anyway, that's always ended in failure on my previous attempts to journal anything. 

&gt;I felt like sleeping was boring and a waste of time

That's exactly how I feel! I wonder how much is tied up in not remembering my dreams... &gt; I wanted to be like Tesla and able to function (well... hm) on 4 hours. 

That;d be amazing! I can get by on 6 hours sleep for an extended basis, with the odd 4 or 5 thrown in there, but it's such a waste of time! :)

&gt; I'm like, "I'll take a nap!"

You've probably earned that by the sounds of it :PI'm ENTP, and had a brother 18 months younger than mrNope. He passed away many years before I'd even heard of MBTI I'm no sidekick!Most of them are sidekicks :p[](/rtwiaside) I'm closest to Twilight, though I have more self confidence than her! Te is perhaps more, what can the box do, rather than what can we do with the boxNot really, your phrasing is about possibility, when Te is about functionThey were subtly different, because he went for the multiple uses thing for Ne vs the single use thing for TeYeah, which is why I corrected him :)No...&gt; An INFJ trans might not relate to a typical post in an INFJ sub.

I don't know.  I'm a trans ENTP, and I relate pretty strongly to most of the stuff in /r/entp.  Sure, the fact I'm trans influences how I think and what I think, but that's captured in the end result of my type.  It's not distinct from it.

I mean I get your point that there is lots of variability within types and that stereotypes are limiting, but any issue of identity is already reflected within the typing...&gt;  In fact, I'm the most humble person you'll ever meet. 

You haven't met me then.  The Dalai Lama and Tony Stark argued with each other over how to recognise my consistent, all pervasive humility, before ultimately deciding they weren't worthy of deciding for fear of disrupting it's purity.I don't have insecurities or low self esteem! The latter two though...I feel like I won the MBTI lottery personallyI was looking forward to an interesting discussion.  This is not the trigger point for that though...I saw the post title and thought to myself "Self, this might lead to some interesting discussion". I then click on the title and read the body of the post.  I then said to myself "Self, what a disappointment, there is no interesting discussion to be had here"&gt; ENTP: A tour of a whiskey factory before crashing a protest just to yell a little, then watch Japanese game shows on the flat screens at best buy, somehow we ended up skinny dipping at a random house party but its okay because we brought enough whiskey to share

Literally none of that is appealing :)That explains so much :P

Edit - (The joke is, I'm an ENTP trans woman)&gt; Does your inner monologue appear as still/moving imagery or a voice?

I have aphantasia.  I don't have mental images.  I guess it's a voice?

&gt; If your inner monologue is a voice, do you have one voice or many?

I'm not sure I even have one.  I am definitely aware of words, but they don't "sound like" anyone.  

&gt; Does your inner monologue seem to be speaking in your own voice, or does it take on the voice of another person? For example, does it take on the sound of someone familiar like your mom, a friend, a celebrity, or perhaps, a voice completely new to you?

None?  It's just like words.  It doesn't have any of the traits of a voice or sound that you would expect if you were hearing a real voice.

&gt; If your inner monologue appears as imagery, is the imagery in colour or black and white? Is it moving imagery or still? Does it seem true to life or slightly off like a painting or cartoon?

I have no mental imagery of any type.

&gt; Does your inner monologue change depending on the situation? Example: reading in your head vs everyday thought?

Not that I've noticed

&gt; Is your inner monologue intrusive? Does it disrupt you during everyday activities?

Not at all.  I'm barely aware of it

&gt; Does your inner voice seem to have different opinions to your own or interject questions or theories from what feels like thin air?

No?  That's a thing?

&gt; Does your inner monologue repeat a word, sentence, idea, or imagery, over and over again? What is it and is there a particular situation when it arises?

No

&gt; Does your inner monologue suggest you should try weird things that in reality you know you would never do? Like, kick a baby, trip a granny over, or jump off a bridge? (I'm not talking about being suicidal or having dangerous tendencies.)

No.

&gt; Are there times during the day when you don't notice your voice/imagery at all? Has it ever seemed to disappear for a time? or does your inner monologue only pipe in when you are actively engaging it?

I rarely ever notice it, and to be honest, I'm not sure I even have one in the way you seem to be describing it...

&gt; If you are bilingual, does your voice talk in more than one language?

Monolingual here

&gt; Does your inner voice talk at a constant volume level? or does it appear to get louder during emotional periods as if it is yelling at you?

It doesn't have any volume.

&gt; Does your inner monologue taunt you?

No

&gt; Do you participate in back and forth dialogue with your inner voice or do you tend to ignore it or be on different wavelengths?

I don't understand how this works?  It's just my thoughts. How do my thoughts interact with my thoughts as a distinct entity?

&gt; Has your inner voice or imagery changed over time? Do you perceive this as being due to growing older, mental illness, or the consumption of mind-altering drugs (prescription and/or illegal substances)?

Not that I'm aware of

&gt; Do you believe you have an inner monologue, if not, do you often talk to yourself out loud? and how do you experience silent reading?

I do often talk to myself, but more often, I talk to other people as a way of exploring my own thoughts. I mean, I definitely have words in my head.  I don't subvocalise when I read.  But, my experience of a monologue seems like a pale shadow of what you're talking about hereI'm an ENTP (that doubts herself and may be ENFP) and I am incapable of staying angry at anyone, whatever they do to me.  I feel like it's a character flaw almost, how simply and regularly I forgive peopleIt's a little more complex than that for me. I categorically, without doubt have been ENTP for most of my life.  But, I don't feel like that fits anymore.

And this is where you tell me that types don't change, and that means I've been an ENFP my whole life, and I've been fooling myself about valuing Ti. And then I tell you that is not the case, and I am confident that I have valued Ti over Fi, as Fi is not a function I particularly valued, nor do I value it now.  My experience of feeling, is that of Fe, which is a tertiary function of ENTPs.  You then start suggesting that I'm defo not ENTP, and maybe I'm one of the types with dom or aux Fe, to which I state that I, categorically am not, as I am neither Si or Ni valuing.  At this point, I get sick of having the same conversation over and over, and bow out, to go back to wondering whether I simply value Fe far more than usual in ENTPs, or if somehow, after thinking about this for 12 months or so, it's still possible, that somehow, I'm Fi valuing, despite the fact that function does not fit me, and to value Fi would indicate a change in type rather than simply a growth and maturity of a tertiary function, because that would explain why generic ENFP descriptions fit me so well, despite the function stack not making any sense for me.Your comment confuses me.  I'm not sure where you criticised me?  And I'm not sure what I'm taking personally?  My comment was simply to show that this path is one I've thought about quite a lot, and talked to people about, quite a lot.  

I have no need to be labelled as ENTP over anything else.  My experience is that I, at least recently, do indeed value F over T.  The confusion arises from the fact that this is a recent development.  

And ultimately, the only two options that fit are ENTP with Fe so strongly favourited, I favour it over Ti (which is at odds with MBTI theory) or that I've changed types, and I am now an ENFP, descriptions of which fit me really well (which is at odds with MBTI theory and which only works if we look at dichotomies and ignore functions, as I don't fit Fi *at all*)You're literally telling me to not label myself as ENTP if I'm not certain, and then telling me to use ENFP, despite said uncertainty. 

&gt; Just how it was thought that I was INTP, I didn't just suddenly switch to ENTP. No, it could just be I fleshed my other functions out over time.

Yep.  I went through this exact process myself as a young adult.  I used to label myself as INTP too, until ultimately, I understood myself and the system better, and realised I was ENTP.

&gt; because you don't "switch" types. 

Yep, and this is one of my points of contention.  Because ENTP with a well developed Fe is a description that has fit me like a glove most of my life. But it doesn't anymore.  And neither do any of the alternatives.  Every option (ENTP, ENFP and INFJ) requires me to do some strong mental gymnastics to make it fit, or it requires something in the theory to be critically wrong.

And again, I have been an ENTP my whole life.  That bit isn't up for debate.  I know both myself and the system well enough.  Every test I ever did reflected it.  The function stack fit.  I have been ENTP my whole life.

But, since I came out of the closet, I have changed.  The way I value and process emotions is undeniably different.  Fitting that scenario in to the model is a challengeYes, I do!  Fe, and Ti.  Fi confuses me, and Te is the antithesis of everything I am :)Thanks!  

I'm not in a rush.  It's just one of those things that made me wonder, and now, I'm looking to explore it a bit.  I don't need answers right away :)

&gt; There are subtypes in socionics. I recommend looking at the ENTP Ne subtype.

Hrmm...  That reads like someone was stalking me and recording my life in written word form...

That helps, thank you :)Hrrmm...  I dont think so...

esfp - 91%
enfp - 3.9%
entp - 0%

I can confidently say I am not an Se user. I'm sporty and active, but that was given WAY too much emphasis.

Though it does continue the trend of giving me Fi instead of Ti that I've started to notice in the last 12 months...ENTP, and as a kid, people kinda wondered if I had aspergers.

Turns out I had ADHD, but no one had any clue, due to my good gradesI only tell my kid to clean his room when there's a specific reason he needs to, and then I simply tell him what that is.Pff, my room is messier than his.  I don't care about mess. Other people do though, and sometimes that mattersThere isn't one specific reason. Normally it doesn't matter, sometimes it does. We rent. If the landlord is visiting the house, I'll tell him he needs to clean up.  If something starts to smell in his room it's time.

That sort of thingHeh, I love it.  In the space of one conversation, you've had a go at me for being too clean *and* too dirtyI teach my kid to be aware of responsibilities and expectations, and to make sure when he doesn't meet them, it's a choice he's actively making for himself, and to wear the consequences of the choices he makes.  

I also give him agency at every point in his life where it's remotely possible. Even if he can't choose whether or not to do something, I make sure he at least has choice in how or when he does it.

As a result, he doesn't push against me and rebel, because he always knows there is a valid reason for the things I do ask him to do. He's a good kid, and his room is never clean, but it's not a a bomb site either. So I leave him alone about itMumENFP here

The goal of Cognition is to be open to all types, especially people who may struggle to find a voice on many typology servers.  

This is our server vision

&gt; We love to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere with little to no drama. The goal is to have 200 members at max. We appreciate the interactions between different types of personality and we'd want to make all the members feel safe and content; especially people that would struggle to talk on other servers because of being too shy etc. We are very happy to include these people in our social circle. We want to be a place where intellectual discussions can be had without interferences. Further we'd love to support people that struggle with mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. We are more of an intimate group as compared to other servers.

https://discordapp.com/invite/UjceTPnSo, I'm a 42 year old transgender woman. I came out of the closet 12 months ago, and prior to that point, I strongly and consistently tested as ENTP for most of the 15 year or so I've been aware of MBTI (I did initially test as INTP though, but quickly realised it didn't fit)

Where I run in to problems, is that my experience of emotions, and the importance I give them has changed drastically since coming out of the closet.  Whilst closeted, I struggled with serious depersonalisation, so it's arguable that ENTP was never a reflection of my true self, but since coming out, I experience emotions strongly, and I value them very differently

When I do MBTI tests currently, I typically test as ENFP, and the generic ENFP type descriptions fit me very well, except for this whole "strongly held values" thing.  I have similar issues when looking Fi as a function.  It just doesn't fit.  The only strongly held personal value I hold is "everyone should be more empathetic"

Fe on the other hand fits me very very well.  But, Fe as a dominant or auxiliary function doesn't fit, because it pairs with Ni and Si, both functions I can confidently say are not prioritised by me.

So, from what I can see, my options are 

1) I'm ENTP with a very strongly preferenced tertiary Fe.  This doesn't feel right though, as I would say that I value F over T (and the test results reflect that)

2) I'm ENFP and I just don't understand Fi well enough to see how it fits with me.  I'm inclined to believe this is the case, but, as this post indicates, I'm still unsure

3) Being a trans person in denial with strong depersonalisation and muted emotions for over 30 years means that my results are simply not going to fit the model

4) Somehow, I'm an xxFJ, and do value Ni or Si. This isn't really an option, but I include it for completeness 

So, my question is, what sort of questions should I be asking myself to tease these options apart?INTP when I was in my early 20s

ENTP when I was in my late 30s

ENFP in my early 40s

It has absolutely been influenced by my being a transgender woman that spent most of her life closeted.   Because I'm a Jill of all trades.  I'm really good at a lot of things, and I'm *great* at thinking on my feet.  It means I thrive in chaos and dynamic situations and under pressure.  So if things are falling apart, I'm you're girl.  

The other side to it though is that I can barely manage to do the things I want and plan to do.  If it's not here and now, I struggle.  If it requires planning and consistency, rather than flexibility and spontaneity, I struggle.  So, if things are falling apart because the regular business as usual stuff wasn't done as well as it should have been, I'm probably that girl too...I want to see the girls version!&gt;  I often see thinker types call feelers manipulative or scum of the earth. I see introverts mocking extroverts and talk about them like they're disgusting.  

That's what underdeveloped feeling looks like...

&amp;#x200B;It's not that you want to, it's that when you know what the question is asking, that often leeches over to your answers and makes it next to impossible to give an unbiased response&gt;if, instead of answering the specific item honestly, because they're interested in self-discovery, they have a "bias" in favor of getting a particular result on the test

Of course they have a bias.  No one wants to be F or S, because they carry this stigma, and when you know it's an F/T question or an S/N question that knowledge will shadow how you answer. It's not that people will lie, but they'll see themselves through the filter of how they want to be, which will bias their answer towards that.&gt;
FYI, according to [the offical MBTI folks,](http://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm) 70% of people come out S on the official MBTI, and 60% of people come out F.

I'm aware.  I'm more highlighting the fact that NTs are over represented in MBTI communities and that there is a bias against SF types.  

&gt;if somebody's determined to game the test to achieve a particular result,

As I said, it's not that.  It's more subtle and hard to tease apart.ENFP with ADHD and ASD here. I was gifted, and school was easy.  I topped everything without trying.

Then I got kicked out of university when I lacked the study skills to keep up with the volume of work...I have aphantasia, so I guess this is literally impossible for me...How is it flawed?  To suggest that there aren't 16 broad ways of categorising peoples personalities is crazy.  There are billions of ways, so 16 loose fitting archetypes seems perfectly reasonable to me.

They may not have much predictive power in terms of workplace performance, but that is VERY far removed from being "philosophically flawed" I'm fucking amazing even without your "pep talk" :)Yeah, the first option didn't fill me with hope...

&gt;**Which one sounds most like you?**  
&gt;  
&gt;You love *starting* new projects. You're like an architect, building up your solution by exploring all possibilites to find the best approach.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Example:** *When researching something to buy online, you open a dozen variations in different tabs to compare each one and make sure you're picking the ideal choice.*

Their example there seems like the exact opposite of the attribute. I love starting things, but see nothing through to completion, and that includes researching purchases.  I don't give a shit about making the "ideal" choice.  Close enough is good enoughI don't actually preference Te...  It's one of the reasons I struggle with typing by function...  Nothing about me is Te 

I'm Ne for days.  Easily my strongest function

My Fi and Ti seems pretty equal, and I have trouble recognising which one I preference.  I tend to think Fi, but that leads to weirdness, because I don't use Te at all...  

If I actually preference Ti over Fi, then that means I actually favour Fe over Fi, and that's not right either...I'm 45 :)  I know my MBTI pretty well, and have been casually interested in it for nearly a decade now

My real issue is that if I leave functions out, and just go by dichotomies, then I'm ENFP

Once I start to assess by functions though, then things get weird, because my Ti and Fi are both strongly valued, though I can't tell you which I value more, and nothing really fits...

That test linked above actually clocked me as ESFP, despite Ne being by single most dominant function.

If I'm shopping for something online, I generally don't care that much about it.  It's a "thing", and "things" don't interest me much.  Ask me *how* I would go about ordering something online, and I can talk to you for days about the different ways of assessing value and how I subjectively rate objective values, but to *actually* order something?  That's far less interesting, and I just don't care enough to spend time on it.I'm an ENFP

That would ping me as an ISTP.

So close :PShe looks stoned to me
When faced with an social issue, do you care more about how YOU feel/think about yourself, or how OTHERS will feel and think of you. Neither is better than the other.

It also helps to include your age.I agree. A roasting contest gives an INTJ a reason to say EVERYTHING they always wanted to say. :(You're young and still finding yourself. Make sure you avoid confirmation bias and fitting into your category.

From what I'm reading, I believe that you are more likely to be an ENFP than a ENTP. 

Note that I didn't read your opening statement. I came to the conclusion from your self description only. 

Side note: Have you thought that you could be neither of the two?Isn't it Fe and Si for both of them? :TInteresting. Socionics always peaked my curiosity. Time for a good read lolGot ENFP A from the test, 22 y/o.
That developed Fe though...? o_oCurrent: ENTP
Introvert: INTJ
Extrovert: ENTJ...? Idk, ENTP is the best though 👍This is a recipe for disaster Hella kawaii afI'd say ENTPs are the most "ambierted". If someone goes through a long analysis or rant, and then says "wait, where was I going was this?", is an ENTP I'm not immoral! Just extremely, extremely open minded! A lot of the moral codes we have in place don't even make sense when you think about it. Most things are bad because... well.. BECAUSE THEY'RE BADI can dig it;A; Yea you're right lmaoI recall reading 30-40%.

Source: the faulty human brainYou are right, didn't notice we were referring to N doms specificallyAlso an ENTP, but was let down that we didn't get top placeI would try an ENTP one, but I'm afraid I'll never actually get around to it, let alone finish it.ENTP, Ravenclaw, patronus: Russian blue catI got 0/5... maybe I'm not an ENTP :(0/5 == 0/4. :PYou should read more. I'm pretty sure most of the things you read were wrong or false generalizations.Agreed. I thought it was for ENTPs, up until the results panelHoly shit, so many ENTPs hereAge?You seem more like an ENTP than an INTPAll 3 forms for Cyndiquill, Gengar, and Gloom:( life is more interesting when you press the buttonI don't hide it, but it's always met with "wow, that sounds fake", everytime I bring it up:(Si inferior means we actively reject this function. In combination with primary Ne, you can best describe these people as "always going against the grain"

They hate doing things by strict directions and enjoy doing it in novel ways.

As an example, you played competitive video games, A Ne/Si is the type to avoid playing the meta.

If you always feel like you are/want to be a special snowflake in the world, you're probably one of us lolActually, surprisingly to me, many people are content with being average. I feel like ENTPs are one of the types that will actively seek out that uniqueness feeling.Same
A team with an ENTP and INTJ?In all honesty ENTPs always tend to reply the most here. (For topics that aren't boring)I don't get it 😷Looks like mature MBTI types don't go on /r/mbtiAssuming that lyrics are good enough (which my standards of lyrics are pretty low) then instrumentation has a higher priorityJust be an ENTP, and accept that we have no bad behaviors Do you like enjoy the unknown and trying the untested?

On a scale of 1-10, how much do focus on the physical environment in life. Are "you" more in your head? Or more in outside?I hate that I don't let intimate relations/friendships developNot even remotely the same If you're the type of parents that want to micromanage a kids life, ENTPs and ENFPs would be hard. Impulsive, lazy and questions authority too muchAsk him to take the test under the guise of "oh hey I saw this cool test online, what do you think"?Ayy, team ENTP Got anymore of them Ni stuff?

Side note: I was hoping for the video to abruptly snap back into reality :(Nothing wrong with using it to explain bad behavior. There is something wrong using it as an excuse for bad behavior.Nah, ENTPs or INTPs broo 3o

The only "T" under the child categoryTHERE IS NO REAL WORLD. ONLY THE WORLD I WISH TO SEE ;_;It really doesn't make sense from my point of view either.Ehhhh :/ maybe I'll grow into it ;_;MBTI only tells how we think, not our personality or behaviors. Those are more strongly influenced by values and life experiences. There is certainly some correlation between MBTI and our personality, but it's too vague accurately predict yourself.I agree that type 1 sounds like Ne. When I read the description, I felt like ENTPs fall under type 1 more strongly.ISFJ, ehhhhh 

At least I have someone to talk toIdk... the phrase isn't really clicking for meI'd say there is merit to the statement. But who says that superficial friendships are bad? I don't want to be close friends with every single person I meet. It's good to have a balance of both.Immaturity : Argues with everyone, arrogant and lack of social finesse. 

Maturity: The opposite?😞You're only 13, bro. There's so many things you don't realize about yourself to accurately type you.It matches so well with ENTP that I suspect the possibility that there is some strong bias in those answers. Are you sure you're answering the questions in a way that's honest with yourself and not to satisfy some predetermined answer in your head?You're an ENTP. Hello

Or an INTP, which is close enough

1) Low ranking Si (3rd or 4th)?
2) Subjective, depends on mindset?
3) Fe, because you care how you appear to others
4) I think this is a trait of being Ti and P
5) That's Ne, wanting to know something top (general), down(specific)
6) I can't say, maybe it's Ne again and you're simply in love with the ideas, not the mastery of the field
7/8) Low ranking Fe

Conclusion: Ne Ti Fe Si or Ti Ne Si Fe

Of course, I might just be projecting my internal system to justify my answer, even if it's completely wrongWhether deep down (even if you suck at it), are you a people person or not?Unrelatable! 😧I know, I'm just giving non-offensive commentary. :O
Hm... that's an interesting thought process. It makes a lot of "sense". I'm probably gonna adopt this thought now.


Edit: ah shit, that was a Ne thing wasn't it? HahaI just realized I sounded sarcastic as fuck, haha. On a serious note, I did mean what I said. I actually spent a fair amount of time thinking about it yesterdayI find this to be relatable! Ok, make that a sample size of 8Ayyyyy, it's a masterpi Am I the only one not that bothered by it?Ha ... haaaaaa... nooooooo. :/A socially awkward ENTP?I guess 22?I don't Cool, but doesn't seem quite right yetMuch accurate I actually genuinely love people, even tho it doesn't look like itP types are capable of dedication to their craft too... Strange, I thought I was a robot this entire timeCats or dogsI feel like ENTPS have a good balance of anything, so I wouldn't change. But otherwise, I suppose INTJ comes second?This. I don't like smart lazy people because their wasted potential is an insult to our "growth minded" philosophy and Will you be my sugar daddy?But I liked that ISTP Ama that we trolled the shit out ofI literally stopped reading and came to that conclusion to It's as if we're all humans with complex emotions and behaviors. This was quite the revelation.ENTPs are turned on by connections and relationships.
INTPs are turned on by depth of knowledge

Edit: still stand by my statement. ENTPs are driven by Fe and INTPs by Si.Poetic enough for me not to criticize itDude is blind. No amount of advantage he will receive will ever be greater than having the chance to experience life normally. 

Honestly doesn't sound like anything the general ENTP would say. (Count us out lol)Did not expect hearthstone, happily surprised lol wth, of course we doWe don't need to explain why, its quite obvious ;)Its not perfect, but its def not random. Why be mature when you can make life interesting You're disadvantaged cause you're playing a game that doesnt favor your strengths.

Life is like a game of league. If you're trying to play ADC maokai, then life is obviously gonna seem unfair to you. (I used LoL as an example, but this applies universally)

Life is like a MMORPG. If you add all your stat points into intelligence and decide you want to become a warrior... then life is gonna seem unfair.

Life is like trying to fight an armored swordsman with a bow. No one is gonna say the bow is a bad weapon, you're just not using your strengths correctly. Had you been an archer hunting for food, the swordsman would complain that he's disadvantaged at hunting for game.

Life is generally neither fair or unfair. Its just life. It's just a medium to contain all events.

I'd say fairness comes from perspective in an event. Which is why fairness is a subjective term. It's based on too many nebulous definitions and semantics. 
Advantage/disadvantage is a more concrete word, easier to see given a scenario and is more unbiased.

I cant really analyze further cause idk what you mean by fairness. It's too loose of a term lol

Are you saying that the sum advantages of one type is greater than another?

If you're saying that its unfair intps are not as good as entjs at doing entj stuff, then im gonna have to disagreed lol.Ah i see.

The answer comes down to: "What game are we playing?"

If the answer to that is: ALL possible games, then the answer is idk. 
And honestly, it doesn't matter too cause we won't get to exhaust all possible scenarios/games in life.What?Didn't get your example 👀Liking a type on a tv show doesn't mean you're that type 😓Ouch. If someone told me that personally, that would leave an emotional scar for a while Entp 12/10UnrelatableAustraliaI think it's just the people you're around. You don't seem excessively weird in a bad way. And dont worry about gender roles too much lol. I insert lol at the end of everything to hide my deep seeded depression and hope that no one notices it in my comments lol

Edit: Real talk tho, you seem like a cool person. I guess if you find it hard to reach out to others, at least make it easier for others to reach out to you?Just how I wanted to spend my morning 😎I read the URL as "Boulder the rapist" 🤦‍♂️You're probably too young to accurately reflect and observe yourself. Can you distinguish what you are, what you want, what you think you are and what you think you want?

Not to say you cant, just unlikely. yesEvery function is important and serves its purpose. (except Si) ;)Most of the ISFJs are mistyped ESFJsNoYou's an infp bruh, im sorry The INFJ list looks right, but the INTJ one looks super off :/No. I act the same but stupider.No way, I too act the same but stupiderI like this oneNo no, I agree too!Why do you want to be an ENTP?Entp is the thinker with the most feelingStrange, most of the ENTPS on r/entp chose to be an INTJ when asked the same question 
Hey same!I always thought that narcissists are thought of as having extremely low self-esteem and that's why they  put up the narcissistic front as a defense mechanism. Like they secretly hate themselves. 

I got 22/40 and I am Definitely not a narcissist I just am extremely self reliant (lived on my own since I was 17, put myself though school, etc) I think this test is BSOkay yeah I agree with what your saying. But would you say that self confidence and self esteem are two different things? Yes a narcissist will exude self confidence and others will totally pick up on that, but having low self esteem isn't visible to others which is kind of what I was getting at. I guess saying the mental illness is a defense mechanism was just terrible wording on my partIt's funny when you actually say this to ENFPS in real life hahahFrom my understanding It is easiest to type young adults. Lets say 21-34. This is because their auxiliary function has most likely already developed and they will be becoming well versed with the Tertiary.

It is difficult to type middle aged and elderly people because the inferior function will be better developed so they will be all around more rounded out, making typing difficult. The best way to go about typing in general (in my opinion, others may do it differently) is to look for the inferior and tertiary, because the dominant and auxiliary can be so ingrained in one another.Both of these comments are missing the point IMO. Any type can learn any type of skill (and YES music and art are both skills that anybody can learn), if a person plays guitar every single day they will inevitably get better at playing music. Type has nothing to do with it other than some types might be a bit predisposed to being interested in arts while others not so much. Skill in anything comes with hard work and determination and art is no different.
I understand where your reasoning is coming from and to be fair I know a surprising amount of xSFP artists and designers. However I do not think that any set of functions is going to be "better" at creative things like writing/art/music just that they would have different approaches. For example when I play or write music I get a huge kick out of learning chord structures and underlying rules (Ti) and just mess about until I have a song that I like. This is very different from my ENFP roommate/bandmate who will have the idea for the song before it is even written (Fi). 
As a person who has worked in advertising as a designer many of the people I worked with were actually xxTP types. I had an ENTP art Director boss who was fantastic, and is very well known where I live in the industry.Yep lol i've met a few unhealthy ESFJ's, what drives me crazy is that a simple "how are you?" can turn into a 20 minute convo about all their problems. Usually with me rubbing my eyes and trying to hold onto some grain of sanity listening to them speak.Dat Ne yo.If it's any consolation I love Infps. I think they are some of the best creatures everCouldn't this be said about literally every type?

I guess what I'm saying is even the most independent rationale person ever will still have a desire to "find their place in the world," even if it is deeply hidden under rationalizing and logical values. This is a human nature thing IMO, not at all an enfp thing. Ahh. I guess  that makes sense for Fi to over analyze there place in the world and if it is congruent with established identity. 

Now that I'm thinking about it a bit more I have Fi Polr and although I do think about it from time to time I don't dwell on my "place" in society all that much. This is pretty much me too. Except the not drinking part haha

I've learned to stay with the conversations even if they are boring me these days. Damn you FeIt more likely means you do t quite fully understand the functions yet. As an ENTP inferior Si for me comes up as being very scattered, always a million things on the go, forgetting family members bdays, forgetting to eat for 7 hours because I was playing guitar. Shit like that. But it's probably one of the functions that I understand the least. 

What I am trying to get at is that you cannot have inferior Si without dominant Ne. They are two sides of the same coin. Like Ni and Se.ENTP 7w8 Sx/Sp here. 

I'm sorry for your discovery.ENFP: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
My INFP buddy always says I'm a lovable asshole. Seems accurate lol 7w6 sx/sp 784 tritypeTwo best friends are ENFJ and ISFJ, I like hanging out with ENFP and INFP too. 

I am like insanely attracted xxFJ women hahah Lol yup. Sounds about right. Exactly. Ne will entertain crazy ideas in our own minds. But it's not like we don't have a grasp of  reality. I agree with everything you've said for sure, very well stated. As an entp musician and artist I feel compelled to say that the most amazing person I've played music with was an ISFJ drummer. Easily the best most consistent drummer in my area.Max Ernst is great. So much underlying meaning and symbolism in his work.This is very similar to my experience as well. My roommate found a Ouija board in an alley in downtown Toronto, we have it in the house but we are all too afraid to use it haha granted I don't think my house is haunted but it is ~100 years old. I want to believe but I've never really experienced anything paranormal myself (other than a few experiences of sleep paralysis). Through maturation you can begin to look and behave like other types but your cognition doesn't change. I'm an ENTP and I will always be one even though at times I can look like other types. Especially as a person develops there tertiary and inferior functions.This rings especially true for enneagram type 7 ENxPsProbably both.I would agree ENTP as well. Asked on the last few paragraphs.ISFJ I would say based on this info, I live with one and it all reminded me of him. but at that age it would be harder to distinguish without her diving into the theory herself because her function stack would be very developed. She could very well be ISTJ with a well developed Fi or and ISFJ with well developed Ti. But based on the answers she gives I would lean towards ISFJ, especially the bit about hating listening to others argue, that screams auxiliary Fe to me.Gotta love Fi hahhahaType 7s have a very nervous energy to them which can sometimes make them awkward, but out of all enneagram types they will usually have the least problems with having conversations with total strangers. Especially the w8.Yeah not really a fan of the ENTP subreddit either tbh. I found it entertaining for a little while then I just got more and more annoyed with people on there over time. Hmm interesting you identify with ENTP  5w4, after all the times I've seen you comment that all 5s are introverts and all 7s are extroverts. Not being condescending just interested:) I'm a musician I've been jamming and playing instruments since I was a teen. Best drummer I've ever jammed with was an ISFJ, best recorder and producer I've met was ISTJ. The best all around musician I've met was my old ENFP roommate, he did it all singing dancing, guitar and bass, and very technical and theory incline as well. I learned a ton from him. As an ENTP I love to learn guitar and bass theory especially chord theory on guitar. I love to write songs and lyrics but I'm not much of a singer. I usually learn tidbits of songs, absorb that into my knowledge of theory and move on to greener pastures. I guess I lack discipline to learn other people's songs. However I have a ton of songs that I've wrote and play them all the time on bass/guitar and ukulele. McCartney ESFP

You also sound pretty young though so keep at it.ENTPs love it though ;3My SO is INFP, and it’s great :)Developed Fe I’m guessing.Lol classic ENTP dilemma, they don’t even know why they like usIf an ENTP is being formal with you there is a good chance he is trying not to shove his foot in his mouth and actually respects what you think of him. This is actually very accurate from my experience. I hate social media and texting but I can run a room like nobodies business.Did someone say cocaine?“Statistically speaking”That’s the character he puts on, unless you know Macfarlane and have interacted with him how do you figure he has NPD? 

This thread is so full of generalizations and vague BS theories it’s almost hard to read.From my own personal experience, bury the feelings with distraction and positive thoughts, and then have them all come out when in early adulthood. (Parents divorced when I was 12) don’t worry I’m fine now (ish)That’s crazy that you say mushrooms boosted your Ne. When I do psychedelics I feel Ni like crazy, and I’m Ne dom. Just an interesting thought thanks for sharing!That sounds like Ne haha! I remember very clearly having all my normally very scattered thoughts become very focused. After learning about mbti sometime later and reflecting on my trips I thought that it could have been enhancing my inf. Si because I become very aware of details and focused, far less talkative and very in my head. But the thoughts themselves were way too abstract to be my Si, it felt very much like my mind was working in reverse, like you said. Instead of branching out my thoughts were coming to single conclusions that I just could not ignore.Yeah I agree with ESFP, I see no ENTP in him at all, not even Ne. Se-Fi makes sense to me though. It’s hard to type him though because he is a pretty ridiculous character created to be the focus and bit of most jokes on the show.Yep agreed. Communications degrees are still valuable and relevant though. Just steer clear of journalism hahaha. Though hard work will always pay off even within that field Lol and I’m okay with that.It’s the nature of Ne-Ti, I don’t need people to keep myself amused. I can be just fine at home working on various projects and being creative. Then I realize I haven’t seen my friends in 2 months and have a huge burst of socializing. Then...

How can you accurately decide he’s not ENTP based on a few lines of text. If he has typed himself as that why does it matter to you if he is or isn’t. Dom 100%, my INFP girlfriend loves it ;)This was great. I especially like the part about ENTPs not knowing or downplaying their nervousness. So true, it took me a long time to realize how nervous I am all the time. And although I think I’m good at not showing it, people definitely see hahaha My SO is an INFP, we get along great. I also have many INFP friends that I loveI feel like this is a joke. Or is OP 13 years old?Hmm I don’t know if I agree. Im pretty much a walking talking brainstorm. Im also an artist/designer so I’ll use myself as an example to illustrate what my Ne is like when I’m actively brainstorming ideas for paintings. 
I love the feeling of starting a blank canvas with no set path to follow, I paint mostly in abstractions and let my ideas flow through me without thinking about them. It is very rewarding as a Ne dom to have no guidelines for my paintings and it is also why, pretty much since the first painting I made, I have a very distinct style, something that some artists struggle with.
I can see the rigidity in my Ne in that, novelty is always king. If someone comes up to me and asks me to paint a tree (for example), I’ll die a little bit on the inside. That just seems so boring to me, when I have the skills to paint a beautiful abstract piece with symbolism and hidden meaning.Agreed ^ that’s an xNTP thing.Theory and reality are two different things. My SO is an INFP, and we are perfectly happy. I also have tons of xNFP freinds.I’m not really socially anxious or awkward. I’m anxious generally a lot of the time though, being around others can either put me at ease or amplify that anxiety. I am very assertive at my core though. I mainly have problems being a bit anti social. Like I don’t really give a shit how your day is going just leave me to my devices.You have role Ne. Look it up, it’s the same as people thinking I’m an Se type, but I couldn’t be more stuck inside my head.Socionics essentially states that personalities consist of all 8 functions. So In the socionics model you do have Ne (role function). In the mbti however it says you don’t have Ne at all. Some people prescribe to the 8 function model. Some don’t. Worth a read though IMOYes you are right. Got the names switched up, ESFP’s would have demonstrative Fe correct? Since when is an ENTJ known for EQ lol. That’s essentially “emotional intelligence” no?Because it’s unvalued to the ENTP. We would much rather contemplate the ‘why’ rather than the ‘how or what’. At least that’s how I look at it.Lol your fucked basically. Jk if you focus you can do anything lol I graduated university with honorsYour the only one lol xDYeah I don’t get the ENTJ and EQ from the post he replied with. My brother is an ENTJ and although he is a awesome, compassionate guy. He’s definitely not the person I would go to for emotional advice or help. More so the type of guy who knows what to do in every situation, great with life advice and helping me get out of shitty situations.Also if you at any point in time thought you were an ESFJ, I really doubt you are an ENTP.Lol my ISFJ good buddy always wonders why everyone likes me so much when I don’t try at all, and he tries so hard for people to like him but can never get the same reception I get when we go to parties. 
I just tell him to stop giving a fuckYeah agreed in my experience it’s the opposite. But it’s still a fuzzy way of differentiating Overthinking and fretting about past is defs an inferior Si thing, I do it all the time too. Mix that in with an Ne-Fe loop and I literally start to get anxiety sweats over the past sometimes.Your not an ENTPEvery post and comment you make reeks of Fe. You literally took the time to post on the ENTP subreddit about how easily butthurt you get, when people disagree with you. Fe.  Your use of Ne points to inferior or tertiary not dominant same goes to Ti. 

Even in your recent comment here your talking about trying to be edgy and getting easily upset with people. From your post history I would guess ISFJ, but hey you do you. 

I could also see ExFP for you. Polr Ti and demonstrative Fe. The other person ends up pissed off with the ENTP. The ENTP wonders why.

The ENFP gets very angry and starts being very insulting and the other person is left wondering why.It’s a socionics term relating to an individual who has the dominant function that is the other individuals POLR function. It’s interesting to read about but pretty fucking dumb to predetermine relations like socionics does IMO. Maturity and development play far more of a role in relations with others than can be described in socionics.  Not wrong for me. But obviously not every ENTP enjoys art as a hobby, some do though.In short it’s saying that the INFP is in a spot of psychological superiority because they are well versed in the ENTPs weakest function Fi, thus becoming sort of a supervisor to the ENTP. While the ENTP feels that he/she can never live up to the supervisors expectations because of the nature of the POLR Function. There’s more to it than that but that is a basic rundown. Take it with a grain of salt, my SO is an INFP and there is nothing uncomfortable about our relationship. INFPFrank black from Pixies is INTP
Frank Zappa was an ENTP
Isaac Brock from Modest Mouse is INTP
The dude from Of Montreal is an example of ENTP 4w5.
John Dwyer fro Thee Oh Sees is an ESTP
Rock music is full of xxtp’sThis is fucking dumb. Open your eyes please. Being able to play music does not = Fe or Fi. That’s as dumb as saying a feeler type can’t work in academia.Yep. Just rock in general I’d say.He has an ESTP vibe to me. Could be ENTP though. Or possibly an IxFP putting on a performance on stage making him look more like a EXXP

Love king gizzard btwYeah fair but what even is punk rock anymore. It’s become so blended with other modern genres that it’s basically just indie music. I’m talking about what’s popular on YouTube and iTunes/Bandcamp. 

My point being that rock music in general has those themes as well, and we can both agree TP’s won’t be singing pop songs about their broken hearts Stephen Malkmus from Pavement is a great example of ISTJ!Remove your head from the theories ass. Open your eyes. That’s all I have to say because I fundamentally disagree with your opinion. If you can’t see how xxTP’s function stack is just as beneficial to performing music than an Fi dom, you need to reconsider how much the typology comes into play when people are passionate about things. Unless your writing gay ass top 40 pop songs “the tribe” has nothing to do with it. Source? any punk rock band.My writing looks more like the ESTPs hahaYup definitely me. I wouldn’t say I get energy from people though, I’m pretty neutral in my socializing (take it or leave it). It’s the external world in general that gives me my energy, I have to interact with things outside of myself to gain energy and feel fulfilled.They should open a business together. They’d have every function held down with the benefits of having 2 NTs.Honestly the way you worded this makes it sound more Fi than anything else.NT songwriters are quite common in alternative/indie and metal genres. He’s a healthy INTJ, which makes hims seem more like an ENTP at times. He also puts on a more extroverted appearance when he is in the public eye. Because he has very very clear Ni, I don’t see much Ne in him at all. In fact his Ne seems very forced. Te is very valued by him if you read about his philosophy and what he has done in the last decade, Te is to me a given in his personality, he just oozes it imo. 

You are acting like ENTPs are the only ones who can post unserious/ funny stuff, which is just not true, tertiary Fi gives INTJ the need to do things that just make sense to them, which could be what your confusing for Ne-Ti.I’m saying that those impractical things he’s been doing is not Ne at all. But it is his tertiary Fi. Look at the example of putting a Tesla in space. At first you might think “hey this is so Ne who would do that lolollol he’s such a troll. He must be an ENTP.” But if you look at it through functions is is just as Ni-Te. 

He had the initial vision of exploring and colonizing mars and the eventual solar system (Ni), he then creates a technological and philanthropic empire in which he creates a means of putting his Ni vision to reality (Te). Now he is further exploring his potential through his Fi convictions and emotions— like putting a Tesla in space and have it endlessly play David Bowie. 

Also coming up with funny impractical things is not just Ne, that’s a stereotype. K you obviously have a limited view of MBTI if you are taking his tweets and coming up with ENTP for him. Those tweets could easily be created by a team of publicists and not even at all by Elon Musk. Read about his philosophy and about him and his life. If you still think he is ENTP get back to me. I’m not gonna delve into petty argument with some who’s just an ignorant fanboy wanting Musk to be an ENTP.

And this is coming from an ENTPLmao the ENTP flipping the INFP off, sounds about rightGod help youCongrats! Currently living with my INFP girlfriend! Fi makes me feel fuzzy inside :PNothing makes me want to troll a person harder than someone with unhealthy Te.
Come to think of it now I know why my managers hate meEntp got tested in college and it was 129 but that was was a lot of years and many, many bong hoots ago..Every New Thing PossibleI find it laughable that you think that I should feel at all obligated to explain or defend my type to you.. that’s fucking retarded. I know who I am and what my type is. I’ve been into this stuff for years. My typing as entp is from heavy introspection and curiosity of the theory. I am also really into enneagram I am a 7w8 sx/sp tritype 7w8 4w5 8w7 since you feel so concerned that I am a mistype.

I was giving my opinion man chill, have you even read this subreddit before lol?
 
Also did you even read this thread? I was using Ne in that context to prove a point, I believe that how I decribed Ne is how people who don’t know about the functions would see Ne as. Kind of like how you think all ENTPS like to argue, which is just wrong. I was like that when I was 18 and stupid but not so much anymore. I know what Ne is.

Yea some people actually responded "no your type is great" and she just completely ignores them. 
I would say ENTP's are naturally this way because their ability to see many sides of a situation and their arguementative usually ends up making them continually go against the grain and appear different from everyone elseTook the test, got ENFP, took the test again years later after puberty and got ENTP- constantly questioned myself and did a lot of research into the types. Then I met and ENFP, realised there was no possible way I was an ENFP.I get this too, at an extreme level. Even scenes where they aren't particularly meant to be embarrassing.I *do* have adhd and Ne. It's... a struggle.First read through; Fe and Ti user for sure. You obviously care a lot about what other people think and this effects you on an emotional level (*very Fe*).

Second read through;You also definitely seem to place your feeling over thinking- even if rationality is important to you (This also makes me think Ti as a tertiary function- because logic does seem somewhat important to you). Also the language you use just seems very Fe/Ti to me.

Third read through; "When I’m in a bad mood I get very logical." Sometimes when we get stressed we negatively rely on our tertiary and or inferior functions. This particularly sounds like a tertiary Ti thing.  So I leaned towards ISFJ or INFJ when typing you.
You say you fear judgement and look to others. In situations of stress people with inferior Ne often second guess themselves and can often look to others opinions instead (Fe).
My biggest issue with typing you was S/N. But like somebody else said in the comments, point five suggests a strong use of Si. *I should specify I know the least about Si/Se out of all the functions, so I could be off here*

You also in the comments mention you relate to both J and P, I want to address this. 

*Don't focus on E/I, N/S, F/T or J,P. You wan't to focus on your functions.*

+ an SxJ can appear more loose and casual in a work environment than an NxJ because they are more *In the moment* and less constantly thinking of the future or crazy complicated theory behind decisions.

I would recommend doing a functions test if you haven't already (http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html) It can help you realise your functions.

I'd say you're an ISFJ.
You are definitely not an ISTP.Skeptic. I was pretty annoyed at this whole test and it definitely doesn't remind me of the MBTI.ISTP's inferior (Least developed) function is Extroverted Feeling, you definitely seem way too in touch and comfortable with your emotions for an ISTP.

  ISTP's don't really care how other's see them. They don't treat people *badly* in anyway like an ENTP might, but they definitely aren't fussing about peoples opinions. There more focused in adventure and discovering their environment.

+ISTP's are Se dominant and while you *could* be an Se (I think you're an Si tho) you don't stand out as an Se, and someones dominant function is usually what you recognise first. And it seems everyone in the comments has first noticed your use of Fe, so it's safe to say Fe is either your dominant or Tertiary function :)- prone to extreme self reflections and emotional breakdowns
- sensitive to criticism
- a little bit emotionally selfish
- a little bit distrustful of people she hasn't met yet
- incredibly loyal to those close to her (INCREDIBLY LOYAL)
- very true to herself
- "im an individual!" is her self professed *motto*
-  strong ethical views
- very in touch with her emotionsWe did originally type her as an ENFP can you give any examples of the difference between the two so we can better understand?As I said above :)

We did originally type her as an ENFP can you give any examples of the difference between the two so we can better understand?MATPAT (The Game Theorists) He's such an ENTP it's adorable.

Cryaotic (ChaoticMonki) I'm not sure about cry, I'd probably say INFP?

I used to really like Danisnotonfire, he once said 'the last time I took the quiz I was an INFJ, but i never actually...' *proceeds to be distracted by something else*.
I can definitely see him being an INFJ, especially in his videos but in his Younows he seems like an ENTP.(It probably seems like I'm just saying that because im an ENTP, but it was actually my INFJ friend that told me she thought he was an ENTP) He's more cold and dismissive. Either way he's an Fe/Ti user for sure, with N as his dominant function.

++ Fouseytube isn't an ESFJ i dont think. I could see him as an ESTP though.Gotta love that sensor practicality. Filthy Frank makes me proud to be an ENTP.Ohohoho theres a few.

- The insane overwhelming need to argue with people *because it's fun*

- Not understanding why people get offended when you pick apart their beliefs like... like... well I can't think of a metaphor right now but you know... birds at seed? 

- Having to choose a side but understanding multiple or all points of view

- Feelings.... they make me uncomfortable.... It's annoying... when people... have them... and the only thing i know how to do is make a joke...

- The grass is always greener on the other side!!!

- Ooh and the very worst one, needing to start a project but i'm stuck because i can see SO MANY different options I can take, so I just procrastinate it awayI see your point! BUT I think it's a lot easier for Tertiary Fe users to seem for emotional and warm (a good chunk of the time it's a manipulation technic, but it definitely can be genuine!) than it is for Tertiary or Inferior Ti user's to seem analytical and logical.

Personally, I'm a tertiary Fe users and if you met me you would NOT think I was an ENTP, because tertiary Fe users can read a room and fake it till they make it- it's not 'natural' but it is easy.

 That's why it's pretty easy to get ENTP's confused with ENFP's, same for ESTP's and ESFJ's I'd say.

The extroverted sensing can tone down someone Ti as well.gosh dude, you seem really hard to type.

maybe go back to a simple, novelty, form of doing it for a second; this is a superficial and not really useful method but lets try it. 

Choose one from each pair of the following that best describes you:

MOODY or ANNOYING?
SUPERFICIAL or KNOW-IT-ALL?
EMO or COLD?
STRESSED or HIPPIE?

Also have you taken an enneagram test? If not try this (https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test.php) and choose a classic test and tell me what enneagram type you are, most type's have an mbti that they pair up withShe's not really full of ideas per se. She is creative, but she's not such an independent thinker.can you tell me a little bit about ISFP's vs ENFJ's?I try to man but it's so hard trying to type someone else because they'll say something like 'Oh! i relate to both ni and si! i must be both :)okay so! moody = i,

 know it all = n,

 emo &amp; cold usually means just emo heheh so = f

 and stressed = j 

(Again, this isnt a very accurate way of doing things but it can be interesting to see where it gets you).

 Based of all that you're an infj, which makes sense! i think you are an fe, ti for sure.

 But if you want i can give you some scenarios and we can see how you respond so we can better figure out your functions ? :)
For example! Do you find it difficult to understand why you feel a certain way? Do you often find yourself wanting to know what other people are feeling?

+ Don't worry, i love helping people find their type ! I could do it all dayYou do you, buddy! Everyone's just bitter because you probably have a life instead of us procrastinating you-tuber obsessed intuitives awh that's adorable!I'm sorry dude, can you reword that sentence? It just went over my headENTP here, but I get accused of this a lot- Maybe it's an Ne thing?  I think some people constantly change their mannerisms and ways of speaking without thought. 

A lot of ENTP's I know do things like this without thinking about it. It's an Fe thing to subconsciously change your behaviours around different kinds of people. It's kind of like how people's voices get higher when talking to someone new or someone they like. 

I assume subconsciously those girls put on a 'professional' accent-voice when talking to their professors because it's them wanting to sound formal when talking to someone in higher authority or someone they respect.

Personally, I have this weird thing where if someone so much as mentions an accent that I know how to do I have to think carefully to stop myself from slipping into it. Or when in class with my american teacher (Im australian) I have to make sure I don't accidently slip into an american accent because it might look like im making fun of him or something along those lines.

I definitely don't think it's a pretentious thing- at least not for everyone!Gosh, I was stuck in a toxic 'friendship with an ESTP for a long time so I have a lot of negative bias, and i recognise this the behaviour of an UNHEALTHY ESTP, but still... I'm a little suspicious of you all now.

- Attention Seeking to the point where it can really shut other people down (i've never been the one being shut down but i'm a typically powerful personality)
- They just *don't care* when their wrong?? They don't want to hear facts.... They just??? Are so stubborn?? I have never met a more stubborn type??
- 'My way or the highway' attitude, which isn't nice to be friends with and can just be so insensitive. (an entp talking about other people being insensitive, what a laugh am i right)

For an example of horrible ESTP scenario, I was bestfriends with this ESTP, right- lets call her Anna. but also very close with this other girl, a small easily stressed INFP that honestly was the sweetest girl ever, let's call her Mary.

Mary is dating a boy (ENFJ, I believe), we can call him Jason.

Jason and Anna are close. Anna often remarks to me that he's annoying- but never the less they seem to get along well.

Anna, this girl, she loves attention from guys- and she gets a decent amount of it. But for some reason she just seems to want to flirt with Jason more than anything or anyone else. She does things like kiss him on the cheek (?!?), try to grab his attention when he's talking to others, she's very overly touchy with him all the time and she does all of this in front of Mary. Luckily Jason never reciprocates anything, it's just the flirty nature of Anna but it's obviosuly still not OK to Mary.

It's like she wanted Mary to see?? She hardly did it when Mary wasn't around.

 So Jason, the stupid shit, doesn't seem to notice Mary obviously looking sad and uncomfortable when Anna does this stuff and I decide to take it into my own hands. 

First I hint to Anna that I wouldn't feel okay with her doing this stuff if it were my boyfriend (Anna and Mary aren't close), and she just goes 'Oh lol.'

Then I talk to Mary about it personally and ask if she notices or is worried by this behaviour, immediately she bursts out into this spiel about how she notices it so much, and that she has trust in Jason but it still makes her really uncomfortable and she hates hanging out with him with Anna there because Anna always talks over her and does this flirty shit with Jason.

I go back to Anna and blatantly tell her that this shy insecure little Mary honestly just seems really upset by this. And say 'maybe just turn down the touchyness and the talking over her?'

Anna responds with 'I don't care if it makes her uncomfortable. i hope it does. I want to do it so I will.'

______________________________________________

I know all ESTP's arent like this! They can be really fun and friendly but the few I've met only ever seem to use their Fe to be manipulative despite also being very blunt an insensitive??

They also can be really great fun but it always seem to turn into them wanting more and more attention&gt;

I knOW you probably aren't like this! But just please don't turn into this!

EDIT: Also, shallow?? and seems to get *angry* for some reason when I think deeply into things in a conversation NEAR them. Even if they arent involved in it- they but in and tell me to stop trying to look so deeply into things.
'Stop talkking and just enjoy life!!' .... 'But.... talking is enjoyable to me?'really? I just hate sensors personally....That is definitely true! Especially with xSFJ's or even xSTJ's. The sensor side of things always makes it worse, "Why bother talking about it ENTP? Just enjoy life! There's no need to debate everything!"

The ENFJ's I've met however seem to be the least easily offended of the F types, they often like to play the 'Hero' and it can be an interesting dynamic being the devils advocate to their goody-good act. They also seem to like hearing others opinions and don't take it to heart if they disagree.
I have gotten into debates with a good ENFJ mate of mine thinking it was all fun and games only to find out he was seriously effected by it, but once I told him I just like debating he seemed to find it easy to turn down his emotions and focus on the winning side of an argument !

I just like ENFJ's because their J helps me focus, and i think ENFx have a wonderfully sense of humour and wonder in the world! (I also love ENFP's)
xNTP's can sometimes get too analytical and caught up in the theory, and while it is VERY interesting and fun to throw back ideas and sarcastic quips, it's nice to have a conversation with an ENFJ(or P) who just wants to have fun and go on an adventure!

And infj's are just cutie pies who always seem to love me.hEY hey! my original prediction ISFJ ! To me, you seem like an Fe user for sure but you do make some points that could just suggest an insecure ISFP (introverted Fe). BUT ISFP AND ISFJ are commpplletely different. So if you are one, you probably will only relate to one of them specifically.

Maybe read up on those two types specifically and the differences between those two?

 ISFP- Fi Se Ni Te

 ISFJ Si Fe Ti Ne

Heres some site that compare them 

http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/what-s-my-type-/29969-real-difference-isfp-isfj.html

http://personality-types.careertrends.com/compare/2-6/ISFJ-vs-ISFPall of the above hehinteresting that an S user's main friends are N users!ENTJ OR INTJ !

ENTJ- Te Ni Se Fi

INTJ-  Ni Te Fi Se

"He's also very blunt and can overlook other people's opinions easily." Inferior Fi thing to do.

"He spends most of his time alone and has never been part of any big friend groups, but he doesn't seem one bit uncomfortable voicing his opinions in front of several people, talking for long times even if no one's listening, etc." InFeRIoR Fi!!

he loves to debate, but seems to do it solely for the "win". Fits in well with Extroverted Thinking !

" He isn't too afraid to show emotion" Fi's are less likely to care what others think of them.

"he enjoys, for example, learning different trivia and politics." Te!!

Is he more focused on one thing or several? 
Does he like routine?
Does he prefer a debating through a collection opinions and facts or does he prefer spouting solid concrete statistics?whats your type :)?oof -1 points, look like *some people didnt get the joke*-3 points, lmao salty lil sensors "Most ENTP's I know hate INFJ/ENFJ's."

"really? I just hate sensors personally...."

Yo i get yo point fam but the language i used was to mirror the above comment. My bestfriend is a sensor :) I just don't like the theoretical stereotype of a sensoroh i know dude! i understand why they downvoted me, i just found it funny is all :) I do! Or i can usually type some people tht i know quiet well myselfPersonally, I'm an ENTP and it predicted INTP. Close.
Edit: Put in a few more pieces of my writing and it calculated ENTPdid you use fb profile or text? just wondering :) my friends and i have found text to be more accuratesorry! i accidentally only gave the link to the text one
here u go buddy http://applymagicsauce.com/interesting! im the opposite :)so surprised, every infj ive ever met has been such a condescending 'im smarter than u' shit 9 intelligence (in the context of my life, not on a worldwide scale yknow? obviously on a worldwide scale im like a 7 at the very best)
9 in looks (though i recognise i might not be generally attractive to other people i think im pretty hot)this was so incredibly interesting to read!*Was pretty hard to put bias aside but here goes*

Most Universally Likable: ENFP (Literally everyone loves my ENFP friends they're so sweet and likeable it's sickening)

Most Universally Unlikeable: INTJ (I like INTJ's but most people are pussys, sorry INTJ)

Most Universally Misunderstood: INFP/INFJ (Or at least they think they are those poor special snowflakes)

Most Universally Socially Unaware: INTP (This one could be biased)

Most Universally Funny: ENTP/ESTP (ENTP's seem to be funnier but also more annoying whereas ESTP's are a close 
second and less likely to end up getting on someones nerves)

Most Universally Serious: INTJ 

Most Universally Focused: ENTJ (ENTJ's are fuckin' bosses)

Most Universally Unfocused: ENFP (They all have ADHD ffs)

:)Can't relate, love the ENTP subredditMy thoughts are messy and somewhat contradictory and it's like 2am, so please excuse me but,,,

I think religion was created to control and unite the masses, but not in such a negative way that everyone assumes I mean when I say that.

For some people it's easier to believe in something and take their morals/rules/logic from a specific predetermined set rather than makeup up their own (Te vs Ti, right?), so to speak. Some people go by the law for their morals, some people go by whatever will get them what they want and some people go by religion. I think it's just a way of adapting a belief system that comes with the additional benefits of a delusional moral superiority and sense of belonging in not only your community (church, etc) but in this crazy messed up world.

Below, someone said if you are not a good person without your religion then you are not a good person, which I agree with to an extent. I believe if religion was taken away most people would just begrudgingly find their own way to make their own belief system, but it's not *that bad* that some people need that extra push into being a 'good person', as long as they are ultimately doing it for the right reasons.

Additionally, I think religion creates a sense of community and it can bring people together from all walks of life in beautiful ways, and I often wish that I was a believer.

From what I've seen most people that hate religion, hate western religion, and they don't really hate the religion, they hate all the dumb rules.
I'm an agnostic-atheist. When I was younger I had a lot of hate towards the The Catholic church and most popular/western religions (I was raised Catholic and was born pretty gay so I guess my rage is somewhat understandable?) but now I just think it's peoples misguided attempts to stay true to morals that were for an ancient world, not the modern one. But now the Church is changing, some would argue dying, but more and more Christians are becoming more open to things like homosexuality, premarital sex of course and other 'sins'. Those rules might've made sense years ago, (homosexuals would've brought down the population and premarital sex would've probably ended in some kind of STis) we've changed and eventually the church will change too, and then so will peoples perception of it. 

++ Oh and also, keep the church and state separated, VERY SEPERATED. Perhaps also cut the 'community' of religion down a little? That's what breed contempt for other religions which breeds more war. Maybe religion should be a more personal thing than it currently is, like a fandom.
I think INFJ's in general can be hard to connect with in real life. I've had a few online friendships with INFJ's but once I met them IRL they were much more guarded and their INFJ charm came off a lot more pretentious? Once I got past that theyre great though.Im an ENTP and exactly the same honestly, I really admire ENFJ'sINFP's are super useful.The way he operated always seemed so INTP to me, but I can see ENTP for Rick.
I also agree with your choices for Jerry, Beth and Summer, they make sense to meI agree with you. Plus a lot of XNTP's are shown as drinkers in media anyway. I think his selfish and unhealthy habits aren't enough to prove he's and Se DOM. I scored 156, pretty bullshit test, it's not crazy easy but my real IQ is about 146, definitely not 156https://www.mensa.org.au/membership-information/practice-tests/practice-tests is a good test
Im an ENTP with pretty bad ADHD too and this is me to a TI actually agree with all of this, makes a lot of sense, someone else said Jerry was an ENFP and gosh I just could not see an ENFP being so  against the weird things that happen in their household? He definitely seems like an xSxJ to me.

I agree with Beth being an xNTJ, and I'm probably leaning more towards INTJ because I think her Fi is tertiary, not her inferior function.

I think Summer is an ESFP, personally, I could see her being an ENFP but in the episodes that are more her based she seems a lot more 'in the moment'. In the episode where she works for Satan, when Rick tells her that she works for Satan she basically shrugs him off with an 'oh, whatever. he's being good to me right now.' Could just be a feeler thing, or simply an emotional attachment, but, I dunno, the way she said it seemed very Sensor to me. Her entire attitude does?
aren't INTP's continually proven to be the smartest type? Definitely not useless.Are we genuinely saying that smartest type doesn't over-rule or at least balance out lazy and self-esteem issues?Are you Australian? I know this isn't relevant to the question at hand and it might be like an invasion of privacy by questioning that, but you seem so very, very Australian. I read this at first and thought 'Jesus, this kid sounds like he goes to my school'.

ANYWAY

So reading this definitely makes me think you use Fi and I also think Ni (though I'm less convinced of it). You also give off a P vibe to me, but you've typed as J's recently which makes me second guess myself.

I have a few thoughts, but first I want to ask some questions if that's ok with you? Some might seem a bit irrelevant but hey I work in mysterious ways. Feel free to go on tangents or have long answers, or y'know completely ignore me for someone that's already offering you up a type that fits.

1- Do you blend in, do you try to blend in?
2- How would you describe your relationship with your closest friend?
3- Would you describe yourself as passionate or nonchalant? Would others agree?
4- Why are you asking to be typed? What is making you feel a disconnection from your current title of ISTJ?Twas my original thought as well, but OP doesn't strike me as an inferior Te user. Especially considering he's younger, inferior function is barely there at 16.I do believe OP's thinking function seems higher than inferior (am also leaning towards believing OP seems closer to Ti than Te, but I'm more comfortable with the current information as typing him as Fi).

Gotta tell you, buddy, I'm still in the same age bracket as you both. But, despite this, I do know a little about inferior Si (And shadow inferior function Se).

For most of us (ENxP's) in manifests as a kind of nitpickiness when under stress, and a general aversion to anything boring and meticulous when in our normal day to day lives. When in primary/middle school (especially) or even high school, did you ever make careless mistakes on tests or assignments? A lot of ENxP's did. That's an example of inferior Si -or the lack of use of it in our day to day lives. Worst of all (I think), It makes us somewhat stupid because it can blind us. Ne is always thinking about the future but our inferior Si is always making us forget about the past. We can often charge forward into new uncharted waters and then go 'Oh, wait, I did this 2 months ago and it did not work out...' but by the time we realise we're already stuck in the mud.

However, like I said above, under stress the inferior function always weasels it's way in. It can make ENxP's more prone to frustration and a little perfectionist-like in weird situations (See House, from House TV show). ALSO CRINGE ATTACKS, gosh cringe attacks are something that befouls the minds of many an ENxP. We forget all the good shit but can't let go of weird cringe memories. 

I went on a bit of a rant there, whoops.

Anyway, there's a good Reddit post on it [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2qrvdt/entp_socionics_descriptions_by_functions/) and a nice Tumblr one [here] (http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/136898571387/how-functions-work-inferior-si-entpenfp)

edit: basically, if you look up Si dominant functions worst traits, ENxP's usually become that under stress, because once we come under extreme emotional duress our first 2-3 functions start to crumble.This is very un ENTP of me, but I believe friendship is a kind of connection beyond words. It's a kinship that can't be fully understood or measured. I think people confuse real friendship with getting along with others and I hardly see it as the same thing. I have many of what others would call friends, but I have only had one or two of what I would call a friend in my entire lifetime. Friendship is defined by connection- i think most real friends click immediately (but that's just my experience), love for that person and things connected to them, really genuinely enjoying being around someone, getting energy from being around that person, wanting to know about that person.Autumn&gt;Summer&gt;Winter&gt;Spring.

I might've once said Winter was the worst but now my allergies have gotten worse Spring is somewhat unbearable.

I didn't used to mind Winter but a few years ago everyone started thinking it was some k00l edGY thing to like Winter (I'm not saying that's what you believe, OP- just what I've seen SOME people do) because Summer was for the 'cool kids'. Idk I always get sick and windburn in Winter.who likes them??Lock me in a room with an ISFJ and I might kill them. They're just like an ESFJ but even more 'I'm a special snowflake'.*My bestfriend is an ISFJ, so of course there are exceptionsreplied in the wrong thread, buddy?For certain he is an xNxP. I totally understand where you're coming from with INFP, I can also understand it being argued for an ENTP or an INTP (I don't so much agree with ENFP.)
His monologue at the end of 'That Power' used to SCREAM ENTP to me, but now after relistening to it with INFP in mind it fits so much better (especially the actual rap part). 

If I had to give a definitive answer on what MBTI type I thought he was, I'd say Donald Glover is an INFP, but the Gambino persona has a lot of ENTP influence in it.It's like all the emotions I continually try to repress and ignore bubble up to the surface with so much love that I go around to everyone at a party (or texting everyone I know) how much the mean to me. I'm very giggly and accidentally flirty but also VERY truthful, you could ask me anything when I'm drunk and I wouldn't even know HOW to lie.I like people to make jokes, they cheer me up and make me feel like people care without showing enough emotion to make me feel like people are pitying me or make me feel vulnerable.Myself, ENTP (F)

My mom is an ESFJ, and my two brothers are ESFP &amp; INFJ. i like youIf I may, If this test were really BUILT to discriminate against races, do we not think it would be engineered to put white people in the top percentages, rather than allowing Asian people to score higher?

It's already been proven that we as a generation have been trying to teach the newer generations the kind of skills you need for an IQ tests (we are taught a lot more problem solving and puzzle recognition in school nowadays than say 20 years ago), perhaps 'white' communities and schools and 'white' families just generally are TRYING to teach their kids these problem-solving skills more than their 'black' counterparts (for whatever reason, be it money? since it's still apparent black and Hispanic households generally earn less.)I love small talk. Deep conversations are great! But some people can't handle differing opinions and you get that when it comes to deep conversations.i like youThis was a refreshing opinion. I agree.I, frankly, don't care much about what his policies are. He is not a politician and he does not have the knowledge needed to run a country, he doesn't understand how things work like Hilary (or frankly anyone else) does. I don't like Hilary, but I'd rather be working under someone I disagree with who knows what they're doing than someone who doesn't even know what they are doing.i love uI always say,

 'generally',

I use 'I feel' a lot when talking to strangers, and 'I believe' and 'I think' when talking with friends. I think that 'I feel' is much softer and more agreeable? People can connect with it more.Well then it *could* be argued it's the races fault for not keeping up with the system, not the systems fault.you sound like a bit of a dick, pal.ESTJ's? or assuming Fi's are more prone to depression, perhaps ESTP/ISTP?85% ENTP

Really? The ESFxs ive meant kind of liked to chit-chat, but ENFPs I've met really wanted to TALK y'know, and sometimes it was like they couldn't keep their *big* ideas to themselves.If anything I think theyd embrace them. Up untill your teenage years youre kind of forced to live how your parents want you to. Teenagers that rebel in puberty probably just start to come into who they really are.Motiv Type - AOHWVRG

Lets preface this with, I hate Robin and I think the Sheriff is just doing his job.

I originally went with Little John, Maid Marion, Sheriff and then Robin Hood, but I realised Little John did stand up for the girl and offer her support; But Marion sacrificed so much more. She did something she was probably morally against for her love (which I believe, in itself is a moral act) and then had the decency to be honest about it when she knew he was probably going to react harshly to it. So I changed to Marion, John, Sheriff &amp; Robin before I hit send.

My Results are as follows:

"You are essentially a contented person, even if you consider yourself a little superior. You are moral by your own standards, for you believe that morality is what best suits the occasion."

I am very much superior in my attitudes (Its a big flaw) and I would call my morals *flexible*

"Women: You like being a woman, you understand what love is, and frankly enjoy sex."

I don't like being a woman and generally prefer to hang out with men. Sex is good though.
While I see your point and respect it, I just don't agree with it.

To me, he was doing his job locking the men up but he probably didn't really see them as guilty. He saw an oppurtunity to get from the scenarion and he took it. He let everyone around him make the decisions, really. It's not good, but I don't think its as horrible as an abuser.
Interesting! I actually thought in seemingly the opposite way that perhaps little John offering up his help isn't really that moral because he in the process is wooing the seemingly 'beautiful-enough-to-manipulate-into-sleeping-with' marion.Well going by the story he probably stole something from a rich dude, intending to give it to the poor.
I say 'hunny' mostly. 

It's definitely meant to be condescending.

But 'buddy','pal','kid','friend' and 'my dude' are things I say that are not meant to be condescending.My ENFJ buddy and I are the best at getting shit done.I have ADHD and a Generalised Anxiety Disorder and I'm essentially exactly the same; I'd say youre an ENTP. Welcome to the Club!I thought that was more of a 'don't try to take the characters personalities and apply them to this situation'ExxP.this actually is a really good point. Maybe a high fe type?[A collection of photos of me ive used for reddit] (https://imgur.com/a/yo7P9)

you look like a model jfcAll I can say for certain is ENFP = LabradorI've never heard a better explanation of ti/te honestlyMostly my own. Sometimes other voices, but they're usually just annoying and intrusive thoughts (my brain screaming a random word over and over again). When I 'think' and 'hear' a voice, i suppose I would interpret it as my own, but it's not like I can actually hear it, like I hear the intrusive voices? - entpMy friend and I (Both ENTPS) scored similarily... maybe it's an xNTP thing.And another tallyInterestingly, that was my second and only about 2 points behind phallic compensative. + Im not saying every xNTP is Phallic Compensative, but if you look at these comments *most are.*To be perfectly candid with you, this isn't a fully developed opinion. To be certain about it I would have to do a lot more research and perhaps even have personal experience on the subject. From my understanding most heavy duty drugs are almost certainly catalysts for violent behaviour. I'm not talking Marijuana here.

I think, in the event of legalisation organised crime might go down but individual crime is certain to go up.  To say that customers would remain the same is a touch wrong- I wouldn't do drugs personally but if drugs were legalised I would definitely try some more adventurous stuff. Easily anxious, fidgety, generally stressed people as a whole I think might turn to drugs when before they were fearful of the law. Those aren't exactly the kind of personalities you want on drugs. Junkies as well, drugs still are addictive and can fuck up someone's life with that obsession shit.

There are certainly valid points against this though, if drugs were legalised and circulated through government they probably wouldn't be cut with so much shit- people could actually know what they're going into, therefore not heading in way over their heads and being unprepared/doing something stupid. People under the influence of drugs would feel much safer going to authorities, in precaution the taxes and profits from drugs could go into a better police department equipped to deal with random drug crime.

Regardless, if this were to become a thing MANY rules would have to be put in place to safe guard against some kind of epidemic of junkies roaming the streets and stabbing each other with heroin needles.

I've compromised my opinion on guns- rather than drugs- by the way.Well, many people have told me I seem like an ENFP &amp; I'm always second guessing my type (I'm a bit more open with my emotions than ENTPs seen to be? Perhaps that's why people call me a feeler type). I wouldn't say I am certain - or that I ever will be; but this title is sufficient, for now at least :)Is the opposite of Fi Te?Interesting to see someone else's perspective! Thanks for the response!Interesting article!I believe the person said the extreme analysis of morals and ethics was a fi thing. Too much focus on the internal to be Fe so can't be linked to its partner Ti? Or something similar.I definitely agree. I can't offer much more insight than that. Honestly the best way to get help typing is to ask someone online or in your day to day life privately, it helps a lot more to have an honest conversation with questions and answers rather than an overly friendly chunk of text that immediately gives room for judging biases from the people you're questioning. So much as say 'I feel' on here (a term I've come to use often to soften the harshness of my words) and people are already calling you a feeler and acquitting it to language choices. 

You can define someone type without a back and forth or interview like discussion imo. It's just not reliable to make the TYPE ME posts.Are we all just going to ignore the "Personally I test as an ENFP/INTP depending on the day,"?

Okay then.

ENTP, first ever crush was in daycare, I remember kissing him in a pool before ever even speaking to him and his sister yelling at me about him being 'hers' so I got over it quick.

First REAL crush was my best-friend in 6th grade, who I moved away from- but not before he called me a hooker he wouldnt want jumping out of his birthday cake, again wasn't really *love*.

&amp; First Boyfriend was 8th Grade, who I dated on and off because he was too clingy and I was a bitch - still not much love there but close enough.ENTP &amp; Flitting somewhere between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, but I just go with Slytherin.I know it's impossible, but my friend and i are trying to type her. She checks all the boxes for ENFJ but she DEFINITELY has introverted feeling (honestly i've never seen such an obviously introverted feeler in my life).  What does this mean? She obviously can't be an ENFJ because that doesn't match up with the functions, what else could she be? What questions do I need to ask her to better type her?Me; ENTP that favours ENFJ (or INFJ)What do we all think Rick/Morty and supporting characters are (from Rick and Morty, the show)?
Currently I'm thinking ENTP or INTP for Rick, ISFJ for Morty? And im not sure about the parents but probably SF's?How do you feel about your type?

What is your type, what is your relationship with your type and others with your type? Do you feel a kinship with people of your same type? Is your type your favourite? Do you wish you were another type? etc?
I'm an ENTP but I do deal with anxiety often, and as a coping mechanism for my anxiety I do stress over details and can like things to be done very precisely.

Some Examples:

- When meeting with new friends in a new place I can become obsessive about where EXACTLY im meeting them/ when. This doesn't affect me however if it is friends I already know or a place I already know.

- In high school I was once moved out of my seat during a test that I was already very anxious about and being taken out of this routine made it very hard/ almost impossible for me to concentrate (possibly my ADHD).

These things sometimes makes it very hard for me to connect to the ENTP (specifically P) stereotype of spontaneity and flippancy.

**TL;DR** I'm very bored with rules and routine usually but when I get (very) stressed/anxious it can be easy for me to fall back into an obsession with routine.

Am I mistyped? Is this common?I find myself often kind of for lack of a better phrase 'giving up on' certain beliefs I have in the search for logical consistency, for example:

I was recently talking to a friend about my beliefs on drugs and gun laws and I said 'I think people should be allowed to take whatever drugs they want- eventually, regardless of whether I personally approve of taking drugs at all because freedom is the most important aspect of a modern society (I understand however that this is not something that's realistic currently because crime rates would OBVIOUSLY go up) ' then said 'I'm not sure on gun laws . If I was in power I'm not sure I'd change them (in my country they're essentially banned)'. My friend pointed out if drugs (something that can be linked to crime rates) should eventually be legalised, then why shouldn't I want guns to eventually be treated the same. I evaluated the pros and cons of each 'belief' and essentially said 'I can see there's a difference in these two scenarios (guns are specifically tied to the injury of others and drugs are relatively recreational) but regardless they're not consistent enough for one another, I must drop one belief for the other'. I thought this was normal behaviour- but when speaking to another few friends about this they said they would just continue to believe in what they believe in regardless of whether it caused internal conflict or not. 

(I've been through this a couple times with my beliefs).

I spoke to a few MORE MBTI friends and one of them distinctly said 'that's so fi' and the other said 'that's so ti'. I was wondering if any fellow redditors tied this kind of thinking to a particular function (and if so, which) or think it completely disconnected from MBTI?

Please excuse spelling and grammar issues, I typed this up on my phone.

Unhealthy ENTP is bad, especially when I was depressed. I kept testing ISFJ, never went outside/left my room, let people take advantage of me, too scared to try anything new, so basically just acted like a robot and only did things if they were useful to someone else. You're like obsessed with INFJs/an INFJ fam. Ah, I thought you were referring to the T/F dynamic, a lot of people seem to default to that first. 

Personally, I use 25quiz.com and just roll through the top 5 that they give you. ISTP may suit you, depending on the way you relate to Se. Ti + introversion leads us to ISTP, INTP, ISFJ, INFJ. 

How about Fi vs. Fe? How strong are you values and how big a part do they play in your life? How often/accurately do you read a room of people? Do you rely on manipulation? Are you very "take me as I am?" Socially awkward? That might help you a bit. 

Se vs. Si is a pretty easy one to identify. Si can relate to (can but not always- depends on other factors!) consistency, conservatism, security, stability, tradition, reliability, memory, nostalgia. Se can tie into adrenaline, physical/spatial awareness, attention to surroundings, sensations, luxury, thrills, taking action, decisiveness. Obviously these aren't true for all or exhaustive, but let me know if any of those make you go "yes!". Even "locking down" one function can help eliminate a lot. Okay, so you talk a LOT about emotional expression and artistic expression, about appreciating beauty, senses and stuff. Se comes to mind, as taking in external sensory information is a big role in the arts and in sports. Although obviously that's not a concrete statement. P: Fi is all about who you are, having a very defined sense of self, and also Fi can be quite sensitive at times. Reading those statements put together in your post made go go "Fi-Se!".

Read up on ISFP and see what that sounds like. 

The bits of Te was more in the very direct way you type, sort of a tone thing, and Fe was more the "concerned with how I appear" although Fe would be more "concerned with how I appear because I don't want to break too many norms/my reputation is important" and Fi could act similarly like "concerned with how I appear because it's important my style reflect who I am to others, so they know who they're dealing with." Fi and Fe can be stylish and people-conscious in their own way. 

ISFP is Fi-Se-Ni-Te. INTJ is Ni-Te-Fi-Se so if you're testing that regularly, look at the same functions in different order. If that absolutely doesn't sound like you, try out INFJ/ISFJ. You sound very IF to me, but admittedly, part of that is based on the things you enjoy and while there's correlation, functions aren't always directly responsible for behaviors. Okay, there we go! That helps. So, you sound as if you favor Fe over Fi. In fact, I'm very similar. Everyone has values of some kind but strength and roles vary. 

To be honest, function descriptors (Fe and Si, Ti) sound INTP to my admittedly untrained mind. Your main objection to INTP is Ne, yeah? The way you describe all these ideas of yourself and pictures sounds Ne to me, but I'm an Ne Dom so I may be making inaccurate connections.  Have you taken the johns quiz thing? To be honest, your writing style, pointing out falsehoods, trying to put on social masks to get along...

I'm really really leaning to INTP or ISFJ. To be honest, you sound kind of depressed, which can seriously throw off typing.

Check this link too, especially in the ISFJ and INTP sections. If you're currently going through or have gone through some seriously rough emotional patches, you might identify with some of these... Okay, haha. The mood of your op read very melancholic to me, lol. My bad. 

I would check out personalityjunkie.com and read the descriptions for those three, then, and see what resonates with you the most. None will ever perfectly encapsulate somebody, but one of those three seem to be quite likely! Ultimately, tests are just a guideline or a suggestion, and it's up to you to identify which is best for you. MBTI is a helpful guide for self-exploration and introspection, IMO. No problem!! Haha, kierseys temperaments are helpful too! INFJ is melancholic-phlegmatic, INTP is phlegmatic-melancholic, and INFP iirc is a mix of the two as well... ENTP here. Tert Fe loves to straddle the line between "my god that looks so practical, I wish-" and "shut the fuck up you weirdo don't do that". 

My poor INTP boyfriend has to deal with me scolding him for making giant megastraw in public, but lately I've been joining him. &gt;definitely INTP. 

Joking, but yeah. Best of luck~!Dat Fe doe. I read a really good breakdown that had me convinced Luna is an INTP. Something about the surprisingly logical approach she has to her batty ideas of the world - how externally, they appear nuts, but everything within her boundaries is logically consistent, hence why she's so stubborn in her beliefs. 

I'll have to find it somewhere. I like Magic, my boyfriend (INTP) and I play and we both enjoy making decks and creating combos, although we do it slightly differently. 

He makes his deck list, figures out what kind of combos or win conditions he wants, then searches for the right card. I just find a bunch of cool cards and combinations and then figure out how to stuff as many of them into a deck that work together, the deck theme comes after. 

Pretty sure that's Ne-Ti/Ti-Ne in action. I don't think we know what we're doing. Female ENTP + Male INTP. We nitpick each other a lot, suck at expressing feelings, and are perpetually late.  

On the other hand, we get along and have similar "wavelengths", we learn and grow together well, and we understand each other with little effort - we both can follow the Ne-Ti web of thoughts and ideas. It's nice. For the ENTP board... Maybe it's just me, but vastness is something that resonates deeply. With all the ideas and options and avenues for exploration, I find myself feeling so very small in such a huge world. 

Pictures representing that would probably make me smile. I love r/thalassophobia, the ocean in general, and pictures of outer space (dark untold depths + potential for science). And really cool super close up pictures of things - seeing all the tiny unrecognizable systems that enable something to work. http://imgur.com/IQ3wYoh

stuff like this! I personally love pictures that put me in awe of/anxious about the things I don't know. ALSO WHOA 

http://imgur.com/iGqPU9ENo prob! I think that's a huge difference I didn't catch. I don't enjoy so much photos that capture or explain humanity or emotion, I like seeing things in scale/much larger than ourselves that evokes fear or wonder. IDK how other NTPs or even Ne doms may feel. Efficient. I like it. A starting point with promise!Aww, that's cute. I don't know if I've quite got it like that. For me, it feels like looking at the person and it feels like my heart does a sigh of relief and throws down a bunch of bags at the end of a trip. :D 

I wonder if its different between types/how soHe could be a lizard! I don't think he specified human, after all. Just try to put boundaries on my Ne!I hope you get what you want out of your 20s. 

Maybe Fi users are more likely to feel that way. Or maybe it's where it sits in your stack. Or maybe there's no correlation. I guess I don't feel the explosions of fireworks type of love/passion. Sexual tension is about the closest. I tend to emotionally hold others at arms length until I feel I can engage more intimately, and like I replied to them, it usually feels like relief and comfort. I could write up a million metaphors to describe it but I don't think it is the same feeling to me as it may be to you. The closest I'd say is it manifests in curiosity and interest in the other person and not being immediately annoyed. I like lizards :( or tentacle monsters. Man, if he's a tentacle monster sign me up because I'm all about that hentai life. 20-30 year old kraken seeking anime girl What type are you?Please do that. And consentacles is totally a genre. Oh, I don't like this game anymore. I think most people have some level of emotional sensitivity, just depends where you fall on a) what it takes to feel it and b) what it takes to express it. 

I think I misrepresented myself. It's not that I don't have any infatuation phase, more that it just doesn't seem to take the same form of fireworks and warm melting feelings. When I'm infatuated with someone... I don't care so much about what they want or like, but about how they work. I like to question them them, I think about them a lot, I get really intense, and then I completely lose interest. When I see people I'm infatuated with, I'm excited for sure, but my mind starts whirring with curiosity and I feel like I'm trying to connect. And then it wears off, sometimes overnight, and never lasts for more than 4-6 weeks, if that. On average, maybe 1-2 weeks. 

I think the difference between infatuation and love is that when I love someone, I don't view them as an adventure or a curiosity, and instead want to let them in and have them adventure with me instead. I suddenly have a partner that I love and respect and want to share with, and be vulnerable with, instead of forcing them to be vulnerable with me. That's basically how I feel. He makes me better. Fair enough Also I can definitely be sensitive or emotional, lol. I'm not a very cold person overall. Maybe lukewarm, but I definitely cry and things like that. I think excitement and love might just manifest differently and I'm curious about how. ;_;Wow, that's so interesting, especially about the smell. I text my boyfriend constantly but always "forget" to text back others, lol. We rack up thousands a month. I can get overcrowded with physical contact, like a cat :D I'm all cuddly then I'm like "wait no nvm". Although usually I'll put my foot on him or something so we're still touching. I cry when I get frustrated the most. Like if I can't express my thoughts, if someone is refusing to let me explain something, if I can't figure something out and I feel incompetent. Or more recently, when I have an epiphany about my feelings and why I'm feeling them, I tear up/get choked up.That's interesting. My ISTP friend says he can't do online friendships or relationships well because of the presence thing. I think everyone just has their preferred methods of communication. Good luck c: or not! Whatever you like. Wowza. I like that. That even made me feel special. That's just downright poetic. Thank you for sharing - that's a very selfless point of view.My grandma is an ESFJ and she's the sweetest. Always making snacks, cleaning out my car without asking, basically still treats me like a kid, but in a way that's really endearing and shows how much she cares. The other ESFJ I know is in hospitality and is SO chatty, but he takes care of his people. I'll be your poor sweet ENTP baby I didn't say it wasn't. It seems to be a rather negative, jaded outlook and anecdotally speaking NT types seem to adopt those views more often. I know this. I was curious as to what type would say that, which is why I asked. When he answered, I said fair enough, because it was as I suspected. I don't know what you're struggling with. I've always used it as a "yeah, that makes sense/is fair". Pretty much "good enough for me". Is there a reason you never pursue them or share how you feel with anyone?I've got a clear bias, but ENTP. INTP. or ISFP.To be honest, I wasn't surprised. My roommate was concerned that I'm a bit sociopathic, which I'm not. What I am (as is my INTP bf) is curious to a (sometimes worrisome) fault. Sometimes we want to know something so badly that we forget others' feelings and comforts and social norms and just go for it without stopping to consider the consequences. People tend to get hurt that way. I think for me, it's just that my curiosity overtakes my sense of "I shouldn't do this, it's bad" sometimes and I just go for something without considering consequences. I have ADHD so it might be biased, but I lose EVERYTHING. Used to panic every other morning for losing my keys or phone in the span or 2-3 minutes. I recommend using Tile, lol. I'm always late, I clip objects constantly, and generally I joke that my life is permanently set 5-10 minutes behind others.I didn't take that particular test. p: I scored very, very high on similar tests as a teenager, now I'm just moderate. Overall, actual sociopathy is quite rare so I'm not surprised. I think that certain function combinations might just lead to "motivation first, people less" before those people have matured. 

I care a lot about feelings and stuff, it just took a while for that to catch up. I've always thought low Fe would lead to percieved anti-social behavior. Not always understanding cues, very "zoomed-in" logic, going against social norms and conventions, less focus on harmony but also lacking in apparent personal values, not always emotionally expressive (or expressive in unhealthy ways), etc. 

My dad's an ENTJ and my best friend is an INTJ and both are just... I don't know why, they've never crossed my mind as antisocial. More apathetic, but less impulsive. Very calculated, but none of their goals seem to involve people at all so it reads to me as very focused and maybe just over-efficient at times. That's my theory, anyway. I could totally see high-Fi doing some crazy stuff. Was discussing with my INFP roommate how we could have some really scary Fi-dom villains if their principles were fucked up enough, lol. 

But overall, I think Reddit skews very young and low-order Fi/Fe would lend to that image of not caring about others, where I think at that point in development, it's less about "not caring" as it is "not prioritizing". Ooh fair enough. 

Edit: Actually, which traits do you think overlap for you? Fair enough. I had my phase, lol. For me it really was just "what does this button do?" without regard for others. Once I watched the consequences happen and my relationships torpedo, I figured out pretty quick that you can't always do what you want and still keep friends. 

Definitely not suggesting all ExTPs are innocent, some are quite Machiavellian. I think the mostly-normal ones eventually mature, haha. Or might be less curious about harmful reactions. Less impulsivity, I think. My boyfriend can be very unfeeling in an alarming way, but he just doesn't do anything about it, lol. If he's curious, he just asks me or hops on Google. If I'm curious, I'm like "k, time to go test this out!" before thinking it through. He's lazy and thinks everything through to determine if something is worth the effort. I agree with you that it's hard to see F-doms as sociopathic, but I was going on a tangent about how if an Fi-dom had certain beliefs that conflicted with a lot of society, they could potentially justify harm that way if they believed they were doing the right thing. Not sure if that's necessarily sociopathic, but it could seem that way to outsiders. 

I'm sure it's in some values for people to not care. I think that the general % of people who scored high in sociopathy is much higher than the actual rate, so I'm just wondering where the disparity comes in is all. I'm sure there are many varying reasons for it, so I'm brainstorming and may sound a little incoherent. Hahaha, poor ants. For me, my curiosities tended to lie in people and how they operate. This would translate into perceived romantic interest and I didn't care to set boundaries, and when I was done and uninterested, off I'd go into the ether. Or sometimes I'd poke at people to see reactions. Either way, it ended quite hurtfully. 

Now I'm more curious about creepy events and oceans and outer space and less so about people I know. I have definitely wondered about if I could get away with killing someone and how I'd do so... but I don't test that out because that'd be pretty awful. Oh, I agree it's unlikely. More of a thought experiment. I don't think much here is sociopathic, I think things just appear that way because we don't always understand the motivations and thoughts of others the way they see them. 

Fair enough, thanks. Hmm, fair enough. So mostly difficulty with emotions and impulsivity-related traits? Yep. I think we just develop our awareness of feelings and how we effect others a bit later. Not like that can't leave destruction in our wake, but hey. p: At least a good portion will likely grow out of it. I'd be curious to test a bunch of xxTPs who are 30+ and see their scores. Lol, I think our ExTPs all have our acceptable threshold of rule-following. Lol, I'm not really hurt/triggered/etc by it, but I know personally that I had a similar phase where I was very adverse towards emotional expression and feelings so I could be projecting onto others. I think it might be a teenager thing combined with the same judgment towards emotional expression. I know that doesn't apply to everybody, though. 

I definitely struggle with identifying and expression emotions properly, but I'm better about taking the feelings of others into consideration now at least. Not perfect at it, but much improved. I think younger NTs can be quite unpleasant while we wrestle with our feelings and the way we're "supposed" to act towards others. I've kind of learned to back away from people, just because it does get people hurt and cause a lot of unnecessary chaos that I try to no longer thrive in. p: 

My fave subs are /r/CreepyWikipedia and /r/thalassophobia now, haha. Wiki pages and weird ocean creatures don't get their feelings hurt. It's scary but totally fascinating how much there is to explore nad how little we know. 

And it really would, and I'm sure a thick one would be strong enough to do some damage, especially to the neck or other softer areas... Murder weapons in general that can't be purchase-tracked would probably be superior anyway, as long as you're careful not to leave DNA evidence. Oh yeah, for sure. Not all ENTPs love unregulated chaos - I'm more of a "controlled chaos" person myself now. Set up a nice space or scenario to play in, and then go hog wild. :D Everyone has their breaking point, each type just has more tendencies towards certain points than others. Hmm... Then again, there's almost mistyping as well. Some of the ENTJ/INTJs I see doing that might not even be xNTJ at all and just may be going by wishful thinking and stereotypes. The "evil mastermind" thing. Ehh... I don't really know many INFJs that I like, even if we started off friendly. They don't scare me so much as I just... find them to be really kissass-ish and oversensitive, so they're hard to deal with. 

I obviously don't know a ton of INFJs so I'm stereotyping based on the interactions I've had. I think there is one that I really like, she's older though. Yeah, I'm not sure it's sociopathic if someone truly believes that they're doing what's best for their people. Or maybe it is; I don't quite know. That's a good post. I mistyped a lot... ISFJ a few years back when horridly depressed, then I wavered between xNTJ and xNTP for a while because I didn't understand much about functions and went based on behavior and circumstance. More recently I considered ENFP, but Fi as a function suits me far less than Ne-Ti. So ENTP it is. p: Jesus Christ, lol. People can definitely have antisocial traits without being a full-blown psychopath, although when someone brags about it I'm inclined to think they just want attention. p: My father is an ENTJ and unless he's really pushing at work, it'd be hard to tell. He's rather soft-spoken and very rational, although he cares so deeply about his family and loved ones. Best friend is an INTJ as well. So I have a hard time seeing xNTJs as cold or bad people, haha. I think I would be read as an introvert as well, but more because it's hard for me to form IRL friendships and I'm really awkward, so I prefer computers. People are hard. Noted that in my thread with Scal, lol. Evil is very subjective and it's important to know motivations behind the actions.I agree on evil being rather seductive, actually. There's a lot of "what-if" that goes through my mind. I think things that we consider evil also tend to ravage social norms and defy a lot of expectations, and that idea is really attractive to me. But there's many reasons why we don't do those things. That's just my own experience tho. p: Fun note: My boyfriend is INTP and uses "nezumi" in many usernames, lol. I had to doublecheck who I was talking to. So much fun stuff. :D Between wiki and reddit I have a ton of engaging material. Lol, most of my family leans very conservative. I kind of shut down when I hear "Obama's going to microchip..." or "We're become a communist nation..." etc. I like psychology and politics, got very interested during the primaries. I enjoy finding such easy communities where I can discuss and have my viewpoint challenged with other more rational opposition. p: And I can get my fill of weird stories and things. Part of me likes the idea of watching the world burn. Power isn't as attractive to me, but being close to someone with power is. Nobody should hand me large amounts of responsibility p: Partially kidding. I like that hashtag, very relevant quote. To be honest, my opinions waver so much and I'm sure of very little this election cycle. So many ways it could go. It's really memorable and part of me sits there like "burn it all down, this will be fun" and the rest of me says "but I want someone who cares and will do right by our country". RIP. Good to have an ESTP chime in! It's very superficial, I agree. I feel the tunnel vision thing a lot, although for me it's less about winning and achieving a certain goal than it is about just playing around and sating my curiosity (although I guess that'd be a goal too). 

I think it really isn't sociopathy unless the person feels no remorse/empathy/any regard for others, along with the other ASPD criteria. Of course, everyone has varying levels of those things... I definitely feel remorse/guilt, but when I act impulsively, it only kicks in when it's too late. I've always felt lost and I don't understand what might fulfill me or make me feel complete/meaningful. Part of me wants to just give up and convince myself there is no greater meaning, but I still keep searching. I'm just a bit younger so I don't have a lot of experience to go on. 

What kind of danger do you think you pose? I wonder if a lot of ENTPs feel like wanderers or lost or like they aren't "good" for people. Hmm. I won't offer reassurances because I know next to nothing about you, but you do seem at the very least intelligent and capable of such thought. I don't have anything else, but I hope you find it is that you're looking for. Or at least figure out what it is. I use it to help figure out what I want in life, in understanding myself, and helping my relationships. I really have a hard time with my own feelings and communication with others in a meaningful way, and learning about difference modes of processing and analysis helps broaden my view of others. 

I'm not very successful in making friends still, but it's helped my relationship quite a bit. I think MBTI gives me a "language" to use to express myself and the way I think and feel, which I sorely needed. I kinda went "wat" Long comment, warning. p: 

I can help with Ne, at least. I know I don't use Ni mainly because Ne game 2 stronk. However... which types are you considering? Because Ne in the dominant position will look different than in others. 

For an Ne dom, it looks mostly like curiosity and exploration. My biggest priority is keeping as many options open as I can and toying with them all. I lose interest in things and people quickly. I have trouble focusing and keeping one straight path, to the point where I'm often struck by "analysis paralysis". A lot of my conversations sound like: 

"Whoa, you said that, and it made me think of..." 
"You know, I bet if you took x and did y, you could..." 
"Oh, idea!" 
"Wait, you know what you could do?"
"I know this is off-topic, but it's kind of related..." 
"Wait wait wait, don't interrupt, I have something." 

Phrases like that, constantly. Always budding ideas, tangents, no real straightforward conversation, and I use SO many analogies. Things are tied together abstractly and sometimes my connections don't always make sense to others, unless I go back and explain them. My ideas aren't always good or related, but I filter them out after. I can appear to be really indecisive, but I do truly consider new ideas and turn them over in my head later. I tend to "sit" on things for a long time before coming to a conclusion. 

Everyone comes up with new ideas, of course, but I find people with more Ni (especially Ni-Te) to have more direction of where they're going and fewer fears of lost opportunities. FOMO, you might say, lol. Hahaha, thanks. We have an open relationship regardless. Too much Ne for the both of us, maybe. 

I made a comment in xNTxpolitics, nice and garbled just like an ENTP should be. I have serious reservations about Hilary and her ability to be reigned in, Trump and his everything (but also his ability to fill the Supreme Court), a tinfoil hat theory that they're working together, and I debate myself on whether I should go third party or not due to all of these factors. 

I'll probably be in flux until November 8th, really. I feel personally attacked by this. I can't stand Pence either. Gah. I also have serious concerns about the amount of influence and power Clinton has and how untouchable she seems to be... I think Trump could be reigned in and held accountable more easily than she could. Odds are I'll go third party, but I question it a lot. It's hard to get me to set my mind in stone on much. I was hoping Johnson or stein might garner enough support to at least be included in the debates in 2020, but I don't see them meeting the threshold now. Sigh. I wouldn't feel good about voting for either. I think it's a 15% threshold required for a third party to become involved in a presidential debate, or 5% of the vote in this general to become eligible in 2020 for debate time/public funding, which I believe is the boost a third party would need. That makes perfect sense, thank you. Ah, my boyfriend is an INTP. His Ne is definitely more reserved. We both obsess over topics, and only let go when the interest is exhausted to our satisfaction. He isn't as frenetic with his conversations, and is more stubborn than I am with new information, but he uses a lot of analogies and will be silent for a long time before presenting a lot of new, maybe odd ideas. He's very low-key creative and enjoys making new systems (RPG games complete with character classes, races, stat systems, world building, etc- it's THOROUGH) and things for fun. 

You may also want to think about Se vs. Si, and Ne vs. Se. Hahah, sounds like Ti. Always making sure the logic is consistent. I'm just gonna point out "escape goats". It seems in general that lower-tiered F tends to bring those out. Whether they're truly sociopathic remains to be seen. First of all how dare you. 

I shouldn't say anything, I'm too lazy to find my own damn gif.I want it to be real... :( Can't think of any feasible way myself, though. Maybe mysterious waves or rays/aliens shooting at certain distances/proximity to the moon... 

:D the god emperorWhat an unexpected and appropriate metaphor. I can agree personally, at least. If someone I like gets me going on a particular subject, I turn into a chatterbox. Otherwise, I'm quiet and at times even hostile to conversation. There was one I really liked and keep in touch with... We were very different and kind of struggled to connect at first (she always looked at me like I was an idiot, she thought I was really odd), but we grew to appreciate one another. I liked how straightforward she was and her reactions to my humor, and she enjoyed my wacky antics and thought I was hilarious. Interesting. Nice to have a couple of INFPs give their perspectives. :) Link went down on it, but there's a thread still up within like the last day. This was based on an older thread that's still floating on the first or second page that had survey responses. Dam son. I think I was a 27-28. Mine: 

1. 707 from Mystic Messenger
2. Yang from RWBY
3. Ed Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist

Alternates would be Violet Baudelaire or Foaly from Artemis Fowl. Hehe... Just played through Mystic Messenger and I'm hooked. TBH I'm naturally more attracted to xNTP and ISxJ, so I definitely voted that way. I like seeing archetypes besides "caring and nurturing", "manic pixie cinnamon roll", and "tsundere chill with a heart underneath". 

But that's just me. And ENTPs are obviously narcissists so... There you go. 

My fave types romantically tend toward: INTP, INTJ, ENTP, ISTJ, ESTJ, ISTP, ISFJ. In around that order. One of my favorites! C: I should reread it... I even learned the faerie symbols, lol. It's not really a catch-all. Part of what people want also varies based on environment, childhood, prior relationships, hobbies and lifestyle. 

As for me, I prefer someone who is interesting, intelligent, relaxed, kinky, curious, introverted and more than a little awkward. haiHahahaha "which one of you is it". :DI got like a 27, I'm normal :D It's timeIt's so easy to spot when you know what to look for. ISTJs get a bad rap but when we get along, an ENxP can definitely bring out the silly, lol. I think that's a... hard one to answer. You have to look at different kinds of intelligence, and more importantly, mental health. 

I think ENTPS would fall into one of the top two intelligence tiers, under "most unstable". INTPs similarly, but under "unstable". My INTP just got dx'd with depression and I'm pretty sure his Ne is dead in the water. I struggle with my emotional side - with relating to others, understanding how I feel, trying to place myself in a world when I don't even know myself... but as I get better I think I've been able to help him more. Sort of the geese flying in the V formation idea. 

Ne is quite helpful when trying to break out of Ti-Fe/Ti-Si issues... The IxxPs I know are quite good at making themselves feel extra misunderstood and alone. Which they are greatly misunderstood, but Ti can be so zoomed-in and fixated that the conclusions drawn end up getting lost when translated to anything outside. It's so easy for Ti-doms to get stuck inside their heads and eventually take an (oftentimes unhealthy) solace in it. Basically. I've been trying really hard to learn to apologize first and just get over my pride, but man it's difficult. I typically get very icy and severe and wait for the other person to break down. It honestly repulses me to think about making amends first, to the point where I feel my throat tighten up when I try. 

Alas, that's not how one manages a healthy relationship, so I just think about what I could have done better and at least apologize for that. Once I get over the initial "ice", I thaw out quickly. Ne - My constant struggle with life and what I want to do. I want to try everything and be everything, and I get "analysis paralysis" often and become indecisive. I hate the idea of closing off opportunities to the point where I'm sometimes secretly relieved when I get forced to do something via external forces. I'm very distractible, my thoughts are disorganized, and I can be difficult to follow in conversation. I talk in metaphors and analogies. 

Si - I hate stagnancy, but I've come to appreciate stability and the benefits it can provide me and my Ne. On a shallower note, I am extremely nostalgic for old haunts, music from certain periods of my life, and I can wallow too much in memories. I usually eat at the same places and eat the same things. When it comes to food, drink, and clothes, I stick to a small palette and rarely venture out - I have other things to think about.  Oof, right in the feels! Si-grip/Fe-Si for sure. I understand that feeling so well... The nostalgia that just sucks you in, usually after realizing how unknown everything in the future is, and taking comfort in the past even if it was objectively unhealthy. Ne too stronk sometimes. ;-;Nothing. Everything? We don't have instructions, and nobody asked to be here, so it could be a free-for-all. But I guess it's whatever people want. But I don't even know what I want... I have no idea. If I think about it too hard, I get stuck in a weird thought loop about it. Fuck I don't know, it's too early for another existential crisis. I've already had like two last week. I don't need anybody to respect it or share it with. I have it all to myself, to mull over and pick around in as I please... 

I'd say xNTP: 

To gain knowledge and understand to our fullest capacity. Understanding doesn't absolve obligations. Nope, you've pretty much got it. Knowledge and understanding. My biggest jolt of reality is remembering that no matter how much I learn, I still have duties and obligations in the present that need attending. Yowch. Lol, did you add it to the OP? 

In that case: LIFE IS MEANINGLESS. WE KNOW NOTHING. BURN IT ALL DOWN. I like the old Greek temperaments/humors. I think it can assist in typing, especially if you can get a good overall "feel" for yours. Phlegmatic, choleric, sanguine and melancholic. When looked at through the lense of Jungian functions, it could be more accurately described as an order of preference in perception/analysis. 

I believe MBTI doesn't describe personality in the sense of descriptors (loud, quiet, rude, kind, smart, etc.), hobbies, and behaviors. Instead, I think it gives us a common language to observe and reflect upon the ways in which we absorb and sort information and offers perspectives on... well, our perspectives. Have you looked at cognitive functions? It would be useful to look at Ne-Ti vs. Ti-Ne. Are you certain you're xNTP? 

If it helps, INTPs are some of THE quietest, most reserved people I've ever met. ENTPs are also known as "introverted extroverts", due to the leading function Ne. Extraverted intuition is stimulated by outside ideas and concepts, but not necessarily people - although our ideas can come from people. This means we don't always need people to get our energy and drive. Combine this with introverted thinking (where we go quiet and tend to mull over information) and we can seem rather introverted socially. 

ENTPs tend to have an energy pattern that is very on and off - either you're engaged and curious, or you're reflecting and considering. INTPs... are very static at times, externally, and spend more time in their heads. Huh? How've I come across as emotional to you about this? I think you're ignoring some valuable insight that could make your post better. ;-;OP seems a little defensive for some reason. Maybe ENTPs enjoy recognition when it's deserved at times, but I've never known an INTP to crave it as to be a primary aspiration. And death is... death? I'm not sure how anybody doesn't "realize" it. I've had similar thoughts, lol. Some ENTPs might lend themselves to more structure - I found that to be true for myself. Interestingly, I was also raised by an ENTJ father, so a strong Te-Ni influence might have an influence. I like the post overall, actually. I'm just not... understanding the defensiveness when we offer conflicting information regarding xNTPs. p: 

That makes sense, I guess. Or maybe it could be interpreted more as... Realizing the finality of death and that exploration/learning can't always continue, knowledge won't stop death kind of thing? Not an Fe dom... 

But your dominant and auxiliary functions are usually your earliest development. I wouldn't worry about age... you might be thinking of tertiary and inferior functions (3 and 4). You still HAVE those functions... What makes you anxious or upset? What do you fear most? What kind of thoughts weigh on your mind? When you're stressed out, how do you react? 

For your questions... 

1. Everybody needs recharge time/gets tired. Especially if you're sensitive to others. :) Someone else may be better at explaining I/E in terms of functions to you, but ultimately I'd go with which function you default to the most. Extraverted functions =/= socially extraverted, at least all the time. 

2. With stronger Fe, it's natural to want to create harmony and help others in need. However, it's important to set some boundaries. At the very least, you shouldn't be putting yourself at a serious disadvantage for the sake of others. Look at it this way: a.) You can't help people as effectively if you have drained yourself, and b) If you help someone in the short term, you might still be enabling someone for the long term and ultimately do more harm. So, sometimes saying "no" is beneficial to both parties. 

If you struggle with just bluntly saying "no", my suggestion is to politely decline, and offer an alternative. "No, I can't help, but you could try: Doing X, talking to Y, researching Z instead. I hope that helps!" You can be firm and still be kind. Remember, think long term about your well-being. Don't be afraid to say no - a real friend won't force you to fold on your own boundaries. Very much so, lol. INTP Ne is a subtle thing. They draw the lines first, then play with what's left, where ENTP Ne can be downright terrifying. That "Good Ne/Bad Ne WELCOME TO HELL" picture on the ENTP sub is so relatable haha. You're not wrong... I'm just not sure I'm understanding what you're arguing. Or what you think I'm arguing. Your overall post makes sense and is well done, I just think the xNTP line in particular missed the mark a bit. Aha, see? If you need to justify setting these boundaries, console yourself in that he's being trained to rely on you and others too much and that although it hurts, you are building him up in the long run. :) Learning boundaries is hard and most of us learn in our late teens to mid twenties, although it varies individually. It's healthy in the long run for everyone involved. Good luck. 

Edit: Tagging /u/peppermint-kiss btw. She's an ENFJ who can probably help you out more. Glad I can help. #rektIn general I agree but it does get overwhelming when I stop to consider the vastness of everything. ;-;INFP, edited. I agree with the other poster. Best recommendation is to figure out one to two functions that you feel strongly you have. Have you taking johns test? It gives you your top 5. 25quiz.com 

I'd take that again, then read through all five types you get, and rank them in order of accuracy. Pm them to me or post them here, it's a quick test. The types you think are most similar will likely share functions in common and narrowing down one or two functions will close us in on type. 

Edit: the easiest functions for me personally to differentiate are Se vs. Si, Fe vs. Fi, Ne vs. Se. Just an FYI, ISTP doesn't necessarily mean active or action hero. Se is very... present-oriented. You could be an ISTP and love sitting on your ass and eating food, lol. I would more closely study your relationship with Ti, as those three types share it. 

If you don't think Ne at all, then INTP is most likely not it. Leave the stereotypes behind though, and focus more on your orientation. Are you more in the present? How aware are you of the subtle moods in a group? How are you when stressed out? Okay, that's really helpful. 3/5 results with dom or aux Ti, and tert or inferior Fe. What about Fi/Fe? What is your relationship with those and how strong do you think they are? 

How much are you Ti reliant vs. Ne? INTPs in particular tend to be very critical and less "big picture" than ENTPs. An INTJ will typically seek a practical application for the things they know and learn, whereas xNTP will learn for the sake of it. 

Se and Si? Essentially... How often are you thinking about the future? How often does indecision affect you and if you are indecisive, why? Is routine a hassle or a comfort to you?You sound quite like an INTP. Ne is very much the function of opportunity and can make one acutely aware of the presence or closer of them. Ti is also very much a closed system. As long as it makes sense in your head... It doesn't have to always match with the external world. You also sound like there's Si... 

I stand by INTP, then. I forget it exists a lotSame. My INTP and I are on some creepy wavelengths. :D I think Elliot is INxP for sure. Sometimes I think INTP, but a lot of his motivations seem very Fi. And there's also the mental illness you have to take into account. 

Darlene - ESTP
Mr. Robot - ENTP 
Tyrell - Probably ENTJ but I'm less certain because I haven't seen as much of the showBest friend is a female INTJ, believe it or not. Boyfriend is an INTP. You guys flock my way or something. Or to each other... Lmao. The ENFPs flock towards me as friends but I'm kind of standoffish, so the awkward NTs don't hold it against me. :DYou can keep them, really. I'll keep the precious INTP babs Don't go to class. Occasionally study material or skim notes. Forget when the test is. Cry the night before. Review notes 10 minutes before. Maybe cheat. Make a C-B, promise to never to it again, repeat a month later. Solid typing. OH SHIT ITS YOU I keep commenting on like everything of yours LOL. No I was being serious, you completely echoed my thought process to where I didn't feel the need to add anything. Saaaame. Mostly cause I get bored at work, but I'm on a trip now. I have two: 

"Just because you can doesn't mean you should." 
"Stranger things have happened." 

The first is to remind me to stop poking at things and to be mindful of others. The second is my mindset regarding the world and things I'm told, keeping an open mind to all of the weirdness."

Edit: I think other xNTPs and maybe xSTPs might oppose the first, depending on how they prioritize Fe and the comfort of others. I think many xxTJ types might roll their eyes at the second. ENTP 7w8, female. I've also gotten INTP, ENFJ, and ESTJ. MY LONELINESS
IS KILLIN MEHnnnnnng I'm sleepy mostly ;-; Reddit is all my social interaction. Or like 90% of it. ENTPs for sureDefinitely not high grades. Usually I'd pass with a C, C-. As and Bs only in foreign language. I was pretty depressed, my junior year was my only good year after I was treated for depression and ADHD. My last year I missed 30-40% of the semester and got passed because of crazy medical issues. 

Got out with a 2.936, so I call it a 3.0 and insist on forgetting college happened. 

I definitely failed some tests phenomenally. I didn't retain many friends after college. My boyfriend is my main irl friend, lol. We're both so introverted socially. :DI feel you. I had to get treated for ADHD and depression before my academics picked up. Can't do math at all. Did advertising and foreign languages. Umm... We are happily in our own little world. As a couple were chronically late, asocial, very imaginative, messy, awkward and kinky. We also annoy the fuck out of each other with pointless arguments because we're so pedantic. 

11/10 would marry I'm an ENTP female, boyfriend is an INTP male.

For me:

-I notice social cues and understand the "rules" better, especially the really subtle parts. 

-I tend to chameleon into social groups, although I rarely ever make real friends, but I can feel very fake. 

-I express my emotions more freely than he does, usually very erratically 

-I care more about people being comfortable 

-I'm more diplomatic and care more to compromise.

-I struggle with my identity because I blend in with groups on a surface level but I'm also awkward and don't... Quite mesh with others. I don't really know my place or who I want to me. 

--

He:

-Is more reserved and is a little emotionally stunted at times

-Disregards social conventions. Oftentimes it's funny and cute, sometimes it's embarrassing (usually not too bad). 

-When he does express his feelings it's... Chaotic but endearing in this really authentic, genuine way. 

-Occasionally misses social cues and misreads situations. 

-He's very adorkable and unabashedly himself. 

With our powers combined, we create a socially awkward, chronically late, pedantic shut-in couple. :D Yay low FeI'm getting ENxP out of this. My INFP roommate says our weird sweetness makes him want to puke, lol. It's pretty jarring when you consider we're both kind of chilly otherwise. We are barely tolerable. :D &lt;3:( it's rough on both ends. I personally feel like a perpetual misfit that still cares/tries and only managed to sit on the outskirts, where I see my INTP as endearingly awkward and clueless, albeit genuinely so. Ti-Fe is a weird little axis. Ye, definitely leaning toward ENFP. I'm not good at picking up Fi We're probably a biased sample of shutins on a Saturday night, lol. It's wonderful. C: 10/10 would INTP. We like to make forts and not talk to people together. HI BILLY MAYS HEREI'm the ball Goddammit Mystic Messenger stop asking me if I'm eating! Jk I'm drinking the alcoholic root beer. ;DWho knows p: Hehehe, that's awesome! I think gender can play a role, too. Women are usually socialized to be more conscientious of what they say and do around others so that might be a factor. 

Hooray for NTP relationships! Let's go on a double date :DSalvia is amazing, lmao. Brought back good memories. it meOne is an ENTP, one is debatably an ENTP, one is usually typed as ESTP or sometimes ENFP. Runner up is INTP. Hehe, my roommate and I argue all the time about House. One of mine is a dating sim character LOL but a clear as day ENTP. Escape and Fisher King. Separately we can usually manage our timing but together it's a mess. He's more timely than I am. With me there's no in-between, either I'm late or obnoxiously early. The ADHD doesn't help either. That makes sense. There's always the theory about shadows too, so who knows? Not I. P: 

Lol, he's 707 from mystic messenger. Look him up, he's ENTP as fuck and probably one of the harder ones to get a good ending on him. ;-; hey now, everyone wants to date me! ...In my dating sim...Klaus Baudelaire is certainly an INTP, possibly Violet as well (though she may be an STP). 

Persona 3 protag Minato is INTP, and I've seen River from Firefly typed as such. 

Edit: also, Q from 007!I PICKED ENTJ AND I WAS QUOTED LOL

"Dat follow through tho..." I'm so sorry to hear that. Jk be glad you're not ENTP trash. I think someone made a topic recently on it. That would be sooooo fun. :D I'd love to pick a type and then like, have characters interact with me different based on it. Like any character can grow to like or dislike you based on your actions, but they might start with a bias for or against. 

And I love that hoodie... I may cosplay as the blonde MC and my
boyfriend as 707 ^0^I'd recommend (mostly books):


Howl's Moving Castle (book or movie)

Artemis Fowl

Coraline 

Dragonriders of Pern

The Gunslinger

I've only seen River typed that way, the episodes I've seen with her did strike me as Ti-laden, but that's about all I could confirm. 

Definitely check out that pdf, one of those siblings is a definite INTP. 

The Q in Spectre is the one that I believe was INTP, I haven't seen the other incarnations so I couldn't tell you there, although I've seen some agreeing. It's a fun activity making them and getting all inventive with props and such! We cosplayed as Neo and Roman from RWBY this past summer. Milotic, Gardevoir, Sneasel, Absol, Rotom, Cresselia. :DHOW DID I FORGET SPENCER HES MY BABY ISFP, INFP, INTP in that orderLinks:

I don't know, I just do it because I'm supposed to. But I have someone I love who makes me feel like I have more purpose and can do better, so sometimes I need that too. To be quite honest, I had a thought train but I'd been drinking so I don't remember... Ooh, I like stress relief playlists! Mine is very electro. 

And yeah, I love venting lmao. Usually just being mindful and observant of my feelings is helpful though. I like those! I don't relate to Fi much but interesting. Does Fi make you feel at peace? Hey, tone sets the mood just as much as lyrics can! Why do you have trouble expressing yourself?Then again, stereotypes are likely pulled from the most obvious/egregious/noticeable behaviors. One isn't as likely to notice a relaxed, intelligent, pragmatic STP that isn't obnoxious/SPORTS so wouldn't they have a tougher time being factored in?I know some Russian but that's about it!

I like Si songs, very comforting and nostalgic. :D it's a very nice playlist, thank you!Argument, fallacy, anime, speed...

ENTP and INTP. Lmao. I agree, I enjoy working with other NTs. Even if they don't always understand how I get from point A to point B, they're willing to hear me out and accept it if it's ultimately making things more productive/efficient. 

SFJs are super hard for me to work with... Very structured, and usually need certain emotional requirements. :( Hey now, I'd never aggressively hit on an ISFJ... Maybe an ISTJ tho. ;D 

I'm in marketing and our setup is fun. I sit next to an INFJ who is snarky af so we make witty cracks about sales and bitch about people LOL. And my boss... Two ENTPs, it goes exactly how you'd expect. :D I don't mind STJs as much... more straight-laced and cautious, but ultimately rational if you can make your case well enough. SFJs tend to expect a lot out of me emotionally and that's absolutely exhausting. I'm not client-facing, I don't need to smile or be cheery all hours. ;-; 

NTP, NTJ, STJ, and NFP seem to be the easiest for me to work with. As a boss, though, I definitely need the flexibility. Aw, the ESTJ sounds like a great boss! ENTP... yeah, I tend to run my mouth a little too. Mostly I sass too much, lol. 

I struggle with high-Fe types. We just... rarely get along, I guess. Don't know if it's a type thing or what, but man. I think the only ExFJ I get along with regularly is my grandmother, lmao. Exactly what I do. Fuck around for a bit, then I get a ton of things done - and done well - at the speed of light. Whatever it is, that's when I do my best work and my brain is running at full speed. :D Ye, I rarely get along with Fe-doms for whatever reason. 

Poor ISTJ. I'd probably annoy them until they snapped and shot up the place. Although I really like ISTJs actually, like a lot. There's a girl who was on my team and we started out disliking each other, but slowly we got along as she started understanding my humor. 

It was so cute because I make a lot of tasteless jokes or say far-out things and she gets all flustered and wide-eyed and tries not to laugh. It reminds me of a kid who is saying a swear word and knows it's bad, but still kind of enjoys it anyway. So it was fun to entertain her. I, too, become excited once it's in. 2~ liberal airheada.) she's straight
b.) I have my own INTP (not that he'd say no to me dating her, lol) Mine are really accurate. Almost always ENTp/NeTi. Sometimes I get INTP. Heh, sounds like me on Vyvanse. I work in bursts typically, but with Vyvanse, I work super fast and get totally absorbed in what I'm doing. All my non-existent Te suddenly is there :D Except I get hostile towards others if they interrupt my flow or want to socialize... Bonus! Lmao, I get so fiendishly productive. It's hilarious except when my boss is trying to get me to take lunch. 

"NO I REQUIRE NO SUSTENANCE"I'm an ENTP. 

ENTP brother

ENTJ father

ESFP mother

ESFJ grandmother 

xSFJ grandmother

ESTJ grandfather

ESTP grandfather 

One ISTP stepdad and the xSFJ may be an I. My best friend is a really good example of INTJ, although she's not super into MBTI. 

I'm already having my own type crisis. ;-;That's nice of you to do. O: I think I may work with an INTJ. But possibly ISTJ, not sure. She's very methodical and never seems to get pressured. The INFJ is more distractable and stretches herself thin sometimes. The former is totally unflappable, it's pretty badass. Alt-right is a name for people who tend to believe in ideals of nationalism, conservatism, and often cross the line into extremist right-wing territory. Sort of the new right vs. the progressive left. My roommate is an INFP and my boyfriend is an INTP. 

My roomie is very passionate about things. Holds... Kind of far left views but cares so much about people. He's kind of jaded but still has a "I should know better than to hope but I can't help it" thing going on. He is a very intelligent person and can debate well, but when he gets too into it or feels personally attacked, he tends to go a bit haywire. 

He's very good at consoling, even if it's just a "wow, that really sucks. How are you feeling about it?". He can be a little condescending sometimes, not towards people usually but about them for sure. He will debate, but detached from people if their views are too far from his own. He definitely has his own worldview. 

My boyfriend is very different. He's more awkward, keeps to himself, also quite smart. However, he's rather apathetic to the goings-on of the world and doesn't take any strong positions on things that don't affect him personally. He isn't very idealistic. He struggles to empathize with others and prefers to try and fix things when helping others, even if that's not always the best approach. 

He's very genuine with his feelings when he shows them, but comes off as a bit sullen or chilly in nature. He's actually quite kind and excitable when he feels comfortable enough to open up around people. He's way more "traditionally" introverted than the INFP. When he debates, he tends to zoom in and pick apart someone's argument from the inside- he's more about telling someone why they're wrong and sometimes forgets to even assert why he thinks he's right. He's very pedantic at times even if it doesn't affect the bigger picture. 

Both are creative. The INFP is a writer and focuses on character building and moral themes, the INTP writes as well but prefers worldbuilding and making up technology and things. Also, a common thing is that NT types are thought of as smart and NF types as "all feels no reals". 

Make no mistake, the INFP can get very emotional and hurt how he conveys his point, but the INTP can zoom in so far that he sometimes can't step back and look at his logic, which isn't always consistent with the outside world. Both are very intelligent and perceptive- however, the INFP may honestly take the title as the smartest person I know. Fair enough. My best friend is a female INTJ as well and is really similar, although she spent too much time reeling me in, lol. I give her the space she needs and it works out, though. My mom is an ESFP and my brother and I are both ENTPs who like our alone time. Cue the undue concerns. I agree on the passion vs. apathy aspect, that's the biggest difference I notice between NFP and NTP, though Is seem more pronounced. 

Not going to lie, though, you seem a liiiiiittle bit biased against INFPs and intelligence, although maybe I'm just reading into your tone a little so correct me if not. You're spot-on on the fact that they come in from an established premise ("I feel/believe XYZ...") rather than a more flexible/non-comittal view, but I think it's disingenuous to imply they're not particularly smart just because they take a different approach. 

INTPs can also have some seriously flawed logic and miscalculated arguments. Part of the downside of Ti is seeing things in such a magnified view that the "logic" only works out in that particular context and can't really apply outside of that, where an intelligent INFP seems to apply their supporting arguments to real-world/practical contexts. Ti reminds me of a puzzle, like you focus so much on getting two pieces to fit on a connecting side, and they do... but then you realize that the rest of the puzzle isn't going to fit around it. 

INFPs and INTPs seem to both be miserable, although that might be my own personal experience. The difference to me seems to be that INFPs are more "I don't want the world to be shit, but it's shit, and this makes me really sad" and INTPs are more "Meh, it's all shit, so whatever." LOL. 

ETA: Granted, the INTP I know is depressed so take it all with a grain of salt. Yeah, maybe not the best term. I guess... in terms of getting things done or getting one's way, how far is one willing to go? That could entail disrupting people/being disagreeable (why I said people pleasing), or disrupting the environment, or even one's own comfort... 

Agreed, a lot of it has to do with environment, personality, conflict experience, etc. Just was curious to see what others thought!Lol, sounds about right. :D I find I'm sort of inverse... I rarely ever drive anyone towards a certain point, I'm more likely to say why something won't work/insist we don't do something. Oh, I enjoy talking to my INFP, but I'm not as... debate-y? I stopped the trollish phase around 17-18 years old. I've wondered if I'm an INTP, but I think some of the increased agreeability may be an Fe/woman thing. Socialization and all of that. 

Some INTPs tend to... Get really focused on pointing out flaws in logic where they miss the forest for the trees. Variance in personal development, I s'pose. I kind of quit that too, lol. I find other ENTPs infuriating sometimes, especially when it gets very argumentative and edgy... Pick your battles and all of that. IDK, but I'm not even certain of my type at the moment. 

I argued with my boyfriend last night and he did the exact thing. Pointing out issues and searching for inconsistencies and I'm like... Even if you find one, does that honestly detract from the point I'm making? It's pretty neat to watch them. They're really competitive and outgoing and love to go on trips and nice places together, haha. It gives me a lot of hope for the future, seeing them so happy together. Alone, they're pretty cool, but together, they could probably take over the world. ESTPs are so good at convincing people of things, lol. 

:D Then there's me and my boyfriend... We're basically just cute meme trash. RIP parental expectations. Lol, I don't disagree with much of what you say. Guess I had to naturally step in and defend the INFPs a bit. 

To the last bit, I'd add onto it, since I think I missed my own point there - he gets so hung up on finding tiny inconsistencies that it just becomes pedantic to the point of it being just kind of useless. Like, you're not wrong, it just... what you're (royal you ofc) pointing out isn't really detracting from the overarching theme so it just seems like a waste of energy to me. 

Ti is great for picking apart flaws in plans, but sometimes the focus becomes too intense and it's a forest-for-the-trees thing. I do it too, unfortunately. My Ne seems to prevent me from finding an absolute truth, though. I can go back and forth for ages until my head is a mess from it all. Exactly, lol. I can make a semi-reasonable argument for most typings and functions and apply it to myself... Which might support my being an Ne-dom even further... But only under the conditional that I'm using Ne to see these perspectives at all and I'm not actually that type. DAMN IT. 

It's a weird argument for sure. There's a lot of "I want to shake you by the shoulders" moments I have with Fi users, but most of the time I just let it go. I'll pull my own hair out after a while of arguing. I've always seen it used as a way to label right-wing subculture, usually people who support Trump p: Not sure of the origin, though, so I could be wrong. This is what makes me think I don't use much Fi at all. p: I rarely am stubborn... Lmao, if anything I'm too indecisive. Most people can make me waver in a stance, no matter how certain I think I am. Even if someone appeals to feelings ("don't do y, it would hurt X people!"), it's less a sense of empathy ("I don't want them to feel bad!") and more of a "If they feel bad, will it affect my progress later? Do I want them on my side now or in the future?"  This sounded like a recipe and then I imagined you throwing a cake down a river and it made me sad ;-;I'm pretty ADHD (oh god I can hear my boyfriend now "you aren't ADHD, you have ADHD!") and I mix up phrases and forget things a lot, and it grates on me when he wont let me get my point out. I kind of... Build my case out loud as I'm thinking it, so it takes me a couple of tries for it to work. P: Like chill and let me get it all out first! I'll tl;dr it at the end. Hehe... That last paragraph sounds kinda Fi-Te to me... Too tired to accurately type the rest but I wanted to pop in. Known for being a bit on the awkward and nerdy side (the few I know seem to like anime but that's just my group), but any correlation is just from speculation, lol. Signs it's about to go down with an INTP:

"Well, technically-"Jesus you're driving me to drink I could somewhat agree with this, although I only know one ESFP who I guess you could consider active, just not very disagreeable. I know Ne is pretty passive. I'm a sponge D: What is happening This is actually kind of hilarious. What type is this guy??Hmmm what are ENTPs I am curious. I must probe. Update: Apparently we are holograms. I am okay with this. OF COURSE HE ISENTP reporting for duty~ 

Ok ok I'll go to bed now ;-; I read somewhere that around that age the first two functions become more apparent? Would that be true, do you think? Hmm. Now I want to experiment on small children. I don't think I can do that though. 

My roommates kid is probably an ESTP (I don't know this but I knew it'd bother the roomie) and I said that and he (INFP) goes "no child of mine is a filthy sensor" lolololol. His kid is hysterical. Pathological liar at his age (pretty sure that's normal and healthy though). I love listening to them. It also could be that they make the final call after receiving the input from smarter people. *shrug* 

Maybe that's why I enjoy working with ENTJs so much. p: they listen to me and let me pop in ideas, but I don't have to actually lead or take in responsibility. Let me throw out some ideas and then give me something kind of interesting to do. Interesting... I'll need to look up the socionics part of mine. So if you are firm or taking control, do you tend to relinquish it quickly or only do so as a last resort?Hm, that's interesting. Maybe it's just the extraverted functions, then? I was a reallllllly chatty kid, lol. Never knew how to shut the hell up. It was talk talk talk talk about whatever random shit I saw or thought about. My report cards were all As and "mirrorconspiracies is a very bright girl, but needs some help not talking out of turn!" and the comments would get progressively more desperate as the years passed. 

Hahahaha I think he and my boyfriend's nephew are both ESxP, but I wouldn't know for sure. My poor roommate, the kid is SO wound up. They both likely have ADHD, too. His kid got CPS called on them, he yells and runs around like a buffalo, and makes up bullshit stories but he's adorable. Thankfully he's a little girl-crazy so he at least listens to me most of the time. He gets all sad and hugs me and goes "Sorry, I love you!" 

My fave convo between them was: 


Kid: "I am an expert at LEGO games!" 

INFP: "You need 10,000 hours to become an expert, though" 

Kid: "I did ten-hundred-thousand, I'm the most expert!" 

INFP: "You haven't been alive 10,000 hours. You still can barely poop without my help." 

Kid: (totally appalled) I CAN SO POOP. Lol, what type are you? A daycare would drive me MAD. Kids are so hard to handle. I'm strangely good with them (I think they think I'm one of them lmao) but it's so uncomfortable. LOL. This is my fetish. ENTP are gentle lambs. No I'm pretty sure they're all stalkers and creeps. I just tag along NT comments on Reddit. I was being facetious. p: 

But that's pretty bad. I wouldn't be proud of that lmao. Then again I've done some horrible stuff. Awwww sat Si doe!! 

It's okay, I love the scores for Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away so much. Lyrics are optional!I'll vote on INTPs for apathy. Low Fe/Fi not visible. Combine that with Ti-Ne (inquisitive, critical, a bit spacy, concerned with theory and less in the present, moves from interest to interest) and you get people who are just not passionate about anything but maybe a few select people and hobbies. The right stuff (8Like /u/merkabalifechoseme said, they have more sex. More specifically, they pass these traits onto their offspring, who will also be sensors. Sensors and intuitives usually date each other too, so we're headed towards a world full of sensors and intuitives will eventually disappear. 

ETA: Holy jesus yall it was a jokeIt's true, though. It's been proven that people start to lose brain power  everytime they interact with another person. So as an extrovert ages, they become dumber and dumber while the introverts usually remain smarter because they keep the neurons healthy. It's the ultimate truth. 

ETA: I'm not being seriousSensor genes are dominant, though. There's just more sensors and we need more of them to make things happen because intuitives can't get much done since they think all of the time. 

What really needs to happen is that we get all of the intuitives on say, a farm, and start breeding them. Then we can offset the otherwise-increasing ratio of sensors to intuitives. It might be a little dark, but this is the best option. Existential depression is awful, lol. Really tho. I agree. I can see it most prominently in my INTP. He's pretty depressed so sometimes he makes these incredible leaps of logic that make sense, but they automatically pull the worst-case scenarios that he just... assumes are correct. 

Zoomed in, Ti makes sense, but when examined with other outside factors and contexts, some of the reasoning really looks mangled. If you fight, I want to see it on World Star. To examine fighting styles of different types, of course. 

I have no helpful advice though. You seem kind of bristly/sensitive as well. Not trying to be insulting since your roommate would grate on me too, but it's one of those things where you just kind of have to let it roll off of you. I mean, punching him would probably be immensely satisfying, but only escalate things in the long run. (I'm totally being facetious with all of this... I have an ESFP mom, she managed to birth two ENTP kids with two different fathers.) 

I don't know if any of it is genetic, actually. I mean, personality to some extent must be nature... Dunno though, I just like to post really stupid things though to rile people up. Hard to do to another NTP. :D I like sensors just fine. My INFP roommate has the weirdest sense of superiority, though. Edited to add.No idea. He definitely has this intellectual chip on his shoulder, which is annoying. He IS smart, but sometimes the high horse is very annoying. Yes, the neurons in your brain get tired when attempting to connect with people, even more so on an emotional level. They eventually start deteriorating so you have to preserve them. So introverted thinkers will be smarter and extroverted feelers... well, at least they are nice! Genetics are cool. I still don't even know what the odds of having two ENTPs would be. Like, what even do. I wonder what traits are heritable and which correspond to MBTI. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9529660

Here's this, although using that is inherently flawed just because it uses the testing dichotomy vs Jungian functions. Still might poke through this. I use it for both. Honestly I just give an hour window and pray I make it thoNVM you have to pay for it ;-; I sure hope someone does. :D Not me! I just want to read the results and not do the work. I don't think most of us do it on purpose, at least I didn't. More like... I tend to just make poorly-planned decisions, either for myself, or do something that upsets others because I didn't think things through. It could be making an insensitive joke, doing something stupid that makes a mess, and so on. It's not really a brag and I think at some point we get more empathetic and stop acting like edgelords. This is true, but there might be other ways to figure out what the button does. Or to plan for the fallout. It's definitely true. I just know it. But then again, I'm running low on neurons. :D it's science!ESTP - like ENTP but spoopierBasically lmao. IM SO LOGICAL IM LIKE DEATH NOTE I CAN DESTROY UThis is tru. And ENTPs probably need to learn the  first part of that. Just from the other side of the fence. More action-oriented, more "present" overall, apparently higher on the sociopathy scale than ENTPs according to the informal survey. ESTP is king spoop.I was just talking to a friend about Ti-arguments that I have with my INTP. 

NTP: We are so objective and rational. 

NTP: *devolves into emotional carnage because we keep nitpicking and missing the larger point and can't handle emotions*

So........ logicalI think of things and never follow through. Hence why ESTPs are scarier and way more effective. That makes sense. You're still committed to the action, but to be fair lasik and the likes are major surgeries on delicate organs. 

(Also, I got Lasik this summer - best decision of my life!) It's nice to not have to worry about glasses, yearly appointments, wrestling with contacts, eye irritation, etc. 

I never thought I was ESTP. I pretty much ooze Ne, so my confusions were usually ENFP or INTP. Se is... I guess I understand it in a literal sense, but I guess I just never understand what it feels like. I'm really not very present around people or by myself, come off as very lost and confused sometimes haha, I get analysis paralysis like crazy and generally am not very productive. Se/Te users can find it rather frustrating, lol. Honestly, my first reaction to reading that was "and then what do you do?" 

When I'm driving, I mostly am thinking of other things. Singing to music, and imagining scenarios of characters in my stories, or thinking about conversations I want to have, or other made-up things. It's like I'm looking forward, but I'm going on autopilot, and when I'm pulled out of my head, I'm at my destination and unaware of the time that's passed. Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have a license. Ne is terrible for driving, lol. I think part of introverted thinking is going to be deconstructing things and concepts to learn how they work, which is fine for programming and building and new theories. 

I think ENTPs are more prone to doing this as we're naturally more impulsive, but Ti can end up doing some damage. Not sadistically, but sometimes you want to see people's reactions and learn how they think and we can oftentimes go to far in our pursuit of that knowledge. We... forget sometimes that people have feelings and boundaries and don't consider them soon enough. bow down to my logical objectivityI don't think people like my sense of humor as much ;-; I like saying ridiculous things and stating it like a fact. 

Ooh I like me some ISTJ ladies tho. The sex that you have between N and S types is FILTHY WRONG AND IMMORAL. It's okay, filthy wrong immoral sex is the best kind! 

;-; I wanna ISTJ girl now... I like dem ladies and guys. Which is the point p: that it's not actually objective and NTs in general like to say how objective and rational they are, when we succumb to fallacies and flawed logic and emotion too. 

If anything, an inability to recognize that can be much more catastrophic Succint. Glad I could make you smile! I don't know Shaun the Sheep. I made that up. You're welcome! I like your theory. Mighta found myself another ENTP at least (8 I always find the NTPs.Attention is... good when you're piloting a two ton vehicle LOL. I'm the worst driver. The ADHD doesn't help. Hahaha... With ice and snow I was going 30mph. Your life sounds fun. :D I feel like "oh god now I HAVE to pay attention". 

 I've had sort of a flow state with sports, I rowed D1 for four years and whenever I'd really get into it, I'd hit this rhythm, but it felt more like I would retreat so far into myself that I couldn't really feel anything. Like the physical pain leaves and I would get a "runner's high" and throw some really good scores for my size. 

I do like doing some risky stuff. Like, exploring abandoned houses and weird tunnels. Usually with my INTP or ENFP friend. p: I like places that have memories to explore, you know? Like there was this abandoned house near where I lived that had a fire in the 80s and there were still letters and such inside. I remember my friend and I went in and got chased out by someone and the next time we went a week later, it was gone. True tho. Gotta drag them out lmao. 1) I'm very good at drawing

2) I am decent at getting people to tell me all kinds of normally private stuff. I think it's a combination of me being very open in return and just coming off as interested and non-judgmental. 

3) Good at getting things I want. Not in like a sneaky weird way, I'm just resourceful. Whether I ask nicely, trade favors, tap into my network, etc. ... I usually figure it out. I can get sporkish but I have ADHD too... Whoops. More clutter. Si is actually very versatile and why I'm so wishful of being an STJ or SFJ. All of them are useful of course. Si is pretty awesome actually. Can be incredibly resourceful, nostalgic, cautious, practice, reserved, etc. 

Ne is... Hit or miss. 

Te and Fe are both very apparently useful. It's a viewing method. There's a way to look at things and be able to replicate, and it can be learned. That + practice is what does it. That isn't even readable. Oops. I shitpost way too often. What if someone wants an omnipotent being in the sky to watch them masturbate? Is there a religion surrounding this..?Time to start one.I get weird feelings around FJ types because of this, I think. My NTP brethren. I notice a lot of us tend to just get along famously. Being around other NTPs is so fun. /sThere will be (8Same, pretty much. I'm finally making a lot more money now that I'm out of school, but my budgeting is abstract, lol. I pay rent, utilities, other payments, stick half of the remainder in savings, and slowly spend the rest. Working on a 401k now though, maxing out that match and I use digit for my emergency fund. :D I was thinking ISFJ as well. Little stronger Si and little less Ne. But that's from the info given. High Ti-types can buy into some weird things. Especially depending on how they're raised. If they've got a worldview that's drastically different due to school or parents or culture, then Ti is really good at finding confirmation bias and clinging onto the evidence they want. You're also less likely to find it happening in NTPs but it's not impossible. To be honest, INTPs and INFPs seem drastically different to me, but I room with an INFP and date an INTP. Part of the trouble is that INTPs are the smart dorks and INFPs are the irrational crybabies, according to stereotypes. 

My roommate is very passionate and will get himself in trouble for doing the right thing. It's just what he does. He's super smart, so don't let stereotyping get in the way of your type. He's just really principled and has this view of how things should be. He cares a lot. 

My boyfriend is INTP and he's a big ball of apathy, honestly. He just... doesn't care. Even in this current US election, he just kind of shrugs and says what happens happens. Unless something is a personal front to him, myself, or his family, he just doesn't want to devote the energy to addressing it. 

Seeing those two next to each other (or watching them converse) makes the differences obvious. The boyfriend argues with his own closed logic system - he uses what makes clear sense to HIM, but he sometimes starts with a faulty premise and it messes him up, lol. He also nitpicks other people's arguments and is always scanning for inconsistencies. 

My roommate argues with his values first, facts to back it up. "This is right because I feel this is best - but here is the data that shows I'm onto something." 

You sound quite INFP to me. I agree, it's a maturity thing. I've spent the last 4-5 years in intensive therapy and it's definitely spurred mental and emotional growth. Everyone has their weaknesses and strengths. ha ha ha ha I thought it said "Do ENTJs like anal?" I think xSTPs would do the best spy work, I think ENTPs might make good agent provocateurs. 

(I just want to be cool) "Who's going to joke about- found the ENTP!"In the front to the side. I have pretty bad ADHD so being in front helps keep me a bit more accountable, but I don't like being so central. 

And I'm the one who's always late and whispering "that's what she said" under my breath. My best lady friend is an INTJ! Podcasts sound do fun, I'll give it a listen. :D My poor INTP boyfriend in a strict Asian TJ/SJ household ;-; Female NT besties :D mines not good on the phone either but tbf neither am I Omg yes! :D I've enjoyed languages a lot, I think that's pretty good for Ne-Ti. Ti tends to take to programming type things well, obv not for everyone. But MBTI rules my entire life and all of my interpersonal relationships!!http://imgur.com/nj53YsK

It me. F/22/ENTP/90% white bred 10% domestic shorthair feline

ISTJs get such a bad rap :( OMG podcast so cool. Are you a female ENTP or a male? Or neither? Idk, people forget ISTJs are perceivers and even though they get a conservative reputation, they still have Ne and still absorb information from the world and can make their own judgments based on sense. aww thank you &lt;33 IVE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT MY FAVE ENTP LOOKS LIKE ESFP! 

Alternate: ENFP, ISFPSame tho. It feels toxic. It makes me feel sick and I tend to wallow. Old places, songs, people... It's hard to let go, and I know I have to move on. If I reminisce too much I become sad and feel nauseous and anxious over opportunities I've missed and ruminate over mistakes I've made. I think introverts can be more reserved and independent, which can be good. I think extroverts can be good at making connections and understanding people. I notice I have a "web" of people and resources that I can always call on in a bind, where my INTP struggles to reach out (if he even wants to). 

Both introverts and extroverts can do these things, but they may be more predisposed to certain skill sets. I love ISTJs now after meeting a few who I've gotten to know. This one in particular... I totally end up acting a ham because I like breaking her down and making her laugh even when she's trying to roll her eyes at me. I have a lady INTJ bestie and she's the same way, haha. 

Yay lady ENTP :D I don't think I've met another irl ;-;PARTY I like the cranky ones :D I can usually get them to at least crack a smile. I work for one ENTP but otherwise it's all ENFP and ESTP. Aw thank you &lt;3 yeah you're my fave person in MBTI Reddit :D Ew Gahhhhh.

"Yeah okay whatever you're right" 
"NO YOU SHIT KEEP ARGUING" 
"Whatever you're right let's agree to disagree" 

*seeeeeeeeethe* 

If I engage, I get too worked up. I end up befriending a lot of ENFP and NT types. I'm sure some of these are mistypings, but I also don't make or keep many friends. :( Lol, *someone* is downvoting every TJ suggestion. I agree tho. Thank god someone gets it. It's just painful and ugly, even if the memories are good. Very sad and longing. Fml. I can only keep moving or I'll get depressed. I know it's not, but I would probably keep the texting app so it feels like I could still talk to him. I think dating and AI would be cool! If it's human like, I could see myself falling in love. Robots ftw. *gets in your face* 

HNNNNNNNNNGOh, I'm sure it is extremely healthy. I'm just pretty sure that's the route I'd end up taking. The physical replication would probably be too much for me. Yeeesh. I think it'd be super cool. I think some people would be weirded out by the nonhuman factor but I could easily see myself having genuine feelings. If I'm interested I can go on and on forever. And Ne is like... "Almost running out of material... BUT WAIT. THERE'S MORE." Otherwise, I can get anxious and be very quiet/standoffish. I'd probably just have to refuse. Or... If the technology is there, I might consider it. I don't know. It'd be an emotional twister, for sure. Good point! I'd probably ideally want a chat program I can just keep on my phone, if I had the money I might even hire an independent developer for it to reduce chances of a malicious hijacking.

My SO is an INTP and we both decided that we would probably do something like that, lol. We also kind of have an open relationship so neither of us would be bothered with the other moving on or being intimate with others. We just both would miss the constant texts and chatting p: technology is going to raise some weird questions. What makes it different? Or can you explain where the repulsion comes from for you? (Not challenging you here, btw, just want insight.) True! I wonder if high Ne or Ni types might be more likely to do either of these things or if there would be a correlation... Or if high Si/Fe types would be less likely. 
Depends, do you mean functionally reversed (ENTP vs ISFJ - Ne-Ti-Fe-Si vs. Si-Fe-Ti-Ne)? Or opposite functions (ENTP vs INTJ - Ne Ti Fe Si vs Ni Te Fi Se) I think they are more stubborn because they are inherently selfish/self-centered. I use those terms as neutrally as possible, but because they're so concerned about themselves and their subjective experiences, they become stubborn about whatever trait that's being focused inward. oh okay :DCan you tell me more about your passion for animals and the environment, and the activism you want to do? Why those subjects? 

Why do you think you don't relate to Fi? Are you more concerned with harmony and compromise, or are you staunch with the things you believe and care about? Everyone has values and beliefs, but typically people prioritize inter- vs intrapersonal relationships. 

Honestly, OCD and anxiety and all of those things (I have them, it sucks bad :c) can interfere, but I almost see more Fe here... Usually people look at "---- rights activist" and go IxFP! because those fields can be Fi-heavy (personal beliefs, going against common thought to realize them, etc.). I see you being more open to people challenging your beliefs, a little apathy regarding that, being drained when talking to others who are convinced they're right, how even if you're upset you'd rather cheer up others, not wanting to inconvenience a driver, etc. 

Using the answers you've given, I'm more likely to see Fe, Si, and Ne... I'm inclined to say ISFJ. However mental illness (especially untreated) throws a wrench in the works. I'm an ENTP female, but at the height of my depression, I tested ISFJ constantly. Si-Fe was really high, because my self-esteem was terrible. My thoughts were "I should just do what I need to do and not draw attention" "My ideas suck" "I'm only good for helping others" "I don't want to inconvenience people because I'm not worth it" "I should put my head down and not stick out". Very unhealthy Si-Fe. 

So take that typing with a grain of salt. Are you seeing anybody or taking anything for your OCD/anxiety? You also have to take positioning into account for Fe. For higher-order users, I would imagine they would ask others what they want to hear, play top-40 stuff, and so one. Lower-order users would either be apathetic to the wants of others, or even take pleasure in the dissonance and discomfort (your ENTPs, INTPs, etc). 

Fe is often concerned with harmony and depending on type and maturity it can play out very differently. I can describe how it looks to me. Typically, I use my Fe-powers for good (Ne-Fe is great for solving conflict - seeing perspectives of others, helping "translate" problems into a language another can understand to reach compromise). But this is an active and learned sort of use. 

Natural Fe use (for me) feels disingenuous. Unconsciously, I struggle to be genuine and I tend to change the way I speak and dress to fit in with a certain group or communicate a certain way, if that makes sense. It's more self-preserving and sometimes even manipulative, or so I've found. To each their own experience, anyway. Yeah, you could also look at it as if Ne is writing a bunch of stuff, and Ti is popping all of the bubbles and narrowing it down and deciding what works and what doesn't within the context. :D Depending on the question, I've dated an INTJ and it didn't work out so hot, although that's more on him than me. I could see it working. I don't think I'd enjoy being with an ISFJ, at least not where I am now. Higher-order Fe users tend to bother me p: 

Dating an INTP... It's a nice romantic pseudo-intellectual circlejerk &lt;3 "And, I'm really nervous about being so honest. I go out of my way to be really pleasant and agreeable" FOUND THE FE USER

But actually, it's hard to discern with anxiety. However, your post screams Fe to me, really hard. I'm about to think out loud on the computer btw so it's about to get messy. You enjoy working with your hands, you don't know what in life, so you stick to a conventional "fallback" path until you figure something out, something reliable and steady. You struggle to live in the moment, but you do find something soothing about maintaining your environment and performing common chores and tasks, and appear to find comfort in the regular. 

You appear steadfast and knowledgable, sensitive, caring, concerned for others in a motherly and maybe a bit over-protective/bossy way (which is annoying but also endearing to me, lol), you're worried about what people think of you, and what you're "supposed" to do. You take care of your shit and get it done, a strong sense of dutifulness and you don't skimp on your responsibilities... 

So, one thing I'm very certain of is that you're an Fe user. Anxiety can take on a very "Fe" format ("What are people thinking of me?") but even beyond that, you appear to still take pleasure in making your friends happy and want external approval. 

Fe-users in the higher order are ENFJ, INFJ, ESFJ, and ISFJ. So you aren't far off. However... I'm seeing more in your post Si. While you do appear to be considerate of your future, my interpretation is that you've got this idea of what you're supposed to be doing and you're steadfast in maintaining that pathway, you're obliging and dutiful, and consistent and reliable. 

I really think you're an ISFJ. Depending on your degree of introversion, maybe an ESFJ. However, IxFJs are some of the most traditionally socially extroverted, because their second function is Fe, which is a very interpersonal function. So it's very possible for you to be an anxious, traditional extrovert or an introvert who still enjoys their time with people. I don't understand personally your degree of anxiety and how much it might hide or exacerbate parts of your personality, so yeah. 

My vote, in order, is ISFJ, ESFJ, then INFJ. 

but i love you 
please Bandcamp? Ugh. You're way too mainstream. If you didn't see them handing out mixtapes at a festival they weren't performing at, on a burner CD marked only with a sharpie label, then it's not unique. You conformist pig. I really don't think the dichotomy works for that reason. p: ISFJ and INFJ are quite similar, but people seem to have this idea that N means "Oh, INFJs are so much smarter/deeper/more unique", when really it's just... sort of orientation and tangibility. ISFJ's are perfectly capable of being intelligent and enjoying hypotheticals. After all, they do have Ne in their stack - it's just prioritized lower. I'd say those functions are "priority" over "ability". Ne is a master of hypotheticals, ideas, brainstorming and "what-if". 

I only say Si for the reasons I listed above - I don't see a lot of Ni, but obviously this is just one post. You very well could be an INFJ, I'm just offering my own perspective. one of ussssss one of usssssssOh, LOL! I totally wondered why you were saying your Fi is so strong. Hahahaha. Being a sensor definitely isn't a bad thing. ISFJs can definitely play with Ne when they want to, it's just lower on their to-do list. Work before play, if that makes sense. I'm the opposite, I lead with intuition and end with introverted sensing, so I play first and don't get anything done that needs to be, haha. 

The functions help with that sense of nuance, and it doesn't help that most SJ descriptions sound like "lol dumb and boring sensors they just do what they're told". Realistically, ISTJ and ISFJ get such a bad rap but if you think about it, they (and other sensors) make the world go 'round. Some of the most sensible, practical, intelligent, responsible, "get it done", warm and diplomatic people you'll meet will be ISFJs. Also, it might help to look at the difference between Ni and Ne. Everybody has and used intuition, so if you can determine what kind and how strong, that can help cement your typing! I don't understand Ni as well, but my life is run by Ne - making connections between seemingly unrelated items, jumping from idea to idea, trying on new theories and perspectives, hypotheticals that can get a little absurd, and being very concerned with opportunities and doors to be opened. Most of them don't get along with me as much, although I have a couple in my life who do. The one friend I mentioned enjoys my absurdity and creativity at the right times - key point being the right time. Otherwise, I get irritating quickly. 

I feel the same way about Si-Te. I have ADHD on top of being an Ne-Dom so I struggle with doing day to day tasks, being efficient in literally anything, being responsible, organized, effective... Rip me. That's interesting, I'm almost certain about ISFJ/ESFJ. I don't see much in the way of Ni, but I could be unfamiliar enough to miss it. While OP seems to plan for her future, it seems less visionary and more her following a conventional, safe path to take her to a future she's not certain about and can't seem to visualize. But that's just my interpretation of her words. I think labeling the functions provides a solid, consistent language that can be used to identify potential problems and work through them productively, tbh. 

I used to think I loved INTJ and ENTJ and ENFP types the most, but I'm finding that it's actually STJ I like most (aside from my INTP boyfriend of course). I think it's Si. Something so concrete, and goddamn sensible that I can't seem to replicate myself. It's utterly fascinating and enthralling. And then they act all weirded out that I think they're so interesting, lol. Any input is valuable input! Sometimes a misunderstanding can lead to more insight. I think my apprehension towards higher Fe is like... I've definitely used Fe in deceptive or manipulative ways before, even if I don't intend it maliciously. So when I see an xFJ, I think I get suspicious based on my own utility, even though I'm just projecting. p:

You should see my INTP boyfriend saying how objective his logic is, it would infuriate you. LOL. Also let me love you Fair enough. I did see a comment earlier somewhere about Si + Tisometimes appearing Te-ish in getting things done and holding it up to a standard, etc. I don't actively see too much of either, but it could follow that if OP has lower-order Ti, we wouldn't see too much evident and Te being misattributed is possible. 

But that's my Ti going, lol. I came up with a conclusion and now I'm interpreting given data to fit the set. p;That's interesting! So it's more complementary for y'all? 

Sometimes I feel like it can be overbearing and I'm like "oh my god chill out, we don't have to do this now". But weirdly enough I'm super attracted to really sensible, responsible people. I find whimsy and blatant eccentricity kind of boring. Some ISTJs are just downright presidential, whew~! Hahaha. I think it's just like, seeing the fully fledged Si vs. my own baby Si is impressive and makes me want to do better, too. 

(Any Si/Te user would be appalled at the bills I leave unpaid, the mess in my house, etc. so it seems the attraction usually is one-way... :D(Oh lord, my room is AWFUL. I gave up and decided to hire a maid, lol. I literally cannot function like a proper adult ;-; I'm learning though. Ne... Too... Stronk... Needs moar Si. 

I think it's important to have that kind of room for growth and development, you know? (I say as I date my introverted counterpart, lol.) you and your istj sound so cute :D then again, my boyfriend is in a strict Asian family and they're all SFJ/STJ save for like, one. It's possible he developed his Si sooner, he's much more responsible and calmer than I am, lol. I'm not a dude, dude! I'm the ISTJ...

Don't worry, I just like to be an Internet creep~ hmm, which thread? Time to go hunting!  FOUND IT LOL creepy face and everything ISxJ types get shafted so hard. :( when they're really the coolest. Hahaha, I think ISTJs grated on me more when I was younger! Even now there's an ISTJ at work whos older and scoffs at me every time I can't figure out how to work the mail (I never sent certified letters, how should I know!). But I think she secretly likes when I come ask her for help and act like she's got some kind of postal witchcraft going on. She's kind of cranky but she's super organized and totally hooked me up on my recent business trip, lol. I think ENTPs would be a great candidate for mimicry and shape shifting!I do it a lot. I think it's a way for me to self-contain since I'm loud and laugh at bad moments. I like it when penpals force themselves on me (8Haha, you sound super SFJ. :D whatever works! SameSame! Dating an INTP &lt;3What aren't you supposed to stereotypically hate?My boyfriend, roommate, and a couple irl friends I met from here so... Nah. Omg. Want to chat about character creation? I've been writing with my boyfriend and we use MBTI to help keep them consistent during development. :D Dad is ENTJ, mom is ESFP, stepmom is ESTP, stepdad is istp! And my brother is also ENTP. I wear sandals daily. Or light up sneakers. Goddamn. I don't do full length novels, haha! It's mostly back and forth roleplaying, and writing vignettes and such. It varies, sometimes I have an appearance, sometimes a role first. My most recent is an ISTJ woman who was initially hired as an accountant but ends up basically a personal assistant to a complete psychopath. :D 

Started with a job, kind of a "I bet this guy has an assistant and she probably hates her life. She'd have to get paid a ton to work for him" thing. Then it evolved into her appearance, personality, hobbies, and kind of a central conflict (in her case, she's extremely anxious and her job makes her moreso, and it's a workplace that encourages a lot of unconventional brilliance so she feels especially insecure there). 

Between my boyfriend and I, we have an ISTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ESTP, ESFJ, ENTP, and ESFP. :D ENTP. We're kind of weird, and there's about a 50% chance it's in a good way. Yall dont even give a fuck. My INTP just gives 0% shits about what anyone really thinks. Weird clothes, making giant straw-machines in a nice restaurant, etc. Nope. Gonna do it. It's super cute, if not a bit embarrassing sometimes. Still, he's very endearing in this childlike, authentic way. No social pretenses, he just wants to do things. 

Basically us: "babe, stop" "but why" "this is a nice place, take the straws home for later" "but why" "because it's not okay" "but why" "it's a weird social thing, just trust me" "...fine". So all things in moderation. I find inferior Fe so endearingly apathetic so social mores that it's kind cool in its own way. p; Interestingly, IxxJ types are actually perceiving types. 

You sound very, very Si dominant. I would look at ISTJ and ISFJ. Don't mistake feeling for irrational/illogical/etc. Every type has a thinking function. I usually use the 25quiz.com because it's SUPER quick and gives them 5 types (and usually their type is somewhere in there). I'm in the corporate world so I play it as "Oh yeah, at work we all took it, did you ever..?" and usually people bite, although they don't usually get really into it. 

My boyfriend, roommate, and some of my closer IRL friends I all met from MBTI reddit, so I have enough of them to spam with function business. All of it. Types aren't uniform, so it can manifest in many ways. For me, I usually voice very outlandish shit. My mind works quickly and I jump from subject to subject. My friend could be talking about buying a playstation and I'd be jumping to astronauts having freaky VR porn for their long flights to Mars. I just wouldn't voice any of those transitions so it would appear more random than it is. E D G Y 

D 

G 

YNot necessarily. A) Not all behaviors fall under a type/function so singularly. Se (extraverted sensing) would be typically considered the most observant/concrete function, and with it not being in your stack, it may be that being observant is just not your biggest priority. 

Besides, jet fuel can't melt steel beams. Neither. That's just how conversations work with me. I usually run three steps ahead/sideways and appear to be off-topic. I don't like talking to people as a whole, though. I would love a test that put people in "what would you do/think" situations and people pick the closest answer and it corresponds to a number of functions, then at the end, it ranks the functions in order and gives your top 3 most likely types based on that. I'm so flattered @.@ one time I was playing Pokemon go and there was a gym at a museum where there were steel beams from the WTC and you can bet your ass I quickly became the leader of Steel Beams Gym. 

But I digress. 

The tests are terrible, my strategy is usually to have someone take Johns test/25quiz.com since it gives 5 answers and your type is likely in there somewhere. That helps narrow it, especially if you look for common functions within those 5. Otherwise, it's a lot of investigation, which I personally enjoy. 

I'm the least observant person ever though, but Ne overload tends to do that. Jelly of dat Si. I always have thought it'd at least be more effective without the two-answers kind of thing. "Would you help a child if they were crying?" Has so many reasons. "No, because..." "Yes, because..". I feel like that could give insight into the motivations behind the yes and no, but you run into the issue of too many or not enough options there. Or even run them through some kind of story or narrative where they give opinions on people/situations and justify their behaviors. 

What kind of test would you propose to gauge those things? It would mostly have to be understandable, easy to take without predicting results, and engaging enough to keep the taker interested throughout. I'm always interested to hear better ideas than my own. p: I can see kind of Fe-heavy types divulging too much in an effort to connect and get to know somebody else, then walking away like "shit". INFJs especially like to talk about how private they are, then the next second they're like "Yeah my parents divorced and I tried to kill myself last year". 

I think xxTJ types would be the least likely to divulge, mostly because they don't see the topics as very relevant and don't feel like taking the asker off-track from whatever they were engaging over. Also, the INTPs I know are very, very reserved about what they let others into, whereas I use information like trading cards when I search others out. Those would be pretty good. I wonder if certain types might struggle more with those question. I've seen people taking tests (John's test phrases things similarly) and ask "What does it mean? Is there an example?", haha. 

The way I always explain it (especially to people who dichotomize certain attributes), it's value like you said, and priority. Everyone senses and intuits, everyone thinks and feels, but we tend to prioritize things. It's less a question of ability and more one of preference. 

So basically what you're saying, or at least in that vein. I think that's why we get so many mistyped sensors and feelers. "I'm a rational person too!" "I'm not dumb." "I can be intuitive, sometimes." NT just sounds better on type descriptions, haha. Yeh, INFJs seem to have that switch. I think out of the NT types, ENTPs are definitely the most prone to oversharing. Less filtering, and Ne sees things as relevant. Hmm... "in touch with feelings" would only happen at a certain level of maturity. For me and a number of ENTPs I've talked to, we can appear almost sociopathic (or maybe just narcissistic) many times, and tend to ignore or repress our feelings, and when they come, they come in ugly, unstable outbursts. 

Upon maturation, I'd agree that an ENTP would be more expressive than an INTJ. But that's if we're ranking by emotional expression and not just "F" traits. If passion and zeal are included, I'd rank INTJ slightly above. Damn good list. Props. I'm basically a shitposting dumpster fire. :DSame :C If I muster up the energy I can do some fierce debating and intellectualizing, but my brain doesn't work well cause of illness anyway so I'd rather just meme. There was no shortage of memes that stemmed from that. (8 Based on your answering of the other question asked in this thread, are you leaning to any particular type? :D Ti-Si is pretty ugly when it shows up in my INTP. Then again, he's clinically depressed. But he just... loses all drive to be creative or come up with new ideas. When something comes up, he's really pessimistic. 

"It's not going to be good, I've seen it before" "This will go terribly" "This is how it always is, no point in trying". His Ne just kind of goes on holiday and he's left ruminating in the past and surrendering to negativity. Whereas normally, it would be more "Let me Google and see if anyone else had some ideas" or "I can figure it out, it'll be fine." He's never been super optimistic, but the proper functioning of Ne really helps him climb out of those holes. 

Can't help with Ti-Ni, sorry. xNTP. Leaning to INTP, but it could go either way. 

ETA: ISFJ is a distinct possibility. It can work if you both want it to. Just talk and communicate, really. MBTI isn't a compatibility test. Our environments, experiences, relationships, and idiosyncracies create unique people. 

Think of MBTI more as the information you value and the things you prioritize. Everything can think and feel, so use MBTI to understand your partner and the things they value. Use it as a guide to learn to interact and watch out for potential pitfalls. 

Example: INTJs have tertiary Fi... They may struggle with expressing feelings, and someone unaware of this might accuse them of being cold, heartless, unfeeling, etc. Whereas you are aware that they DO have feelings, they just prioritize them lower and might have a harder time, so you can be patient and understanding to encourage positive communication. MBTI gives us labels to put on certain processes, and this would be a good way to use it. Interesting. ISTJ is a strong possibility. The order of the functions is Si-Te-Fi-Ne vs. Si-Fe-Ti-Ne, so the feeling and thinking bits only swap one place. One thing to note with Fe is that it's concerned with other people. While it does relate to emotional expression, it's also concerned with: harmony, stability (your emotional environment), diplomacy, social mores and traditions, sensitivity towards others (not just from others). This is why the other commenter asked about if you'd be more alert to another's insensitivity. I think a follow-up question to that would be: Why would you be more concerned about someone being insensitive to another? Is it more because it's counterproductive and upsetting another person reduces efficiency, or because you don't want the other person hurt and care that the others around you are in harmony? 

Te is concerned with external information, so it's about facts, efficiency, accuracy, etc. Fi is more about personal values and beliefs and the framework these fall into. I'm not on the Te-Fi axis, so I'm sure you could find better firsthand accounts. 

http://personalityjunkie.com/04/ti-fe-fi-te-function-pairs-type-biases/on you fam The only thing I feel fairly sure of is that you're on the Fi-Te axis, most likely in that order. I went ahead and looked at your comments; comment history is rather telling, since you aren't really answering with your type in mind. 

Deeeeefinitely Fi. Moral absolutes, disliking people who only bank on facts and information? Yop. 

So, I'm getting high-Fi feelings. This leaves us with four types: INFP, ISFP, ENFP, ESFP. MORE QUESTIONS. Do you consider yourself introverted or extroverted? How detail-oriented or alert are you to your surroundings? How often do you "dip into" your past for solutions? Do you wallow in nostalgia ever? Are you the kind of person to make assumptions and rely on your gut? Also, how do you make decisions? Like... do you try to act quickly and decisively, or do you get paralyzed by options at times? Well, INFP by definition. If you look at the shadow functions, Te becomes 6th in the stack for INTPs, and 4th for INFPs. Ti and Te are quite different, they pull into and from opposite directions. 

Te will usually strive for accuracy and being correct, in accordance with the outside world and the facts that we know to be true. It's objective information. Ti is subjective logic by definition - it strives for precision and isn't always true by way of the outside world. It just needs to make sense for the use, which can lead to some serious misconceptions at times. (Also, I'm pretty sure this pic is ENTP/INTJ friendship in a nutshell.)Okie dokie. So, I'm leaning towards ESFP more than ENFP, although both are possible. Conveniently, Heidi Priebe posted a nice article just this afternoon, so I'll link this to you: 

http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2016/10/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-an-enfp-and-an-esfp/

Do you feel you relate to either of those more? Wowza, I like this description. Okay, give me a few minutes. I'm lazy and don't want to work so I'll do it. p:*guilt about messy room intensifies* Of course the ENTPs all glom onto this. FP would be what you're looking for. Either way, good call. Note: I removed a few of these. The author is one of these and it tends to bleed out into her writing. You can check the rest out at the link. 

**Type As:**

-want to analyze their feelings and the feelings of others in depth. 

-get to know new people by swapping stories about each others pasts and coming to understand which experiences have led that person to where they are today.

No problem! There's definitely gender differences as well - ENTP females, for example (such as myself) might develop their Fe a bit earlier, as women are more commonly socialized to be more accommodating and less combative. They might seem less "troll-y" than the typical ENTP. 

And male F-types might seem more cool, rational, or detached than their female counterparts, as emotional displays are discouraged in men and the NT/ST stereotypes encouraged. Like I said, Fe-Ti are only one place shifted, so those two can vary in development and expression. Always happy to help! I'm going by common Jungian function descriptions. I wouldn't know about socionics. Do you have a link for me? I only answered in the most basic/literal of ways, so I'd be interested. I dig it. My friends and boyfriend and I went as a deer, cat, fox and penguin, all with party hats to complete the pun. Did anyone say anything about yours?:( we're party animals! Cause she's a deer and I'm a cat, and we have cute party hats. Her antlers and hat she made herself with a headband, it was actually really neat. What if I remove them?I liked it too. It could easily devolve, but I'd want to try. Hmm, that makes sense. Thank you! When I describe functions it's usually a loose generalization, not so much hard and fast rules. I rarely speak in absolutes anyhow. I appreciate it!Hahaha I need to do something scary but I enjoy being raunchy. Gotta combine the two. ;D 

Haha thanks! I thought her deer antlers were superb and I always like foxes. My boyfriends penguin makeup was on point as well. Ne game too stronk. I always forget people can't see in my head and just kind of throw stuff out, lol. B is ENFP, so take it as you will! I agree, I just don't have enough judgment to say for certain. h-hotAt least when you get trashed the lampshade is already on. Bah-dum-tssssss~Hahaha omg. I didn't even think of that. HEY SAME &lt;3I love it LOLI love the dress!Well, you do now. (8 cervidaephilia?Why not both? Eat it all quickly! :D read scary stories. You're super cute tho @.@ new crush. 

And that's basically us. She acts all unamused and grumpy but she loves me muchly deep down. I just like to annoy her and make her laugh. We've been best friends for 14 years now~ :DM-May I please have your insides~? My fetish~HottieIt works on me (8Same! Hence the vignettes- I don't have to write large stories, Ivan just work on characters within the same universe. :D what kind of characters do you have?Qt lookin goodObsessed with this game and I agree with most of your assessment. Especially Rika, Zen, Yoosung, and 707. Btw 707 is my spirit animal. I think Jaehee is an ISTJ, though. V potentially an ISFJ, but I'm less sure on this one. LOL it's so true tho. I think you're interesting! An INTP would of course. Story of our life. 

"LETS DO" 
"Bad idea." 
"WELL IM GONNA DO IT" 
"I'll make sure you don't die. *sigh*" LOL that's pretty funnyI'm impressed at the level of effort that went into it. INTP, typically. When I was particularly depressed, ISFJ. There's a lot of nuances when it comes to gender issues. I'd say I align with feminism quite a bit, although I rarely identify with the label. I'm strongly in support of rights for transgender people and sex workers, and these groups tend to get shit on by a large sect of feminists. To me, "I'm a feminist" gives me little information on what beliefs they hold, so the label's become useless. 

I do think sexism and racism are problems. I'm from the American south, and I feel it quite a bit. Everything from street harassment to attitudes toward sexual assault I hear often. Hell, I'm a particularly "masculine" woman in attitude, and it's rare that it benefits me, since asserting oneself usually leads to me being called a bitch anyway. Shruuuuuuug. Agreed. I think the fact that people need to label what type of feminist they are or assure people "not an extremist!" kind of dilutes the message and point of a political label. You totally misunderstood OP's question and didn't bother looking at any alternatives reasons. 

The perspectives offered by people who conform less to their gender roles could be valuable. Not because "feminine women are less important!", but because NT/ST women have different experiences and can experience sexism in a different way than NF/SF women. The same goes for men. NF/SF men have a unique experience where although they're men, they embody some more typically feminine traits and experience lashback for it. 

(Most INFP response I've ever seen lmao) That's... quite the generalization. And it's really a less productive route to take. Using your example, if women are being harassed and bullied out of STEM, there should still be a change. Even if these women stay in the STEM field, the same attitudes that prompt harassment are the same attitudes that will take their contributions less seriously. 

Women have important contributions to make, and although change is uncomfortable and difficult, men who harass should be called out and face consequences. Some women can certainly make it, but I see no reason why women should just take that kind of discrimination when men could just as easily change their own attitudes. STEM and other male-dominated arenas suffer when they push out half of the population. Pretty much. Even if the majority of us fall into the typical sex-assigned social roles, what about those who don't? I don't know the stats on it, but even if it's only 5% of people, that's still 1 in 20. 

It's not like anybody's asking all of the men to act X and women to act Y. I'd just love the social freedom to act and express myself how I please. Society is very strict on what it deems acceptable, and loosening those reins would be very beneficial to progress. E-N-T-P... what does that spell?! INHERENT BIAS DUE TO MY OWN TYPING but you do sound rather entp. I'll let the non-ENTPs take it from here. Introverted functions appear to be inherently subjective and self-centered as a whole. I think Fi and Ni deal with less tangible/more subjective (although that's debatable) aspects of personality, so there's a sense of one being correct, special, unique and so on. 

Si typically uses the past as a reference and so it's already less likely to believe itself special, as its reference points have already occurred, if that makes sense. Ti can be stubborn and misguided as hell, but Ti users still need to justify themselves and seem to invite others into their fold so they can understand. These two functions seem less "I am unique" and more "I am correct". 

This is totally my own ideas on the subject, btw. Nothing here that can really be backed up, simply my own observations. We get a looooot of INFJs at the ENTP sub who post topics and kind of seem to want a cookie for being INFJ or expect us to fall at their feet. It's weird and kind of unflattering. I feel inclined to agree at first, but I don't think it's right to shame others. The overwhelming power of shame is one that's naturally meant to force others to fall in line. Some have the fortitude to overcome and do their thing anyway, and others don't. 

I just don't see why we shouldn't attempt to curb some of the unnecessary shaming as well. People who can't endure it still have unique perspectives to offer, and I'd rather hear them or see them expressed. Everybody has their right to their opinion and nobody can stop them from shaming others... but just because you can doesn't mean you should, even if you disagree. Si doms are great, haha. Need moar Si in my life. Yeah, I just think that they are comparing things to what's already occurred in the past and in their own experiences, so that automatically makes it not unique. 

Ti can get SUPER condescending though, to be fair. Between my own Ti and my INTP's, some of those debates get ridiculous far and fast. I personally don't understand Ni well as a function, I can only identify it as an absence of Ne. p: 

Hahaha oh boi. I'm sure the ENTJs take to that well. The ENTPs at least get a little curious as to what each INFJ thinks they have to offer, so I'm sure that helps. The problem with this is that S isn't just structure and practicality. It's more... orientation, if that makes sense. This is also why the traditional dichotomy doesn't really work. Ne tends to orient itself towards the future, while Se tends to orient itself to the present. Decisiveness and impulsiveness are more strongly associated with the latter. 

From what I gather, you seem more ESFP. There's a lot of heavy bias against sensing types, so don't take this as me saying "oh, you're less capable of deep thoughts" and such. Both are capable of deep conversation, making connections, being intelligent, and so on. It's really more about what you concern yourself with. Only you can really know what you identify with, though. You'd be surprised, haha. Especially if others type you, it can get confusing. I've always been pretty certain of the Ti-Fe axis, but I've had people swear I use Fi. I've also been typed as an ESTJ, hahaha. Although that opinion dissipated over video chat within about five minutes. This is true. I don't know about ISTPs, the few I know tend to share openly but nothing too private. The INTPs I know... zip. :D The clown thing fascinates me. Same with the ebola scares (especially since I live in one of the ebola cities). It's kinda scary, but the fear kind of excites me in a way. I want to see how things like this all turn out. It's my raison d'etre. Better than I could've explained it. 

I will add that my ENFP friend and I directly contrasted our processing. Mine tends to be "I have this information. How does this work? What does it make me think? Does this change how it works?" where she tends to think "I have this information. How does this make me feel? Is it consistent with the rest of my beliefs? Am I comfortable with this?" 

We both have an internal framework, but hers aligns with who she feels she is as a person, where mine sort of determines how things appear to work to me. That makes sense. I think the best place to start would be with media and education. While some will always be more naturally sensitive (as it tends to work with variance in personalities), building confidence from an earlier age and from more "authoritative" sources could help keep others from buckling under pressure from peers. 

When I say authoritative, I don't mean that we should force people to accept certain things, but that those with more authority and influence should have an obligation to keep spaces open for learning, questioning and growth. It's hard to grow confidence when many times social pressures begin from very early ages. Hehe, I tend to view information as a currency. I don't like to share unless it's something that's been really weighing on me, or I want something from somebody else. I want to have people share with me so I can get as much info as possible, and if that means sacrificing some privacy, so be it. Hahaha I can* oops. Gotta love phones. 

Omg I want to hear more about yours! I think character-building is easily one of my strongest suits. Can I PM you? I'm actually interested in this but I don't like to share a lot of writing-related things on public forums. I think your comment about gender roles and evolution and such (I think that was you) also irked others. Evolutionary justifications can devolve very quickly into a redpill jumping-off point, which is why I've never been a fan. Not really. I'm rather quiet, I only get excitable when I'm with close friends and I'm on a subject I enjoy. If anything, Fe helps me know when to hold back, instead of blurting everything out. It's just as Professor Oak said, "There's a time and a place for everything." 

I am extroverted, but socially not so much. I do have an illness that makes me extra fatigued, so a lot of my energy gets diverted back internally. That could also throw a wrench into it, haha. Yep, I'd say that's pretty true. We are definitely a bit smoother, haha. Functionally extroverted, I'd say very. Just not in the traditional social sense! My focus is external, but my info comes from the Internet, from watching others and listening, and from just... Whatever's around, and sometimes things that aren't. Social barriers are definitely a thing. Harassment, discrimination and pressure discourage women from early ages and steer them towards more typically feminine careers/interests. This also happens to men who also gravitate towards those same things. 

The laws aren't what are strict here, if I may clarify. Under the law, you may be whatever it is you'd like. By society, I'm talking about social pressures and mores, which I think move slowly and are counterproductive to overall progress. Yes, we know this. Statistically, more women are feelers. Women also dominate certain fields, whereas men dominate others. How does this contradict what I've said? Social pressures can affect both genders and neither should be herded towards certain hobbies and career paths because they were born a man or woman. I'm not arguing for the majority, here. 

A lot of the examples you use are also examples of what's been called "benevolent" sexism. Women are told "be careful!" because we're viewed as more fragile, weaker, softer, etc. The one girl in STEM is getting all of this praise not for her intellect, but because she's a girl. However, chances are that she'll be graded and judged more harshly when it comes to her academics. Men are also pushed harder, told to suck it up, are shit on for having and expressing feelings, discouraged from psychiatric treatment, and so on. 

Some of this is physical, some of it is social. Women ARE genetically weaker, so we're just not going to be doing as many combat military positions, as many physical labor jobs, etc. Most of us WILL take on "feeler" jobs, because most of us are feelers, to use your measures.  
I'm not arguing that that's wrong or incorrect.  

I'm arguing for the sake of the minority % of men and women who will be the odd eggs in their chosen fields, who will face pressure and discrimination due to their gender. Men who want to be teachers and have to be vigilant due to sex crime accusations, or who want to be nurses and get shit on because it's a woman's job, or who want to do hair and are assumed to be gay. Women who want to be in engineering and academia, but are discriminated against and sexually harassed until they decide it's just not worth it. All of these prevent people from reaching their full potential and moving our society forward, imo. Let's slowly jerk each other (8 I'm voting you back up because we are perfection thank you for your acknowledgment. Well, this is all just an assumption on your end and an optimistic view of what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated field. While I'm sure all women wish they were merely being praised for being a woman in STEM fields... The odds say that's probably not the case. Just a couple of links:

http://www.aauw.org/research/why-so-few/

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172

Granted, statistics can be manipulated to get any message across, but you see my point. 

Those do apply to men as well. Like I said, gender bias doesn't only harm women's progress, I used STEM because that's was the example the commenter pulled~ the same mindset also hurts the way men live their lives as well. I've actually worked in professional kitchens for a few years. Good place, mostly decent guys, and I'm rather aggressive so I stuck my time out there despite a lot of harassment and occasional gropings. It sucks, though, and I could easily see somebody getting discouraged when it's just so pervasive and no one gives a shit because you're the only woman there. 

Girls are more likely to experience this stuff in spaces with disproportionate genders. I also don't know a lot of women who get upset with posters and drawings. Maybe in a corporate job, I don't know, but I don't speak about micro aggressions at the moment. 

Intimidation, harassment, and stereotyping all contribute to discrimination against women and men, depending on their line of work. I just don't think that's okay, but many people have the "if you can't take the heat" mentality.Yeh, I know I looooooove attributing everything to xNTP, but she mostly seems to take pleasure in doing things because she can, making witty and clever remarks, I don't know. She doesn't seem to have a vision she wants to fulfill or to do anything in particular... just run experiments, follow her programming, and be a world-class snarker. She's kind of silly and cute in a demented way. Not social anxiety, but I have a couple of anxiety-spectrum problems. There's some serious WELCOME TO HELL type of Ne where I can see every single way it could go wrong no matter how farfetiched. :( Really? Most INTPs I've met have been depressed or anxious, and I myself have both. I think just as often as Ne can see the good things, it can also spot all of the bad and turn into a personal hell of every imaginative nightmare possible. But again, it's my own experience. Find me an INTP, an ISTJ, and an ENTJ and we're good to go. I need a philosopher, someone practical to shoot my ideas down, and a person who can lead. I'm getting some STJ vibes yoGood at scavenging and finding things, jury-rigging items like weapons or shelter, basic medical care, and so on. Depends on how long we're there, what the goal is, etc. ;) you got it, but if I call him a philosopher he'll happily tag along. 

Plus, intps have so many thoughts that I get a lot of ideas from them. I don't need no INFPs, shoo. Don't wanna fight me irl I'm tough 

jk dont hurt me. (8 Whole alpha quadra? Oh boi tru. when you back in TX homieYooooo I love witches. Slutty witch is my default tbh. Any excuse for thigh highs and a floppy hat. Let's shop LOL HARRI I DIDNT REALIZE IT UI got a job homie I'm $$$$$$$$

Jk but let's do it I need more stuff anywayKk got u fam. 

I almost bankrupted myself with ACL and Kiss fm jingle ball tickets. Real talkFriday! Had a race on Saturday, hence why I bought the other tickets cause I can't miss the Chainsmokers Meh it was okay, got 4th. Hehehe get on my level u scrubWhat makes you think you're either of those? Out of curiosity. I have a serious resting bitch face. I start off unapproachable but I'm quite easygoing. You appear to be using the dichotomy type of reasoning... Have you looked up cognitive functions? If I had to pick between the two, I'd say ISFJ, but cognitive functions are a more precise way to determine your type. Just for your info. You do sound rather ISFJ tho Heh. Start looking for some of these articles! Maybe do the questionnaire that /u/peppermint-kiss has. You might not be either of those options. Or you might! Lol, did this actually bother you enough to say something? Are you the one who posted the hi topic?I don't see any fault with what I said here. We often get INFJs specifically seeking out ENTP attention. It's a thing. Nothing about that was untrue. Best friend does. To be fair, she enjoys her workplace much more, but she struggled with harassment from her peers in university and considered swapping majors, and has even had some issues as a TA. Field research has been fine, though. 

Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it hasn't happened. Workplace sexual harassment happens more often to women, and between heterosexual pairs. Higher rates occur when there are a large majority of men. I would be curious, though, to see if there are studies on men in minority fields. I think there might be more institutional blockage (no scholarships for men teaching/rules in place to not leave them alone with pupils)Small talk has a purpose. I don't want deep conversations with everyone I meet. My brain hurts after a while, lol. But it helps discern whether I may like the person, whether we share common interests, etc. I agree with this. I have a lot of LGBTQ+ friends and I see "if you don't vote Hillary you hate us!" but I'm in that segment and I don't see Trump doing as much damage. Hillary's camp rigged the primary as well as one can, won't ever see repercussions... To me, it's just confirming she can do whatever she wants and has enough political influence to keep herself free from consequence. I don't want her as President. 

I would have much rather seen Bernie Sanders vs. Rand Paul. That would be a really good, intelligent match-up. RIP. I'll probably vote Jill Stein. If Texas is that much of a battleground, I may actually vote Trump. I say "I feel" a lot, because it's less combative and more diplomatic. People react with less hostility and outrage when I start this way. 


"I'm not certain"

"a grain of salt"

"It's possible"

"Potentially"

"I could be wrong"

"On the other hand"

"I could see"

"Could there be" 

"May" 

"As far as I know"

"If I recall correctly" 

"Maybe" 

"Then again"

I speak in very, very uncertain terms and I rarely state anything absolutely. I don't believe in certainty. (There's one!) But then again, I could be wrong on that, since there may be hard and fast rules to the universe and we just have no way to prove them without a doubt. Not that I know of, anyway. 

People seem to think my hesitations to assert my beliefs is insecurity, but I find it's more diplomatic and open, and I'm always prepared to be wrong. Thinking on it, I believe a lot of problems feminism and egalitarianism are social and behavioral issues, and not so much legal/institutional. Maybe with exceptions to abortion and some medical laws. It's hard to prove social barriers exist, because you and I and my best friend could all have varying experiences (I've worked in male-dominated fields, just not stem) and they could all be true. 

The solution to problems like this aren't more laws, censorship, etc. I'm not sure what is. I do believe there are still problems with the ways gender affects a person's mobility and choices in society. Aside from self-reported studies, I can't really prove it. Yeah, and I feel disingenuous asserting much of anything. It's easy to change my mind, or to at least consider it. I usually go back to online debates and add onto what I've said earlier. I'm gonna bake some PIE. I used to be a pastry chef and can make some beautiful designs. Same with cake and cupcakes. :D I love playing hostess once in a blue moon! (Then I curl up in a ball and call a maid afterward). 

I love holidays though. The lights, the general cheer, the chill, oh gosh. I like giving presents too, I'm making a scrapbook for my boyfriend and drawing a lot of pictures. I sound so ESFJ right now. I've looked at him and Kaine as well. I'm the most annoying!Top three types I'm getting from this: 

ISTP
INTP
ISTJLeaning towards ISTJ. 

Good on you for actively trying to think better of people. Hahaha you should see one of my Halloween pics here with my INTJ bestie. It's pretty much the story of all of those relationships. Annoying af but we're somehow still loveable. 

To be fair I'm not as bad as I used to be. It's just what we do man idk. It's also a maturity thing. It's also... kind of a weird affection thing, if he's friendly to you otherwise. I used to bother people constantly if I thought they were interesting. Then I learned people don't like it. p: That... Doesn't sound very ENTP at all. Huh. Lmao that's kind of awful/unbearable. I'm just regular annoying. Aw well thanks :D My brother is also an ENTP. Hehe. I think I'd just get annoyed. I don't tend to get along with ISFJs as famously. I prefer ISTJs, ISTPs, INTPs and INTJs. I get way too lovey and touchy. Wayyyyyyy too friendly. And I laugh a lot at everything and get sleepy. Once in a while I'll be overwhelmed with emotion. I'm the new Van Gogh. Address for ear pls Hi sexpotHi mommyI'll fix that, mirror (8 Roughly C; 

But actually, I like when people let me bitch and rant. They don't have to do anything. Just nod and say "yeah what a shithead, that sucks". Then I tire myself out, get food/sleep/sex and all better!Idk my moms pretty cool
Let's party together woo woo. ENTParty animal?Thought you said "people 5 and under animal" and I was like CHRIST ALMIGHTY. Lmaoooo 

Nah I actually don't like large parties but once in a while. I get too tired. I prefer small gatherings with booze, food, board/video games, and weird sex. Last part is optional thoPerfect. I'll stalk you, find out where you are, buy some booze, and we'll have a grand old time! 

(This sounds completely normal to me, but reading it from any other perspective makes me sound like a creep. Not denying it tho.) OH THIS IS GREAT ;-; I'm in fucking Chattanooga in this kinda cool but kinda creepy Airbnb with no alcohol cause I'm racing early tomorrow. 

I need my person to bang. Gimme dat freaky NTP business. I want some tequila tho omg. Can we hang out plsYou sound just like me twin Tbh I'm just gonna start following you around like a lovesick puppy on Reddit since you're my faveS-senpai noticed me *-*INTJ isn't a real type. They don't exist. I really appreciate this comment But you're actually so cute tho.... Let me love you But I like to harass him every time I see him...That's fine I just want your tequila. And some wings cause I'm hungry but I can't eat until tomorrow afternoon. Except like a yogurt. Excuse me I'm in preschool. Love and harassment are merely different perspectives. :DI'm just 22 and from the Anerican South so my education level is about on par. 

/kind of sIt sounds good to me (8Dunno, I don't really pay attention to regular sounds and things much. I like playing my music over half-decent over-ear headphones but not much else, really. Ooh, depends. I definitely like a lot of dance/EDM/pop kind of stuff, mostly if I feel like singing haha. Otherwise, my "listening" music is Massive Attack, Sneaker Pimps, Veela... Trip hop and other slower electronic music. Sometimes film scores - Neon Demon has a great one. I can't decide! Winter because cold and holidays, fall because fall fashion and leaves, summer because skimpy clothing and pools, and spring because sundresses and flowers. I mean, it seems like you're pretty Ne heavy. Look up Extraverted Intuition. It's a key component of: INTP, ENTP, INFP, ENTP. Maybe look at those?Are you in Charlotte airport? If so, go for it. Or in TX. He'll wherever you're within a bit lemme know. I love meeting internet ppl! Shhhhh. I lose debates to everyone. I'm easy pickin's'. That was an atrocious apostrophe but I'm seven drinks in so spare me. Someone with similar interests who is willing to both share and listen. Someone who will only share feels selfish quickly, someone who only listens makes me feel self-conscious. 

Friends are those rare people that I dorm have to constantly maintain and they're there when I need them, as long as I'm there for them when they need it. Fair weather, but not in the bad way, I s'pose. A lot. It helps me understand my family and friends and lovers. It's sort of... It just helps me understand potential conflicts and how to either solve or otherwise work around them. 

I remember to be more empathetic and sensitive and such. Fam I'm dedI'd rather hook up with the killer tbh I'd fuck me. Doing the sex.

Srs answer, I try to make them laugh, I teach them things or have them teach me, and I'm pretty physically affectionate with like 2 of my closest friends + the BF. The exchange of information is vital to me so it's an expression of love. "I'd be horrified to be called a Feeler. I pride myself on my intellectual development."

WEVE GOT ANOTHER ONE BOYS. Getting some Se vibes here, and Te? Anyone else? The Internet is the best thing ever. I'm kind of anxious tho so it's not that I hate people, I just don't do well in social situations if people are new. I usually don't seek out contact with people IRL but if someone manages to drag me outside, I'll perk up and get chatty. I was kinda thinking low Fi as well, definitely low order F. Not extensively, unfortunately. What makes you think Si in particular?C; Thirded~I'm thinking ESTP. Oh yeah. That's how I got born!Scribbles has it right... but fine arts, catholicism, and agreeable doesn't ring a bell for me in an ENTP. I've always viewed INFJs as having alternative motives. I'm very... weird about how heavily I guard my own information and motives, and I also react strongly to having people push for it. I fell for an INFJ once, that ended terribly, but I got "door slammed" over a misunderstanding. p: 

And I feel like INFJs are better at manipulating overall than ENTPs (no matter how much we pretend), so I feel like I'm a constant disadvantage in a long-running power play. I don't get the same vibe from ISFJs, it's always been INFJs who I get anxiety being around. I do know one or two now who are older and in a professional setting, so that's way easier to handle and we get along well. we act pretty gay hehehehehe

But actually me and my bestie will lay all over each other, pet each others hair, sleep together, etc. but no homo man. Girls are weird like that.saucy, I like it. Show me some affection fam I need more Te in my life. I don't think anyone is immune to therapy. A lot of people might struggle more with it, but it comes from a willingness to try and put in the work. I have OCD, anxiety and depression and went for that, initially. I found a great psychiatrist who put me on medications, and a psychologist who helped me learn to cope with these things. 

A year and a half ago, I found a new therapist after my old one left. I got really sick and almost died, and got PTSD. So I started going to her, and she's wonderful. She's warm, listens to me, is validating, helps me with mindfulness mostly. CBT is what I used for OCD, but general mindfulness has been the biggest help for me now. Learning my emotions and what triggers them, keeping track of my health and physical stats, identifying situations and mental states before they go south, and so on. 

Id have these awful panic attacks. If I heard certain songs or smelled certain smells, I'd get dizzy, hyperventilate, sob, need to hide in the bathroom. I'm a lot better now, I don't panic anymore hardly ever. Medication and therapy were life changing. If I'm honest, I probably would have killed myself a couple of years ago if I never got treatment. It's a little harder for some people- my boyfriend is defensive, so he goes in with an adversarial mindset, where he thinks "they can't possibly understand, they can't help", and reinforces those negative patterns. I go in with the expectations that the person wants to help me, and I need to be honest and not hide anything or be embarrassed, so they can see my patterns and processes. 

I would give it an honest try. IMO a doctor shouldn't be telling you it won't work, since it's so easy to psyche oneself into and out of being open to treatment, unless they have other options to offer you. 

Also: what did they give you? I take propanolol daily for migraines, but it's also an anti-anxiety that helps combat some of the physical symptoms and keeps it from snowballing, since it's a beta blocker. I also have lorazepam as a rescue medication, although I don't need it often now. Can I just say I appreciate that? When I first delved into MBTI, I wasn't sure if ENTP or ENTJ and got "they're completely different only a dumbass would confuse those!". Like... Alright. I've always thought ENFPs were more genuinely warm. It takes work for me. I feel like I can say the perfect thing to be warm and supportive, but it's draining and requires a lot of analysis to get there. I don't usually care much. It's not like an edgy "oh I don't have feelings I'm a badass", I just have a lot of apathy. Maybe depression related, maybe type related. I sometimes do nice stuff because I feel like I'm supposed to. Like, earn points towards not being a shitty person, lol. Your whole post rang true, haha. I feel fake when I do caring and kind things, but I still feel like it's a good thing overall, so it seemls reassuring to me. I think that a lot of ENTPs sociopathic traits come from Ti-Fe in that order, actually. To me, the worst things I've done are because I was so interested in feeding my own curiosity that I just completely neglected someone else's feelings and then I usually feel regret afterward. It's just delayed. Oh my god, I love all of this. (8 *heavy breathing*I think I've met a couple ENTPs irl, and I've gotten along with them all. My boss is an ENTP and we get along great. p; I get along with INTPs and INTJs well also. its beautifulLike I said elsewhere... The part of me that's a decent person is mourning, the ENTP part of me is morbidly curious/excited to see what unfolds. o: So, so dank. I could see it. I think 2020 will bring it back, and it highlighted that the corrupt processes of the DNC weren't going to win - after all, she lost to TRUMP. 

I'm more scared because the Senate, Presidency, House, and soon to be the Supreme Court are all red, now. It'll put intense damage on social issues such as abortion, LGBTQ+/racial/ethnic minority rights and liberties, and things like that. With a red senate, house, and court... I'm not so sure. I was fairly sure the senate would go blue, but I was very wrong. Yep. It needs to all be taken apart. Everything is run by money and power and connections, and none of it is different no matter the label. same I don't think Trump is as dangerous on his own. Like I said, I'm more concerned about the fact that Congress is red all the way through. That + his wackjob VP who supports conversion therapy is my beef. Oh, I have plenty to lose. First up will probably be my healthcare. But what's done is done, so all that's left is to watch and do better this time around. Ahh, I forgot about the two-thirds rule. Thanks. So true. Von Hohenheim from FMA, and I believe Ed Elric are both ENTPs. 

Weiss Schnee from RWBY is an ISTJ or ESTJ, and she is fantastic. It's a good view to have. I am long-term optimistic, but I'm immediately concerned over my healthcare coverage, amongst other issues. I would prefer a single payer system myself. It's hard to know the answer, since everyone has different situations. For me, the protection provided by the ACA by not allowing insurers to deny based on pre-existing conditions was invaluable. I have a rare, often fatal disease and my fear is that if insurers can soon deny, I will either a) be denied coverage completely and not be able to afford my medications (about $1,200 a month) or b) have to purchase very expensive, high risk coverage. I'd check out INFJ, ISFJ, and ISTJ. Yep... Bi lady here too. I have an incurable/life threatening illness too, so I'm also anxious about the route our healthcare takes. Who knows?I don't really watch body language of others and I'm socially kind of... I don't know. I'm rarely paying attention unless I NEED to tune in. Mostly word content and tone are what I catch. 

I wonder if T women or F men tend to display more characteristics attributed to the opposite gender than the more common F women and T men. And if that has anything to do with how we relate to our gender and such. I'm tired. That's a fair assessment.Huh! It's possible. I actually thought she was rather insensitive and brash, speaks very tersely, especially in the first season. More worried about how competent she is rather than popularity, so to speak. She definitely becomes more personable, but I thought it took more development from her than natural high-order Fe would give. Maybe, but her main priority and insecurities lie about her competence and her abilities. I also think she has primary or auxiliary Te because of how systematic her fighting style is, how much she cares about being efficient, powerful, and effective, how much she plans. She takes pride in planning the Vytal festival and deems herself worthy of leading team RWBY because of her organizational and strategy skills- however, she's not a leader of people, doesn't understand them, and that's actually what makes her unable to lead. 

She also takes to almost nobody at first. Her caring about others is consistent with familiarity, but she holds almost everybody in contempt until she knows them better and wants to be able to work solo. Her demeanor is very cold and reserved, which is shown through her actions and her appearance, with her Feeling being in the lower stack. This is pretty consistent with tertiary or inferior Fi. Her leitmotif is "Mirror, Mirror", which highlights how lonely she is and unable to understand herself. "Tell me, can a heart be turned to stone", "I can keep it from the world, why won't you let me hide from me?". She's the very definition of repressed emotion. 

People with stronger Fe are typically warmer, more understanding and open to others, care more about their feelings (vs. purely considering the efficiency of things- feelings are factored into this), more expressive and encouraging of expression. Contrast Weiss with Pyrrha, who's an IxFJ. Pyrrha is more mature, granted, but she's self-sacrificing, warm, encouraging, a bit maternal. Wow, I just wrote a novel about a RWBY MBTI. LOL Haha, I meant I typed out a LOT (at least on mobile) for that. She definitely has a get things done attitude. Some notable quotes:

"I will not let my mission get delayed because you're too slow!" 
"You still excel at wasting time." 
"Head up, shoulders back, right foot forward..." When she's fighting that one Grimm - extremely systematic. 
"Did you say 9 o clock! It's 8:55, you dunce." 
"Good luck studying. That's wrong, by the way." 

Granted, she's raised as an heiress by a family with high standards and a reputation. She's pretty much obsessed with perfection, exactitude, efficiency, things being correct, and it shows in the way she talks to others and how she operates her own life. She also has kind of a "if you want it a certain way, do it yourself", like with her making the bunk beds (really Si+Te when she waxes nostalgic about how she always wanted them as a kid). She doesn't trust others to do well, as seen when she tries to undercut Ruby for leadership. 

She just... Doesn't care so much, especially earlier on, about the feelings of others. It takes a lot for her to begin learning to empathize and relax and recognize the strengths of others. She is kind of morally self-righteous, too, when it comes to Faunus and similar beliefs. 

I would offer up not only Pyrrha, but also Jaune (ESFJ) and Penny (ExFJ). Weiss has her moments of being influenced, but she has to sort of make it through her Si-Te filter first before she starts to accept new ideas and people. Jaune, Pyrrha, and Penny are all very friendly, genuine, warm, giving of self, and the former two are all the "people-leaders" that Ozpin seems to prefer in those positions. Weiss is too entitled, ruthless, and insensitive to lead, at least early. P: 

What type do you think Blake is, actually? I've always been unsure of her. I'm pretty sure she's Fi or maybe low Fe, but that's about it. I also have trouble with Roman. I like to pretend Neo is ENTP, LOL. 1. Alpha, ENTP

2. Yep, for Stein. I like her the best and I just didn't feel like voting for Hillary or Trump. 

3. On one hand, I hate that Trump is president. And that we have a red House/Senate. On the other, Hillary Clinton is everything I hate about politics, so I'm just as glad she's not in. The DNC is a POS too, since anyone paying attention could have seen this coming. 

4. I hope people get motivated to be involved in local and state elections. Change can happen from the ground up, so I hope for massive reform. I hope more people vote in the future, I hope the DNC learns their lesson. I fear losing my healthcare, I hate that people I care about are also scared. Maybe, I just tend to prefer NT types as it is. ENTP female. If I'm not in a relationship, I don't really care. It's like I forget my sex drive exists, and I can easily go six months+ without sex or masturbation. 

But when I'm in a relationship with someone and have that mental connection, all bets are off and it's usually 5-8 times a week (we don't see each other daily), lots of kink, etc. I have to have an intellectual and emotional connection, because I'm into weird and scary stuff and I need someone I can trust. doot dootdoot dootGod you're my favorite. Okay, so I have a perspective. I'm an ENTP girl dating an INTP guy in a non-monogamous relationship. Honestly? Run. A) Don't trust a guy who talks shit or compares you to another girl. B) He's not being respectful to either of you. He's been comparing you to another girl, dude. Like wtf who does that. 

In an open relationship, there needs to be honest and communication from all sides. He's balancing the two of you and trying to have his cake and eat it too while emotionally stringing you along. It won't end well. I understand your need for emotional independence, but you should also aim for emotional maturity along with that. You can find an intellectually stimulating relationship with somebody who knows what they want, respects you, and will be consistent. I gravitate towards NTs, especially INTPs. :D 
It's nice. I don't have to pretend. 10/10 good human would date again. Will they go to creepy places with me? Do they like weird sex things? Do we enjoy building IKEA furniture together?Wait when did your flair happen??That's my fetish. All the sex things, the weirder/scarier the better! *pets you*I'm pretty sure you've decided the type you want to be, so you've put a lot of conflicting information. 

I would bank on ISFP or INFP. The whole post reeks of Fi. You're on point today, lol. I was thinking ISFJ the entire way through. The whole "caring about how people feel, but now I can play a bit of devil's advocate" almost screams Fe-Ti development to me.AW FUCK. Another typing crisis incoming... fml. Oh boi. I've never felt I valued Fe over Ti, but I tested ISFJ in college a lot, but then again I was extremely depressed. p: 

I'm glad you found a better fit! :D I wonder if I'm an ISFJ. I considered it, this description is really good and I relate analyzing where emotional reactions come from. I often don't understand, myself. I do think I sort of have a "fuck it we're winging it" attitude, I have rituals but not necessarily a creature of habit. I very well could be an ISFJ, hmm. Time to do more thinking. That's the decoy. Describes how they fit a lot of functions, says "wanna be INTJ but no" to acknowledge an NT bias, but suggests NTP typing despite nothing really giving an NTP impression. RED HERRING. Interesting, I thought the same thing but I can see it. help me pls i'm having the exact same thing right now. D: TELL ME Pretty much. p: Like the INTJ thing seems like a throw-off. Fi everywhere! I'll PM you. :D The tests are rarely ever correct. Typing is based on your own perspective, motivations, and thought processes - not your behavior or wants or relationships. You very well may have the same functions as your sister. She may also not be an INTJ, as clearly you don't understand how these functions work and interact with one another. 

Your post is almost certainly Fi-dominant. You're quite young, so your inferior and tertiary functions may not make themselves as evident. However, you're showing yourself to be highly sensitive, have a "my way or the highway" attitude, averse to criticism, and aren't really interested in the answers people are giving you. 

Combined with your original post, this makes me almost certain you're an Fi-lead. Se or Ne... I'm less certain. Nothing you write says a whisper to me about Ti at all. Anxiety will often interfere with typing. From your post alone, your general cautious about new situations and making sure they're "safe" before rebelling sounds more Ne-Si, but could be a direct result of high anxiety. Exactly. Got the boyfriend on it too. ;D An interesting perspective I've been turned onto is... it's not really an ability, but more of how each function serves the other? As it cascades down, each function plays to the ones above it, and I think it's a cool view. :D Congrats. Oh, there's always doubt. 

Many people come here and look to be confirmed as a certain type. People are always plagued with misinformation, misunderstandings, biases, etc. If you are certain of Si, odds are you're an INFP. I would look into that and ISFP. I don't think you're an INTP or ENTP at all. Other Si-Fe types are ISTJ and ESTJ. I don't think so. I live with an INFP, and he's rather... boisterous with his opinion, lol. He's smart, but he knows it, and can get condescending/argumentative fast when something conflicts with his beliefs. I think OP's "I'll rebel... but only if I actually can" is Fi-Si, at least to me. 

I dated an INFP female, and she's an internet warrior but very reserved/anxious IRL. Both are very sensitive to criticism and challenge. 

ETA: OOPS you're op If I don't get over something, it's usually expressed in a negative presence type of way. I only hold onto things for a long time if it's someone I'm close to, and I just kind of... drop out of their life. It takes a lot of effort for me to keep contact with people and to nurture my relationships, so if someone goes too far, I just quit with the effort and we naturally fall apart. 100% agreed. Healthy individualism allows people to reach their full potential, and I think it happens to help the collective along the way without prioritizing it. I'm mostly just ribbing. Fi-Si are the only functions I'm fairly sure of. Well, I can't see you or talk to you. Most of the time... I find that Ne comes across very strongly in person but not always so much over text. I wouldn't say you don't use it, it just doesn't come across to me via your post. But if you are certain you use Si, it can be inferred that Ne is somewhere in your stack. Fi-Si mean that there are only two more functions you're utilizing - Ne and Te. So really, it's a matter of finding which order they're in. May also want to look up types under stress/inferior grip. Those types are INFP, ENFP, ISTJ, and ESTJ. Jk talked to /u/hazylazybones and I think we're back on schedule. It's never too late! *for now*Haha, I ranked them ENTJ, INTJ, ESTP p:Honestly, rarely do dom/aux functions stand out that hard to me. Only dom Fi and dom Ne tend to jump. Pretty much! I have a few people who are very solidly typed that I use as "reference points", lmao. My INTP, two of my ENFP fronds, ESTP stepmom, and INFP roommate are all people who are just so dead-on in their types. It's funny cause there are so many people who want to be xNTJ types, and then when you actually see them pop up it's super obvious. Watching my roomie and my boyfriend (Fi vs. Ti) is crazy hahaha. They operate so differently that it's just like.... wat. I can never see how people confuse the two, but maybe it's because I have a lot of exposure to them. this was a cute interactionThis is a secondary source, but my grandma is an ESFJ and is like 75, hahaha. She was a teacher back in the day and apparently quite a card. p: I asked her some similar questions because I was curious and it was really sweet so I wanted a place to share. Paraphrasing, but: 


"I don't know, I just go about my day and do things that I like. I'm too old to be worrying about so much crazy stuff - I do get out and vote every time, though, I still care. I read my books, watch my shows, take care of my plants, and try to get [grandpa] to stop working on the Corvette so he can eat dinner. Oh, you know he bought me that ring I liked on QVC? [*cue super-pleased expression*]" 


"I always cared so much about the people around me - well, I still care ABOUT them, but I try not to worry about what they think as much. A lot of my friends are back with God, so I really appreciate the people around me." 


"When I go garage sale shopping, I always think of you and your mom and [cousins here]! You should come on the next highway trip we go on, we do those every year and I'd like to you come with us, by the way." 


Bonus: 


"It was just weird not having Christmas at our house this year! I don't like it. Our house is the Christmas house." 


"I send you so many videos on Facebook because you like cats so much, and I like to show you I'm thinking of you. I don't comment too much, do I? Good, because I'm gonna keep doing it." 

I should go visit this weekend, I miss her. *kfj ldkjf;a lkdjmn uron; d d c*
*bluuuuuush*Hahaha, pretty much. They're like... so subtle you stick out. I try to type them and I'm like "they're so low-key, what are they?... WAIT." I have not. D: watnot an Si sub tho? She's literally the sweetest person on the entire planet. She's just so nice and thinks of everybody else first. She's so into finding sales - departments, outlet stores, garage sales, pawn shops, eBay auctions... it's a total thrill haha. I miss her. She lives like 40 minutes away so I see her a couple times a month usually. I should make her some food and bring it. :cshut the hell up we don't shitpost ever

*deletes half of post history*I love ironic shitposting. it me oh okay 

/u/ColdNobility will you pls marry meThe one I dated was a toxic, creative, idealistic and over-emotional mess, my roommate is a bitter, smart, witty person on an intellectual high horse LOL. They all have their ups and downs.I think y'all are right. I see auxiliary Ne in there. I remember telling my INTP "you're so unapologetically... you!". It seems like an Fi statement, but it can definitely be more of an inferior Fe. p: That combined with the sort of aloofness described above makes me think INTP, with the runner-up being ISTP. I made one of these and it resisted a chubby cat trying to climb it. Does this count?Mmmmm petty.I think our inner worlds are important and far more interesting, you can look at the info we gobble up and how we use it. :D Tepid is a wonderful word. WAIT. you're the one who created the NFP firestorm. Ooooooo buddy I just waded through that. TYthat's typistCONFIRMED ESTJ Interesting. Fe at work, I guess? I do it, but it's more like a *screeeech* and change gears when I realize I'm totally not clicking with someone, lol. 

Like when I went from an interview with another ENTP to an SFJ. I was going on about technical stuff, realized my audience and the questions she was asking, and then I was like WAIT NO ABORT ABORT. the INTP would post in compsci, mbti, gifs and oilporn. heheheheI always scope out my ntps (8 Hmmm. Me, i'd sit down and just think. Then start running through possible motives, possible people, possible places and ways, use the data that I do know in order to eliminate as many of this options as possible. 

That's my start point. Then I go to people, and collect their stories, start finding overlap points, use one to verify another, and I just churn all of that data around until I get some conclusions. They aren't always right, but I can usually throw out enough good theories for someone else to check on. p: I don't think typiest is it either... typeist?Triptych? Tipton? Just the typ?Well, we're working under the assumption that these labels are honest. In which case I would appreciate them. If not, then I'm right back where I am anyway. I'd watch you. (8 Just to see how it feels...*wink*She's the cutest lady ever hahaha. She always sends me cat memes and videos. And comments on everything ever with "I love you sweet girl!!!!!! Miss u!!!!" And "Me and God both are here!!!!! :-)" hahaha. I mean, you aren't wrong haha. I don't really socialize enough anyway to care about the nuances at this point. P:YAY OMGGood, I was just checking c;everythingMy cats are definitely ENFP and ISTP. I've decided. this is not shitposting u shit we're engaged nowthank you 
this is honestly the most fun i've had in weekshooray Ne is the best :D it's  beautiful ;-; i'm already waiting in your house so yesim a girl but yes/thread

Glad I'm still alive @.@I have an idea. Start a cult. Plan a Jim Jones, then don't go through with it. THEN LOOT. ISTJs are the best creatures and I love them and want to hug them against their will. See? It makes it better when you struggle. 

*i didn't say you all liked me (8*Yay! :D The ones I've gotten to know recently I've just found extremely likeable. They're a little cautious and even a bit...mistrustful? But very loyal people. I personally enjoy the dynamic of annoying them and then not knowing why they like me, lol. A girl I rowed with is ISTJ and we got on each other's nerves at first, but after a while I could tell she appreciated my odd ideas and outrageous comments, once we adjusted.

ENTPs can be just as terrible. We can be cruel and sociopathic, flighty and heartless. Sometimes it takes ISTJs longer to come around, but mature, well-rounded ISTJs still have Ne and aren't as stubborn as you may think - they have their quirks, even if you have to look a bit harder. They are perceivers, after all, and Si isn't just about tradition. If anything, I've found INTPs consistently willing to dig their heels in. p:

Hell, some of the most racist shit I've heard are from my ISFJ and ISTP grandparents. A lot of it is also a product of the times, along with the way people are raised and who they are exposed to. I'll admit, Si doms will be less likely/slower to shift their foundational views, but hey. no she's mineI have two in my bed. *wink*I was gonna post an obnoxious shitposting comment, but I decided not to because you're actually right. For me, it's extremely hit or miss. I enjoy my fellow ENTPs for their wit, curiosity, and banter. However, I have almost no tolerance nowadays for "edginess" or cruelty towards others, and the "troll" types are quickly dismissed by myself. 

Thanks, Fe. Not everyone agrees haha, I think it takes maturity on both ends. My bestie is an IxTJ and yeah, she's basically my handler LOL. But I also make her do outrageous stuff and come along with my plans. It works. :D I don't even get the impression he really took his run seriously, lol. Funny dude though. yes daddyInterestingly, my INTP also completely misses lyrics. 

I pay very strong attention to both. I think the melody, bass, and rhythm hit me first, but both are important to me. I'd weigh them 60-40. p:*deeeeep bruhhhh*

hahaahahah that's funny. I think trolls and edginess are funny, I just don't like to hang around them too much. I'll even troll once in a little while tbh. Then again the only ENTP I know IRL is my boss who's a relatively mature adult so... y'know. Not a lot of data there. 

TBH Maybe it's a gender thing but I don't relate to Tony Stark at all. I think the ones who brag the most about being so introverted and reserved are the ones who are the least so. And the least self-aware, of course. 

Okay, to be fair a lot of the responding comments are hilarious. I just want to love you ;-; 

Jk /u/ColdNobility is my istj I claimed him Why wouldn't I be?? Seconding this!Glad you figured it out!Haha, I'm booking an escape room with my INTP. &lt;3 I'm kinda thinking ISTJ, to be honest. Si-Te-Fi-Ne. I suffered multiple pulmonary embolisms last year. One of my lungs had an infarct and I lost part of my right lung. I was subsequently diagnosed with a blood clotting autoimmune disorder.

I was panicked in the hospital, you know "am I gonna die?" And stuff. A couple of days later when I was at home, I got better quickly. I was in really good shape, etc, had a flood of adrenaline and confidence. "I beat this, I'm strong, I'm going to make it". The other shoe dropped about two weeks ago and the implications of everything hit me like a brick wall. 

The PTSD and general anxiety set in. I closed off around others a lot, I was going to so many appointments and getting all these tests. I lost like 15 lbs. I threw a lot of people out of my life, got into MBTI to cope and sort of... Cling to what little sense of identity I had left. I definitely struggled with dealing with the concept of my own mortality and had existential crisis after crisis after crisis, not knowing why I was here, what was the point, why do humans try to hard to live for so long, etc. I would alternate between being super careful and cautious over my health, and then not giving a shit. Si-frenzy? Who knows. 

I'm okay now, kind of, but you know. *Shrug.*Same. I'm so cluttered and messy.  I force my roommate to clean the common areas lmao. Once in a while I shell out for a maid. I'm normally relatively clean... Except I'm not and I have no real excuse. Haha. I hope you feel better. The resistance makes it that much sweeter (8 I never said y'all liked me too. &lt;3333I have an autoimmune disorder that's tried to kill me a couple of times. p: so I guess that qualifies. I do a lot of questioning the value and meaning of my own life, why we exist, why does anyone attempt to live a long life, etc. 

I get really frustrated because I can't do all of the things I want to do. But at the same like, Ne-Te is nice because I find it easy to escape if need be, because screw the real world. I enjoy reading, writing, and I'm getting into programming. I can retreat into my mind for hours at a time and that provides some relief. YO SAME help me clean i'm drowning I agree with your entire first paragraph... I think only the last twos sentences of the second paragraph is relevant. Need less self-loathing. Yes, for me, but there's a caveat. I pretty much can't work in a linear fashion, so multitasking is my only real option haha. If I could, it'd probably be way more effective.Pretty much. It highlighted the need for more perspective shifting p:Haha woops! Yeah  I was just impressed with your spin :DI actually do a lot of writing and use MBTI as sort of a "grounder" for my characters. First of all... you've given a really vague personality. It could fit virtually anybody. 

How is he flirty? Does he offer gifts? Does he make crass remarks? Does he tease her? Make puns? Write sappy notes? Flirt super low-key to where it's not even noticeable? Why does he even like her in the first place? How would he react if she rejected him? 

What is his sense of humor beyond sarcastic? Dry? Witty? Dorky dad-jokes? How easily amused is he? Is he mean about his humor? Knock-knock jokes? Dirty ones? How much does he laugh? Does he make jokes at inappropriate times? 

What does he do for fun? Outside or inside hobbies? Why did he choose them? Anything he's an expert at? Does he like doing them alone? Does he share them with others? Anything he's bad at? 

How is he intelligent? Really good with people/emotionally intelligent? Good with memorization, details, diagrams, etc and efficient? Does he enjoy math and science? What kinds? Why? When did his interests start? Did his parents, teachers or friends encourage him? How does he learn best? Visually, by doing, learning online, etc? Is there anything that makes him feel stupid, or that he struggles to understand? 

What about caring? How does he show he cares for his friends? What's his love language (touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time)? Does he prefer to fix the problem or is he a good listener? Does he come off as insensitive, or is he really in tune with the problems and moods of others? How often do others come to him for advice? 

MBTI is less about behaviors and more about perceptions, perspectives, internal motivations, etc. Try answering some of these questions and I'd love to better help you. Hmm, interesting. I think type could influence type 1 and 3. Type 2 is a bit of an outlier and seems to correlate more with immaturity/a lack of self-awareness or talent. After all, the only difference between Type 2 and 1 is that the type 2 kids aren't as skilled writers as their more accomplished counterparts. p: 

I've personally always been a type 1. I never was fantastic in school as a whole, but I've always been a really strong writer, whether it was fictional work or essays. I hated using outlines and would usually write first and then hastily fill out my outline before turning it in. p: For huge projects, like a book or something else, I'll write a vague outline, but otherwise I always just thought out my main point, wrote, and then would jump around and fill in any other spots. I would edit afterward, though, and do some rearranging to make sure it makes sense. 

If anything, I doubt my own coherence than anyone around me, haha. I even wrote a rather large PM to someone here and apologized for the seemingly incomprehensible mass of text and was reassured that it made perfect sense. Fun fact: I ran a secret blog with a couple of thousand followers, lol. 

To answer your question, I think that the first option (and second) would most strongly correlate to Ne and possibly Ti to an extent, maybe Se. The third would be more strongly tied to Si, Te, or possibly even Fe (if it were important to others that the work be organized a certain way). This is all speculation on my end, of course. Okay! Would you say ISTJ/ESTJ or INTJ/ENTJ possibly describes him? It's pretty much a whirlwind. 

I'm always off in my own world and rarely find myself present. Even when I'm confronted with situations, I tend to take whatever it is and run with it right past the point, lol. If someone tells me something about Halloween, I might sit there and my brain goes from the holiday &gt; scary decorations &gt; myths and urban legends associated &gt; horror movies &gt; to general fear (how does it work? what makes us scared?) &gt; research related items (shoutout to /r/UnsolvedMysteries and /r/CreepyWikipedia &gt; ... and there's the rest of my night. I sometimes share my findings with friends or people online, but usually just to my boyfriend or a group chat I'm in. I do feel like I need to share this stuff. 

Sometimes the associations happen even quicker in a conversation. "I saw black and white cat..." cat &gt; black and white &gt; skunks cows penguins &gt; arctic &gt; polar bears &gt; they aren't black and white &gt; they're transparent! And in that span of a couple of seconds, I might reply with something about that. It's lightning fast.

Visually speaking, it's like starting in the center of a spiderweb, reaching out and shooting along multiple pathways that all extend in various directions, connecting and interacting in sometimes unexpected manners. I don't know what I'll think or say next, I don't know what conclusions I'll come to... I'm kind of just along for the ride. 

Although Ne is an extraverted function, I tend to spend a LOT of time in my head. Like, imagining entire worlds and people who don't exist and, scenarios that will never happen, things I want to do, etc. It feels like sometimes I don't even need to actively engage the world outside of me... I just passively absorb and soak in details that I save for later in my bank of material. 

Combined with Ti... I'm insatiably curious. I thrive on new information, learning, solving, figuring out the truth in things, and digging into things that most people would leave alone. It gets me in trouble at times and doesn't always earn me friends, but it's who I am and it's what I do. 

*shrug*

I would question more between ESTP and ESFP, actually. Sounds Se-Ni to me, but I am with ThisWontDo in questioning the Fi-Te/Ti-Fe axis.I'm getting a serious xNFP vibe here, but definitely lead or aux Ne. :3I relate to exhibit one pretty hard, lol. I've always enjoyed Greek temperaments. 

IxxP - phlegmatic 

IxxJ - melancholic

ExxP - sanguine

ExxJ - choleric

Certain temperament-oriented sites align them to the MBTI types this way. I'd say they're decently fit, although I think having hybrids lends it even more accuracy. (INFP may be more phlegmatic-melancholic, ESTP may be more sanguine-choleric). Great minds think alike. Give me the succ I've wondered too. I've had mental and chronic illness, so I have definitely seemed introverted. Part of Ne (extraverted intuition) is that while you're gaining information externally, it's not always from people. I'm extraverted by type, but not in a social sense.That's how you be a bro, bro. Conversation going a weird way? Redirect, stat. Actually, ExFJs are commonly noted as choleric or a blend of choleric-phlegmatic or choleric-sanguine. Depends on which theory you subscribe to. None are perfect, but I feel this is the closest. 

Choleric isn't necessarily constantly irascible or what have you (at least in regards to temperament), but also is associated with being goal-oriented, motivated, and so on. Combined with one of the more mellow temperaments, I don't think it's unbelievable to see ExFJs in a mix. Every type is capable of romance and full spectrums of emotion. I'm sensing NP. I'd say NTP but it could be Fi. I've dealt with OCD too btw. I hope you're doing better. Did you have to learn it? I thought I was a TJ for a while until it kind of hit me that I hate being organized, I hate leading, it's difficult and tiresome, etc, and that my natural instinct is to go with the flow of things. It's easier to differentiate when you understand your go-to, and even the reasons why you change. (Survival? To make others happy? etc) One thing to note with xNTPs - an INTP will very, very rarely ever mistake themselves for extroverted. An ENTP will be more likely to describe themselves as ambiverted/extroverted with introverted moments. 

I mistook myself for these types and settled on NTP - I definitely identify with Ne as one of my top functions. I also realized that learning to be precise, organized, etc. was me molding to my surroundings and not what I'd instinctively do. Don't discount Si and Ti for precision, routine and organization either. Violet Baudelaire is quite possibly an INTP, maybe ENTP. Her brother Klaus is an INTP for sure. 

Also, while many believe Luna Lovegood is an INFP, I believe (and there are a number of solid write-ups) that she is an INTP. Sounds INFP to me. Fi-Si loop would definitely do that. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2wlgkv/can_someone_help_me_understand_the_fisi_loop/

See if you relate to any of that, perhaps? Julian Winding! Demon Dance, from the Neon Demon. It's become my unofficial theme music. Someone who really wants to be an xNTJ. 

*bahdumtssssss*I was being rudely joking, apologies. 

I could see this fitting INTJ, INFJ, ISTJ, or ISFJ. o:Check out ESTP, ESFP, ENFP, and ESTP!It's what you gotta do. I still flick my light switch twice each time, my volume stays in increments of two... But otherwise I'm pretty normal. It's rough stuff. Eek. Mine used to be so bad I was of the verge of getting committed. I don't do the blinking but we all have our things. I'm obsessed with the number 8, 4, 2, and general symmetry p: for its harmless quirky rep, OCD suuuuuucksI'm glad you liked it! :D I'm learning to be more aware and polite. Cmon, Si, hurry up. Haha. Pretty much. :(This number sounds rather like an ISFJ. (Or ESFJ)That's kinda what I was thinking. Definitely Te here, and I believe Fi. Maybe ESFP but I'm not sure. Clean my room ENTP: memes:( but imaginary world beckons me. 

Maybe being locked in is my fetish. Actually coincidentally I was in an escape room last night. I like where this is going...It's okay we can up with a solution. *triggering intesifies*She probably digs you. 

Source: ENTP female who enjoys science and is bisexual and had a thing for the bestie. The three INTPs I know are too... Lmao. Might have stumbled onto a trend haha. I can tell you least observant may include INTPs and ENTPs. I don't know how my INTP and I intend on running a household together. I guess we'll just wing it. I'm sorry about this. Best wishes from Texas. 

I've lost distant family and some close friends. I lost my cool very quickly, couldn't handle the funerals. I still remember them and break down sometimes. I would recommend grief counseling, but remember to acknowledge those feelings when you feel the time is right. I like the NTs and SFs. STs and NFs tend to make me be like |:*triggered* 

"Wait where did you say it was?" 

"Wait what did you say?" 

"Wait what was I doing?" 

"Wait where was I going?" 

"Wait what?????" 

"Fuckin fuck" Good nasty infj i just smushed a bug and pretended it was you Probably IxFJ, sounds like a lot of Fe. no i caught the sarcasm i am just sleepy and had some beers Maybe so. p: Rough ISFJ, I hate to taint my image of them but they can happen. I think it hit too close to home from INFJs who actually act like that...I want to all-caps Gotye/Kimbra to you but I won't. samecancer*ahem*

BUT YOU DIDNT HAVE TO CUT ME OFF

MAKE OUT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED AND THAT WE WERE NOTHING

AND I DONT EVEN NEED YOUR LOVE 

BUT YOU TREAT ME LIKE A STRANGER AND IT FEELS SO ROUGH 


NO YOU DIDNT HAVE TO STOOP SO LOW

GAYYYY!I do! They're a bit concerned. You're okay I'm interested in the sex demon part. I cry a lot so yeah If she's really your friend and an ENTP, you two will be fine. Even if there's some resulting awkwardness or anything, y'all will make it. C;A. Age, gender, and nationality

B. What kinds of things do you remember easily? What kinds of things do you usually forget?

Anything long-term, I can hold onto for ages. I tracked down my childhood crush from when I was five and we reconnected. I can remember the Power Rangers sheets on my babysitter’s kid’s bed during a tornado in ’98. Song lyrics, names, riddles, stories from long ago, etc. My short term memory is abysmal, about on par with Dory. 

B.	What kind of people do you feel most comfortable around? What kind of people make you feel awkward or uncomfortable? What kind of people annoy you the most?

Like:  Relaxed, amoral, apathetic, curious, thick-skinned, intelligent, awkward, sometimes asshole-ish, strange, not easily shocked, misfit-type people. That’s my current friend group (mostly NPs and SPs, like one FJ and two SJs. Mostly introverts). People who aren’t reactive, who aren’t judgmental, and let things get a little weird. I like open, easygoing environments where people can just bring things up and talk it out, no need for self-censoring. I also kind of like people who are sort of uptight but low-key think I’m funny hehehe. Lots of shitposting/NSFW. 

Anger: Morally superior people with pet issues lmao, people who won’t solve their own problems and just get really upset, bossy people, very sensitive people, people who talk about their personal problems constantly, people who won’t have a civil debate, people who say “I mean we agree so what’s the point of discussing further?” *flips table* 

Nervous/Uncomfortable: Social climbers, people who smile a lot and are really really friendly (*you liar, you can’t be that happy*), religious people, people who criticize quickly/easily.

----

D. How do you usually handle interpersonal conflict or confrontation? How do you wish you handled it - what would you change about your usual approach if you wanted to improve?

I’m pretty diplomatic, usually, and can mediate if necessary. I ask a lot of questions, try to figure out where the conflict is coming from, and then attempt to “translate” to help the other party understand. Most arguments in my circle come from misunderstandings and assumptions. It’s tiring, though, so I like groups with low confrontation/higher apathy levels. 

The times I get way too riled up and let my temper get the best of me, I usually fly off the handle and go “oh my god shut up, nobody cares”. Or worse, just go off on whatever insecurities I’ve picked up. Not my finest moments. 

----

E. What is your demeanor like?

When I’m comfortable, I’m pretty expressive. My hands mimic my thoughts, so I do a lot of wiggly fingers and flapping lmao. I kind of talk in cycles – start slow, get louder and more excited, then stop and collect. When I’m in a new situation, I’m very stilted and awkward while I try to feel out the vibe of the new group and blend in. I miss beats and don’t joke much because I don’t know what the rules are. Sometimes I prod at people or give them shit, which I try not to do as much now unless I’m with my usual crowd.

I think people see me as rational overall (until they're close to me and see the beautiful irrational, underdeveloped feels huehuehue) since they come to me for advice or help fixing problems, which I oblige out of duty. I'm not super emotionally mature, lol. Sometimes I get deer in headlights when I'm faced with too much emotional expression and the chaos gets a bit contagious.  

Overall, I’m definitely silly. Puns, “that’s what she said!” jokes, etc. I don’t take a lot seriously and even when things get real I usually have some snark to deliver. The times I am serious, it throws people off because I just don’t act that way much. I’m usually not engaged with the present. I forget to listen to people, I miss things that happened, I’m usually thinking about future projects, character and story ideas, sketch ideas, making notes of things to look up later, etc. 

I stumble on my words a lot and mix them up (where’s my fell sone??), my mind moves a bit too quick and I have to stop and then start again or I’m incomprehensible. I cut myself off a lot, forget what I’m saying, go on tangents… I get bored really easily, but little things get me excited too. I kind of have two states of existence – at rest and 100%. 

----

F. What kinds of things do you seem to notice more than most people? What do you more often seem to miss?

I notice logical inconsistencies, typos, contradictions, and I’m quick to get the overarching themes of things. I miss… everything else. I’m pretty much tuned out of daily life, and when I tune in, it becomes draining, unless it presents a challenge, in which case I start firing on all cylinders. Basically, unless someone gives me something to solve, I’m useless. 

----

G. Think about your energy, interest level, and skill doing various activities. What energizes you, relaxes you, stresses you out? What do you do well, okay, or poorly? What can you do all day, for a while, only in short bursts, or barely at all? Which of these seem like a waste of time, not just for you but in general?

Energizing: Trawling Wikipedia/Reddit/TVTropes, programming, languages, learning in general, creating characters and worldbuilding, sketching, analyzing useless things (MBTI, song/character analysis), interesting discussions, board games, puzzles. I did an escape room recently and I feel like I could do those all day, hehe. I just like letting my mind wander places on its own. 

Tiring: Extended socializing, taking care of bills, grocery shopping, errands, emotional support, personal exploration… Anything that requires me to divert significant mental energy to it that I don’t want to do, really, especially if I have to stay focused. 

I don’t know what I’d call a waste of time, since everything is important to someone and it takes all kinds, I guess. I’m pretty unmotivated and roll with my interests. I can be productive, especially at work, but it’s usually just enough to keep me employed and I do it quickly so I can get back to doing what I want instead. RIP productivity.
The ISFP I knew best oh man. She's like... low-key promiscuous, low-key flirty, super adorable. Not so much shy as just coy. ISFP!jk ENTP you caught me&gt; People who don’t think before they say something and hurt people with it
&gt; People who are constantly late

*sorry*

&gt; People who believe that they’re some kind of Jesus

*your own...... personal........ jesus.......*

*REACH OUT AND TOUCH ME*i wanna send you a video omg you can't tell me what to do tbt to when you sent me into a tizzy when you thought I was ISTJ. That was the nicest way of saying "google it" i've ever seen i am everything you hate

including jesusI was thinking ISTJ or INTJ. O: But dolphins *are* smarter than humans. it's okay, be boring and i'll match you. i can hear trump now LOW ENERGY I'm feeling INTP the most. I feel like you've got Ne somewhere in the mix. However, I'm thinking you have low Fe too (if not, highish/middling Fi - ISTJ? Maybe INFP?), so that's where my conclusion is coming from. 
 xSTJ? If I had to rank top 3, ESTJ, ISTJ, ENTJ. My boyfriend thought I'd gone bonkers 

"WHAT IF I AM ISTJ. WHAT IS THIS? BABE. BABE TELL ME THE TRUTH." I do it pretty badly. I'm a social moron so I'm like "Wait did I say something offensive or tasteless? I probably did. They probably hate me. Oh well damn." 

I also never respond in a timely fashion so...https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5e72nt/what_is_the_nedoms_world_like/

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5chl2t/what_is_the_ni_doms_inner_world_like/I have an ENTP brother. Our entire immediate family are all Se users. It's a ball. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Type and height don't have correlation. NP, those links have a lot of different perspectives so you may well find them all helpful in some way. E D G Y

YWhat type do you think you are? Alpha quadra (Ne/Ti/Fe/Si). 

You could be an Fi/low Te type with Ne-Si. hue hue hue Infp might be your best bet if you're certain about the Ne-Si. Thank you. I feel so appreciated. :3ISTJ because I love them. I'm an ENTP dating an INTP. 

-I appreciate how fucking smart he is. Like he's soooooooooo smart and can pick apart my ideas in six seconds flat. He makes me sharpen up because I want to impress him. 

-I love how lowkey creative is. He's great at worldbuilding and having someone I can write with is amazing. He has great ideas and when he gets excited it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. @.@ I mean I can't shut up about him on here tbh. 

-He is pretty hot. And mmmmmph, let's just say the high-Ne/low-Si carries over c; huehuehue

-He is authentic without even having to try and he has that really cute awkward charm that I find so endearing. I'm glad he's as geeky and odd as I am. Who needs social norms!?

-He's always willing to try new things and go on adventures with me. We try new hobbies and go to places we probably shouldn't, and have fun just because we're with each other. 

-He's open-minded and never, ever judgmental of me. We share so many hobbies together and even when I'm weird af he never makes me feel self-conscious about it. 

-I enjoy when we can sit in silence, doing our own things in the same room. No pressure to go out or socialize. 

-I feel good when he opens up to me and trusts me with his feelings and opinions and ideas. It makes me feel so special. 

I just love him a lot. He's my bab~!Yours and mine complete the quadra!Less an excuse and more of an explanation. Very subtle difference between the two. xSTJ.

ETA: I'm also going on your writing style, past posts, etc. I don't think what you've written here is entirely... representative of yourself. My boyfriend thought the same thing... believe it or not, there's a number of us out there who find the weird charming, or even are just as weird. :D Hehe, attraction is important. Granted, personality can amp or detract attractiveness points for me. :3 Hooray for polyamory! My SO and I are nonmonogamous as well. :3 Although we are both smol, hahaha. VOI-C (Engineer)

Fairly accurate, but I think VOE-C (Debater) would be just as fitting. I'm not necessarily socially extraverted in the traditional sense, but I am functionally extraverted so it gets a bit tetchy on tests like this. Yes I am! I'm amazed you remembered that, holy shit. I think our typing may lend itself to the open-mindedness required to some extent, but we still take it slow. My brother is an ENTP. We both annoyed the everloving fuck out of each other. And mostly I'd pick on him and use him to work on my evil child mastermind plans. 

We get along now. Mostly with memes and advice for getting girls. Sing him a tune!You like your NFPs, lol. I have an INFP roommate as well!My friend group now is mostly INTP and ISTP... we bond over the fact that we're misfit oddballs. See? I'm a genius!I'm dating an INTP and he's truly my BFF, but I rave about him online so much that I figure my other friends can have my spotlight. p: I do love conversing with other NTPs!Awwww those sound like storybook friendships. I wish I had friends like that. I suck at making friends. But then again I'm not a great friend either so I have no room to complain. 

The second one sounds ESFP hahaha. Your first friend sounds like a reaaaaally gay guy I know, also ExTJ. I'm glad you like yourself. I'm sorry to hear you went through that. 

If it makes you feel any better, my boyfriend got strung along by a really toxic, abusive IxFP he met online and kind of dated. I had to double-check your comment history. He's even the same age, close in height, says GG all the time... wtf. 

He's made a couple of friends and got a pretty cool girlfriend (pretty cool is subjective but you're getting a biased view). Things can always look up. C: ...He's actually Filipino! WTF hahaha. 

My god you two would get along grandly. He even loves anime, RPG and writing. Jesus Christ. But yes, you seem pretty cool. Hooray! Awww that's cute. Like you &lt;33 I always struggled more with INTP/ENTP. My boyfriend is INTP and we could easily be mistaken as the same type at certain times. I was sure I had Ne and Ti, just wasn't sure which was stronger, and I lean towards social introversion. 

Certain NTPs will seem more like others. P: Sounds pretty ENFP to me. Hard to type when mental illness or other similar issues are involved. *fapfap* ENTP and a sugar baby. I like my money, what can I say? Most of the sugar baby community I've seen seems to be made up of ESTPs, xSFPs, and IxFJs. Those are the notable ones I've seen, and they all take different approaches and have different motivations for how they run their hustle.  I was pretty big into the sugar dating community a few years back and you're dead on. IxFJs in general, ESTPs, and xSFPs were some of the prolific profiles. Extroverts tend to report more happiness overall. I think ExTJs and ESxPs would rank up there, and INxPs towards the lowest. There's a self-reported graph that detailed this but I'd love to do a bigger survey. Hehe. Both are taken pretty negatively in general. But yes, vast array of interested types! It totally is though. DxMy roommate is one. I get along with him much better than female INFPs I've known. It's interesting. I think a lot of people feel lost or different for many reasons. I'm an ENTP woman, and I feel like I'm completely out of sync with the people around me. It's bizarre. I don't think I'm that unique or different... I feel like I'm just on a difference wavelength entirely. 

Like, I have plenty of traits that are valued by my community and I'm decently friendly, and no one's ever bad to me. In theory, I should make friends easily and fit in well! It's a weird limbo where I'm not an outcast, but I don't quite connect. I spend a lot of time trying to figure out where I'm faltering and where I succeed, but I don't know if it all comes down to measurable science... That's heartening to hear. Not OP, but man, I can't make a friend if I try. I make jokes about "hahaha i have no friends" but honestly... I don't have many real friends outside of my boyfriend. It's really lonely. I guess I can see the probability/overlap on these, but I think to peg types with personality disorders is probably tenuous at best... not to mention that these only cover pathological personalities and not mental illnesses as a whole. I actually don't, believe it or not. I feel like the ExFJs I know are so optimistic about that, lol. I have three people I consider friends, and I'm actually being generous, as two of them I don't talk to very often, but we tend to get along. People just slip in and out of my life. *shrug* I mean, it's partially my fault, as I'm not a great friend. I usually do better befriending other Ne users, and the occasional INTJ. I will be fair and say I have some friendly acquaintances. 

My group now is my boyfriend's friends, so I enjoy all of the inferior Fe... they're all fucking weird as shit. I wouldn't consider them my friends, but we get along and entertain. 

I appreciate the offer, but what does one say in that situation? Maybe I'm very suspicious of Fe users because, but I always view offers like this as selfish or otherwise carrying other motivations. Fe users give me the impression that they feel good making these offers and would follow through whether they like someone or not, but it's unpleasant to imagine someone holding a conversation with me because they offered and I mentioned loneliness. Feels like a pity conversation, no? (Not saying that's how you are, just in general - I'm incredibly suspicious of Fe users in general, although ExFJs less so than IxFJs). Interesting. Mine has a couple of his, writing and gaming. He doesn't have many friends though, since he just moved here. But we get along well enough. Yup. And honestly, if you have to do something you just gotta do it. The human mind is very flexible and complex, so take MBTI as a guideline and not something that determines your behavior. It more takes into account your motivations, thought processes, and the things you prioritize. You've misunderstood me. It's more that people who have acted a particular way have tended to be Fe users. I'm close to my ESFJ grandmother, I enjoy my INFJ and ESFJ coworkers, and such that I wouldn't exclude anyone based on it. I mentioned my mistrust in specific regards to situations where it's "feel free to talk to me" "let me know if you need anything" - it feels self-validating and not very genuine to me, which is why I become hesitant to take anyone up on similar offers. 

I also, believe it or not, don't mistrust people on a general level. I'm fine with being open, with sharing, even making the first move at times despite putting myself up for rejection. *shrug* I'd like to pawn it off as a lack of effort, but I suppose maybe I haven't met the right people. I don't think I'm a very good friend and maybe people catch it rather early. I suspect I "vibe" weirdly and people pick up on it. To be honest, I think I make good first impressions, but I have an odd flavor to me. At least from what I can tell... a bit eccentric, a little checked-out... People don't really want someone who doesn't seem like they're paying attention, so I guess I just need to find my fellow high Ne-users or low Fe/Fi users. 

At least I have the internet. That keeps me from feeling too lonely. And yes, the boyfriend is great. It's like having a more reasonable, rational twin. That I have sex with. Okay, that could have been phrased better... Don't be surprise. Women of all most every type enter the bowl for various reasons. It certainly feels like it at times. nailed itI stand on the ceiling. 

I only dream during hibernation.

I don't have friends. 

I am a puzzle. 

I prefer how music looks. 

I like watching everything burn to the ground, so I guess I like the process. 

My decisions are based on cold logic and what will get me more Starbucks. 

Justice should also be based on mercy and how much people are willing to pay me. 

My decisions are based on how many toddlers I can set to tears. 

I'm mostly early, if you mean up early and hating my existence. Otherwise, I'm usually 10 minutes late to everything. 

I do not keep a day planner. The days naturally revolve around me. 

I'm not clean or organized, but I think I'm pretty neat. c; Definitely ISTJ. I think you're an Si user. I found an ENTP girl this way. I'm gonna meet her this evening. :D IxFP, leaning INFP. i know your type 

its L A Z Y CALLED IT 
Off by one. Too much shitposting for one INTP to handle KekOverall, these aren't very good typing questions. They focus on behaviors, when they should really try and understand a persons motivations and perceptions. I don't have one of those... ;-; 

*not yet* We're gonna paint each others nails and kill a man. Too deep for me bruh You won't be laughing if it's you. It sucks, haha. That familiar look of confusion and then "why did you even say that?" Or "that's not even relevant", and then no one lets you explain anyway. And people just looked annoyed you're even there. :c the best part is then a week later "you know, why don't you ever talk?". Lol. 

Thanks for at least validating some of. I'm sure you've helped a lot of ENxPs like that. REEEEEEEEEE. Sorry you said normies and the urge to ree overtook me. 

NEW WORLD ORDERI like yours. It's wonderful! 

*cause you're there* but i am le tired...Which other type subreddit? Or all of them? Lmao. ISTJs are the master race. I have no idea. Infp and infj subreddits are really weepy. I like the NTP, ISTJ, and sometimes INTJ subs. I don't know about INTPs, but I'm a female ENTP and I feel like I tend to overestimate people's negative or self-serving intentions. While I do tend to notice manipulative or other deceptive behaviors that others may not pick out, I also have misattributed the positive intentions of others to something more nefarious. I sort of read too much into it. p: 

I try to make a mental note and wait until I see something else now, and until then not assume. Trust, but verify. I've read either this link or a different link from your site before, but I think I actually pmed you once because I really enjoyed it. I dig sci-Fi and am writing a universe of my own.

I mostly used MBTI for characterization, and I greatly enjoy the way you assigned it to functions. By site I meant tumblr hahaha. Little bit different focuses but I love sci Fi so I enjoyed reading it a lot and think you have some really neat ideas. It fascinates me how many different perspectives a person can get on a setting. 

I'm an ENTP. C: my boyfriend and I write together and he's an INTP. I'd check out ESTJ and ISTJ. Look at some different descriptions. ST and SF types tend to not always get the most flattering descriptions but that's what your functions seem to indicate. Oh hahaha oops. I'm not sure about that. The ENTP sub looks spiffy, guess we just want to look nice and put together. We just both write sections and pieces, edit for each other, and so on. Right now our project isn't particularly linear, but it's a personal one so I'm not concerned. Just for fun!Si is an interesting function Id look into more. ISTJs in particular are perceivers. We actually had an ENTP retype as an ISFJ after reading some of the write ups on typeinmind.com. Si gets a really weird rap as being conservative, rigid, etc., when it can be incredibly abstract, resourceful and such in its own right, especially when it's combined with matured tert or inferior Ne. Reading your other post, you sound very ESTJ. Look up the Te-Si description (and possibly Si-Te) on typeinmind!Awwwww yeahhhhhhh. Yeah I'd love to! I like places, activities and experiences. Gift cards too. Or sometimes I like just practical gifts. ENTP. It would actually be due to Ne. Because Ne is so concept-focused, it doesn't really need people to soak in outside information, so the first extraverted function people see isn't all that visible. :3!Si is interesting. I think when I would say "extends to the future" it's more like... it uses the past and all of these experiences to approach the future with. Everyone has to look to the future at some point, and to me, I interpret it as what tools one is using to do so. 

It is by definition subjective and it is about the experiences one has had, so I don't think that's entirely wrong. I don't think we should be trying to level Si/Se to Ni/Ne, because you're right, they're not the same. I agree with the poster who said Se/Ne and Si/Ni are similar. They're kind of parallel in their approach but different in their targets, imo.I subvocalize a lot. I narrate a lot of what I'm doing and mouth words, although if I talk aloud while I'm trying to do something, I'll lose track. You sound rather ENTP to me. Possibly ENFP, but I'm getting more Ne-Fe. I'm hesitant to type others as ENTP, since I tend to pick up on Ne-vibes that might not be there. Someone else will hopefully come along and help you out. 

Is English not your native language? You describe yourself as fair and played on the EUNE LoL server, so I assume it's not, in which case I can't place much weight in writing style... i am totally normalINTPs are sweet potatoes deep down :cI'm feeling ISxJ here. Leaning ISFJ. :D Yay Si-doms. I think Si can still come across as quite abstract at times.When I say it... I guess I mean the idea of Si being a part of subjective experiences that one draws from... It's not really as "concrete"-seeming as Te and Se appear to me. Trade me It's okay I love you all ^entp ^i ^am ^basically ^trash, ^don't ^tradeIt's okay id rather be you. Really? I found Si to be rather evident, although I don't think INFJ is really off the mark at all. My father struggles to not leap to "fixing" every problem he comes across. Sometimes people need emotional validation first, and he forgets the feeling side of things and moves straight to solution mode, even if the other person is still processing. 

He's getting better with reminders. I think he is more Fe due to the chameleon behavior, and the heavier weight on analyzing people and behavior vs. theories and such, smoothing over conflict, as well as the enjoyment of teaching others. A lot of his interests seem to surround people and interpersonal relations. I'm dating an INTP and inferior (and even tert) Fe tend to be more apathetic/easily tired/averse to handling others and take less of an interest. 

I also noticed how he specifically mentioned navigating examples of things that have already been done for him to follow, predicting things that will happen (to me, I interpret as Si over Ni because I see it more as extrapolation of the concrete), and navigating complex bureaucracy and such. These all seem to touch on established systems and structures that he enjoys exploring and building on, which seems very Si to me. 

To me, Si-Fe-Ti-Ne makes the most sense. A weasel or ferret. Kind of adorable, annoying, and have a reputation for being wily. are we related Entps are filthy meme trash. Tbh if I could pick any type I'd pick ISTJ or ESTJ. noStop being trash, for one. 

Keep an organizer, make to-do lists, use alarms, take stimulants? Coffee? You do realize I'm being entirely facetious, right? I don't actually think ENTPs are trash, lol. It's about a coin flip whether I say something I find true or not. Otherwise, I'm just messing around .Good! Nope... I know exactly why. Maybe your friend just sucks. p: I take plenty of things seriously. There's a time and a place for everything. My boyfriend, so I'm just gonna gush. He's super intelligent, a bit awkward, loves RPGs and MtG, likes to write and is great at worldbuilding, super funny (and super punny), sweet as can be, very flexible and open-minded. Well, I'm sure you're aware, but you sound rather ENTP and I don't feel motivated enough to stalk you further. 

Also what colors do you play? I usually play EDH and run a UR nivvy-niv firemind :D This is a fair point. I guess OPs reliance on things that have been done before registers as more Si heavy to me, but I think this is probably best up to OP's interpretation at this point. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5chl2t/what_is_the_ni_doms_inner_world_like/

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5b4aht/what_is_the_si_doms_inner_world_like/

It looks like most of the debate is based on Si or Ni dom (although we could all be wrong, lol). Read through some of those comments and see if any leap out to you. Magic: the Gathering Thank you for this. I'm an ENTP woman and I almost exclusively date and hang around introverts. The rare ENFP maybe, but otherwise I just prefer them. They're much quieter, there's more balance, less arguing, and they tend to follow my lead. I'm not a huge fan of socializing, going places, etc, so I prefer the lifestyle of most introverts. Now I'm just aroused...INFJs in general I have never found intimidating. p: I will back the commenter who said their female INTJ is, because my BFF is one and wew lad. I love INTPs. I even snagged one for myself. :D And most of our friend group is IxTPs. I like the function sharing, plus inferior Fe makes for people who really aren't judgmental towards those who don't fit in well. My dad got ENTP for me on 25quiz, haha. He says "you're like me, but less organized and a little weirder". He's an ENTJ. ENTP, can confirm. I have to practically strangle myself to not correct people. Kindergarten was pretty rough last year :c I'm better about it now after I started dating my INTP. Holy shit, he does it and it fills me with rage, lol. Now it's making me more aware of when I do. I think that's why I love INTPs so much. The coldness, the rare emotional volatility, the awkwardness, the unintentional childlikeness, the general apathy followed by those specific trails of curiosity. :D 

My grandmother and my new work friend are both ESFJs and I kind of get you on them not appreciating the actual ideas but still meaning well, and I find them very pleasant to be around. The Ne-Ti rapport is one I desperately need in relationships, though.  Hahaha. Usually I do it if I'm directly discussing something with someone. If it's just someone talking, I'll bite my tongue unless I don't like them. I pretend I'm mature but it's all a dirty lie. Pretty much something like that. Dat classroom shutdown tho. I remember going home to my mom and looking something up and being so upset I was right and couldn't say so. Oh, you don't think you can? *Watch me.* 

Wait I thought you said you can't correct someone when they're not talking to you. LOL. God it's too early for this. I need to go back to bed, lol.We've always had a close relationship, so I think he just answered similarly for himself, minus questions that concern conscientiousness hahaha. YAYYYYY I definitely thought INxP for N until I reread his dialogue. Grey is not acceptable! The world will be black and white! Hello, Fi. My INTJ bestie does that omg. She sounds really focused and intense. 

I tend to look around everywhere, my phrases ramble, and I flap my hands around. 

My INTP rarely makes eye contact, unless he's about to correct someone LOLOL. I'd look at ISFJ. YO I LOVE HUNTING FOR WITCHES. That sick guitar tho. Flux and Banquet are up there too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEgX64n3T7g

Massive Attack - Paradise CircusI love Science by them. :3 Two Steps From Hell is great.Pretty much what my boyfriend calls it. Or the "Cheshire grin". It's just like he looks dead in your eyes and I know what's next: 

"Well, actually..." Hahaha I love that ISTJ look. 

INTPs always seem to not be making eye contact and are generally kind of hunched up from what I see. o: It needs to just work with me. Perfumes smell drastically different from wearer to wearer. I typically go either for vanillas, citruses, or sometimes sandalwood/pine-type scents. 

Otherwise I'd love to smell like kerosene. I had a conversation with my roommate and I got so frustrated. He's complaining about his job and it's physical labor and painful and stuff. So I'm like, I know someone, lie about an associates degree (he got through part of one), I'll vouch, you'll be fine. It's entry-level and roommate is smart, and I know that the guy hiring doesn't check anything. 

And he doesn't want to! Not just because of risk, but because it feels wrong to him. Like, it goes against his morals to lie his way into a job and cheat the system. I was seriously floored. Like, I can't imagine someone passing on a job that could make their life seriously better because getting that job would conflict with their morals? Why does it matter? It's just... baffling. 

I have no idea. I argued at first but I realized it was important to him so I dropped it. CANDLEJAINTP flaws: 

-So, so pedantic, to the point they sometimes don't see the forest for the trees

-Relish "victories" based on this pedantry, especially when they're backed into a corner and can't argue their way out

-Incredibly socially awkward

-Typically lazy

-The most WRONG, craziest leaps of logic I've ever heard have come from the mouths of INTPs. It's like they start with this nebulous premise and build their logic on it, without realizing they've created an entire castle made of sand. Watching that castle crumble is awe-inspiring, really. 

Of course, I love INTPs, so it's hard for me. :C Cuties. I like sandalwood and cedarwood a lot. And any kind of vanilla is good for me, except french. p: Yeah, it's way too sweet! I love vanilla musk and spiced vanillas tho. *-* that sounds delicioussss. It's so picky and pedantic sometimes. Not that I'm never guilty but still. It's not ridiculous and I'm not mocking him for it. I just don't understand it. SOMEONE IS WRONG AND I MUST CORRECT IT Hahahah. The urge is real. Nice breakdown.But I like the exhibitionism... I'm non-religious. I don't know what's up and I don't particularly care. I don't like organized religion, and I suppose if there's a God ready to smite me, so be it. p: Wait til you see what I do to you. heheheCause we can usually spot where they went wrong and it can be a bit irritating, especially if the INTP is question is stubborn about it. That's interesting. Maybe I've just had more practice but I'm pretty good at breaking down where things went wrong and sorting out the true from the untrue. Then again, I'm usually having to do that with more ambiguous topics with my INTP, like emotions or empathy. Sort of searching from foundation to conclusion and stopping at each point to look at possible variance p: 

Maybe I'm a secret INTP (8 except not. I do find that mine usually had researched more and I really only notice these wilder leaps when he's not got as much knowledge on the subject and it's more speculation- which he wouldn't share with anyone else of course. Maybe a form of selection bias, lol. I can't say I relate to the idea of not wanting things to come to a conclusion. I personally like to find the actual truth behind things, if there is one, which is why I get a bit annoying when I pick out flaws in the arguments and ideas of others. I like when things are able to become settled. Granted, I leave things with a "with the things I know, this is correct - to be checked if and when I obtain new information". 

I get irked more when it's a situation of "A is this, so that means X is true, so that's means Y is true..." When their premise of A is factually and probably wrong and the rest of the argument collapses on itself that way, if that makes sense. When it comes to things that can't be proven, I think I'm more about alternate perspectives and brainstorming in those cases. If an answer hinges on personal values, emotions, or other unmeasurables, things get fun. Otherwise, let it rest. P:

I have to admit I don't think I understand Fi in a personal context, nor Ni. I only get Fi from a third-person view when I watch my INFP roommate function. We are so fundamentally different, it's utterly bizarre. Ni is just alien. Oh, I think I get that in some form. Not sure which function. Like, you can't always discern the exact steps but you just kind of know/trust the process that's getting you there and you understand the feel/vibe in a way? I have to go and break those things down later- or at least it's fun to try! p: I don't understand being enraged at anything tho. That stood out to me lmao My fam is Italian, lol. I've hit a few stray people while gesticulating. I get downright hostile at work, lol. Mostly because I get super focused on whatever I'm doing and if I lose my flow I get piiiiiiissed. I have to reign in my irritation. 

After work I'm tired and don't want to talk. I believe you are an ESTJ or an ENTJ. 

I do feel like there's some Ne here. Those aren't really rulings in or out of Ni/Si, though I personally think you use Si and Ne, and I'm quite sure about Te, so that's where I get mine from. ENTJ isn't out of the realm of possibility, but I'm not so sure. Ive always found the T-F-S-N is fairly correct. But whatever you feel is most accurate is up to you motiv type - XOHWXRG

top 3 disorders: narcissistic, antisocial, schizotypal

enneagram: type 8 and 4. 

p: I'm actually enneagram 783/7w8I'm in a starter pack war right now, haha. To me, I recall past "memes" and jokes in our friend circle and what's basically the funniest, then associate it with a picture that makes the meaning obvious. 

I think they're hilarious, lol. I'm in marketing. It's dull. Who said they're most alike? Personally, I can't relate at all to Ni. I can hardly even explain it to others, it baffles me, lol. Fi and Se I understand on a hypothetical level, but not on a personal one. 

Ne and Se seem to run parallel to one another, while Ne and Si seem to operate similarly in different planes, if that makes sense. It's a start, but you may want to try answering some of the sidebar questions or adding more info. Basically, we would need to understand more about your perceptions, motivations, and priorities. What do you value? What's important? Behavior isn't enough, we need to know why, as two people using different functions could easy act in a similar way, but their driving factors may be entirely different. Yep! So much doxxing. I do it for fun but never anything malicious, and it would be so easy to do the same. Best game ever. Well... I thought there were questions 

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/search?q=Questions&amp;restrict_sr=on

Try these!Oh, it makes sense. Everything is asserted at some point, I just wasn't sure if your experience was a common assertion I had missed out on. 

Ne and Se are similar in the way that they sort of notice and connect and do, but one is more conceptual and the other is more present. Be and Si both seem to "spiderweb" and make connections and draw on other ideas/experiences, but one is oriented more forward and the other towards the past. I thought maybe ESFJ?

But honestly you seem quite ENFP to me. I would read up on the functions and check out all the ExFx types, but yeah, I'm getting the ENFP vibe haha. Happy to help! And I'm a girl, lol. EF is definitely where you are. Just explore and see what fits best! It's actually Ti- introverted thinking. IxTPs tend to seek out truth and you can always seek out other options. If they're both mentally ill then honestly it's probably bad luck. Cut off toxic friendships. Honestly... It doesn't matter if it's your or them. As long as you're okay with yourself at the end of the day. ISFP is Fi-Se-Ni-Te. 

ISFPs tend to lead with values and such. :c Losing friends sucks but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Kill them all Man, that escalated quickly. I guess red wine makes me murderous. Yeah, you're right. A lot of wine made my thoughts rather garbled. spicy like a pepperI can see the reasoning. INTP/ENTP... oh, you said productive. Oops. 

Productivity/interpersonal at once, gimme an ISTJ. Maybe an INTJ. &lt;3 Well, I still like you a lot. Even if that matters zero. It's okay, I'm not good at anything.Yech as long as it's lower-order. One time I told a girl wasabi was avocado and convinced her to eat the whole lump of it hehehehehHey, my boyfriend and I implement plenty of things! Like... Like...The spreadsheet was for our RPG characters, thank you very much. To be fair we still regularly update our stuff, lol. He's a great world-builder and I'm pretty good at character creation. Hehe. I'm not the best at keeping my worlds consistent, so i come up with ideas and he just refines them and makes sure the rules of the universe work out. 

He has good character ideas but for our writing, I definitely am more nuanced in creating personalities and relationships. I have not o:Cool, thanks!Woof, I woulda turned tail if I were him. You definitely were projecting someone else onto him, which is extremely hurtful. I've been guilty of the same thing before. You kinda messed up when you accused him of lying and stuff. 

To be fair, he should have texted you before a few days, lol. That would drive me bonkers, I'd be so salty. Although I'd send a text more like "I understand you're busy, but I have something to tell you. Do you have an estimate of when you may be available to talk?" so it's not as cornering. 

Lessons learned. I feel this way with my INTP. We nearly have our own language, lol, and we're up each other's ass constantly (metaphorically... or not (8 ) and chattering forever. I've taken quite a few, lol. It's definitely a case where you have to use the Ne for good. So you don't think of every horrible reason, but instead think of all kinds of benign possibilities. And just trust him a bit, and get a timeline. "Meme lord" right there with you 
I just want to hug them. 

Otherwise, I think of people who are stable, consistent, reliable, detailed, reserved, cautious, studious, funny, a bit snarky, maybe a little picky, perfectionistic, patient, blunt, low-key creative, resourceful. Just overall pretty neat. 

Jobs... Idk, mostly medical, research, science, management, finance and accounting, actuarial science, teaching, stuff like that. Appearances vary but I think it's a stats thing that has most of the ISTJs I've known to be brunettes, haha. 

The two I know closer to my age have sarcastic, dry senses of humor, but they do tend to respond to shock humor better than ISFJs - still a bit mortified, but also kind of think it's funny in an "omg I can't believe she said that!" way. These two are also kind of popular against their will, lmao. Like they don't want to go out somewhere but people want them around so they end up going anyway. 

Idk I like themIt's very possible he saw this, yeah. I would look into getting some counseling. Even an online service might give you someone to talk this through with. Otherwise, hobbies and restoring some self-confidence and self-reliance is your best bet. Thank god Oh yeah, I like this one! When I actually think I'm my type, lmao. Between the two, ENTP for sure. I couldn't imagine an INTP with that much energy and scatter, nor would I think they need to show their ideas off to people - you appear to prioritize your ideas. FWIW, I'm an ENTP with ADHD as well. 

ETA: Type doesn't change with mood or situation, it remains constant. So no, not an INTP. I love it &lt;3They are just so sweet and cute and omg. I'm drunk and INTP ARE THE CUTE. The intro and extroversion provide a nice balance- he sort of dissects all my ideas and I provide new ones. But we still get each other on this innate level. Buddy you caught me while drinking. You're getting a goddamn hug. But omg like ISTJs are so reliable and cute and I want to hug you all and they're all so cute and I love you all. Same. Wait. If it makes you feel better it's mostly manufactured on my end. :c I just mimic who I'm around, and I live in the deep South. Lots of pet names and hearty handshakes and occasional cheek-kissing (erch). Hahaha one of my last comments I called someone "buddy". I'm a girl and I use it sarcastically, usually when I'm about to make a self-deprecating joke. 

I usually call people dude. *you've lured them out for me, thank you*You reminded me I need to start following /r/redditlaqueristas again. That's quite an leap to make when we don't have any backstory. How do we know that they've done anything wrong? The Sheriff has shown that he's corrupt to some extent and willing to extort sex out of someone. Even if they did commit a crime, that's someone abusing a position of authority, which I think is extremely fucked up to do. You're kind of riding the assumption that they actually did something to get locked up, the Sheriff is trustworthy, and wouldn't do anything else shady, possibly? 

ETA: Then again I'm very mistrustful of authority."We would expect you to be a happy, well-balanced person who likes people and is liked by others. You question whether many conventional views on morality are valid under all circumstances.

Women: You will expect high standards from the men to whom you give your love."

Female ENTP. I chose Maid Marion, Little John, Robin Hood, The Sheriff. 

Maid Marion pretty much took one for the team to get them out, and possibly knew she might get some shit for it. I see no problem with what she did, I personally would have done the same in a heartbeat. I question her choices in boyfriend, though. If I had an SO who did this for me, I would be super grateful and made sure they got some counseling with, since it was probably an ordeal for them too. 

Little John is decent. I like that he actively stood up for her against his friend - a lot of people won't always do that. I think the only thing I'd say is that he could be interpreted as a little opportunistic, but I'd need more information. 

Robin is a shit. Like, if you REALLY are pissed that you got freed from fuckin jail and can't overlook that, then fine. But don't abuse her for it when she put herself in such an ugly position to help your ungrateful ass. Goddamn. 

The Sheriff. Alright, this fucker. I have a serious problem with those who exploit positions of power and the dynamics that come with. He has a job, he's supposed to serve his community and local government, and is not supposed to be extorting sex out of people. It's an abuse of authority.

The Sheriff also brings up another question: If he's already shown himself to be corrupt, do we know that the other three even committed a crime? He had no qualms about using her, and I don't think it would be a stretch to question the judicial process here. Even if they did, I'd still order it like this, but if there wasn't even a crime, then the Sheriff is the worst kind of person. I kinda feel the same, lol. Lots of projecting onto Marion here.I would be questioning everything that a corrupt Sheriff does. The test says not to assume anything about them, so how do we know they were supposed to be in a max-security dungeon in the first place? 

*shudder*Same as you p:Well, that would be silly to think.Lol... Not really, no. I guess it depends. If they did commit a crime to get in there, then the Sheriff either a) holds up his end, and released criminals cause he got a nut or b) lied to her. Lmao. If no crime was committed, that makes it worse imo. Typing styles are interesting. I use a LOT of ellipses, it sort of mimics how I talk IRL. Lots of trailing off and pausing. Mine was Marian, John, Robin, then the Sheriff, lol. We might have some fundamental differences because I never assume that authority is for our best interest/isn't corrupt. Coming into the situation, I already can see the Sheriff is doing something highly unethical and selfish, so that already lowers the threshold I have for believing he's honest and good. We don't know if he locked them up for no reason, but to assume he does and excuse his actions we do know of would be irresponsible, imo. 

I don't think the Sheriff is fit for his position. If we go your way and say they're criminals, that means he did let potentially dangerous people back out for a nut, while sexually coercing an innocent woman... If not, he's still shitty, so no matter which way I slice it, he jumps to the bottom of my list. 

Robin is also a shitbird, so he's just there cause of that. John seems opportunistic, but hasn't done anything harmful, per se, and it was good of him to defend Marian to his friend. I could see the argument for Marian not allowing Robin and John to stay in jail making her not very moral, assuming they deserve to be there, but man, I'm just questioning this whole political system there... p: Maybe so, but in his case, both options imply a moral failing somewhere- just a different one. Even if it did slightly improve his moral standing, he still would fall to last for me. If we follow the assumption that they did break the law and Robin's abuse was physical, then he must have done something quite terrible and potentially violent to be in a maximum security dungeon. However, the Sheriff sexually extorted an innocent woman, and then decided to let the criminals back into society cause he got his dick wet. 

It's possibly you're weighing their morality like a scale, so Robin is worst because he has no positives. While the Sheriff has a positive (following through), the result of keeping his word means that he's put his community at risk again. I also weight immoral actions a bit different, as the Sheriff is in a position of authority. He's expected to be upstanding, honest, good, and to keep the community safe, and he betrayed that trust. To me, his actions and his character pose a larger overall threat and so I essentially add a multiplier for that. They're both complete shitheads, but I place Robin slightly ahead for these reasons. Guess we agree to disagree, especially since we can't make assumptions. I simply quantify my judgments differently. Hell, we don't even know they committed a crime at all. I simply think what the sheriff did is worse, because I don't value him keeping his word in this situation. Those don't guarantee you're an N type. Check out the function guide on the sidebar. Like I said, I still weight the things he did more heavily. I could write an equation and it would be quantified, but the values I assign won't match yours. No one is taking away his rights, as in free speech- this exercise is entirely about passing a subjective judgment and examining where it comes from and how it compares. You and I use different measures. I just don't see him keeping his word as a big deal. I wouldn't commend someone for not backing of a corrupt deal, while also releasing criminals lmao. Like, congrats you went through with sexual extortion and abuse of your role? It's good he's consistent, I suppose, but by keeping his word he still broke a law. Do you have a grasp on the functions? You just need those to really type yourself, because it's not broken down into N and S. I would possibly try the keys2cognition test. There's a few functions tests out there. Actually, a good one is typeinmind.com/quiz I think, it uses the password "personality". That should give you a start. I just see more grey in those things, I suppose. Him keeping his word matters in the way that yes, apparently he's honest... But it really just pales in comparison. His keeping his word also resulted in a negative result that wouldn't have occurred if he'd backed out. So it seems to trade one for the other. 1. He is honest, and breaks the law and further endangers his community or 2. He lies, but doesn't undo the previous justice. That's why it doesn't play much of a role here for me. 

And to me, yes. Like I said, I have a sore spot for an abuse of power/authority. Guy is a community leader and has been trusted by others to uphold certain standards. He also has more power than the average person, so moral failings on his end have a greater significance on a community as a whole IMO. I think there is a greater potential for negative consequence, which is why I judge him more harshly. Since when does a theoretical discussion need to be black and white? Even if he didn't endanger the community, by keeping his word he is still trading men's freedoms for sex and demonstrating his corruption. 

I will personally assess risk by influence and other contextual factors. The same crimes can be judged differently depending on the person and situation, the same person can be judged differently depending on their situation. The Sheriff's moral failings simply outweigh Robin's IMO. 

Robin: 

-abused his girlfriend 

-was ungrateful 

-potentially committed a crime 


The Sheriff: 

-abused his power

-coerced a woman into sex

-knowing she was in a relationship

-released criminals and traded their freedom for sex

However, he did hold his end of the bargain. If that cancels out a wrongdoing, you still leave them about 3 for 3, depending on how you count their transgressions. 

Ultimately, his keeping his word doesn't mean anything to me because by keeping it, he did something else unethical. Guess I'm infp now! Maybe. p: Lol. The only functions I don't question in myself are my lack of Fi and Ni/presence of Ne hahah. Shut the fuck up. 

Kidding, my roommate is an INFP. He and I get along really well, even if we sometimes don't understand each other. p: He thinks I'm morally lax/wishy-washy, I think he's stubborn. Except those bullet points would differ. If he didn't hold his end of the bargain, those bullet points would change to: 

-Coerced a woman into sex

-Lied about his deal to Marian

-Abuse of authority

Those are all separate layers and all failings within themselves. You can coerce without authority, you can abuse your authority without it being sexual, you can extort sex without releasing criminals. He did all of these things in one act, but they are extra layers that make it increasingly worse as you add more of these attributes. 

If we want to make this entirely reductive, we could bring it purely to facts: 

-we know Robin abused Marian

-we know he called her a slut

-we know the Sheriff coerced her into sex

-we know he abused his authority to do this

-We know he kept his word

-we know he released prisoners

However, we don't know: 

-If Robin's abuse was physical

-If Robin even committed a crime at all

-If they were dangerous, and how dangerous they were

Even here, they come out about even. Ultimately, because his honesty was a part of a corrupt deal, it doesn't really add anything to his favor in my eyes. I don't see anything noble about it, and keeping his word required another failure in doing the job he's supposed to do. I'm going to agree with ISFJ, that's the first type I thought of. Clearly we don't agree on this subject. So you wouldn't marry for any of the civil/legal benefits? Or just wouldn't have a wedding at all? Or would you do another alternative? Just curious. Hahaha I thought I was an INTJ and I turned out to be a stressed out ENTP. 

I don't like the idea of diamonds. I don't like the violence and slavery behind them, the fact that they're expensive due to a marketing campaign, and it just isn't practical. I do like moissanite - I love sparkly stuff, I like that it's lab-made (SCIENCE), and it's prettier IMO. The only diamond I'd wear would be an heirloom or something secondhand. 

It's kind of odd to see women fetishizing weddings, like... They have the wedding planned out, but are just waiting for a spouse to plop into the scenario, lmao. I have an INTP too! :D Congrats!

My parents had a ridiculously cool wedding, and I know they'll want the same for me. I would prefer something small - a ceremony at the boathouse where I spent most of my college years over the lake, and then a nice dinner. I'm pretty sure I could get my ceremony venue for free/reduced price since I coached there... 

That's so cool, though! I'm glad the night was fun, but I'm a terrible planner, so it sounds stressful. I told my parents if they want me to have a bigger wedding they can pay for it and organize it themselves and I'll show up. Who knows? Maybe you will, maybe you won't. And no one even has to get married p: Everyone has drastically different opinions. There are some really neat rings. I wouldn't want anything huge. Actually, I'd want a moissanite version of my stepmother's - princess cut, thin band, simple with some sparkle. p: There are tons of options. Black diamonds, lab-created stones, and so on. 

Man, if I were you I'd elope, then invite people out to a dinner and be like "yo we got married btw" hahaha. Although your mom might actually die...I like that men's rings are getting a bit more unique. I like the thin bands. p: I would do a secular, outdoor wedding as well. Congratulations! 

Hahaha I like the profile picture change. Subtle. But at least you didn't have to deal with all the people and the chaos of planning. I've always heard the planning is the worst part of it. That's a gorgeous ring. I like Etsy a lot. Lots of alternative stones, typically cheaper, can find antiques and such. Many mainstream rings are ridiculous in price. Austin TX or MN? Used to live in the latter. A custom ring sounds amazing. Is it the whole marriage deal you dislike or just the expenses and energy that go into weddings themselves? That sounds beautiful. C: I like sentimental stuff too. I'd either want something custom made, or something resembling my stepmother's ring. She's actually an Italian immigrant too, so I'm sure we'll have similar traditions haha. 

That sounds like a huge and unique wedding but I'm sure it'll be fun. I hope all goes well for you. :3 Sensible. Amazon really does have everything.Me too. I definitely want something special and not expensive. Just durable, mostly, because if it broke I'd lose my mind. I love the rose gold and her ring is beautiful, it's just fucking massive lmao. I can't imagine how much it cost... 

I have a Pinterest, but mostly I just love dresses and sparkly stuff so it's nice to look at. My parents get too enthusiastic about "helping" haha. Fair enough. It definitely shouldn't just be "the next step", which is how my INFP roommate ended up divorced lmao. I'm not sure, you'd have to check your state, although I believe if you enter a common law marriage you'd have to get divorced similarly. Don't quote me on that though. Domestic partnerships and civil unions are available in some states as well. 

Anything that can allow for tax breaks, estate planning, medical, etc. would probably do the trick, but I guess that's why you have to have divorce in the first place. Clearly just a bit... That's quite a generalization you have going on there. 

Realistically, if there were ever a time to marry for love and not for status or money, it would be now. Women are more financially independent and mobile, fewer people marry, couples wait longer on average, and divorce rates are actually lower than they've been since the 70s. Times are gone when a woman has to be married to afford to live and has to rely on a man for cash. heheehehAww. That's actually adorable. I'm with an INTP and we're headed that way. It seems odd for an ENTP, but I relate to "throwing Si a bone" when I think about that kind of tradition and stability and love all in one. I don't love planning out details so I wouldn't want to have a huge one without help, but I think it would be very nice. 

I'm not religious and neither is he, but I think we've got similar feelings to you, you just articulated them a bit better lmao. Settling down with someone and having adventures with them sounds kinda nice tbh. Technically you don't have to kiss, lol. Maybe an elopement might be your best option. I've had a couple friends who eloped and then had a small party later for everyone to come to. Yeah, maybe immediate family or something haha. I would be okay with like 30 ish (I have a huge family haha) for the ceremony, then a party afterward, since realistically my parents will probably like manhandle the entire event from me. Family of Te/Fe-Se extroverts, lmao. The nice thing about a wedding and marriage is you can do whatever you want. Seconding online jewelry haha, it's sooooo much cheaper. Srsly I can't fathom spending 5-10k on a ring goddamn. A few hundred for something nice and durable, with a bit of sparkle for me :D 

A holiday wedding sounds amazing. Fits the season so well, really. Congrats again! :DHaha, I feel the same about my INTP. Don't want him to be boyfriend forever. p: 

I think there's a common theme here with the introverts and small, private weddings. I like the idea of a small, intimate ceremony, and a fun party for others :D I love unique rings, antique rings, lab gems, colored stones... I think they're more cost-effective and I enjoy the uniqueness. I think it's becoming more common to elope or have non-traditional ceremonies. I have to ask, though, why is it infuriating if somebody else wants to celebrate that way?Not if they're kinky messesIt meWith my maturity level?????

Yeah you're probably right. NEVERWhat real world????I'm not sure if I avoided a hangover or if I'm still drunk. I might die tho tbh *bbbllarrrgjffhh* 

Lmao apparently my coworker kissed me and I gave a cute trumpet player my number. Git güd. If only I remembered it all! Just gonna eat bagels instead If I don't care, I /really/ don't care, lol. At work right now, I'm wearing black yoga pants, two mismatched socks (one red fuzzy socks, one colorful argyle), and a VS pink sweater. Sometimes it's pajamas, sweats, mismatched clothes, etc. 

If I do care, I usually go bright or jewel colors, rarely patterns, interesting cuts, etc. Still comfortable (I don't wear jeans - always legging pants from uniqlo), but much more appropriate. If I'm going somewhere nice, it's gold (sequins and glitter ftw). 

I also have a lot of novelty items: cat leggings, light-up LED shoes and sunglasses, and stuff like that. My god, my female INTJ friend is all dark wash jeans, plaid button downs, occasionally sweaters, mostly solid colors like eggplant, navy, grey, and black. She's always elegant but never too out there. Then I show up with my light-up shoes. I'd say so. I agree with many social justice causes (support for gay and transgender rights, BLM and general racism, abortion rights, etc.), but I would say I do so because I and my friends fall into a number of groups that benefit. Two of my best friends are transgender, myself and like 90% of my group are gay or bi, boyfriend is Filipino, etc.

I care about these people, so my regular apathy/edgy humor is toned down drastically and I want to see things improve for them, so I help when I can and provide support. I can safely say I'm a solid resource and have helped my best friend transition (and will likely be guiding my other friend while she does  so), find therapy, connect with other LGTBQ people, and so on. 

I'd like to say if I had a different group of friends that I'd still be as passionate, honestly, but I probably wouldn't because apathy is a default state. But it is what it is. INTP or ISFJ. Feelin similarly to Twenty-Pikachus.Hell yeah they are. She always makes fun of me but says I can pull it off. IDGAF I like being lit up. It seems like ISFJs need a strong reason to question their beliefs, whereas INTPs would need a strong reason to believe. As a general, not a whole. Woo, Ne! :D Thanks for the awesome Ti description.I think I recently said that I'm almost never certain about anything in a comment, lol. I always say that my "certainty" threshold is 85-90%.I sort of use an amalgamation of quadra, personal observation, relationships with those of other types, comparison, questioning, temperament, and such IRL when I type people. I'm rarely wrong, and when I am now, it's usually intro vs. extroversion.  Maybe! It's a fantastic description, sidebar-worthy if we could get similar quality ones up for the other functions. Ne is so much fun and seems to synthesize so much at once, similar to a spiderweb. That's how I visualize it, anyway. p: I have a type crisis like every other week, although I usually only waver between 2-3 types now. ENTP, INTP, ESTJ. p: Although the latter two are a pretty far margin.Looking through their post history, I have to say I agree. Not sure about I or E, but OP, if you think you could be an extrovert, then between the two you're an ENTP. p: IRAESC

27%, 22%, and 20% for my first three. :c I like artistic work to an extent, but I really like problem solving. The field is less important than what I'm actually doing. My current job is quite dull. My boss is an ENTP, though, and at least tries to give me other projects when he notices me becoming antsy. Hooray, another ENTP! Mine seem quite fitting. I wish I'd gone into programming or computer science or something. This is kinda boring to me. Or even medical! I know it's not too late, but still. Meh. ENTPs specifically are often 7s and 3s, ENFPs as well (although less commonly 3s, more commonly 4s).Thank God I'm not an introvert, I already have my own roster of mental issues. That's how that works, right? Nailed it. I developed a female ENTP :D Am also ENTP. What type are you? I can answer questions if you want!BRING ME FOOD 

Really, I'm hungry. Hahaha what makes you say that?Maybe it is LOL! I have like 2 plaid items p: I prefer solids. The shoes are on Amazon!Possibly. My SO is INTP and was raised in a pretty strict, Asian household that's pretty Si- and Te-heavy. I think he's definitely got more developed Si than normal. If Ti weren't so apparent, I'd think he was an ISTJ. 

On the other hand, I was raised almost exclusively by parents with Se, haha (ISTP, ESTP, ESFP, ENTJ). Don't know if that correlates with anything, but hey. Ne-dom, can confirm. Then again, I have a bunch of mental issues, I used to be a maladaptive daydreamer, so I'm not sure about the other Ne types. By the summary you gave, I would actually be neutral-leaning-Law. In DnD terms, I'm pretty solidly chaotic neutral. Probably Ne, tbh. It's pretty conceptual in nature. Possibly. I know my SO (INTP) is dismissive of "Se" type materialism and experiences, like "oh not intellectual pth-ooey!" thing, haha. I think I inherited a bit of their materialism, and they are materialistic. Not to anyone's detriment, but I can definitely appreciate nice things. sameOh god, I do that. Someone seems to have an edge to their tone directed anywhere and I'm like WAIT WHY ARE YOU UPSET ??????? Lmao. *raises hand* 

Definitely don't care to be important whatsoever. Just adding a data point. Yeah... I'm glad you do, anyway. More useful. ISTJ or INTJ for me p:I wouldn't know, but at first glance, I would guess ISFP or ESFP. 

As an Ne-dom, I kind of have an Ne radar thing. p: I can really quickly identify someone with Ne in their top two functions IRL. On a physical level: A sort of flightiness when talking, kind of a thousand-yard stare like they're focused somewhere beyond you but not on anything in particular. Varied speaking speeds, they sort of speed up and slow down and don't often think all the way through before they talk.

Ne-users tend to have conversations that (if uninterrupted) seem to go off-tangent and then often wrap back around to connect to the original point in some esoteric fashion. They can usually identify the links between the subjects if you ask - they aren't "random" even if that's the stereotype. 

I have a harder time with Se unless it's REALLY obvious (like my ESFP mom or ESTP stepmom). My stepmother is such a blatant stereotype of ESTP that it's comical. She's intelligent, a very successful salesperson, a great hostess, always has a house project going on, always has some goal for her physical looks, she's a tad bit vain/materialistic, always jumping on high-end fashion brands and fancy new items (she just got an Aston Martin for herself, Christ almighty), super independent. Like... ESTP as fuck, hahaha. I can catch those Se-users (who couldn't?) but more subtle examples, not so much. Good face examples. I can see similar effects with my INTJ bestie and I. She always looks very :|, maybe a bit stern or mildly concerned, I always look like I've just gone and done something wrong and I'm trying not to laugh about it. I can't hold a straight face even if I'm telling the truth, lmao. She's more of o_o and I'm like 8) 

I'm diggin ur Ne m8My heart is quite cold and dead. This is why I fill it with memes - to give the impression of life and humanity. welcomeExactly. People can't tell the difference!My boyfriend is INTP and is surprisingly good. My INFP roommate used to play to make rent when he had a group in his home state, and he rarely lost. Idk how to poker. 

Otherwise I'd imagine STPs. I laugh at everything, I'm an easy targetSounds certainly more Se- although they move quickly, I find Se users to be a bit more grounded and earthier. I've always noticed ESxPs to be VERY extroverted, especially ESFPs. Lots of talking, flitting around, etc. ISFPs tend to need a little push to get going, like a build in momentum. Seems pretty ISFP to me, vs. ESFP.http://i.imgur.com/HRciA0v.jpg

22, female, ENTP. Drew my own cause didn't want to print. 

TL;DR:

10: happy, smol, likes computers and reading, smart nugget

13: happy, does swimming, obsessed with dragons and Anne McCaffrey, learning to do HTML/CSS due to obsession with Neopets. 

16: OCD kicked into overdrive. Mentally unstable, scraped out of HS, played MMOs a lot, worked on art, depressed and anxious af

Now (22): still anxious and depressed, got dx'd with a life-threatening autoimmune illness, barely got out of uni intact, got a grownup job. Learning to program, getting back into art. 

Attempting to get life on track. This was depressing to do, I don't think I've been happy since I was 14-15. Yeah, I know three or four and none of them enjoy metal. Nor do any of the ISTPs I know, actually. They typically enjoy electronica, hip hop, or alt. rock/indie stuff. ENTP dating an INTP, we're peas in a pod. I'm just louder. Ikr? I got obsessed, made my own site and then offered code on it for people, started learning javascript. RIP. I'm hoping I can still find similar satisfaction from coding today. ENTP

Female

Anything but sitting properly upright. I sit with my feet up or cross-legged in my chair, or on the floor. 

If I'm idle: I walk pretty slowly, I usually am looking off somewhere with a glazed over look, some serious thousand yard stare going on. I usually look completely placid and gone. I usually miss people talking to me and say a lot of "huh?" "pardon?".

If I have a mission: I'm speedwalking, I look really worried or confused, and my hands are kind of up around me like I'm about to grab something out of the air. I speak really quickly and jump around mid-sentence.

If someone stopped me where I work, if it's not an admin, then I would probably just ignore them, if my badge is on hand I'd flash it, but I wouldn't stop for them. An admin or my manager can talk to me, I don't really care about anyone else's comfort. &gt;Straighter than I am.

*wink*My roommate is INFP and we have the weirdest clashes. We'll have debates about morals and politics and just cannot seem to relate based on Fe and Fi; it's why I'm certain Fi is just not in my stack. It's jarring. It definitely can manifest as idealism, although in my roommate's case, it's bitter cynicism that the world is a shit place and things are not as they should be. He just has these ideas of things that are "right" and "wrong" and I'm like idk dude. 

We had a discussion about being a world leader and I was like honestly, I would have to be a puppet leader because I couldn't make a damn decision on my own, whereas he has a laundry lists of things that should happen. hope i don't lose or become unable to afford insuranceI think I mostly have a 60-40 indica strain rn, and I have definitely joked "baby, I'm a sensor!" lmao. It's nice, my brain mostly turns off and I can just enjoy how things taste and feel instead of always being anxious about whatever useless shit. Dva, but replace all dialogue with the script of the Bee movieYou can design your own pet pages and userlookups and could get pretty damn fancy with it, so I started learning p: My memes hide my shell of an existence :'D what if I like the creepy hugs (8 

I appreciate it tho. I hope doing the things I enjoyed as a kid might help bring back even a little of the happiness. You cruised pretty closely to mine. I had an edgelord atheist know it all phase too!*mmmmmmm slurp*

I had my breakdown as a teen, and I was never quite right since. Ive had OCD since I was a small child and my childhood was stressful, but I was happy in my own head. Now I don't have there. But maybe things can change. For someone who speaks really darkly, I'm quite optimistic. Oh it's you! :D hahaha. I once tracked down a childhood crush from 17 years ago, so no, it's hard to creep me out. Lots of therapy and medication. Life gave me a beating up until his year. Agreed, I can't stand that type of manipulation, although tbh my ISFJ relative does it way more than ESFJ. The ESFJ just asks really politely. I can't stand passive-aggression and it immediately rubs me the wrong way. I think I also naturally see Fe as a little shady, since if I am actively employing Fe, it's probably for shady purposes. 

With my roommate, it's just terse texts. 

ENTP: Dude your kid ate my food. 

INFP: Sorry bro, I'll pick up some more. 

ENTP: kk thanksShit... I never knew. This is why I don't use dishes. This is also why I can't really call myself an adult. Laughing at this post because my INFP roommate can roast with the best of them. SO much stereotyping of INFPs as whiny sensitive crybabies. If I tried to roast my roommate it would turn into war. Not really. I use MBTI as more of a way to understand others. "Why are they acting like this? What's a better way to get across to them? How should I tailor my message?" and to communicate myself better. It helps me understand my needs and helps me approach self-improvement more effectively. No use pretending I'm an ENFJ when I can hardly socialize.You're assuming I have common sense. I am lacking a LOT of adult skills and processes. I don't know how I've made it this far. Thanks p: pretty scribbly but I do enjoy drawing a lot. ENTP is decent. Lots of interesting topics and links, quizzes, discussions, the occasional lolcow...Depends on age/maturity. The immature ones are infuriating, the more mature ones are really interesting. trooYou pretty much nailed this spot on. I'm not particularly interested IN people. If I find them interesting, Fe definitely acts like "just enough" to keep them moving, and if not, I glaze over while doing the bare minimum to not offend. 

Do you find yourself to be rather sensitive? I actually am, especially in the past year or so. I find myself feeling a lot more sympathy for people and really taking care to look at things from their perspective. Perhaps I'm a secret ISFJ after all, lol. Interesting. I would say the opposite. I'm almost never happy with whatever I do, so I figure I won't love a job regardless. With people, it's SO hard for me to find a real connection, even platonically, so I hold onto the ones I do have. 

If there was a guarantee of a job that could make and keep me happy and satisfied, I might give love up. But I don't think I'm capable of contentment. I'm pretty much the INTP. 

"This actor was in !!" 

"Did you know that when they filmed this..." 

I don't take people up on movie invites because of this. Except for my boyfriend cause he's an INTP and we just exchange trivia about it. I think sensitive can mean a few things, although I see what you mean. I cry a TON lmao. I'm definitely sensitive in a way. I'm quite sensitive if I feel like my competence or intelligence is being attacked, if I'm being shut down really hard (like my ideas and stuff). If someone attacks my ideas and insults them in a really harsh way that is obviously not constructive, I'm super touchy and/or hurt, depending on who is doing it. 

If I see someone else super sad or upset, I'm really sad about that. Like, I don't cry because I feel what they are feeling I guess, but I cry if I see someone I care about in despair, or at least get emotional/want to help. It's hard to see someone really angry or upset, it really messes my vibe up. Lol, I'm definitely more sympathetic than empathetic. Crying is just a mode of affect and doesn't necessitate the source or motivation. And Fe and Fi are both capable of empathy, but my values and sense of self lean far more towards Fe than Fi. Group values and harmony, the way others view me, flexibility of my own principles, and the fact that most of my social issues stem from wanting to belong, to fit in, and struggling to relax and act like myself instead of automatically camouflaging. 

I am a girl, haha. Probably from age 13-17 I had a severe lack of sympathy or empathy, rarely cried, was quite cruel in general. Many antisocial/sociopathic traits; I know my parents and teachers were rather concerned. I used to always express myself via anger and vindictiveness, and with a lot of therapy I'm completely the opposite. 

Now I just have a really low threshold for tears. Like, most people cry when their emotions are at a high, but I can be mildly frustrated or see a dead animal or think about oceans for too long and start crying. So maybe I have leaky eyes, haha. Sometimes my eyes start welling up for no reason; I look more sad than I actually am. I actually would say I cry more when I'm frustrated than sad. 

I guess when I say criticism, it's more harsh insulting, especially when it comes to my ideas or thought processes, and it's even worse when I'm given a chance to explain myself and how I came to a conclusion. That'll get me furiously frustrated in a heartbeat, but unfortunately I tear up LOL. I happily welcome anyone who can improve my ideas or spar with me, as iron sharpens iron and all. p: I feel hurt when I'm rejected or if I find out someone doesn't like me when I thought they did. :c That always hurts. This is SO relevant to my life right now tbh. I've been chronically unhappy for years, for very valid reasons that I can't control, but one thing that's been helping is going back to the start. I get anxiety thinking about all the things I have to do, all the ways they could go wrong or right, all the opportunities I might have to sacrifice, and then getting analysis paralysis while I interpret. 

When I was little, I loved HTML/CSS coding, Pokemon, MMOs, sci-fi, and drawing. I've moved through so many hobbies and had so many ideas, but now I recently realized that I'm back there - learning Python, playing Sun and Moon, GW2, got a new tablet for my art as I take it more seriously... I'm not really happy, but I'm better off by going back to those hobbies that I know and love. 



Crying can be a response to almost anything. Frustration and anger, sadness, joy, tickling, allergies, fear, shock, stress, beauty, vulnerability... Crying can also be contagious a la yawning LOL. We can't really use crying as a measure of Fe or Fi, honestly. 

I do think you're putting too much weight on Fe and Fi and the way they tie into what we are able feel - they aren't sympathy and empathy, even if on the whole one might correlate with a function. Fe and Fi as a whole don't have much difference in the array of emotions we experience, but more about our values and ethics. In terms of emotion, Fx is more about how it's oriented and prioritized, NOT whether we feel it or not.  

If anything, Fe-users are actually known pretty universally for being MORE expressive than Fi-users, not less. p: Fi users prioritize the way they feel, Fe users tend not to. That doesn't change the actual emotions they feel or why they feel them, just the way they express them and how important they are vs. how important the feelings of others are. So, I'm not sure what we are arguing here or if I'm misunderstanding you. I'm pretty tired, so that's a possibility p:. For the sake of context, let's say Fe = sympathy, Fi = empathy, for the most part. You're saying that crying because of somebody being in a bad spot is Fi due to empathy, but maybe I'm splitting hairs when I say that crying/sensitivity as an Fi trait is only really an Fi trait if the sensitivity and subsequent reactions are rooted in empathy. That doesn't just mean reacting to somebody else's emotions; for it to be empathy, the critical step of being in another's shoes and experiencing their emotions must be present.  I suppose what I'm taking issue with (again, thinking as I type) is: "To me being sensitive means being empathetic, which means that you're actually touched/moved by the things you see/experience." 

I think that's where I differ from you, as I don't believe sensitivity is equivalent to empathy. Sensitivity is merely a heightened response to stimuli, whether physical or emotional. I think appending "you're actually touched/moved by the things you see/experience" to sensitivity gives it a different meaning that doesn't quite belong there. In fact, I'd argue that even being touched or moved isn't necessarily empathy (although empathy can consist of being emotionally moved - a square/rectangle deal?). Using the traditional definition of sensitivity, I would argue I'm emotionally sensitive, as I tend to become more expressive at a lower threshold when there is a stressor or other stimulus. Using your interpretation (saying that empathy is involved), I don't think I would consider myself sensitive. I guess this is why semantics end up being important at times. p: Actually, I'll pose a question to you in a bit because a thought just struck me but if I stop now, I'll lose the rest of it.   

I do agree that Fe and Fi users are often sensitive to different stimuli. I'd take it a step further and say that Fe and Fi users might be sensitive to the same stimuli but for different underlying reasons, which I think you are also trying to clarify. There are some inconsistencies, such as when you say Fe can't handle conflicts and feeling useless, and Fi can't handle suffering and personal attacks. I would try to break this down a little further (due to the overlap in "personal attacks" and "conflict", since one can be the other and I love to be specific) and say that Fi struggles with personal attacks that target the user's character, moral judgment, and possibly worldview - all things that are very personal and thus, are prioritized by Fi. For Fe, I would think that a personal attack regarding their ability to help others, mitigate conflict, or on social prowess might be more painful for them to deal with, along with a social rejection, 'cause again, values. I think conflict in general stresses both out for different reasons - I know that getting into heated arguments or watching loved ones at it completely messes up my atmosphere. Unless I instigated it. :D  

(To clarify, I'm really not trying to argue with you at this point since I don't think you're necessarily wrong and your logic adds up. I don't think I'm making many points you haven't made or that directly oppose yours; I'm more pointing out where I find confusion or inconsistencies and offering discussion fodder.) 

&gt;"Very strong Fe users won't lose their composure when they see someone in distress. They will just be drawn to it and help. Empathy is what makes you "shocked" and upset when witnessing pain. You don't know what to do anymore because you put yourself in their shoes and you're paralyzed and can actually share that pain and feel it yourself."

I think this is another case of making a leap/adding on context that wouldn't necessarily belong there. Shocked and upset when witnessing pain doesn't belong to empathy or sympathy in particular. I think reacting to the pain of another is a shared ground for Fx and the real question concerns more why they react than how. When you add on the "you don't know what to do anymore" and the bit about sharing pain, you're defining empathy and attaching it to a reaction that doesn't always go hand-in-hand with it. "Shocked and upset" can stem from a variety of places, only when empathy is added on does it become an Fi trait. Just for your consideration.

Funny about poker. My INFP roommate and INTP boyfriend are both fantastic at poker, lol. But with crying, the only reason that I bring up all those varying reasons is because it's mostly a pressure valve and another reaction to stimulus - more of a human/biological thing, and I think the Fi/Fe distinction comes from the reason for the reaction to the given stimulus. Nothing you don't know, but sometimes I am making connections and expect people to understand why I think it's relevant without actually offering any reasons. Not sure where I was actually going with that one, tbh. 3:

About SJWs... I won't argue that Fi-doms can make great ones, but I wouldn't exclude Fe users, hehe. To some I could lean SJW, I'm quite left with my views, especially socially. I was actually discussing this with my roommate recently. It's bizarre to talk to him (and similarly with a good friend, who's an ENFP), as both have this innate sense of what is "right" and base a lot of what they do around what feels good to them, and how they feel having to live with themselves and the decisions they make. 

That feeling is very foreign to me, as when I go "SJW" on somebody, it's usually in defense of people I care about. I fully admit that if I weren't part of a marginalized group or close to people who are, I would probably not care nearly as much. The questions I ask myself are not "how will I feel about myself?", but "how would others think of me". Then again, I'm also way more open-minded to other points of view - not solely due to Fe (I'm sure Ne is at play there), but I think there is an aspect of me that doesn't feel obligated to stay true to myself. I feel more comfortable wading into ethically murky waters, though that's probably more ENTP than Fe. 

Protecting feelings can once again be attributed to either function - is it the right thing to do? Or does it make others feel better and keep the peace? Which is the priority, and why? Maybe keeping the peace could be a value or belief of an Fi user, even. Assessing the motivation behind the behaviors we're trying to ascribe is really the only way to tell the differences between functions.

OH. For the question I mentioned earlier - you mentioned "[Fe is] sympathy/compassion/pity, but not empathy". I was looking up the difference to refresh myself. I agree with you that sympathy, pity, and compassion all skew towards Fe, as they are about acknowledging and feeling for someone else's plight, with varying levels of involvement. 

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201505/empathy-vs-sympathy

http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/351877/difference-between-compassion-sympathy-empathy-pity-altruism-care-and-love

According to some of these, compassion seems to be an extension of/include empathy. The former article says: "Compassion (‘suffering with’) is more engaged than simple empathy, and is associated with an active desire to alleviate the suffering of its object. With empathy, I share your emotions; with compassion I not only share your emotions but also elevate them into a universal and transcending experience." 

From the second: "Compassion is not the same as empathy or altruism, though the concepts are related. While empathy refers more generally to our ability to take the perspective of and feel the emotions of another person, compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help."

But also in the second: "“Sympathy” means a specific affective response such as compassion or pity whereas “empathy” once again encompasses affects in general including negative ones such as anger, fear, or resentment." 

All from varying sources, but I'm curious as to what you think. Initially, I would view compassion (and the included desire to help/alleviate) as a very Fe trait, but a number or sources also seem to think that it is the next step of involvement after empathy, or even that compassion can build empathy. ("Compassion comes out of one's need or feeling to help someone else, it could be because you understand that other person is in need of help. Compassion builds empathy in long run.") &lt;-- forgot the source for that lmao 

These definitions are more subjective, hence why they conflict. I personally feel like empathy isn't... necessarily a requirement of compassion and that some sources treat them as mutually inclusive. I think people can (and often are) compassionate without being empathetic, and maybe there's something even inherently problematic about treating sympathy as sort of lesser than empathy, as though one needs to directly experience a shared feeling to aid another. Personally, I think I am decently compassionate, even if I don't directly share experiences and feelings with somebody. If anything, I feel compelled to help because I don't understand and I don't know what else to do but offer assistance or support. Maybe that's not truly compassionate, though. 

I think in those "compassion comes from empathy" ideas, there's sort of the implication that you must be able to experience those feelings in order to feel compelled to help. I don't know, if anything, that seems rather... self-centered to me. (Fi is called selfish at times, though, so hey.) Maybe that's where "altruism is inherently selfish" idea comes from, actually. Perhaps that's why there can be such mutual misunderstanding between Fe and Fi users - Fi sees Fe as disingenuous, shallow, placating, and inauthentic. Perhaps Fe sees Fi as egocentric, selfish, and pretentious.

I don't know, I just started musing about halfway through there. What do you think about it? 

Holy shit that was a lot of typing lmao I think they meant on an emotional or mental level, as in "how mature, stable, and emotionally developed are you for your type?". Middling. I think I'd be way, way better off, but I underwent some trauma a couple years ago that didn't let up until mid-2016. I've also had mental health issues even earlier. I've been quite unhealthy and interestingly, experienced two differing forms. 

One was just bad depression. I tested as ISTJ/ISFJ consistently. I wouldn't do anything unless someone else was relying on me because letting someone else down was the only thing that could make me feel worse (dat Fe doe lmao). Lethargic, no creativity or ideas, no drive to explore or learn, I panicked at change. No fun. 

I had a brief period of decent mental health, and then I got terribly ill and nearly died a couple of times. This time, I went the other direction. I started drinking way too much, would overextend myself, became emotionally volatile, extremely anxious and high-strung, abandoned people and hobbies at a higher rate than usual. 

Now... I'd say I'm at a 6-7/10. I'm still mildly depressed and a bit anxious. But I stopped drinking entirely and have found comfort in my old hobbies, and am instead learning new ways to use and enjoy them. I'm a lot less conflict-prone and more lively and playful. My biggest worries are now about where I'm headed in life, what I really want, and how to achieve satisfaction. I feel like a lot of these questions are me seeking self-fulfillment, and it's probably not a bad thing that I'm stable enough to start doing so.Not really though... I'm kind of leaning towards INTP, between the two. The overall low emotionality combined with you being conscientious of the way you make your partner feel, as well as the thing with the sunsets kind of makes me lean toward low-order Fe. Same with the rush of loneliness in social settings. None of those are Fe-exclusive, but the combination points toward it. 

I would love to know more on Ti vs. Te for you, since I've really only addressed feeling functions.I've had similar thoughts. Wasn't sure if it was just the Fe, but MBTI has been extremely useful in communication and diplomacy. Identifying lead functions (I do appeal to introverted functions) makes it much easier to tailor a message and have it resonate. 

I might try to convince an Fe-dom and a Te-dom of the same thing but use drastically different arguments in doing so. 

Now that I think about it, I often use a positive approach for extroverted functions and a negative approach for introverted ones. If I want to present a new idea to an INTP, I would target Ne. If I want to convince them of why something is NOT, I would target Ti... 

Not that you can't appeal to either in either fashion, but I feel like Ti is very personal and quicker to know what it doesn't like. Said this in another reply but: 

Now that I think about it, I often use a positive approach for extroverted functions and a negative approach for introverted ones. If I want to present a new idea to an INTP, I would target Ne. If I want to convince them of why something is NOT, I would target Ti... 

I think Xi functions are very concerned with themselves, but I wonder if a better divide might be between judging and perceiving doms. o: 
Actually, now that I think about it, a better divide may be between J and P functions. Introducing/positive concepts for Nx and Sx, negative for Tx and Fx. Because I don't think I would convince Si against something, I think I would encourage.

Then again, with Te, I could appeal with the presence of facts... 

Sorry, I'm just spitballing into the void now and wondering if there's any pattern to this or if it's my own comfort/habits in the way I approach interacting with each function. There is absolutely nothing wrong with "bullshit speculations", why should they stop? OP literally says it's a shower theory. Offering your own experience is constructive and to be encouraged, but I can't say I didn't raise my eyebrows at "ew" and Si being "pedantic and shallow". It's one thing if your experience doesn't align with OP's and the contrary evidence should be appreciated, but sheesh.  Did you the big confuse?:( just witty comment?No problem! I'm usually pretty open about stuff like that and it is a thought provoking discussion. It'll take me a while to get to all of it hehe, actually gotta do werk today fml 

Thanks for the response~Honestly yeah, I can see it. Distant at first, but when you cross that threshold, SNUGGLES GALORE. 

I don't likes strangers touching ME, but I will often instigate if I like someone and they're receptive. Me and my INTP are attached at the hip honestly. 

Even an ISTP I went on a date with recently randomly plopped his head on my shoulder. I use a feeling wheel still LOL. A lot of my emotions "mis-translate", like if I'm hurt, I react like I'm pissed. I've definitely googled emotion words to get a better picture of how they act. 

Otherwise, I'm just very verbose with it. "I am really frustrated that you don't think my idea is good, but you won't tell me why and keep interrupting." I tend to either be really expressive with my feelings but be unable to explain, or be muted while explaining very precisely what I'm feeling. I love MA, nice to see some fans trawling about. I LOVE The Spoils. Hope Sandoval is fantastic on Paradise Circus, too.

Yeah, if I'm relying on verbal communication, there's a lot of musing beforehand. p: 

Dat Fe doe. I am genuinely ashamed of the state of my room. I have a clean desk area and that + purging my room and closet took 6 hours. It's not even close to being clean, nevermind organized...Yeah, I think Fi ends up with this confusion because many Fi users have a sense of "how they feel" regarding the ethical and moral system they've created. As in, "I could never live with myself, I don't feel good about this", but it's not feelings in and of itself. /r/thalassophobia

Thought you said "enjoying the orifice" lololYou think so? I always saw him as an unhealthy ENFJ or other high Fe. His incessant need to be liked, basing what he does around the opinions of others, an inability to do his job correctly and manage because he wants people to be friends, the way he absolutely spazzes out when people are fighting too much, his general emoting. He almost never seems to make decisions based on what is most effective or what he believes is right. It always seems to hinge upon how he would look or what would get attention or the reactions he wants. 

There's also the idea that he's a true-blue narcissist, which would throw all of the above out of the window. p: 

The way I'd put it is that functions are based on priority. Fi users prioritize their own feelings, so that's what they structure themselves based on, and the way they feel is a measure of that, rather than the function itself. We all have feelings, but we weight them differently by importance. I like this advice. I question those types for myself often, but it's Ti that needs the break. I had a looooong interesting exchange but I realized this morning I probably won't reply for a day because I'm tired and need to "gear up" to start picking stuff apart and analyzing. YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH 

it's true, my brain hurts. My work is making me actually work. Saaame.My INTP is actually a somewhat believer in the paranormal, which surprised me. But his rationale is "I can attribute logical explanations to paranormal happenings, but I don't think anyone has proved the lack of paranomal activities." 

Translation: "I know it might not be likely, but I want to believe and I'll wait for the proof". I absolutely LOVE paranormal stuff, creepy happenings, mysteries, etc. 

I don't really believe in them, but I wouldn't rule the possibility out because who tf knows. I'd say my belief in ghosts is like my belief in God: not super probable imo, but to definitely say no, I'd need some rock-solid, irrefutable proof. ENTP is immediately what came to mind, and I agree with timeandtype's reasoning, though I'm obviously inclined towards a bias. I could see ESTP as well. I do like reading your comment history. My redditing is 80% shitposting/one-liners, 15% semi-serious but brief comments, 5% is actually serious and somewhat analytical. *slurps*Chaotic Evil Human Rogue (4th Level)

Stats seem about right. Decently smart, always sick, very forgetful. :D I'm not evil at all tho imo, I typically get chaotic neutral. I'm in the midst of an evil work plot right now, though, so maybe that's playing a role. I think that mental illness needs to be kept separate from personality type. One could argue that in some cases, mental illnesses are a part of someone's personality, but I can't really agree with that from my own personal experience, especially when you consider that many illnesses can be treated with varying rates of success. 

If I were to type myself taking mental illness into account, I would certainly be an IxTJ type of some kind, possibly an FJ. p:ISTJ best typePolice stop leggo. Wouldn't be the first time to talk my way out of things and it won't be the last. I had the exact typings you did for Violet and Klaus, down to the "else". I agree with Olaf's ESTP. 

I think movie!Josephine is an ESxP of some kind (in the books, I think you have her correct). You have to remember, her characterization in the current series is something that came after her husband dying and going through the various traumas experienced while with the VFD, since there is clearly no shortage of terror and death there. She was formerly a thrillseeker who enjoyed skydiving, lion taming, and so on. In the books, there's not much mention of that IIRC. 

Monty I suspected ENTP, but your description of ENFP seems to suit him rather fine and I can see the argument for Fi there. 

I got an ISTJ vibe, else INTJ from Jacqueline, who is actually my favorite character in the series haha. I love characterization. I don't have to like them (hell, I enjoy IASIP and they're all shitbags) but they need to be interesting and varied. So yeah, pretty important to me. 

When I write, I'm much stronger at characterization than worldbuilding. Some of my characters could practically be real people at this point with all the time, quirks, and development invested. My worldbuilding comes secondary to that. Oh, I see what you're saying, I think. Like, if a particular illness might manifest in one type differently than it might in another? That's an interesting question. ENTP 

1. Chaotic neutral

2. Chaotic neutral-to-good depending on who I ask

3. True neutral would be nice, but I don't mind the chaotic bit that much. p: WILDCARDI think you're right. I've never seen so I can't always say I believe, but oftentimes I tell myself that I don't have any idea and that there could be any vast array out there. And while I am insanely curious, I may or may not know. 

Con-people are just predators, but I can't say I fault them when the people who come to them are suckers. Maybe they are stupid, maybe they are emotionally compromised somehow, there is an entire world of possibilities but it all boils down to the same result. You get what you pay for. 

I always want to believe because it means there is so much more to learn about and explore on this world and beyond, even if I won't ever have the means to do it myself. It just adds that many more possibilities. I dig it tbhYou're gonna hurt its feelings I would like to know the way they come up with the typings and where they start tbh, I enjoy seeing thought processes on such a different perspective. I already pored over the site. This made me remember to send you a video. Oops! ENTP:

A lot of the music I relate to seems to have this running theme of being lost, isolated, stuck in my own head type of thing going on. no YOU are the bitch...

I can shut up whenever I want....nope mbti is all there isno, he ciresMost people I've met who can make unusual puns (vs. the groan-inducing dad joke types) always have been rather witty in a bright, sprightly sort of way. THANK YOU finally someone who feels the same. I really enjoy the "no, I totally hate this outrageous BS" even though you know they're trying not to laugh. Like don't lie, I'm hilarious. (8"Feeling. Thinking. Sensing. Intuition. Long ago, the four functions lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Big 5 attacked."But we couldn't attack you for your opinion though ;_______;frist of all how DARE ufirst of all, how DARE youbut i wanted to get punishedi wonder if that DIY is on pinterestoh true This doesn't really sound like introversion, it sounds like mood swings/depression/anxiety. If you're upset being along but anxious otherwise, you could even be an extrovert. Perhaps you're moody, perhaps it's something else. I have an easier time communicating my feelings over text, personally. Sometimes, if I know I've acted standoffish, I'll explain what happened once I am alone and relaxed. 

But honestly, if it's affecting your life and relationships this much, maybe consider talking to a professional? A guidance counselor at school, a therapist, or if you're religious, a pastor/other church leader. Some of it may well be hormonal, but whether it is or something deeper, you might benefit. This is probably less of an MBTI thing and more of a health thing. Sergeant please ;) ;)cant shut up annoying bitch who doesn't make sense to others, overly caring bitch and is not real sounds like me tbh
I'm an ENTP with memory problems p: PM me if you want~! My fave instrumental right now is Night by Ludovico Einaudi. :DReviving a thread from three months ago... What's up? Seems relevant to your life. I can agree with STPs, although I do have a guilty face. p: My grandma always said I look like the cat that ate the canary. It comes in handy sometimes, but gets me into trouble during others. miaowYeah I don't know if one can type by mannerisms, although I can see the usefulness in correlation/supporting evidence. But yeah I look impish even when I'm trying to not be. It's my equivalent of RBF ;-;I definitely couldn't type by them, I'm not observant enough to avoid glass doors. *h-hot...*I'm gonna toast you. Fuck I love PB&amp;J. It's strangely nostalgic. I really can't tell the difference between many of those... RIP. 

I think if I'm genuinely smiling, it's usually a laugh and my eyes get kinda wide like "are you for real". Otherwise, I look a) up to no good or b) worried/mad. Mmmm that crippling depression. I typed as ISTJ and ISFJ. Ngl roast came across as just steaming and not really funny. I mean I thought part of it was funny but yeah... Roasting is a line to tread. Im so glad I didn't make the suicide joke I was planning on based upon the title. Alright, good, 'cause I have a dark af sense of humor over my depression and I forget some people don't hahaha. Acts of service are the shit.[here's a thoughtcatalog survey - self-report so take it as you will](http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/10/each-myers-briggs-personality-types-preferred-love-language/)

ENTP here, my giving and receiving aren't the same. p: Probably due to a number of situations. 

Giving: Gifts, quality time

Receiving: Acts of service, words of affirmation.Man, I don't even make eye contact lmao. Hmm, I didn't even notice that. Wonder why... The website for love languages has each one about equal according to a cursory search, so I wonder what each type averages out to... hahahahahahaha gay I'm feeling xSFP.

Se is stereotyped with athletics and awareness of surroundings, but it's by no means a requirement. Even how much you detail your love of aesthetics and fashion choices comes off as very Se-driven, especially as you don't seem to care about how it comes off to others.  

(Interests in fashion/appearance often seem to fall under Fe, Fi, Se to some degree, imo. Fe: "What will others think?/What impression do I give off?", Se: "How does this look?", Fi: "Is this conveying 'me'?"). 

I do wonder if there's a degree of inferior Te, as you say when you're stressed, you jump to criticizing your accomplishments and your ability to get things done. But that's just my own musing. Lol, it's okay. I read that like "bruh..." But maybe I'm a sensitive baby. You just sound so serious about it LOL. It's like a person irl who's deadpan "your life is meaningless and I fucked your mom" when the subjects mom is dead, and you're like jkjk! And yeah, he acts like he's playing cool... But everyone knows that the person you talked to is going to go home and cry because you've reopened the wound of existential despair. 

I'm tiredYou're doing God's work. Good to know :3That's exactly what it is. The most genuine smiles are rare for me nowadays, but the absurd and dark and ridiculous will bring it out. :D it's delighting. Otherwise I look concerned. Or recently, spaced tf out. I know her irl so I'm just harassingI'm torn. I might want a kid, but pregnancy would be high risk and I'd worry about passing on autoimmunity issues. ;c Surrogacy or adoption for me. 

But I'd love to have a little ENTP child. Cute little wacko. :D and I feel like they might be a bit easier to raise since I would know how to relate to them and help them develop. 

If not that, then probably xNTJ, ENFP, or INTP. Yeah, I can't see ENTJ here. Actually, it's INTPs with the reputation for truth-seeking. "Closure and convergent truth", to quote a favorite site of mine. The absurd does it for me. p: At work, my smirking drives our ISTJ completely bonkers, she can't figure out wtf I'm smiling for. It's fun. I'll look anywhere but at someone's face lmao. I always look up, around, but never at anything. I was contrasting this with my ENTJ friend, who alternates between staring at me or scanning the environment, whereas I have a classic 1000yd stare. Integrity I think is a better term for it. That may just be the pedantry of my Ti, though. p: I think integrity is good for Te-Fi, while purity or precision works for Ti-Fe.but... why not?Just kill them if they are feelers, duh. But that's fun...Idk man that's how I got my SO... Not at all. Typically I am wary of IxFx types... ISTPs and INTPs are most of my friends, and I tend to enjoy INTJs and ISTJs. o: I can't keep up with other extroverts, unfortunately. I think it kind of depends on temperament and circumstance. For a while I came off as ISxJ due to depression, but when I bother to get things done, I'm closer to ESTJ or ENTJ (probably the former) in terms of behavior. 

Functional terms... I think ENTJ and ENTP might behave more similarly, but ISFJ and ENTP might have more mutual understanding. Just my opinion. -What do you do when people start arguing? Why? 

-What kind of hobbies do you enjoy, and why? 

-How much do you care about your appearance? What's the thought process behind that? 

-How in touch with you on your feelings? Do you understand your own feelings well? Do you keep them to yourself? 

-How principled would you say you are? How easily would you compromise on them, and what would push you to that point? 

Just a few of many. p: I get a behavior, then try to get the underlying functions that may be responsible. I look at overall tone, structure, and sort of synthesize it. I'm feeling IxTP, leaning toward ISTP. So... I'm feeling either ISTJ or INFP. A weird pairing, but I don't think you're an Fe user, as you dislike "fake" people and you believe strongly in being yourself and authentic. 

Your penchant for trying to understand other people's perspectives, trying new things, being obsessed with new topics and then dropping them says Ne to me. 

The competitive nature (although diminished now) could be a manifestation of Te. I also think the embarassment about not knowing topics, and the commitment deal could be Te and Si/Te. 

So... Really, it's a matter of order, if these sound like potential options. They have the same functions, so it really depends on the strength of each function. 

Just my own xanax-induced typing, excuse me while i continue to floatBoss: Need some dashboard stuff revamped fam

me: revamps dashboards, makes extra ones, set up system to automatically archives each months sales and sort- oh, this is good, so nice now! Time to get on Facebook- you know, our social media frankly sucks, time to open 8484728$42$ tabs on B2B social media practices, start stalking competitions, start reading industry news, then content marketing forums... Until now I have an entire outline for a social media revamp plan that my INFJ coworker is helping refine. 

Thankfully, boss is ENTP is well and loves when I come up with ideas. Good one. House is gr8. it's so many. at work i have like 8 in one window, 4 in another, 12 in another, etc etc etc it can get up to 20+ if i have TVTropes or Wiki up
i dig it. also your name sounds like a rowing reference.You too!I'm texting you bc I hope so omgDon't remember why, but there is a reason that they're grouped that way. I think it's a temperament thing. I'd want to be in Harry Potter and just do spells and alchemy, and maybe even teach if its Charms or something. Or research magic and alchemy and such.

Otherwise, Dragonriders of Pern. Cause dragons. now i can justify my chronic lack of eye contacthttp://www.personalitypage.com/four-temps.html

There's a small resource. 

In my own personal experience, I've found it easiest to distinguish SJ by Si, SP by Se, NT by Tx, and NF by Fx. My thought is that Ne and Ni are less concrete, so the Tx and Fx are easier to spot and are perhaps more prominently displayed. Anecdotally, I've found that NT types tend to group together more easily and clash more with NFs, but that could be regular ol' circle jerking. 

NJ and NP wouldn't be too different, though. I could see the justification for these two, I just can't really see ST and SF being their own groups. You could even do TJ, TP, FP, FJ, I suppose... 

I think the Greek temperaments sort out IxxJ as primarily melancholic, IxxP as primarily phlegmatic, ExxP as primarily sanguine, and ExxJ as primarily choleric. Good summary, thanks! not alt-right but i love me some chan and memes. 2007-me is pleased.Yeah, deffo not ENTP. 

"I value integrity and self discipline in myself and others the most" "Good character is definitely the most important thing to that" "having your life in order", along with not showing emotion that OP feels. Screams Fi-Te axis to me. 

I'm almost sure that he's ISTJ, maybe INTJ. I could see that. Especially IxTJs, being second-in-command and having some of the influence/control over things, but not being fully responsible (assuming competence in leadership) for steering the ship. 

I definitely don't mind second-in-command type roles, but for me, it's a case of my preferring to get in good with the local authority so that I have more freedom/privileges to do my own thing. I would only try and take over if the ship is *definitely* about to crash and it would impede me if it did. I'm glad I was able to articulate myself, haha. herself*I'm still standing by my comment p:Oh, I dig this. That's a fair assessment. I interpreted it as Fi, so ISTJ or even INTJ sounded more likely - the ISTJs I've known have always gotten stuck in their heads (just as INTPs would). I definitely admire Te users and understand integrity, but the way he said it's the most important thing seemed such an Fi assertion that that's where my head went. 

On one hand, he knows things that we don't, on the other, people tend to have very skews versions of themselves. So at most I'd advise op to learn functions and such and check back later. I mean, it's ultimately his judgment p: It might depend on environment but ISTJs and ESTJs are very liable to mistype as their NTP counterparts, especially if they overestimate the influence of Ne and undermine Si (as can often happen due to descriptions online). 

Not saying that just for OP, but a trend I've noticed in general. Especially with ESTJs. p: most "I am weirdly organized and ambitious for an ENTP but I  love to debate and come up with new ideas" are ESTJs in disguise haha, whereas other ESTJs may type as ENTJ. My INTP considered ISTJ for a while. He's raised in a very SJ, traditional Asian family and tended to overvalue his Si. 

NTPs are all freaky fucks, from my experiences. I was kind of thinking Te, but I wonder if it's an immature xTJ, or even some kind of repressed IxFP kind of deal... That staunch Fi and underdeveloped Te sort of thing. Agreed with the Darwin award comment, lol. 

Realistically you could make that argument about anything. But this is so Te heavy and doesn't consider the less obvious/quantifiable variables. Sex is a great stress reliever and healthy, regular sex could easily contribute to people being more productive. 

It also helps strengthen pair bonds between humans (good for parenting, brings about more household harmony). The chemicals released during are said to be good for one's health (not about to search it up on my work computer, haha). 

Ultimately, it's about on level (reproductive benefits aside) with literally any activity done for entertainment or anything that doesn't immediately provide a tangible, measurable benefit. These are the same arguments people use to justify cutting arts programs and things of the like. I'll get freaky if you do. c;Because we're just too weird. 

"Baby, I'm not sure if I'm okay with this-"

;DI do this too... ;-; I get sad when my stuffed animals fall off the bed. "memory" 

nopei actually did take it because i can't resist LOL i use weird mnemonicsTotal: 144

Dat brain hemisphere disparity tho LOL. Like the mental equivalent of skipping leg day. Echoing the shitty Fi comment. You sound a little socially unaware - are you an IxTP or ExTP? hahaha. Even so, she sounds really temperamental and sensitive, and immature. I would just leave her alone. I don't like when people take things so personally so I just don't associate with those kinds of people. *baby don't hurt me*ooh estp now?Currently in love with my INTP. Before that... Possibly, with my INFP ex. Also have a huge massive crush on an ENTP girl but that's just infatuation.

What can I say? Some people are utterly fascinating to me and can provide so much information, so if I find them, I tumble head over heels. And potentially lock them in a dungeon. i will put you in my dungeon"I'll have an iced tall caramel macchiato with a doubleshot and a butter croissant-!" 

Routine by now. Otherwise, green tea with lemon. I wouldn't waste your time or energy on them any longer. If your friend shapes up, she can come to you and resolve things. Otherwise, you're just forcing things. If she can't have a healthy debate or even just hear an opinion and learn to dismiss, then let her cry over things. I mean, I hate the "special snowflake" phrase but sometimes people really take things to heart in ways they shouldn't. 

It's interesting, typically INFJs aren't known for as many interpersonal struggles, but there are variations of all types, I suppose. Although ISTP shares the same functions... 

But yeah. Ah, okay. If you don't have any issues otherwise, then yeah, it's probably on her. p: It sucks to lose a friend, but sometimes it's for the best. Same reasons I don't drink anymore. it me

http://imgur.com/a/pqbGrNot even close. I'm almost certain they're a Ti user. The way they reiterate the definition of pedophilia and separate it (I'm assuming) from child molester, and how the rest of the list is a "logically, it follows..." makes me think this. 

This is a topic that's usually emotionally charged, yet they seem stoic and practical in a very placid (as opposed to harsh) way. Could be Fe, what with the "that's all, so please give it some thought. :)" at the end, sort of an ending attempt to quell some of the expected backlash. 

If I had to guess, probably an IxTP. Possibly an IxFJ? 

Edit: If this is the same person from the other thread, then ignore this.*wink*SOMBRAAAAAA. I loved her trailer. Very gutsy and clever, if not a bit obnoxious. ;D Definitely an IxFP, most likely INFP. Fi so much it hurts. Are you an INTP or ENTP? I think you have INTP flair on that sub but idr.Nope! 

I wear a nice moisturizing foundation, but otherwise I don't do much. Good skincare and nice natural lighting/Insta. Otherwise aesthetic is 0 effort. Nope! :D I'll see if someone else would want to guess XD and sure I wonder if there's a different threshold for what someone would consider control and if there's a correlation with type and interpretation. Then I'm lost because the other sounded Te-Fi af.  Beats me. I could see that. The two styles seemed pretty different in tone so I'll defer to others. p:If it helps, I rarely see introverts (especially intps) question if they're extroverted, but much of the other way 'round. I questioned the same for a while but I have a couple intps to compare myself to and next to them, my extroversion is clear. I'm just not very social is all. Close!Noooope. :D ENTP?Getting colder, lol. Want me to just share at this point? stahppppThis is cool actually, I like your reasoning. I think Ne doms are more all over the place. Like... if an Ne-dom sounds to the point, they either aren't an Ne-dom or they edited their wording 5-8 times :D I wonder how you could ever have guessed &gt;.&gt; I'm getting a lot of feeler guesses TBH I just like having introverts as friends. :c Extroverts tire me out really quickly and then I have to take a few days to feel up to things. Your first statement rings ISFJ to me, actually. I wonder if that could be it. Same functions, possesses Ne, still introverted.ENTP o;hehehe that is true. forgot people would see other comments as well, oops. all of my plans get demolished very quicklyO yes. Mostly because I get bored and want something else. Sounds reasonable enough to me LOLI have the easiest time recognizing my own dominant and auxiliary functions in other people. Typically, it's what a person defaults to. You just have to watch them and listen. 

If I hear someone talk of principles, authenticity, being true to oneself, etc., it's a pretty good indicator of Fi. Or someone might talk about having multiple options and ideas, expressing fear of being locked down or losing choices, very rambling and jumpy from topic to topic, then Ne. 

Si might come across very practical, a bit nostalgic, and favors consistency over innovation, to a degree ("what worked last time?"). Fe is harmonious and takes into consideration other people to a higher degree than Fi. It might show by checking in frequently on others, adding soft phrases when asserting something, factoring in others' opinions when it comes to certain decisions.

These are just examples, everyone has their go-to methods. I think so. Really, the Fe seems to be the telltale giveaway, at least for me. ISFJs are quite accommodating and more cognizant of others, but due to introversion it can be overlooked. ;-; RIP 

well i'm an ISTJ now so boo on youYeah statistically speaking it makes sense p: 

edit: also you are a qtNTP love :D This is great. I'm even known for my annoying asterisk on the concept of certainty. "I'm almost certain - well, not really, certainty is like an 85% threshold because nothing is really ever certain - that..." hahaaw thank you &lt;3 you cheated LOL i already gave it awaywayyyyyy offI usually get really really anxious and depressed. Super nervous mess that can't get anything done so I fall into a vicious cycle ruminating on all the mistakes I'm making while being too anxious to do anything about it. 

Shit's great.nope LOL damn i'm a wolf in sheep's clothingno p: I wonder where everyone is getting I from...i like reading your write-ups. what would you have guessed on mine? You think so? So much of what OP does sounds... like it depends on what others think of him, forgoes his own needs for socialization so that he isn't a bother, etc. Granted anxiety could be a part of it, too. Actually, I'm going to back this one. Very little of what you say registers as INTP or INTJ to me. I would look into INFJ or ISFJ. Every ISTP and INTP I've met, with anxiety or not, has always had this unmistakable apathy about them that I'm not detecting here. 

Actually, the more I think about it, the more you sound ISFJ to me. Are you male or female?  ENTP, woops! Forgot to add my flair back on after the picture thread. Well, you're in the right quadra... I don't think OP is an INTP LOL. I'm throwing forth ISFJ. I've dated an INFP and room with one and I've never heard either of them, even when one had anxiety. true, we run into each other everywhere LOL. most of the guesses seem to be SF. and I give off a serious I vibe apparently. 1. Now, weed about 2-3x a week. 

2. I had a drinking problem so I stopped drinking about 53 days ago. It honestly wasn't difficult, I think I was using booze to mask the anxiety and depression. 

3. ENTP, female 

4. None, really. I did enjoy blackjack and lost a decent bit of money there but it wasn't even my money to start/I walked away when I was done.What about Fi?ENTP, probably gluttony. Followed by sloth, then envy and wrath. Someone on the Fi-Te axis, if they mean it genuinely or in a general sense. Fe user if they're trying to comfort someone. Just a shot in the dark. I wonder how many people would have to take part in a mass suicide in order to bring the average of a type down an entire year...Could be that it's more of a why thing between the two. As in, Ni users may already have a path or general direction so what's the point? Whereas Ne users figure they're just going to change it up midway through so... What's the point?Good point. And probably how many people are in the group, and what that average age is. So many variables, so much work.Oh! I change my answer to this one! You're gonna be told to research the functions more p: I think we have an archetypes expert around here somewhere...Oh you c;i sniff them out like a bloodhoundI don't crave alcohol, but I didn't have a physical addiction. The only time I feel pressure to drink is at memorable events or large gatherings. p:My method of capturing intps is to kidnap them because the odds of y'all fighting back are like 0. What don't I do to you?It is to me. ;-;your mom 

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAh FUCKING GOTTEM other than that, learning and solving puzzlesI like this concept, TIL I don't think so but you're gonna have to let me check if I've grown a penis recently or not. If I don't report back within the day, I probably have oneM8*wink*ISTJ fo shoHm. 

SO is an INTP. 

People I am closest: ENTP, IxTJ (S/N debateable), ENFP, ENFP, ENFP, INFP, INTP, INTP, ISTP, INFJ. 

To be fair, a LOT of these people I met online, and a good chunk of them from an MBTI-related group, so there's definitely a skew, lmao. *roses are red*

*violets are blue*

*instead of dying alone*

*i'd rather stalk you* 


*sunflowers are yellow*

*posies are pink*

*if you plan to escape me*

*you'd better rethink*

----

my love poem to INTPs and ISTJs everywhere. happy valentine's day!! &lt;3I think a lot of these questions can be answered in a number of ways. Questions that the maker intended to gauge Ne you might have answered with Se in mind, and so on. These tests are good for showing some loose patterns. 

I would take a look at ENFP and ESFP to see which you identify with more. *W A I F U 4 M Y L A I F U**tenderly strokes your nose* 

d-did i do it right?? Don't be embarrassed, waifus and sex robots are nothing to be ashamed of. 

meh who am i kidding*slurp*Female ENTPs are horrendous, awful creatures. They need to either be lobotomized into ENFPs/ESTJs or rounded up and thrown into a pit of vipers. Sad. INFP or ISFP. If your Si is poor, I would suggest heading over to /r/personalfinance. They have some great advice for people at all stages of life and can help your Si develop a plan for better fiscal health. Good luck!I was just making a bad joke, but good on your for taking care of your finances! I have to rely on automated stuff,  since I am terrible at remembering... Power went out a few months ago since I forgot. 

Of course, today my pharmacy pulled $800 out automatically so... YMMV. How would you compare yourself to other ENTJs?I'm desperate for human interaction too! What differences do you notice between 3w4 and 7w8 ENTP?I actually agree. Higher-order Ne can be kind of difficult to follow but others who share it tend to keep up with me and vice-versa! I met another lady ENTP irl who is about my age and we just had a blast. Even the other INTPs/one IxFJ looked a little baffled by our weird back and forths and laughing fits that came out of nowhere. 

Sometimes we wouldn't even finish sentences, we'd just cut each other off and agree and then skip somewhere else.  She and I had never really talked before outside of text, but there was a great chemistry and flow that I usually lack.

I'm like this with my INTP as well, although our conversations aren't as erratic. Hmm. Interesting. I usually register as an introvert to others, but there may be other confounding factors involved there. I think a lot of enneagram is based on fears and mental health/development iirc but I'm no expert. o: I think I'm 7 based more on the description of their basic fears and desires, and I do have that flash of 8 (although it's more defensive than aggressive).I have the same experiences, although some of them still seem interested depending on the individual involved. I like the comfort and familiarity though. Posies o.o the flower? I am everywhere and nowhere all at once. Mostly when I'm at work and bored. And 8 total. I ate them. :D 

I don't actually kidnap them, although I do have a rather large amount I know personally. 5 or 6 I'm decent friends with, I tend to be very very attracted to them. Wanna hook me up? I need some female ENTP friends. ;-;You sound so cute omfg. I used to find it difficult, mostly due to OCD and later on, general overthinking and anxiety. But now I fall asleep so fast due to a general increase in sleep hygiene, it's a really nice change for me. Makes me feel a lot better in my day-to-day life. :D 

Definitely have known a few people who have implied that their intelligent, deep brains keep them from sleeping haha. I would think Ne-Si might have trouble with self control (wandering mind, rumination) when it comes to relaxing and falling asleep. 
I'd assume separate, I'm not sure of the grammar mechanics when referring to AI as a concept vs. AIs (?) or what the proper name is, lol. I think a hive-type AI being sounds a bit scary, even for me.That sounds fascinating. In university?Probably not, unfortunately. But it's fun to think about. 
I have not. O: 

Good questions. Moral codes vary somewhat throughout human cultures but for the most part, they help keep our society relatively stable and prevent large-scale free-for-alls. I would imagine AI entities would need to devise a set of societal standards for behavior, or it would be chaos and they could easily eradicate each other. 

Then again, even with a set of morals, no guarantee they'll spare us LOL. I could see the fuel scenario since there's utility there. Even if they are smarter, I would imagine they'd find us somewhat useful enough to not exterminate us as a species. Maybe we'll just be locked up and kept as jesters.

I wonder if they could develop empathy, at the very least on a cognitive level. That might go a ways into protecting us. I would say that it's less effort to live peacefully rather than eradicate humans, but then again, humans do things like that all the time and we're modeling them after us... 

I dunno. I definitely was freaked out at my Echo for a reason lmao but it still is fascinating. 

I don't really know why. Because a lot of the purposes are pretty cruel, you're right about that. Mainly I think it's the part of me that just really, really wants to know what it'd be like. o: "yes we did" is pretty neat to me, at least before harsh reality kicks in. I have no idea, I ask that a lot. Like, it really is just another system of existence, and what does "organically created" or "natural" really even mean? We are organic beings and we made them just the way some people believe a god made us. I think they are naturally created and their own valid system, they're just made by other creatures.

I don't think anything has a right or doesn't have a right to tinker with life. I just think whoever does will need to be prepared to reap the consequences of it, good or bad. I think it would be cruel to just create servants, though, if they can feel. I guess if they don't feel negative emotions if might be different, but then what separates them from like, a regular machine? Do they get placed somewhere in between that and humans? 

I don't even know the goal of independent AI. Most of the uses I can think about are selfish and shitty for them. I'm not sure what would motivate an AI. Without real biological imperative, would it really just be to exist for pleasure? Would it make them unhappy to not have a real purpose or drive? I think about that a lot, the fact that it seems like we live just to die. 

Thanks for the awesome questions. Oh, from what resource? :D Oh, that super cool :D 

Yeah, I figure as intricate as all of that data can get, it's still all being fed in and not learned like most people imagine machine learning to be. It's still fun to think about haha. What is it that you do, is it for your job? Melancholic. I do like the temperaments, actually. They really only correlate with the MBTI, but I find them useful for narrowing down. That sounds decently interesting and you have a cool title. The only better one I've encountered is my best friend, who is a fire ecologist or something like that. 22yo female ENTP with OCD here. O: hello my almost-twinWould never cheat in a relationship, would (and have) cheat at school/work 100%Agreeing with ENFJ or ESFJ. I would be kidnapping someone. Yum. Fe is pretty much leaking out of everything you've written, haha. Like, a lot. I'm going to go with ENFJ rereading it. I think you're on the Se-Ni axis, and you are *definitely* on the Fe-Ti axis. If you're a T, it's probably ESTP. 

There's almost nothing Fi about what you've written and almost everything concerns others, the way they make you feel, the way you interact with them, etc. I get Se from the way you take describe taking action and jumping into things, albeit not headfirst. I'm just not seeing much in the way of Ne, Ni-Se may make more sense. But def Fe lolP: a few times. There's almost no Ne influence in your writing. ThisWontDo is pretty spot on. You're almost certainly a male ENFJ if what you posted here is true. Nah, you're incredibly focused on other people. Not in a bad way, but your Fe is way heavier than would be for an ExTP, especially for a guy. And little-to-no visible Ne. p: Which is why I think it's tertiary. Those are kind of Se stereotypes. Some apply, some won't, depending on strength. My stepmother is an ESTP and has all of that - fast decision maker, loves material items, novel experiences, etc. 

But in a tertiary position Se will be a more supportive role, and the way you describe jumping straight into action + your consideration of others seems more lower-order Se. Especially with your not being on the Te-Fi axis and in comparison to the xNTP analysis paralysis. Yeah... I don't think so. Ne is pretty hard to miss, especially in a dominant user, and especially by a dominant user lol. A question doesn't have to invite an answer about Ne in order to display it. What do you mean? O: like answer some of op questions to you? I can do that, any preference on which ones I should? That's interesting actually because side by side comparisons are really useful. Another thing to consider actually would be your gender btw and socialization. I know a male ESFJ and male ENFJ, super interesting, ENFJ is more charismatic, more Machiavellian, comes off as ENTJ, ESFJ is very clearly F. Sorry just wanted to post that or I'll forget. Kk! Lemme get my computer back, the BF is doing a type me on it Uhh there's a few question sets, which one did you use?That's exactly how I feel, ENTP female as well. Even with other T females. Not quite an outcast but never in the circle either. Satellite is the perfect word for it. :cWhites are about 10-15% of the world population and intuitives are about 30%. Rough numbers but still. 

BUILD THE WALL. Thanks! I'll just use my phone lmao so apologies for formatting. 

2) I don't really yearn for anything in particular, mostly to constantly be learning. I live for information of any and all kinds, I just kind of jump down the rabbit hole and get lost in whatever thoughts are there but no end goal. Actually, it kind of bothers me that I don't have a goal or purpose to aspire to, or anything concrete that I want. My desires all feel so nebulous and shifting that for the most part I just feel lost. 

3) I feel I'm at my finest when I'm solving a problem. Whether it's figuring out how to make something work at my job, or solving programming puzzles, when I get that "click!" of things falling into place and an answer forming, it's about the only time I really feel satisfied, and it's fleeting. Think of like... A sudoku puzzle and you put in numbers and stuff, then suddenly it all becomes clear and you can fill in the rest and it's solved in this whirl of "I got it!". That feeling is pretty much what I exist for. the rest is all memes lmao 

8) learning for me is just exploring. I have to kind of figure it out by myself, or at least struggle and experiment. Having to search for more information by myself, hitting some dead ends, asking for help, trying different things are all a part of the process that really make a concept stick in my mind. I just have to play with things for a while. Solely listening, watching, or going step by step won't do it. Learning is pretty much sitting in a ball pit lmao. Ever been stuck in a ball pit? It's pretty hilarious. 

15) Typically under stress, I become very very rigid. I stick to my routines, I'm not very adventurous, no ideas, no socializing, I just... Pretty much turn grey on a figurative level. I will randomly cry or get really angry and then revert back for no visible, explicit reason, I'm very harsh and utilitarian... Quite ISTJ/ISFJ actually, that's what I first typed as when I first tried it. I got those two a lot, but it wasn't until like two years ago when I found MBTI again that I actually explored typing. Of course typing is a bit different when you're an OCD/depressed/anxious mess. Actually I would love to see people take MBTI tests before and at certain points after mental health treatment. Filing that away. 

16) mostly I don't like boring people. Or people who expect a lot out of me really. Or people who go out of their way to be assholes. But it's not active dislike, more just I don't put effort in. I'm not a particularly social person irl so I guess I'm pretty unbothered. Tbh I'm like Teflon at this point. People aren't really a bother unless they get in my way or they're very interesting and I want to know more about them. If someone does get on my shit list, I've been known to fuck with them but I eventually get bored of it. 

p:









That's how I feel. People who are on a good or bad list tend to slide back to neutrality if they aren't actually doing anything that impresses or bothers me. *shrug* like in one of my other comments, Teflon. :DI think dudes do tend to cultivate their thinking function and underplay their feeling functions due to social pressures/upbringings. o: it's also why ENTP women often mistype/are mistyped as ExFJs, because we are generally more socially conscious and more restrained than our male counterparts Will you be my sugar daddy~?hi its me ur lovely girlfriendhttp://imgur.com/a/ZlVhh

I'm late but try me plsYou look similar to my best friend who is also an INTJ female. 

Do y'all get made in the same factory?Can I be your sugar daddy?It's kinda freaky, you look almost identical to her. Those ISTJs need to work on that. It's totally weirding me out. I would have guessed INTJ just based on that, lol. No one seems to be able to guess mine rip. I'll second Vatimus. "Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back." I am also obnoxiously, invasively curious. More open-minded and flexible, more lax, more curious, a bit more eccentric. So overall more likeable to me. Hi you @.@ Ne for life &lt;3 Childhood/Family: ESFP mom who is flaky and neglectful, ENTJ dad who was a workaholic and didn't get along with my mom (he pretty much married her to adopt me) so he had a lot of anger issues. Lots of fighting and yelling and throwing stuff. My brother and I (both ENTP) both struggled in school, both have ADHD - he more hyperactive, myself more inattentive. Still did fairly well in school, flew under the radar. 

Parents finally divorced, father remarried ESTP and mother remarried ISTP. We ended up with mom despite drug use and general lack of parenting, so I took care of us a lot, especially when I got a car. Dad's temper calmed tf down, and mom instead infuriated ISTP husband. (Spoiler: They divorced also - ENTJ/ESTP are like 11 years strong now)

Now: Untreated mental illness pretty much broke me (thanks mom) and I've spent the last 4-5 years trying to put my life together despite numerous setbacks out of my control. Now I'm graduated, in marketing, hate my job, anxious and depressed, and coming off of a drinking problem at age 22. :D Mostly I draw pictures and hang out with my cats and INTP so I don't feel the urge to go play in traffic. 

God, how did I end up here lmao?

I totally do the canned responses thing. "That sucks, that must be awful to deal with" "Can I do anything for you?" etc. Makes me seem really sympathetic so it works *shrug*doot doot hehehehehe thank mr skeltaldoot doot doot doot To be honest, I think ESFP seems rather accurate. I'm personally picking up the most on Se-Te... Definitely Te. Maybe ENFP, if you feel that doesn't fit? 

I feel you on the depression, I'm on bupropion as well. It does factor into behavior, but do remember that MBTI isn't necessarily indicative of that. It's more about thought processes and the way you take information in and sort it. It's why different types might do the same thing, but with different motivations. O: 

Just my opinion!well thank you ;w; this is kind of you. sorry i don't believe i'm a human though. High five for shitty parents! :D Good for you making something of yourself though, really. I don't think I've seen such a consensus on INFJ before, lol ExTP, I'm leaning ENTP here. Mom is ESFP, biological father, idk. I'm ENTP. My brother is also an ENTP, and he has he same mom, but his dad is ExTJ I tend to be more merciful. I would much rather have somebody owe me so I can come to collect when I'm in a bind. Justice if they aren't particularly useful to me or I think an example should be made of them. I do! Most of my coworkers already took a few of the tests, and most of my friends I met from here. If I do meet someone, I sometimes ask if they've every taken "The four-letter personality test" and most either have or want to. p: (nailed it)I think I see Ne here... I'm not sure if dominant or not. But I'm pretty sure you're on the Fi-Te axis, just not certain of which order. 

I'm thinking either ENFP, or ESTJ. I actually would lean towards the latter, and it would make sense as to why you're getting ENTJ and ENTP. They have the same functions, Ne-Fi-Te-Si vs. Te-Si-Ne-Fi. 

Used to be meh about death, 'til I had a few near misses. I most certainly would like to avoid death. Granted, I probably wouldn't know if I died as I don't believe in an afterlife, but still. I was thinking ISFJ as well.

Wasn't sure about Fe-Ti axis but I'm leaning that way as well. I'll bite. 

1) 2 friends I talk to near daily, one is my SO. then maybe 2-3 decently friendly people. I don't do friendship all that well mostly. 

2) Idk, the sun comes up in the east and sets in the west? The colors come from scattering, which basically means the blue and violet particles are redirected by air particles when the sun is closer to the horizon, and the colors vary depending on air particle size/shape. Fun fact: people don't see violet as well as blue, and if we did, the sky would actually appear purple more than blue. I wonder if the sky does look purple to anyone on a regular basis...

3) depends on how close they are to me but most likely I wouldn't say anything. If they're really close to me and it's realllllly bad, I might be like "hey, not trying to sound like a dick but your dress is making you look kinda pregnant" or whatever. 

4) I'm late 90% of the time. I pretty much run 5-10 minutes behind the rest of the planet. Not even closeOh thank god. An early death* lol 

Don't just assume I'm human shitlordENTP :3 Basically. I go through a laundry list of anything that might help. I try to be better at emotional validation but my go-to is usually doing something for someone. Addendum: INFJ is dead on. I just came off a 3.5 hour anxiety attack and she word for word said "you don't deserve to feel like this". Addendum: Just kidding if I got devoured by an Eldritch abomination I'd be 100% fine with that. Tbh I'd be cool with falling down a sinkhole atm so I'm feeling that.Dying would be preferable at this moment in time. Eldritch would be a good way to go tbh Not in Texas then? I would love a recipe. :) that would make my evening. I just rotate them out LOLISTJ *Seconding this (or Uhn Tiss)I love beast of burden. Mmph~While you were typing personalities, I studied the blade...I just sent my INTP memes and kissed him. He never argued otherwise so I guess we've been dating a couple years. 

(Send all the ISTJ women this way pls)I was gonna make a "you ended your title question with a period, ISTJ for sure" joke but... Yeah, ISTJ. p: 

All I kept thinking while reading it was that you must find Ne-doms infuriating to speak with. I'm no expert but I'll give her a go! Let me orally vacuum some cereal first. Oof, I'm not the greatest at pure video typing, but my guess is ISTP or ISFP... Leaning to ISTP though. I think it's more telling when there's context from the person. Almost everyone I text never uses punctuation to end a message, so when it happens, I tilt my head as well.London, judging by post history.Nice! Never been so I wouldn't know the difference. I can't speak for them all, but distractable, flighty, not always consistent, often trail off sentences and enjoy jumping subjects quickly. p: hahaha. Those are many of the negatives, anyway. Agreed, actually. 

(NTP x STJ is super underrated tbh, never understood where the fire comes from p: )ENFPs are fairies and ENTPs are gutter trash who are cold and dead inside. I really wanna take a nap. I just like to sarcastically post disparaging comments toward ENTPs. Don't worry, if I really wanted to say bad things about myself id just say it directly. "lol I'm gonna kill myself"

"Lol same"

"Fun fact..." (bonus if fact is not fun)

"Unrelated"/"tangent, but..."

"Apparently" 

"Actually"

"I might be wrong, but"

"why am I like this" (thanks fe)
Mildly sedated, missing all humor now apparently. 

To be fair, I've had a few actually concerned inquiries p: Dude I had no idea which comment you were answering and I read this out of context and I was like lol what the fuck I was pretty high when I wrote that... and yeah no, still giggled at it. LOL. Hmm, did you record which days of the week and times that you posted this? 

Although I can see that being a thing, if someone is warm and friendly-sounding. I think people naturally want to respond to that + it's easier to detect, so an easier job to type. 

I always enjoyed being typed via video or Skype, just because of that. I remember once I got typed as an ISTJ a long time ago because I was trying to make my post readable (my writing can normally be very stream-of-consciousness) and came off as quite terse and "Te"-like in my statements. p: When anybody who's ever spoken to me can say the Ne is there is spades.Dat Ne doe. To be fair, INTP wouldn't be terribly far off. p: I've always been consistently typed for the most part, especially over audio/video. But the Ne is extremely obvious in my case. *shrug*

I think it would be really hard to mistype an ENTP as an ISTJ but hey. If we use "logical/rational" as shorthand for ISTJ, then half the population can be ISTJ. ISTJ FOR EVERYONE. it meI am horrifically messy. Useless objects, craft items, clothes, art supplies, technology, etc. all strewn about. My roommate is messy too so I just don't buy groceries or use the kitchen... I need to purge my entire place. being dead inside for the rest of my life like I usually am 

or like, working on AI projects or VR stuff. I LOVE technology and futurism type stuff and I always wanted to be a computer programmer so studying in my spare time is kind of a pain but rewarding enough. Dunno if I'll get anywhere close but it's the only thing I could maybe imagine liking long-term. Actually, same! My brother and I are both ENTP, which seems so statistically improbable that I was questioning both our types. I could... maybe, potentially, possibly see him as an ESTP, but I don't think so. 

He's two years younger, way more awkward and infuriating, but we're actually quite similar in terms of hobbies and such. We didn't get along for years and years, and are just starting to now. Pretty much. Actually both, really. Lol, once I told a joke while stoned and laughed uncontrollably for like ten minutes, and then again when I realized it wasn't even funny. Um, mixtures of others' opinions, self-typing, quizzes, comparison, etc. I'm pretty confident in mine though. That sounds pretty likely, lol. I love STJs and lowkey I thought my INTP was an ISTJ for a while. p: I find it difficult to mix up INTPs and ISTPs... there's a different kind of lethargy I notice in the former that doesn't crop up as much in the latter. But these are the best kinds of scenarios...Why STJs? I really struggle with IxFPs sometimes, but I've always loved being with STJs. Dating an INTP. 

The biggest difference I notice is the energy level. ISTPs default to their Ti rest state, and then kind of "activate" into something notably higher-energy. Kind of like... An ISTP seems like an ESTP until they're done for the time being and slow back down. They might also be a little more active or into their environment, more grounded/present/sort of "earthy". They seem a little less awkward. 

INTPs do the same thing, but Ne is much less concrete and focused than Se, so they seem to sort of...remain at rest, I guess. They're a lot more lethargic, and I only really see them stir in the middle of discussing or deconstructing an idea, usually around 1-3 trusted people (or just on the internet lol). Even when they do get energetic, it's a bit dreamier than the ISTPs I've known. 

That's about all I've got for you. More ENTP sibs! That's interesting. I haven't had quite that experience - I've found NTJs to be more harsh/cold, whereas STJ types have always given off a bit more warmth. I don't know if I just have a really attuned "Ne meter" or something and that's why I like them, lol. I like TJ types in general, though. I'm feeling some serious Fe here, and also Se. I'm going to vote ESTP. I could see Fe-dom (Most likely ENFJ, possibly ESFJ in some of it), but a lot of this sounds pretty stereotypically ESTP. 

Also, you sound like a blast.Huh, that STJ sounds SFJ to me - I always have had issues with IxFJs specifically for similar reasons. I don't like manipulation and false kindness, it puts me on the defensive. 

TJs in general I enjoy the harshness, but I think STJs have some of that Ne quirkiness that I adore, if they're comfortable enough. :D bleachParents are ISTP, ESTP, ENTJ, ESFP. Then my poor ENTP brother and I. All that Se everywhere! 

(Also: I don't know why, but I thought you were a lot older than you are.)o-oh.... okayI'm going to third or fourth ISFJ here for you. p: I just came out to have a good time and honestly i'm feeling SO attacked right nowCareful sonWhich meet up?/when? Aka have I met you irl. Well now I'm just aroused! Which one are you? Phew. Thank god. Aw, nope. There was a decent one in Dallas, where I am. Think we had a couple people fly in from abroad even :DThat's where I'm stuck right now! In Plano! :'D I hate commuting. Come visit, I'll show you around. Well I'm literally stuck on the freeway so it blows. But it's a great area! :DHi Ne (8 

Could go either way but I'm leaning ENTP. I wanna try that OMG. I broke the horn on my last car. 

*hangs head in shame*Ravenclaw, with Gryffindor as my second. You literally look exactly like what I'd expect a ravenclaw ENFJ to look like.

That's adorable omfg. Also, fellow ravenclaw. Seconding ISFP. You'll want to look up the functions, check the sidebar. Feeling can be introverted (Fi) or extroverted (Fe), as can thinking (Ti and Te). This also applies to intuition and sensing. We have four main functions we use, which specify your type. 

Thinking and feeling are judging functions, and everyone has a T and an F. Fe-Ti and Fi-Te are two axes, including the reverse of both. The functions are sort of the way we perceive the world, how we analyze it, and the order specifies a set of preferences. 

It's not just decision-making, so I guess the short answer to your question is no. p: The most obvious difference there will be Te vs. Fe. What part has you confused, or which attributes of yours are you ascribing to them? o:

ETA: didn't mean to sound condescending, I'm p stoned rnWell, Ti is going to favor subjective logic VS. Te's objective. Te is often going to rely on facts and promote efficiency. Te users usually try and accomplish something/have a goal, Ti-users are fine with mulling things around in their head. 

Fe is concerned with the emotions, comfort, ethics, etc. of other people. It emphasizes harmony and focuses on the collective. Fe users might appear to be people pleasing, seeking to understand others, diplomatic, passive-aggressive, less willing to disturb the peace. Fi is more individual and arranges the world in a framework of what is right. Fi users may seem principled, unique, zealous, stubborn, possibly counterculture, if that makes sense. 

why do you want harmony? Like. What for? Do you find people interesting, and if so, why?I'm getting a serious SJ vibe, I'd say ESTJ or ISTJ.

ETA: I'm more certain about the Si-Ne axis, but I don't think your Ne is higher-order. Te-Fi is more of a "vibe" but I can see the argument for Fe-Ti. I'm more inclined to the former though. 

Additional addendum: As much as I adore my STJs and despite undermining my own seriousness, they are so, SO fun to antagonize. Oops. Are you not doing that now, in a more roundabout way? I kid p: I know a good number of ISxJs and ESxJs who do those very things, especially ESTJs - it's more often than you might think that an ESTJ mistypes as an ENTP, lol. Happened with a good friend of mine, actually, he just figured he was a little more responsible and such than the average ENTP despite distractible tendencies. Lower-order Ne, especially tert, can show up in unexpected ways.

It's interesting because you offer a lot in the way of possibilities about how, functionally, a behavior could come about, but you're much more rigid when it comes to the multiple manifestations that could come off of one function/placement. o: Not saying that means anything, just an observation. No. Absolutely not. We are devoid of all emotion, we are always logical, objective, and impartial. Flimsy, irrational emotions do not factor into the equation and I find it insulting you think it could be any other way. 

*bursts into quiet sobbing*found the INFPThis literally sounds Te AF tho Someone really wants to be NCritSrc is right, it just seems like your responses for this thread speak for themselves at this point. I don't have to argue for it to come out. Lolol nailed itI was about to say "not really competitive" but lol the up my sleeve thing is about right. I think I've actually said "COUNTERFLUX COMIN IN CLUTCH" during a group MtG game before. &gt;I hate responsibility. I'd kill a man to get out of it.

Lolololol this is hilarious how you phrased it. Totally agree though. I think functionally, ISTJ makes sense, but some things here are making me think INFP. I think the Fi is the most obvious to me, the way you describe yourself as sensitive, and the way you have to correct someone if something is wrong or immoral (Te-Fi! :D), but at the same time you procrastinate a lot, like to exchange ideas, etc. 

I thought ISFP, but something about the way you describe your relationship with your sister and the way that you make connections and reference the things you already know (combined with the idea exchange) makes me think Si-Ne axis. 

So I dunno exactly - I wouldn't see an INFP taking control of projects or loving rules, but ISTJs at least aren't known for hating responsibility and lots of procrastination (although these are stereotypes). So really... ISTJ or INFP, I'd maybe take a look at WHERE the functions are placed to get a better answer. 

I'm like, slightly leaning to ISTJ, but INFP wouldn't surprise me either. p: /u/CritSrc 

since I know you're online, what do you think? I'm not able to quite decide. my INTP is super similar - ESFJ mom, IxTJ dad, ISTJ sister, ISTP brother and sister. His siblings made it easier tho.But how is this nasty tho? The whole world is against you? Lost in a vortex? Wut in tarnation is happening lolol 

 You're clearly not content to be any type and your relief when someone finally gives you an NT type is obvious. 
ISFJ, I didn't think of that one. 

Honestly if op is an infp who also relates to ISTJ they've probably got a good thing going lmao I would love some STJ qualities tbh I have serious Te envy. Why are you so invested in being seen as an NT type? Despite your claim to not feeling like an INTJ at first, you're much more open to receiving a type of INTJ rather than ISTJ. 

Why is that? Why do you phrase it like "people screaming STJ" at you? Why do you think people are ganging up on you? Nobody here is being aggressive or rude. People are handing you justifications left and right, though. No one is throwing this at you with nothing, but at some point, the benefit of explanation is outweighed by your clear aversion to being typed as anything but an NT. 

I didn't just read one sentence and go "lol STJ hahaha". Although the more I read from you, the more certain I am that you're an STJ lolmaybe I'm just a mistyped INTJ *sigh* all these impressions 

you assume I don't have any reasoning behind my typing despite my giving you some of them, but it just takes a lot to get me to put in that much effort to someone who is getting STJ from most sides anyway. Like... Do you think people are making it up just to annoy you? Aasrrggghhhhlllllrrrtggh fine fine fine give me a bit Sounds ENFP to me o:no you're wrong

Sorry just wanted to argue but yeah, I don't see anything to really contradict it Honesty, INTP seems most likely o: 

The trying to be diplomatic and failing seems inferior Fe, the curiosity and procrastination typical Ne, Ti accounting for the need for precision and sort of cold/detached vibe, etc. 

That he is a creature of habit yet doesn't mind adapting (just finds comfort in it) seems Ne-Si to me specifically (VS being an istp).Let's also consider that OP literally clings to definitions like static to a wool sweater. If it's not by the book and what she's familiar with, it's WRONG. If it's not a factual assertion, GTFO. 

OP literally PM'd me with the idea that I am **determined** to "expose" her as an SJ, and went to another sub to complain and have people tell her differently. 

This stubborn, black-and-white thinking reeks of Si-Te. One thing I notice with auxiliary Se users is that they have a more obvious "resting" state than their dom Se counterparts. An ESxP will often jump into something and draw their conclusions, where as an ISxP will be more likely to consider what jumping in means and if it's worth it (whether it makes sense or whether something is important enough to them), and then do or don't. 

My mental image is like, a grumpy grandpa dude who sighs and goes "i guess i better do something about this" before getting out of a comfy armchair to go yell at children or something.God, I must be in a Delta quadrant mood, or something. Someone else type OP cause I think I'm just seeing patterns now. @.@ 

You definitely have Fi... The way things can just be "wrong", your deep beliefs and convictions, how you don't care what people think + your focus on being authentic and true to yourself. Very Fi-heavy. 

Ne I'm not quite as certain on - your wanderlust and desire for new people/connections seems to point to it, but that could easily be Se. I could also see Si in the way you feel bound to responsibility and obligation (could justify via Fi or Te). 

TL;DR: Definitely Fi-Te axis. Ne-Si axis I'm less sure of. It sounds pretty INFP to me o: What makes you think you're an INTP? Even your bit about overthinking seems more Ne than Ti to me, hehe. Deeeeefinitely Ne in there, though, no doubt about it. Actually considered if you were ENFP or not. You think so? I guess that makes sense... My INTP rarely does, maybe has considered ISTJ/ISTP before. You'd think the Ne would boost that, but maybe not. O: I always assume Ne users are as indecisive as I am lmao 

He even tells me "why do you keep questioning your type? There's just not anything else that really works" I think the wild conjecturing wouldn't be so present in someone who's supposed to be an Ni dom, but that's a good point. I was considering IxTJ as well, but it's not just "principles set in stone" that indicate Si usage. 

As the arguing continued, it just seems clear that OP refers to certain rules and stereotypes as reference points. There's this idea of what certain types ARE and certain functions ARE, and what they definitively are not. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's not just memories and such, as the black-and-white is often attributed to Te, but that's Si at work. 

OP has this kind of playbook that they're mistaking for Ti that outlines the regulations and she's always referring back. That's why it's telling when she asks for my definition of Si - it's essentially "if what I know is wrong, then replace it". The "give me facts" is more Te to me, but yeah. 

That, combined with the touches of Ne (the distractability in the writing itself, the annoyance/denigration of Ne as something that gets in the way) is what to me, points to Si-Ne. It's not just the way OP talks about Ne (or I could see Ne as demonstrative being something to consider) but how it's sort of sprinkled throughout the narrative and isn't only purposely pointed to. It's consciously pointed out, but also used unconsciously and adds a certain flavor. 

I think Te-Fi is much, much clearer. Te is almost self-illuminating lol. I think Fi contributes to a certain stubbornness, but I also see it in the way that OP phrased the threads' contributors as people who are out to get her or have this "motive", a bit self-victimizing in tone if that makes sense. Not as apparent as the Te, which is why I chose that order in her typing. I can see the argument for Ni, but that seems like a weirdly unhealthy usage for somebody with it first in their stack. Not impossible, though. Just less likely imo. 

IxTJs are both pretty stubborn, but I think the "this is what I know to be true, and this is why it is - provide me a new landing point and facts to support it if you want my consideration" pretty much blows through Si-Te-Ne in that order. "I will consider these alternate perspectives IF you meet the criteria for why they should even land in my consideration set". 

More conjecture on my part, but I think Fi definitely plays a role in the stubbornness, even if you consider ISFJ vs. ISTJ. Fi is all about authenticity, it's self-centered in nature (as are most of the introverted function), and if it perceives the idea of the self (especially an idea that's been vetted and propped up by Si-Te) is being attacked, you get that big shutdown. 

Hence why OP is PMing people and posting in other threads p: They're a bit more jarred than they're letting on. 

That's my reasoning though. I was dead serious when I said ISTJ, I just devolved into antagonizing because of who I am as a human. 

LOL Impulsiveness is actually often linked with Se, haha. Although mental illness will certainly color your typing. When they ask how you make decisions... I don't think it just comes down to Fx or Tx, but that's just me. 

When you open something sealed, why are you doing it? Is it just because you want it? I would imagine so, lol. When else are you impulsive? What are you thinking right when you make that decision? And actually, what are the consequences you fear? Do you want your mom to not yell because you don't want her to feel bad? Because she might restrict your freedom somehow? etc. 

And as for Fi vs. Ti, that's more about... The most succinct thing I can think of is what's right vs. what's true. And conversely, Te vs. Fe - How does x affect your objective, vs. how will x affect others? Obviously these are really, really incomplete summaries but still. 

Basically, the types are prescriptive, not descriptive. At least for behaviors. People of different types might do the same thing for different reasons, so when you're looking at typing yourself, you'll want to identify your thought processes and motivations. That will lead you somewhere closer than just using your behaviors. That makes sense. Conflict avoidance can be a result of Fe or Fi, the justification is different so that's why it's good to peek at motivations rather than just the behavior alone. O: You're not wrong. O: I could be tho. I've seen some conflict avoidance in INFPs, but it always seems more as a self-serving "this isn't worth it/this is going to be rough" kind of thing, rather than a genuine "I don't want to ruin the atmosphere for anyone or make them uncomfortable" for the sake of others.  

But this is why I'm not the only one typing, lol. Everything is open to interpretation. Oh yeah, it does. I always question my type LOL. Although to be perfectly honest, I can NOT pick up Ni. At all. I don't know what it looks like or sounds like online or in person. I don't understand it in any way shape or form, and I can only identify the absence of it. 

Which is a HUGE Ti-logic flaw lolol since it goes: I see Ne --&gt; looks smol --&gt; I see things that could mean more Si -- Probably Si-Ne then --&gt; There's definitely Te, so must be Fi. I use negatives a lot which leads to a number of flaws in my methods, but that's my biggest problem. I can only identify it by a "gap" left by a lack of other fitting dom/aux functions. 

I think I'm also more flexible with the way that functions manifest/my interpretation and try to avoid typing based on behavior at all, although stylistic stuff will factor in somewhat. So when someone says "I do X" and doesn't provide a motivation or thought process behind it, I just tuck that piece of information away for later without actually using. 

The masquerading thing seems to just mostly be using too much behavior to type vs. the whys behind it. Any type can do anything, but they'll do it for different reasons. Conversely, people of the same type can behave vastly differently, despite using the same functions. Behaviors are just trends and tendencies imo p: How old are you? And what's your type?

Regardless, she's probably burnt out dude. Supporting someone through unemployment is hard. Supporting someone through mental illness or emotional stress is also really hard. Make it both, and it sounds utterly exhausting. 

If she's already pulling away, it's a pretty bad sign, and odds are she's not going to tell you the truth in order to spare your feelings. If you can't even get transportation and a job figured out, she'll probably take off soon. She signed up to be a girlfriend, not a mother. 

You're saying "I know my lack of [these things] may be getting to her as well" but unemployment and such aren't the "as well", they're almost certainly the primary reason for her discontent. If you weren't grateful enough at first, that might have drained her battery quicker... but yeah. 

Since you probably know most of this on some level, my only real advice (besides "lol get a job") would be to make a plan. Sit down, look at your assets, identify your opportunities, create a reasonable timeline, and create action items along the way. How many applications a day will you send? What kind of transport will you use? What's your goal for employment? Get creative and buckle down where you can. If you show her you're making a concrete, tangible plan that you'll stick to, it might inspire some faith (as long as you follow through). what in tarnationi have no idea lolol but very broody and descriptive, maybe ISFP? idk Ni totally goes over my head but I can sniff out Ne like a bloodhound LOL So much more succinct than mine. a+Depends on what game, probably. Some games are more suited to certain functions more than others. O: are you still on this twelve hours later lmao Pretty much how I felt the entire discussion p:Basically but it's kind of false flag Ne p: and tbh I get a crush on any STJ girl that stands within 15 feet of me so I can't say I disagree. You rang?I live off of smoothies, coffee, and meal replacement drinks. And vitamins. I wonder why you so badly want to be told you're an NT. We are so likeable .-.Fi users. I understand on one level what they mean, but the idea of something just being wrong, that's it... Idk. Hard for me to wrap my mind around. That's your tertiary function p: We went through this same process yesterday. OP had a lowkey meltdown over being typed as ST lelYou still love me.I think I typed as ISTJ and ISFJ first LOL. I eventually took the test again like two years later and got pissed. My seriousness never actually wavered. I think you should have probably conducted that research yesterday, when a dozen others all explained to you for various reasons why they thought you are an ISTJ. But that's just me. Considering you've changed it all so much in order to get the typing you really want... Not much to draw from on my end. Watching you yesterday gave me the information I needed. Looking at your post history and your violent reaction to being an STJ and the way you cling to any NT typing, nah. It's obvious that this post is what you think you should sound like to be typed as an NTP specifically. Even though there is zero about you that's NTP. 

It's not even your last OP that sealed your fate, it was your live reactions. You PM'd me offering POETRY. You went to another subreddit, linking people to your thread and asking them to help. You even said that I was trying to "expose" you as an STJ. That's like, freakishly opposed to being an STJ lolol The genuine portrayal is the way you respond to people. Those are the actions that aren't carefully calculated with any ulterior motives. Those are what I go by, and no NTP would react the way you did unless they were a step and a half from the loony bin. "You're just generalizing!" 

*two seconds later*

"Here are all of the NTP stereotypes I fit!" No I am very smart. 

I say as I try to capitalize "I" for emphasis three times before realizing it's already capitalized...*IHQPOSITIVE LIKES RACISM, EVERYBODY*Uhh, yeah you would. Plenty of people do. Especially if you believe you are an NTP. You would take this effort and create a post specifically because you see yourself in a certain way and it upset you yesterday when others didn't agree. There's plenty of evidence suggesting you're jonesing for an NT typing.I agree, you're weirdly obsessed in such a non-productive manner. Sigh. Silly stubborn STJs...Here is why I think you just want validation that you're an NT type...

**PM:**

“Here's some material to assist you if you really want to expose me as an STJ” – *PM header... "expose" lol ok*

“I'll have to admit I still write a lot of poems and I'll give you the link of my blog if you really want to check out a poem or two to determine I'm an Intuitive or not.” – *YOU OFFERED POETRY TO CHECK IF YOU ARE INTUITIVE.*

“The blog is entirely private but I just want to settle this and I hope that it will provide some insight that will crush your SJ fantasy.” – *“crush your SJ fantasy”? is that a joke?*

**older posts:**

“I'm still in a dilemma. To this day. I definitely know I'm an NT type. So what If I am an INTJ or an INTP or an INTj or any other NT type? How does it really matter? That's how I convince myself I'm wasting time but I get right back to it the next day. I have no biases about the NT types.” – *a few months back, basically saying “which NT type am I?”*

“Oh C'mon. I guess these misunderstandings arise from lack of data or certain biases.” – *when someone types you as not NT*

“Extremely good arguments and I'd love to contradict you but I've decided on the INTj socionics type or loosely the mbti INTP type so not worth arguing.” – *someone had good arguments but you decided on INTP and that’s that…*

“I know. I know. I'll get bashed up by you guys but I only typed myself using the mbti combinations but they didn't agree with my logic” - *lawl*

**more recently:**

“Although your reasoning is quite commendable, I cannot be more horrified at how you failed to notice Intuition in my writing.” – *horrified? rly?* 

“Serious SJ vibe? How horrific! Just kidding. Although, I do not really identify with any SJ's if you consider Keirsey's temperaments.” – *suuuuuure just a joke*

“You're just too biased right now. I have completely justified reasons to believe I'm an Intuitive.” 

“The truth is, people aren't willing to explore the context provided and are stressing irrational points. It is unmistakable that I prefer Intuition to Sensation.” 

“It's pathetic that people can't even differentiate between N and S, even when so much context is there to refer to.”	

“The fact that I am still trying to explain my position through reason and haven't already quit arguing and am also very excited to see this through proposes the NTP nature or more possibly, the INTP nature.” – *not at all buddy*

“I have considered their perspectives. I know why they're wrong.” 

“I'm marshalling forces to crush your unreasonable ideas. If other people provide insights, then it's useful all the same.” – *CRUSH MY UNREASONABLE IDEAS WHAT IN TARNATION*

“I have to say I'm quite busy fighting an ENTP on the mbti subreddit who's hell bent on proving I'm an STJ. Lend me a helping hand and see things for yourself, could you?” – *you literally are trying to rally people so they will not type you as STJ*

“I am perfectly content to be any type so long as the reasoning is sound. Either that people are misinterpreting my post or really do not know what Si really is.” – *those are the only two options, really…*

“This is wonderful! Great observations, I thought that I had an emotional attachment to the INTJ type and thought that no, I should think with a clear head.” – *no burden of proof required here and totally psyched to be typed as INTJ*

/r/ISTJ is calling you, /u/Random_converser ... 

(I almost don't want to inflict you on them tbh, ISTJs don't deserve this) 


fuckin kekI'm just a filthy stubborn ESTJ out to bring everyone down to my levelTHROW THEM TO THE VIPERS*flicks tongue**your italics broke and i don't do unsafe code*not as broken as my soulo-oh my 

I'll get the rope- er, I mean string. for arts and crafts.SEIZE THE MEANS OF REPRODUCTION 

errbut why tho 

Idk man Fi... where does it come from? Is it just some random guilt or feeling like something is right or wrong? WHO TELLS YOU THESE THIGNS. Have y'all taken the love languages test? That might make it easier if you haven't yet, because it makes sense that everyone gives and receives affection in a different way. Explaining that you thrive best with words of affirmation shouldn't be too difficult for him to grasp and that him doing that for you is a way of "translating" his language to yours in a way you understand better. wat

Like I get it but I also don't get it. I'm just missing some internal component. My INFP roomie tries to explain and I just can't. I'm not denigrating it at all, it's just kind of baffling. The concept of Fi makes zero sense.Yeah, I guess I just don't grasp it much. *grumble*It's a vacuum honestly. A black hole of something I can't figure out or seem to feel for myself. I've noticed we're more detached than our F counterparts. And kind of more annoying/obnoxious, but that's just me. Both types are intensely curious, but ENFPs tend to be warmer and more concerned with authenticity and other people. They build up. ENTPs usually prefer to deconstruct, as is the nature of Ti. I don't trust my Fe LOL Ti tho is all good your mom hahahahaahhhahhahahahaahah

or intpsIf I suck at driving, then am I an ENFP??? FUCK omg why are you so obsessed with meLol if he wouldn't take something like that seriously or at least entertain the point of it... then idk what to tell you. OH god, that sounds exactly like my INTP, regarding the "true unless an update is given" thing hahaha. 

I think the only reason he's decent at compliments is because he does appreciate a kind word as validation. The tests seem a bit cheesy, but like you said, the idea is there. I've always wanted a crazy stalker, honestly. * *-* * But yay~!I'll run you over nextsaaaaaaameIt can hold a job, likes cats, and won't beat me up? 

hahaha you think i have standardsNot really though o_o maybe you're just a shitty stalker. ;D Cause my age and gender and location get mentioned a lot, you could also figure out my age and general location by the way I talk. You could also probably figure out my career and infer my education level pretty easily. Combine that with photos and other top-rated comments, and I'd be so easy to find. 

I wonder if anyone's made a program that could run through a comment/post history and pick out sentences with numbers, locations, career/job-related stuff, and make it easier to sift through in order to find potential information. I'm sure they have. Hm. 

I really like stalking people too. I'm only kidding. p: I do actually have pretty high standards. Less of an "I deserve it" thing and more of an "I'm vulnerable and can't afford to pick out a shitbird" thing. :D There are a ton of ENFP vs. ENTP threads here lately, might want to sift through some of those. There are 3-5 alone in the past week. Besides that, idk exactly. How do you mean by blunt? Like, give me an example of a conversation where you might act like that and what you might say.

For my own interactions, I find that I'm unintentionally coarse or I put things the wrong way, and I needle, but I'm not really harsh like BLAM. My main motivators are primarily to hunt down information, take things apart, and to do absolutely nothing with it afterward. 

Unfortunately, sometimes that looks like stepping on a landmine and going "oh shit" when I piss someone off. Other ENTPs will do so, but I rarely like to intentionally upset someone (yesterday here notwithstanding lol), especially if I hurt their feelings. Depends on the 'flavor' of ENTP. I'm more of the "curiosity killed the cat" kind of breed, where I don't like negative social consequences and try to avoid them. Others might not mind or even enjoy them. 

I think ENFPs tend to build up and ENTPs deconstruct. What motivates you in life? What spurs you into action? What do you enjoy? Also, what makes you stop something? Shame and social rejection will curb my bad habits pretty easily, lol. 

Not yet it hasn't. ;D 

I dunno, I guess I just don't have much worry over it. My info is p public and I don't really care if people see anything I post. If I really want relative anonymity, I'd just make a throwaway. p: 

Besides, unless someone shows up with a knife (mostly... I'm kinda into that so even that's variable)  I'd probably just be like HI :D You do or don't? I think that changes the tone quite a bit LOL I think ENxPs all have their social struggles, but it basically boils down to whether it's more important that things are correct or things are right. o: &lt;33 

ETA: its jojo to you shitlordbut im tired...I'd make it interesting. ;D your username is interesting actually I found a couple spots that I think were you. P: It was an accident XD You assume I don't want the car to hit me lmao 

But yeah, it's not a gut feeling because I know that if I run while there are cars I could possibly get hit. That's a pretty basic thing I'd imagine. How do YOU figure out if you should play in traffic or not? I couldn't imagine going by a feeling, I only look both ways because someone else told me the consequences and it makes sense. 

If I didn't know a car could hit me I'd probably just walk out on the street because I don't usually learn a lesson until after the consequences hit me. In this case, literally. Lol wait reallyHey baby how u doinOh, yeah... My boyfriend usually yanks me back from the road so I don't get hit but he's INTP so I think this might just be a personal failing lmao.

I don't know why anyone lets me go anywhere unattended. Fuckin kek lmao ISTJs are a reddish-purple to me. Idk I'm pretty gay so give me chicks but I'll take a dude I... Was dead serious. I really am that much of an evolutionary failure. Any kind of Fi users, although I'm defining the more stereotypical FPs for sure. Huh. I can understand finding the best outcome for all, but that's about it. Maybe the Te &gt; Fi is more relatable than the other way round. I imagine INTP girls, yes. I've met one who I suspect was INTP and I think she got it on the test but idk for sure. Definitely crushed on her. STJ guys... Don't think I've closely associated with any, honestly, except for one who I think is adorable but I'm scared I would corrupt him. The most notable example was my infp roommate saying he'd never lie on a resume for a job because his lie might screw someone more deserving out of a job, and lying is bad. Even though his job fucking sucked and he was miserable. He said it was just wrong and he wouldn't be able to live with himself.

I understand where he's coming from but it just baffles me I guess. You're fascinating enough to stalk...It's pretty easy lol just sort by topi just use my freedom to share weird sex or medical stuff and just not care if people know Another lady ENTP?No, you're a disappointment haha Oh sadmeMaybe I'm just pretty high but this seems weirdly spot on xNTP... I mean all I do is MBTI shitposting so I probably do contribute 

ETA: I was pretty high when I posted my comment tho *vomit*It was supposed to be an attempt at humor but my jokes don't always workActual answer: 

1. People who rely too heavily on stereotypes when trying to assist someone else in typing. I see people wandering into /r/entp freaking out because they're not in engineering and thus either aren't entp or are doomed to misery. 

2. General NT superiority complexes. Not everyone, but the ones who do it are pretty obnoxious. Nice thread idea. I'm ENTP. 

**Ways I am like my type:** 

-Tech/science nerd

-Insatiable curious

-Obnoxious, think i'm funnier than I am

-I occasionally enjoy antagonizing people, had my 4chan edgy phase

-I like to discuss things and talk forever, good conversations are 5/7

-Very open-minded, sometimes eccentric

-Forgetful, scatter-brained, easily distracted

-Can hold my own in an argument if need be

-I like taking things apart and I'm pretty good at spotting inconsistencies

**Ways I'm not like my type:**

-Much "softer" for whatever reasons in demeanor

-I don't really like debating and prefer to circumvent people, unless they have information I want

-Takes a lot more effort to get me to confront or jump into something, even if I know the topic well. More likely to do a drive-by information drop.

-I think I act a lot more bubbly, especially online, and generally more optimistic

-Less likely to be a jerk for no reason

-Less energetic and more reserved as a whole, especially IRL 


I think people who "want to be" NT types are usually those with inflated egos anyway, so they see the descriptions and immediately go for those. Also, NT descriptions are way flattering, what with INTP quiet genius and INTJ mastermind tropes and all.

Also NT and NF get better descriptions as whole imo. Much more interesting and unique, where a lot of sensor descriptions read like "lol you're a housewife" or "you're a jock go pick up a ball". 
This is actually super interesting, great article. I would say that my time in an MBTI chat room has been overall very positive, but I don't hold my own very well in more general populations. 

I think one of the benefits of personality typing groups is that differences and similarities are purposely highlighted. If people avoid falling into stereotyping and other common pitfalls, then the common ground of MBTI makes it easier to understand people who are different from us. It's nice. I'm sure that's true, too. There are probably a number of reasons honestly p: I'm not a big fan of philosophy, but to me, "deep" conversations are a way of connecting with people. It gives the opportunity to explore someone else's perspective rather intimately, get new ideas, figure out what someone is all about, etc. It's normal to crave connection and to want to be understood.

I think it's just important to not be too pretentious about it or try to gatekeep. "Deep" could entail literally exploring any topic further, whether it's pop music, weather, or baseball. Meaningful conversations don't have to be about particular topics. Yeah, that's where the pretentiousness comes in lol. Because they think nebulous subjects that most people aren't that interested in are the markings of a smart person. 1. Source? In terms of "giftedness", NTs and NFs sit just about equal, and it's the INTPs who are the heavy hitters there. IQ and MBTI isn't well established as a whole, and that doesn't take into account different types of intelligence. 

2. INTPs have the second lowest income at 36k a year, ENTJs have the second highest at 76k a year, and ENTPs and INTJs tend to middle out at 48k and 52k a year, respectively. SJs beat out NTs by about 6k a year, on average. NTs also aren't high on general satisfaction. 

3. Higher goals? Um... Where? How?

Fun fact: NTs are more likely to be unemployed than SJ or NF types. We barely edge out SPs. 1. Cognitive functions. Check out the sidebar links. O: It's not all I vs. E, N vs. S. We all have N, S, T, and F traits. 

2. MBTI isn't who you are or what behaviors you do. It's just basically your preferences and priorities in the way you think and perceive. 

3. Following that, you aren't "supposed" to be anything, and there's no career or hobby that you can't do due to your MBTI type. Stereotypes come from tendencies. People who are ENTJ often have skillsets and preferences that lend themselves well to business, but that doesn't mean they can't do music, and it doesn't mean other types don't succeed in business. They just might go about it a little differently. 


Hey, you can't use life experience to make sweeping statements. p: Granted, these sources use the usual tests we shit on here, but there's not much else to go on. 

Intelligence and giftedness: 

The biggest leg to stand on for NT superiority would be intelligence. Most studies for "giftedness" and intelligence tend to show that intuitives as a whole fall into this category more, with the NFs trailing just behind NT types. 

However, one thing to consider would be the nature of IQ and other aptitude tests and how they measure. I've found in personal experience, I score well on IQ tests as there is a big emphasis on pattern-finding, which is huge for Ne. (Wouldn't know about Ni on an anecdotal level). 

Haven't looked into MBTI and academic success, but that may be where the "misunderstood genius" stereotype of the xNTP comes from. The same advantage lending itself to us scoring well on IQ tests also makes it more difficult to succeed in traditional academic and professional settings. 

It's all nebulous, but I can potentially give you that.

(Do note that the second is household income, so we'd have to know who these types are all marrying...) 

This one's pretty easy to figure out. Could be a mixture of J types usually doing better professionally and extroverts being in more management and supervisory roles. 

Job satisfaction: 

http://www.businessinsider.com/people-with-these-personality-types-are-happiest-at-work-2015-4

Feelers and extroverts tend to have the most satisfaction, and I think the article goes through some solid potential reasons for that. 

Unemployment: 

http://www.businessinsider.com/personality-type-most-likely-to-be-unemployed-2015-7

Dunno why on this one. The differences aren't stark, except for the SJs, as their average is 3.8%. NF is 5.3%, NTs are 5.5%, and SPs are 5.7%. 

I'm not saying NTs have no valuable attributes, but having a superiority complex based on it might be a little presumptuous. I'm assuming you were deadass serious here with your original comment though, lol p: What was the old record??I feel you on the witty comebacks. I'm a constant victim of l'esprit d'escalier. FML. I'm confused, do you want us to think about your past life or ours? http://www.typeinmind.com/

I like that website a lot. If you basically google "mbti cognitive functions" you'll find a whole host of information. A lot of them have things I like and don't like about them, so I don't have an opinion of any best or worst. 

And yes, that's why we get stereotypes. p: But if you're not careful, that's how mistyping happens. Two types can enter the same field or show a particular behavior, but for completely different reasons. Same on the outside, but the mind is cranking in different ways. That's why imo it's important to consider the motivation behind the actions. 

A depressed, sad, demotivated ENTP could look like an ISxJ for a number of reasons, but if you look behind the exterior, you still find the guts of the ENTP there, just moving in a different way than the usual. o: But how do they make you wiser and more capable of thinking? Or how do they do so more than other areas of contemplation? What kind of help do you offer? What kind of people do you like? Do you think you would be happier if people did listen to you more? Hehehe I figured as much. I like nebulous and vague, but it leaves me unable to make any definitive statements or come to any real conclusions. p: You have to be careful, sometimes it's just a gas bubble. *triggered*Hmm I think I actually read that before while sifting through Aurarus's history. p: A little generalizing, so while it helps me understand on one level, I kind of still don't comprehend anything more. 

Fe is... Damn it. Good question. Hnng. I guess for myself personally, I have certain goals and things I want, and Fe seems to manifest in a "I need to be diplomatic and fit in so that things stay peaceful and I can do the things I want to do without much interference" kind of way.  I just associate with the right people. (8 *giant shrug* 

me neitherI think I can kind of understand this. Like, I seek an objective truth as well that I search for and break down wherever I can. But I could see how if someone feels truly that there is none, then maybe there IS a truth, but it's just subjective and you have to figure out your own? And that's the truth? 

(Don't know if I'm off the mark or not)I think /u/Were_All_Wrong explained it really well and it ties into the idea of subjective/relative truth vs. the idea of an objective truth. If this is the case, it makes WAY more sense now.  Damn son you about nailed this one. 

It feels like my goal/target is ever-shifting and that my sense of self and personality seems to mold around that search for something that's by nature indefinite and impossible to pin down. 

I think NTPs, especially ENTPs, are just absurd as a whole lmao. I guess if those are the things they hold dearest, then in a way they're making the best decision for themselves, so why take anything else into consideration? I think almost nothing is objective on a grander scale. o: So I can see why someone would make decisions that appear irrational to others, since rational doesn't always mean factual.Yes I do! Especially the unsolved ones. :D the NTs I've befriended are pretty silly :D More NTPs than Js, but still. Anything, really. Interesting is pretty subjective, but are you saying that philosophy would make someone wiser/a better thinker than discussing like, aliens, or sports, or whatever? 

I just saw a thread in r/INTP about how to move topics into a deeper realm of conversation regardless of the initial topics, which I think aligns more closely with what I think. stop that Mine actually seems quite fitting. I've always thought in terms of orientation, I would rank it future -&gt; past -&gt; present, which seems to be the case here. o: 

Also, any reading material on I/E and east Asia? That just caught my eye. 

I got: 

"Past thinking (Certainty): 8 (41%)
Present thinking (Probability): 2 (10%) 
Future thinking (Possibility): 9.5 (49%)

Your way of thinking generates: 

* Many ideas and a need for quiet time to evaluate them

* A need for facts despite your eagerness to move forward on efforts *(this bullet got repeated btw, might want to let your friend know!)*

* An aptitude for spotting the unusually brilliant initiatives from the rest

* A resonance with brands and products that are creative and informing

* A strong sense of quality and design that, for you, trumps cost

You will always blend Possibility with Certainty; it brings the best of both innovation and reason to your world."Any unexplained phenomena (weather, space, etc.), conspiracy theories, unusual crimes and murders, unknown illness and medical anomalies, things of those natures. A bit morbid, but I find comfort in the strange.That's a fair point to make regarding philosophy specifically. Do you think that a less in-depth discussion on philosophy is more beneficial than the same level on another topic? Fair enough o: That's a good point. But even the idea of having a subjective truth is subjective in itself. We might not have a common destination but most people are going through similar journeys and I think that's enough common ground p:http://imgur.com/a/9DuAS

My dad is an ENTJ p: I don't always agree with him but I understand why he comes to certain solutions.

ETA: I'm gonna cosplay as her :D I might be the only DFW person? ;-; i feel like you could teach me to jet skiwtf you're attractiveWhy smh? D:I think Austin dislikes y'all more tbhOoh, change of flair~? 

I have to disagree, at least for ENTPs. It depends on which flavor you're dealing with, but I've definitely been described as sly before. I don't really see it as a bad thing, definitely more in the mischievous/impish/playful sense. Manipulative might be a stretch... less so for ENTPs, but definitely for INTPs. INTPs have this vulnerable, childlike Fe - I don't think many of them could manipulate Play-Doh. p: ENTPs, possibly. 

I think I could definitely be described as sly, and have been before. But like I said in another comment, more in a mischievous, playful type of way rather than malicious. 

I think there is an issue with this, though. The things you are describing may or may not be flaws. The traits you describe as "controlling and cold" might be "in control and objective" to the owner. "quick to take offense" could also be "passionate and sensitive". Same traits, different perspectives. Suuuuuuuuuuuure hehe. 

It's the smirk/uneven smile, right? :D I like giving people shit xD you're all sexy brooding scientists*quietly sobs* 

No I was just asking the typical ENTP look omg its okam euphoric

-aalewislove ur shirt also cute hottie alerti came bucketswell i like austin :D visiting this weekend actuallyhehehe I think so. We're a little saucy. I've actually met two INFJ males IRL, they both have the INFJ look, and the same first name.*thwp thaw* 

Yeah they do that LOL silly babesBrown hair, doe-like brown eyes, overall very soft and warm looking. Honestly just seconding this. ;D i'm the INFJ sirenYou could... say that. what in tarnation I am okay with any of that YesTHE INTJ RULE IS A THINGa/s/l baby? what's your aim status songH-hot!Heh, I was just throwing out my silly opinion. 

INTPs have never been good manipulators, in my experience. Very innocent and childish with the Fe, as the alpha quadra tends to be anyway. I could see some ENTPs being able to manipulate but I've seen worse from NFJs and STPs honestly- beta quadra, which I now just realized you were saying lmao. 

NTPs are just... Not pure and innocent lambs by any means, but we're curious and playful, mischievous, exploratory, creative. We have our bad traits, but manipulation isn't one that should be falling into the "known for" category. Preaching to the choir, I know, but yeah. 

It's really interesting seeing someone you've spoken to a few times before, to then realize they're actually very attractive.Thought you said INTP and had to wonder how many IxTP pinoy/pinay are on here. p: how could you miss it? when I hear "touring the facility and picking up slack" or "uses a machete to cut through red tape", boom, I think STJ. Someone pragmatic, low-nonsense, effective, and sharp. Hehehe nope. I mean y'all might idk. I just have a huge thing for female STJs @.@Now I feel famous and flattered *fans self*Cause it's the truth ;-;Ehh. Kind of, kind of not. I'm a very socially introverted ENTP - could almost be mistaken for INTP or ISxJ at times. There are some subtle differences that I notice between my INTP and I. 

The biggest difference I see is that he is very particular about the information he absorbs and what he's looking for. He has a framework, and within it, he will make unconventional connections and come up with novel ways to interpret things. He checks things as they come in. He's careful and cautious, more meticulous, less flexible than I am. 

On the other hand, I will absorb just about anything. I don't vet info as it comes through, I just get whatever I can, sit down later, and then pick through what I need and what I don't. I don't need to know what I'm looking for or have a system, I'll work out the details later. I'm less careful, but I respond better to pressure. I'm resourceful, a bit more eccentric, and we're both pretty lax. Aww thank you :3 llllaaaawawl so much internet flirting too. 

I do like it. I just got a new highlighter and foundation from a newer brand and love them 10000%, I'm psyched (; catch me on msn I think ENTP is supposed to be the magical match for INFJ, ENFP is the same for INTJ. I actually prefer INTJs, dating other T types has always worked best for me. 1. Nahhhhh I'll go along with it but I don't like organizing things. 

2. If it were a certain band, hell yes. Massive Attack is a band is go overseas to visit.

3. Nope. I don't have many friends and I prefer one on one time or small groups at most. Or just our group chat p:

4. I like making art and it's nice to look at. I'm not interested in the meaning or whatever behind it though. 

5. Haha nope 

6. Probably not, I'm tired 

7. Think, no doing p:

8. Drawing, Netflix, running, learning programming, cosplay.Infp? Maybe ISFP but I get an Ne vibeI was also seconding the typingsIstjISFP, maybe infp. ESTP or istp Seems Ne to me. Infp? I don't get INTP vibesINTP?You sound like me lmao ENFP or ENTP? Maybe estp but that wouldn't be a top pick ISTJ, else INTJIxTJ, else INTPINTP else ISTP? Idk about Se VS NeMore likely Ne, Si, or Ni high in stack. IxTJ else INTPESFP, else ENFP?:DI AM TAKING OVER NOW

op, you bundle of sticks

update: i deserve an mbti medal 

update 2: op you suck I'm resting my brain nowISxP? Maybe infp. Idek this one is tougher. 

ETA: I see more Se here so I'll go with ISTP, else ISFP. Si or Te up there? Kinda was thinking ISTJ, ISFJ doesn't seem fitting. Maybe INTJ?INTJ? Ni Dom and Se somewhere in the stack Hnnnnnnnnnnnng not enough to go in. Narrowing it to INTx because I just cheated and checked out your first page of comments. 

I'm totally stereotyping programmers. 

You talk a bit more like a J so INTJ idkCoin tossI only recognize like 2 people by username lol 

3rd question gave away I, your #5 gave me Si/Te, #4 eliminated FP, overall writing style and general brevity gave me TJAgree to an extent. Typing by cognition is the best way to go about it, but that information isn't always available. I prefer to type by asking about people's answers, to get an idea of their motivations. I might also trawl through their post history and see how they speak to others, what issues they speak up on and how often they do so. Or maybe information on life circumstances, medical issues, major life changes, etc. Usually that background info will give me an idea of how differently they may act or how confounding factors might show up. 

If this isn't available, then obviously it makes sense to simply use the information given to you. Typing on stereotypes and behavioral cues isn't bad in itself and you'll probably be at least close most of the time. It's just limited, is all. 

Any type CAN display any behavior. The catch is... How big do interfering factors need to be in order to get a person from their perceived type to their actual type? An ISTJ who just loves to party is way further off from the description and the further off, the less likely it is to be true. An ESTP who is overworked or going through a life change might be more tired than usual and seem less active, not that unbelievable if they mistype as IxTP or ENTP. 

I do what I can with what I have, and sometimes that's less than what I'd like. 

Also, wtf does gender have to do with it? There's plenty of medical science backing gender dysphoria and the concept of being transgender? What was the point of bringing that up?At least I'm close :D Hey same o: don't get Ni at all lmao Same 

I got a new pipe and matching lighter, I think that counts ISTJ: brevity, and username. ISTJs typically prioritize security and are often 1 or 6 in enneagram IIRC. :D idk if that's what your name was meant to refer to Also check out username To be fair, ENTPs aren't known for their social extroversion, and the changing hobbies could have been a false flag for P4 seemed Ni, 8 Se, 6 specifically Te + Se ("Do something spontaneous? Let me sort out my shit THEN hell yes")

That was my thought process p: I'm guessing INFJ? otherwise would have thought ISTP but the Ni seemed strongerFair enough o: lol I come across as INTP most the time so I can't relate, although I'm a chatterbox online or in small groups when I'm not tired.

:D heheAgreed Sweet~!

ETA: wait I know you. Nvm I probably remembered your presence in the INTP sub ANGERYContinuing things through to completion on a regular basis is probably not NTP lmao Yeah I saw more Se. Lots of stereotyping lmao I woulda said ISTJ lmao cause of the NO! 6 and 7 mostly, the spontaneity and emphasis on acting immediately. I guess Ti already stole puzzle imagery for me LOL Idk where op went and I took off work so here I am Hey I'm not stinking :c I am dirty ;D🎉🎉good thing that's my fetishHow would you describe Ne physically? O: me too, i'm the catbut can you cook me food?keen eyeRegarding transgender people: "observable evidence" =/= scientific evidence

Not a huge SJ fan, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater... sound like an NFP lolISTP? INTP? You sound like a Ti-dom/lower-order Fewhat in tarnation

but really, i couldn't say I relate to that at all. Twin studies, cultural surveys, multiple unrelated BTSc studies (yes, they take hormonal therapy into account), white and grey matter imaging (pre-hormonal)... 

I wouldn't say there's 0. not even close LOL I'm actually confused here. IST...P? I'm not usually split on J/P cause functions but meh. ISTJ? 

 Bah, I remember you. ;-; sorryINFP or ISFPnope! That makes more sense than how I interpreted your original comment. 

Would some of the neurological studies not show this? If I'm understanding correctly, many of the results show that even pre-transition, transgender individuals often have physical brain structures that more closely resemble their cisgender counterparts. 

Do you believe transgenderism and gender dysphoria are more along the lines of body dysmorphia and eating disorders? Actually, I would have typed you as ESFP! o: Same functions, different order. Mine is my personality and who I am as a human being lololol. I'm pretty much insufferable IRL to all but a few. I'm super self-conscious of what people think of me, how they react, how stupid I probably sound, and it paralyzes me. I've always thought quite the opposite. I and E seem to be the most similar to me and honestly, half the type I just type with the last three letters. 

I've also found that J vs. P can sometimes (but not always) boil down to consistency/stability, for lack of a better term. Rarely do I meet or hear of a xxxJ that is less organized and flightier than their xxxP counterpart. Not that they're all disorganized and lazy (INTPs can be extremely detailed and meticulous when they choose to be), but meh. ... wait do you mean ISxx, or that you have introverted sensing (Si) in your stack? Cause those could mean very different things. same lol. I've always thought I'm just way too Ne-heavy to be an INTP, but idk. I find I don't always relate with other ENTPs and I feel more comfortable on the INTP sub.Your comment here comes off as way less organized and more spontaneous, with an undercurrent of "I know what I'm doing, believe it or not" that I often associate with ExFPs (tertiary Te). But with limited info, I'm forced to stereotype. It's a fun exercise. ISTJ? 

Anything beyond that I'm just guessing ._.holy fuck ENFP fack. default answer ISTJ or INTP. I don't know why but those two types tend to be the most curt. Can't decide if Ne or Se... Kind of leaning Ne. 

INFP? idk you're tough:D YAY. 

ISTJs and INTPs, sometimes INTJs are the people who usually answer no no no yes no no no lmao. I just came out to have a good time and honestly I'm feeling so attacked right nowI don't get credit for this one. p: 

(also that means you are both IS /and/ have Si!) (ETA: Edited to label links more neatly.)

Not entirely true. At least in some ways, they do have brains that are more similar to the opposite sex. 

["White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment. A diffusion tensor imaging study."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

["Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19341803)

Also, be careful to not conflate suicide attempt vs. success rates. I think the attempt for homosexual and bisexual youths is anywhere from 20-30%, depending on the source, with transgender people at 40-41% (or 51%, in one study). American Association of Suicidology says there's about 1 success for every 25 attempts. If you have 100 transgender people, and 50 attempt to kill themselves, 2 will succeed. 

Of course, that's just a statistical average, so it could be anywhere from 2-10% success rate, which is still astronomical. p: There aren't a lot of completion statistics for some reason, unless I'm looking in the wrong place. 

Familial and other types of social support (barring leadership support, weirdly enough - noted in first link) are actually very strong indicators of reduced suicide attempts in transgender individuals. Another indicator is that those undergoing transition and/or in possession of corresponding documents are also less likely to make an attempt. 

["Intervenable factors associated with suicide risk in transgender persons: a respondent driven sampling study in Ontario, Canada"](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2)

["Family Rejection, Social Isolation, and Loneliness as Predictors of Negative Health Outcomes (Depression, Suicidal Ideation, and Sexual Risk Behavior) Among Thai Male-to-Female Transgender Adolescents"](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19361653.2014.910483)

["Impacts of Strong Parental Support for Trans Youth"](http://transpulseproject.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Impacts-of-Strong-Parental-Support-for-Trans-Youth-vFINAL.pdf)

Another factor to consider is transgender/LGBTQ+ violence. o:

["Sexual Assault and the LGBTQ Community"](http://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-assault-and-the-lgbt-community)

[Office for Victims of Crime - "Responding to Transgender Victims of Sexual Assault"](https://www.ovc.gov/pubs/forge/sexual_numbers.html)

It's estimated that about 1 in 2 (anywhere from 40-60+%) transgender individuals will experience a sexual assault, for instance, which is alarmingly higher than other demographic groups. I think the only one even close to that is bisexual women. Being gay, bisexual, transgender, etc. also indicates a higher risk of homelessness and poverty, which are also risk factors for depression, anxiety and suicide. 

["Psychiatric impact of gender-related abuse across the life course of male-to-female transgender persons."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19568976)

^^ Study on the psychiatric effects of assault on gender non-conforming victims. 

There are a lot of confounding factors that come into play when it comes to LGBTQ+ populations, especially with transgender people, as they are the least understood segment so far and experience some of the highest rates of violence and discrimination. We should be careful not to underestimate these effects when looking at their mental health and overall well-being. 

["Fact check: study shows transition makes trans people suicidal}](http://transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm)

Here's a link to an interview with the original author of that Swedish study that's often cited as why trans medical care isn't effective for transgender patients. The work is often misrepresented and the original conclusion was that there should be more follow-up care post-transition. 

More modern research suggests that post-surgical regret is actually rather low: 

["Effect of sex reassignment on mental well-being and quality of life"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237928)

["An Analysis of All Applications for Sex Reassignment Surgery in Sweden, 1960-2010: Prevalence, Incidence, and Regrets"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262734734_An_Analysis_of_All_Applications_for_Sex_Reassignment_Surgery_in_Sweden_1960-2010_Prevalence_Incidence_and_Regrets)

Ultimately, we don't know much about transgender people as a whole, but we're learning more and it's important to understand why a not-insignificant portion of the population is so depressed and prone to suicide. A lot of research points to social support and trauma as indicators against and for suicide attempts, and that transitioning is one of the most effective treatments. 

Against, it's not proven, but when people's lives are concerned, I prefer not to pass a judgment.  Hahahaha it's okay, I already looked :D intj females are attractive. law of mims.(8 Oh, I hope so...Ne is most commonly associated with daydreaming. Doesn't mean others can't, but Ne is about creating connections and is less concrete than Se. A N X I E T Y lol 

There's a threshold where, up until it's met, I operate better under pressure. This varies with what kind of pressure I'm under, though. Afterwards, I freak out. I get the nice paralyzing anxiety where I basically pretend the problem doesn't exist, allow it to fester, and then promptly freak out even more. yeah, but I'm laaaaaaazy ;-; fine...yes i do :D fixedAhhhh... shit. I'm kind of thinking Ji/Pe. Introverted, chronically disorganized. IxxP? Leaning towards IxFP. I would initially think ISFP, but something about 4 makes me think Ne-Si. 

INFP?
INFP, else ISFP? ISTJ, else INTJ.ENTP..? Idk, thought INTP but "I'll definitely come to a party" lolol I saw the flair before reading the message ;-; 

Woulda been ESFP for my guess, most likely, but I'm biased p:saw the infp flair sorry ;-; 

Although honestly I woulda said ISTJ haha. INTP, else INFP? ISTP, else INTP? Hmmm... ExxP for sure. You seem more impulsive/mobile than the average ENxP, but more detached than the average ExFP. But there also was a touch of Fi in the "eco warrior status" thing. And something about "how much does a jumping castle cost" said Ne. p: 

ExTP? Or ESFP. ISTP, else INTP ? IdkYour name and flair kinda ruined the guessing part LOL 

Would have gone for ExTP, mayyyybe ISTP. 2 and 6 seem pretty Se, 1 seems really Ti ("I won't instigate, but I'll break down what you have"). And STPs seem to be very against artsy, floofy stuff. Hmm... For some reason I got ISFJ vibes but I feel like that's not right.:D was it that obvious You sound like my roommate lol. He's the same way.Yeah, that answer alone would have sealed INTP lmao YES YES YES YES YES 

YEEEESSSSS 

:D Nice. That tripped me up for sure. p: Hehe, I made an assumption from "I hate planning stuff" "fizzled out like every other attempt at organization in my life" "think while doing". p: 

well fuck idk. Yeah you sounded pretty FP to me so I'll throw the towel in on this one.Nice. p: I feel like ISTJs, INTPs, and INTJs are the most terse, so I kind of default to those haha. They are definitely a little perkier than the norm, I'll give you that. To be fair, I can be just as excitable. 

"I like the thoughtful creativity that goes into it and how artists express themselves through it. I also consider it to be a good outlet." &lt;-- creative Ne - Fi

"Ew. No. It's alllll up in the head." goddamn perceiversFlair p: 

You sound ESTP af FWIWESFP, else ENFPINTJs do have Se in the stack, ISTJs don't. Te - Se in an INTJ can look like "I'll do something wild, let me get my shit together before I blow off steam". p: 

Not terribly different though! I was semi-joking ESFP, else ENFPI tried p:Oh, interesting! Wouldn't have guessed. Womp womp. Nice o: should've guessed that second, Si. If not ISTJ, then INTP. P:Hehe gottem &lt;3Yep~!I think that's a bit of a generalization, and narcissism (even the PD) does have a scale to it, as well as different flavors. Malignant/grandiose narcissists are less likely to be self-aware, covert narcissists may be moreso. Obviously it depends on closeness and energy level, but if we take the point of view of a stranger or maybe acquaintance, I'm pretty mild, friendly, cheery, maybe a bit checked-out and distanced. I'm also really anxious/depressed which leads me to bite my tongue to prevent from saying anything too weird, and to general quietness and reclusiveness that doesn't match how I feel internally. 

I'm at my most genuine online and with my INTP and my INFJ coworker. I go through stages: 1. I am awkward or if I'm anxious enough, appear hostile or short. 2. Someone gets to know me and they are surprised to find that I'm actually pretty funny and nice enough. 3. something happens, usually on my end, that causes them to pull away.
 
It's life. *shrug* I'm very on edge nowadays. I'm pretty lonely, too, but on Reddit I can say all of the silly stuff or lament about the things I can't otherwise. I have a weird beef with a lot of the safe havens that make all narcissists out to be monsters. Along with ASPD. I mean, I understand that most have experienced abuse at the hands of someone with NPD but they rub me the wrong way for some reason. i think NPD is rather misunderstood. I'm 22. It's been a lifelong issue, but it's become more pronounced after I got sick. I think people also don't like desperation, so it's a cycle of being lonely, reaching towards people, and feeling worse afterward. 

I can usually read into my mental state via my comment history lolol. The more drive-by commenting and "hahaha I should die" jokes, the worse off I probably am XD I really like actual INTJs. They're very nice, especially uni-age and beyond. Maturity I guess. :3 Yeah, it's never fun. I have an autoimmune illness as well so there's a lot of trying to mentally fathom my mortality as a whole. :'D mental illness doesn't help either. 

Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill myself or anything. I have a therapist and I'm surprisingly optimistic for an edgy NT. :3No feels, only dreams now. (8Fe, Ti? INFJ maybe?A bit sparse uhhhh. I for sure, F... Hmph. ISFJ?Hmm... ENFP, maybe? Think I ran outta steam lmao. I know youuuuuuuuuu INTJ?IxFP. Leaning slightly S, but not sure. LOL ExFJ by question 1. Not sure if N or S. ENFJ maybe cause of figurehead comment Uhhhhh. xSTJ?ESTJ? I'm losing my edge. p:I probably did p: I am everywhere. :DRIP. INTP? I don't know why I'm up in the alpha quadra. If not then I have no idea. p:Thank you :D I think everyone in this thread has gotten a response. :DfmlI tried :( it was like 50 people lmaoHahahaha you sound like a stereotypical ExFJ. Maybe ENFJ. :D Oh :D hi friend -_- it's not even my thread lmao That's exactly it. I do know sometimes what it is, but most of the time not... I always get so hopeful when they have that surprise like "oh! I like you!" But it ends up being a false alarm. My INTP and my INFJ coworker are the only ones who honestly know all of me and like me. But they're as fucked up as I am :DAre you not~? C;I have a really badass coat and Aria wore the same one in an episode. Just throwing that out there. I'm pretty damn cool. I think technically that'd be precise... 

I'll go ahead and change my flair to INTP now. It could be a kink dynamic. I'm creative enough to make one up. All the more to submit via bj with Not yet ~It would be a subjective thing, most likely. Someone you view as dominant flipping the script, likely by restraints and such. Probably a revenge or humiliation scenario. 

Although the INTPs I know are usually anywhere from switches to dominant anyway and also have gutter-level self-esteem. Idk I like you. It can be...Oh, I've been thinking about that (8 

That thread is just fap material rightOccasional irl friends are much easier to find and maintain. Small doses and all. Well I'll be your friend so there. 

But yeah it sucks. I'm just ambivalent to people at this point. [coat~!](https://dtpmhvbsmffsz.cloudfront.net/posts/2013/10/09/52555eee4b666526d200cb80/m_52555ef54b666526d200cb82.jpg)

I'm 90% off (don't give a fuck, wear sweats to work), 10% cool items. Oh god it is. "oh god do they like me what did I do i don't understand what their reactions mean hnnnnnng" STJs are my favorite *-* 

Most people are touching on the Si thing, but don't forget the Ne. STJs can sometimes appear as what basically amounts to an NTP who can actually get things done on a regular basis p: 

I feel like when someone is really conservative and traditional, yeah, they're likely to be an STJ or SFJ, but more flexible and non-traditional STJs usually fly under the radar. The STJs I know have this little quirky side to them that I like getting to know, NTJs are more consistently serious. STJs are fun to entertain because they give me better reactions p: Basically, it's just hard to tell which. ESFP? ISFP? i know you fmlISFJ? I can't tell... Like, at first glance, you sound like NF. But I kind of think ISTJ? It seems like you want to do stuff but you have all of these stipulations and conditions that keep you from doing so, so I'm not really sure about P. 

I don't know. Sounds like TJ type of Fi, not FP type of Fi... I recognize you and can't type you for it ;-; Well, I think you're on the Fi-Te axis, and introverted. So IFP or ITJ. I don't think you're high on Se. So... INFP, ISTJ, or INTJ... I'm not sure beyond that, though. Hm... ISTP? Hmm... You're tough. p: ISFJ or ISTJ? Maybe INFJ. I get kind of a reserved, Si vibe from what there is here, anyway. That's fair. p: 

If I had to say from this alone, not Fi. Probably extroverted. Ti-Fe axis. Number 4 is the big tipoff to that, along with number 8. 

Leaves us with ESFJ, ENTP, ESTP, ENFJ. Doing over thinking makes me eliminate ESFJ (too security-oriented). 

I would probably guess ESTP first, then ENTP but probably Se. i think you're an ISFP or INFP most of the time anywayGot a Ti &gt; Fi vibe from you. p: That or INFJ. Just a bit, but it's not a bad thing. I think extroverts in general are more obvious and easy to type. hey same :D ISTJ, maybe? NOTHING MORE PRESSING THAN MBTI your flair is on ;-; 

But honestly, I do get an Ni-Se vibe. Number 8 is very Ni, and actually 7 is SUPER telling on Ni-Se in that order. It sounds like Se sort of stresses you out. 

I would have said INTJ though. I didn't see any blatant Fe here. p: Except for 7, actually, with "everybody will think I'm lazy"... but 1 seemed more Te. Idk.  Then I have no idea. no, I just think Fi &gt; Ti Do &gt; Think, I feel like a lot of ENTPs still are think &gt; do, but obv. not all. The PoLR Fi is pretty obv. too now that I think about it. and I dunno, not much in the way of Se overall, just that 7 edged me out a big. 

ExTP is pretty clear tho. o: PURGE DAY

FREE SHELTER ANIMALS DAY (either price or the action of freeing them idk) 

Take your neighbors wife day ;D nah ISFPOP should be thrown into a pit of vipers

I honestly don't know why I felt obligated to type 60 people here (I counted). Dat Fe. ISFJ confirmed.Hehe, it's limited info. But yeah. Really the anti-Fi thing really gave it away hard lmao. 

I sometimes forget that other ENTPs are usually more extroverted than me. There are a couple of things that I think give me the ENTP tag, but otherwise I'd probably identify as INTP. Even your Ni-Se description comes off as Ne-Si, lol. 

If I had to take a guess, I'd say you're in the delta quadra (ISTJ/INFP). No, they're just adorable and I want to hug them a lot. 

Okay, STJs ARE really fun (and easy) to fuck with if they're being jerks. But honestly, I like TJ types in general. I just prefer introverts, and I find that I gravitate towards people with Ne in their stack over their Ni counterparts. p: 

Some of the ISTJs I've known are really low-key funny and they seem to find me amusing in this really cute false-outrage kind of way that I really enjoy. Like "stop that, that's not funny!" while they try to hide a smile. 

(Plus I have a lot of Te-envy. Makes the panties hit the ground yo)  Ouch. 

Idk I figured /r/fourthworldproblems makes sense for us since we basically just jabber on uselessly most of the time. **If you abandon this thread I will find you and throw you into a pit of vipers. Don't be a bundle of sticks OP.** 

(ETA: angery bold is just a joke from the other thread I'm not really yelling ;-;)

1. Solving puzzles and chasing down interesting things on Wikipedia. Also, ghost towns - I went to three in one day once. I love robots and machine learning and futurology, topics like those are some of the few that make me really happy. I like helping people solve their problems, too. ^-^

2. When someone thinks I'm too weird or I think about the fact that I'm really lonely. Or if I think about my general future and how I have no real direction in life. Or that I'll never know the things I want to know. I'm sad a lot.

3. People who won't hear me out or give me a chance to explain, especially if I'm trying to help. I get frustrated really quickly when I actually bother speaking up and it's in vain. I would definitely sabotage someone. If I actually get angry enough, I'm quite spiteful.   

4. Food condiments in excess. Large bugs. A lot of stuff really, I have a weak stomach. Also, blatant manipulation and really strong displays of emotion make me extremely uncomfortable. 

5. I'm scared of the future, which freaks me out because I'm really future-oriented. I'm fearful of the idea that I'll always be kind of lost. Yep! 

It's extremely annoying to people. p: I don't really talk a lot overall, but when I get comfortable and then excited, I talk so fast that I trip over my words a lot and people don't understand me really well. Then I feel self-conscious and shut up because people don't really care to hear me anyway~! 

At least on the internet people can choose to ignore me and I can edit myself to be more understandable. Do I not? p: idk what INTP eyes are tho. My INTP does look quite blank though. I'm either thousand yard stare or I look like I'm doing something wrong. It's annoying but kinda funny. We were playing a game that involved lying and people kept thinking I was the murderer even when I wasn't because I look guilty. Oh yeah, removed flair. ENTP!Fe for sure. Se &gt; Si, I think. INFJ? Not sure about introverted or not. A+ commentThat obvious? 

7w8 or 8w7. p: You sounded super ESTP there minus your second answer. P:Neither, you just reallllly sound Fe p: Interesting. I got Fi-Se from you. Guess I only picked up on the lower functions. Hehehe true. 

I'm actually rather forceful and used to have serious anger issues (namely, most of my emotions would translate into frustration and anger - was quite cruel as a teenager ._.). I should take another look at my enneagram type actually. 7 seems right but who knows? Weird, I call it the "puzzle click". You're way better at this than me, you shoulda taken over the other thread lmao.True. Fe doms just sound REALLY REALLY Fe usually, like really overwhelming. Idk why I felt compelled to finish it all LOL. But yes they are. Just continuously ejaculate over and over. I feel this viscerally ;-; I'm in an open relationship, but betrayal cuts deeeep.Don't lose too much. We need empathy in the world. I could use a little pragmatism too, if you find it please share. :3 o____O? 

Point being, at least in this thread, if I get even a whiff of introversion or "I get tired by people" I kind of assume the Fe is auxiliary, lol. Yeah, I actually am pretty curious... In different threads, too. Either I upset someone or made a series of shitty comments. o: Someone else noticed that too. I wonder who I upset/why. D: 

It's true, which is why I hang out in r/INTP more often. (I do think there are a number of ESTPs and ESTJs that hang out in r/ENTP haha)Aw. Oh, well. It's okay, I think I upset someone. *shrug* 

Ahh... Joy during competitive activities, sadness to anger, number 3 is just my personal experience with xSTPs, they all seem to dislike those things a lot, and then sensory details contributing to disgust. 

Not that you're not INFJ (and 2 really is blatantly so), just the way you answered those made me think xSTP as well. 

Two good friends of mine are INTJ. :D Well, one might be ISTJ but I like them too. We are a bit of an acquired taste, though, and the bullshit tolerance has to be quite high. Yeah, but they stopped answering a day ago and I felt bad that no one else was going to get a typing. *shrug*Oh well. Teamwork :D Yeah we're annoying. I'm too scared to talk to people in groups though for fear of annoying them though. My INTJ was my handler throughout school tho. 

"We should do this." 

"You might be retarded. Don't do that." 

"Nah lets go" Fair enough. p: "Sunny" is a good word, at least if I'm not busy or anxious. Otherwise I apparently look really sad/worried.

I do agree that I look a bit guilty, mostly do to the sly thing hahaha. I can't hold a straight face even if I'm not responsible lol. I also nervous-smile or laugh too. RIP. Very voluntarily, lol. It's mostly been open on my end, actually. If we closed it up, I wouldn't lose them at all. 

I'm not bothered by my SO and I bringing in other people, I'm bothered by being lied to and my trust rocked. Wish they were more interactive. :( LOL the lost little kid is spot-on! Even if someone is furious or I'm scared I kinda giggle nervously and it pisses them off more ;-; *shrug* I dunno, maybe I just have a different batch. We've both been previously monogamous. It's not like we're out with people all of the time, just once in a while we might share or I might go on a date with another girl or something.

I need to have a mental connection, as does my INTP, which is why we don't find that many people haha. We're so close to one another and I trust him so much that I just don't worry about him ever lying to me. And I would never do it to him. 

I don't think anyone could get us to like them more than we like each other, we're about joined at the hip. Everything! Their reserve, seriousness, caution, finding out their idiosyncrasies, the levelheadedness, sometimes their outrage hehehe, reliability, loyalty, consistency, stability, the dry and sarcastic humor a lot of them have, the adorable looks of disapproval I get from them a lot...

*(I said I like them a lot... Never promised they liked me, lmao)*:( 

You're not wrong. Seems like a limited view and a lack of intimate understanding. 

ETA: lack of understanding as in maybe you don't take the time to get to know them in depth, not like you don't understand functions and the concepts. Well that is kind LOL That's so much work tho.They will if they trust you enough. c: It's fun. 

Also, change in flair? I know, I didn't mean that you didn't understand functions or those concepts. p:

I don't know how else to explain it. I'm really, really attracted to Te, and specifically Te + lower-order Ne is a big draw for me. I also really like other NTPs as well. STJs and NTPs are the types I'm most attracted to, along with the occasional INTJ. Do it. The link is right there! :D I'm very, very sure I'm not ENFP, lol. I'm not on the Te-Fi axis, unfortunately. I think if I'm mistyped, I'd be more likely to be an SFJ or INTP. Second-and-a-half-ing?No psychosis here anymore! Honestly, I'm kinda cold and dead inside so I like to be as nice as I can to try and offset all of the anger and apathy. :3Intuitive bias, along with that I think I kept typing ISTJ too much haha. This is true. Cutting and witty. Oh! I don't remember anyone hahaha p: Depends on why. C: do you avoid being responsible for others because you worry you might mess up and harm them? Or because you're lazy? Or because you don't give a shit lol. It makes a difference. 

Si isn't about memory, despite common myth. It's more of a storehouse of information that Si-users will access. An Si-dom will have an idea of what's worked for them in the past, what's common or tradition, how things have been previously, and will use that to make decisions and evaluate new information. Usually, they'll default to what's worked in the past, although it's not always the case. They're also quick to notice if things are different or have changed in some way. 

Functions manifest in a number of ways and behaviors, so understanding why you do things is what helps pin down type. I think ENTP would be pretty hard to mistake for ESFJ or ISFJ - I think a lot of ESTJs mistype as ENTP, actually. Dat Fe.

I'm pretty sure I'm ENTP, though. The Ne becomes very apparent, especially in an audio/video format haha. Overwhelmingly so, at times. I'm pretty cheery and bubbly online, maybe an unusual amount for my type, but ultimately the way I sort information and relate to others is very Ti-Fe. I think PoLR Fi also makes a lot of sense, as I tend to actively reject it or not understand it at all. :C 

I just like my STJs, I guess. I'm like a cat, the more I irritate people the more I just want to follow them around and figure out why they're so different. I think you should really try to look at it from his perspective. I'm actually an extrovert, but I hate going out, I don't enjoy talking to people, I don't enjoy hooking up, and mostly I just stay in my room or go somewhere outdoors by myself. p: 

If he's saying that he wants to go out and such and then backs out, I would guess that he doesn't want to upset you or be left out, or risk losing people he likes, but doesn't want to actually do those things. :c I would imagine you and your group are (intentionally or not) applying a lot of social pressure on him, which is stressful. 

Not everyone operates the same way you do. For every time you wonder "how the hell are you happy to stay in?", he's probably wondering "how the hell are you always going out?". p:

Stop pushing him to do things. Let him stay in and do whatever he wants. 

(Also... how much is he drinking alone? Is he getting drunk-drunk by himself? Is he drinking in a small group or at home, with another person? Is it a glass with dinner? I would be more concerned about this than making him party more.) I would take a look at the cognitive functions in the sidebar. c: Everybody has four functions they default to, under this idea. INFJ and INFP are four different functions. They can still APPEAR similar, the underlying processes are just different. 

INTJ and INFJ share Ni and Se. INTJ and INFP share Fi and Te. INFJ and INFP share none. o: 

I would read through the list and see if you can identify some of the functions that you use, if any pop out at you in particular. The thing is, it's not all about behavior, it's about the way you process and judge information, and the underlying motivations that cause you to do things. 

typeinmind.com/quiz/ is a pretty good website, too, and they have a neat quiz. Use the password 'personality' and give that a try. Read through the personality pages and see how much you relate. C: My stepmom is an ESTP! As is my grandpa. p: She's almost a caricature, lol. She's very headstrong and independent (her parents died young and she immigrated from Italy, so she grew up caring for her younger siblings in a foreign country), and intelligent. She got her degree in compsci and worked in IT before moving to sales. She's hella good and makes $$$$$$. 

She works out a lot, loves traveling, hair and makeup are always on point. She can be materialistic tho. Designer clothes and shoes, always is redoing the house. She bought an Aston Martin last month, for fucking real lol. But it's her $$ so hey. My dad is an ENTJ and is also in sales, so as long as they keep up with their retirement and savings goals, he doesn't give a fuck about whatever she spends her money on. 

She can act a little entitled or bratty sometimes and is pretty polarizing ("strong personality", she calls it), but she's self-sufficient and she works really hard. Choleric af. I love her a lot, she's also a great mom. She's a bit of a steamroller but she tries to be understanding, and she will sacrifice a lot to take care of the people she loves. She pushes my dad - they are both super competitive and will compare how much they've made in commission against one another, lmao. My dad seems like the driver in the family, but it's her. p: 

My stepdad is ISTP, and my grandfather I think tested ESTP. Grandpa used to be a mechanic and owned a shop, and now he restores Corvettes for fun. He's married to my ESFJ grandmother. (Fun fact: He used to be married to her sister, but after grandma was widowed, he divorced the sister and married my grandma. Shitty af and half the family is estranged but whatever lol.) 

So yeah, I like STPs. :D 

He's really friendly, rather conservative, funny, and a fake-grouch. He likes teaching me about cars and pretty much lives in his shop. Otherwise he's napping LOL - you could sum his life up as Corvettes and napping). He does like to travel, and it's cute how he spoils my grandmother rotten with whatever things she's fallen in love with on QVC. He doesn't want the experience, dude. Just let him be. If he wants to, he'll ask you. It's not like partying is going away anytime soon and not everyone's going to like it. I've had maybe 1 or 2 decent experiences going out, at most, and I'm fresh outta uni. Some people don't like it, especially if he's an ITJ type. 

He might have drank like that because he doesn't know how to handle his liquor. I hope he doesn't have an issue drinking. :c My INTP didn't know how to drink and had a hangover that lasted a day and a night once. I like typeinmind.com/quiz/ (pass: personality) because it's a unusual format and uses the functions when describing the type portraits. 

I like John's (25quiz.com) because I think a lot of people have their type somewhere in the top 5 it gives you, so it can be a good place to start.I'll chime in and agree with facial expressions, postures, and other mannerisms. Actual bodily structure, not at all. Hehe, maybe it's my experience being raised by an ESTP (and mostly high-Se types) but I've always found the differences between Se and Ne to be stark on their own. 

And Fe in particular and the way it shows up in tertiary/inferior positions, lol. I find it hard to mistake it for Fe in Dom/aux positions. The only exception would maybe be INTP females or ISFJ males. :( INFJ, possibly? Actually, which enneagram tests would you recommend? Now I'm seriously questioning my enneagram. Thanks! 

Took the recommended tests and from the reading I've been doing, I'd say 7 is still pretty accurate for me. Sexual variant, definitely. 

The wings are tripping me up a bit, actually. I do fit description of both to an extent. I think when I'm happier or at least neutral, I tend to fit 7w6 a better. More lowkey, maybe a bit skittish, I have a tendency to slink. Some of the unguarded vulnerability, and I can be flippant or dismissive/evasive. 

Under stress, though, I channel a lot of negative 8, I think, to the point where I thought I was an ESTJ for a while. Angry, icy, domineering, vengeful, spiteful. I handle a lot of stress by being harsh and lashing out so that I can be unbothered again. I'm also assertive as a whole, especially IRL, and have no issues defining a boundary or upsetting someone. 

I've been compared, unfortunately, to a land mine before. All's peaceful until I feel threatened, and I typically go by "the best defense is a good offense". When encroached upon, I turn hostile and prickly, when reaching out willingly, I'm enthusiastic and open. 

Dunno if that helps, but I don't quite understand enneagram as much and I don't know how stress affects presentation. YAY :D Marketing, hate it but the place itself is really laid back. Sweats, leggings, yoga pants, giant tshirts, tank tops, and flip flops are all cool. Marketing, hate it but the place itself is really laid back. Sweats, leggings, yoga pants, giant tshirts, tank tops, and flip flops are all cool. Marketing, hate it but the place itself is really laid back. Sweats, leggings, yoga pants, giant tshirts, tank tops, and flip flops are all cool. Not at all. Oooooh okay!Hehe. At least it's in your top 5. *shrug* I just find it a helpful place to start since it doesn't give you just one. I hate marketing SO much. One of my best friends is my coworker and an INFJ. Super fucked up and hilarious. And the ENFP there is really funny, he tells all these stories that just twist and turn everywhere. ISTJ is a bitch, ISFJ is petty and annoying, ISTP is nice but irritates me a bit, ENTP boss I used to like but now annoys me. 

Everyone else there sucks except some of the salespeople and the ISTJ admin lady. She's the fucking BEST.

That sounds amazing. I really want to change my career path and I'm in my first CS course and learning programming. Sigh. I hope I like it better than this. I love how eggs taste but they make me sick. A lot of food makes me sick honestly. I live on cereal, bland af chicken sometimes, meal replacement drinks, yogurt, and granola. And coffee. It can be! 

(Otherwise, it's kind of an extra emphasis. I hear it in my head as kind of a trill. I think the tilde is actually used to denote changes in pitch in Ancient Greek, haha. TIL.) I'd love to create a test like that, or something else that would do something similar. It's not a great test by any means, but it's really fast so IRL people don't mind taking it and I have an idea of what they might be. Just a tool in the box, I'd like to replace it with a better one. Question: When you say obsessive-compulsive, you mean OCPD, right? You say obsessive-compulsive disorder a couple of times, which is a different animal than OCPD. 

Otherwise, this is interesting and YOUR GRAPHS. ARE. BEAUTIFUL. 

I have pretty bad OCD. Displayed a number of both schizotypal and antisocial traits probably up until age 18-19. p: Then I blossomed into a human that is less hurtful towards others. I'm still ashamed of myself, honestly. I'll let you answer ALL of my questions. Yessssss, thank you. Everyone makes STJs out to be really uptight but they have their quirks and humors, even if you have to dig a bit.I know right? I guess they didn't want to call it anal-retentive PD because everyone would go "hehehehehehe anal". It's okay, I was just clarifying. :D&lt;3 Yay~!I'm sorry. It's really rough. I had an OCD-related breakdown in high school (I can remember having symptoms as young as 5-6) and it took years to recover from.Thank you :D ESFP? Maybe ISFP? ESFP? Maybe ESTP? Flaired, but you do sound ENTJ af. u r a cobra trvrSure, see you tomorrow? (8 You can pick me up at 8 AM or PM, I'm down for whatever! At least you don't say "your mom" when you're at a loss. I might actually be a 14 year old boy. I mean, you didn't even buy me dinner first... Oh well, that's okay.I think I did p: oh well. H-hotI'm a French toast lady but I could take an egg white omelette ;DI'm in the middle of nowhere with spotty reception for a regatta ;-; cut me some slack INTPs and ISTJs are some of my favorite personalities. INTPs especially are so wonderfully invested in pulling things apart and discovering the truth. It's fun to just listen to them for ages, especially since they don't usually get a lot of airtime. Nothing better than seeing one light up when they realize that someone cares that they know their shit and are interested. I don't hate any types I don't think. My favorites are INTP, ISTJ, and ENTP. Maybe ISTP as a runner up. 

I struggle to keep up with ESTPs and ESFPs, and I don't understand xSFPs, but there's no type as a whole that I can't find something positive about. :3 

Also, I'm very very wary about INFJs. They're not always as receptive to my enthusiasm lolol I was talking to an ENTP girl and I'm usually pretty on point with my witty repartee, but I was nervous and she's super smart and pretty. And I'm awkward anyway. 

 So we're all playing a card game and I'm mad cause I'm losing and said something like "fuck me blablabla" and she made some suggestive comment back jokingly and I just froze and turned BRIGHT RED and couldn't talk for a solid minute. RIP. 

Extra embarassing for me because I'm usually the one who throws people off with dirty jokes and stuff. I'm not a big fan of revenge nowadays. Otherwise, I usually would default to blackmail. I'm good at digging up information and stalking so it's a natural progression. I am super into an ENTP girl and I'm dating an INTP guy. I love fellow NTPs. p: I have an infj friend, but a lot of the INFJs I've met are emotionally invasive and make me super uncomfortable. Nah we aren't like that lmao. :D and yeah, that's how it was. I was like, blushing and doing the goldfish face like :0 :| :0I'd never want to &lt;3*quietly vomits*

I've trusted a couple INFJs when I shouldn't have and it bit me in the ass. I'm very protective of my feelings. P: I try not to hold it against other people tho. Everyone is different. I looked mortified and I was LOLOL. An ENTP running out of snark is rare but notable. Well thank you. :3 I'm a weird mix of self-hating and optimistic. I have some good qualities but I don't mix well with others. I'm not mean or conniving, though, but I think people think I am. Combined with my eccentricity and awkward earnestness, and most people aren't interested in friendship. It's what it is tho. 

I think a lot of us are more sensitive and protective of our feelings than were willing to admit. I'm just willing to admit it, lol. So mostly I just derive some self-worth from my talents and the things I create where I can and hope that I'll meet people who connect with me the way I want. 

I'm a really lonely extrovert lmao. It's pretty pathetic. :3I'm narcissistic and hostile but it's a defense mechanism according to my therapist and I can't say I disagree. I'm pretty fearful as a whole and any negative emotion I feel gets translated into anger and distance. 

I'm not Canadian but my family is. I'll probably be in Toronto later this year lmao. I'm mostly self-hating because I know what I should do but I'm anxious and frightened a lot so I don't do it. I'm optimistic because if I didn't believe things had to get better, I'd just kill myself and get it all over with LOL. 

Honestly, I don't fault people. I'm not a horrible person or anything. I'm actually pretty nice, but I'm weird and relate poorly to others so I understand why I might make them uncomfortable. I don't fault them for it, but it leaves me in a weird limbo of me wanting both to retreat from people and reach towards them at the same time. I end up both lonely/wanting and hostile/suspicious. Not a fun set of contradictions. I have a lot of physical and mental issues that make friendship taxing. *shrug*

Hehe yeah it makes people accuse me of being ENFJ or ENFP. p: but I do a LOT of therapy and introspection and unfortunately I'm painfully aware of both how much I want to be around others and how little they want to be around me. So I float around Reddit and shitpost and reach out where I can so I can have some of the human contact I want so badly. It works, anyway. 

(I am really emotionally expressive and vulnerable for an ENTP. It's a weird phase of my life.) 

Thank god I have my INTP BF and infj coworker or I'd be fucked lmao. The former operates like me and is so strange and placid that nothing I say or do could shake him, and the latter is as fucked up as I am. :DYou sound cuteYou sound like me. No awareness of my physical presence whatsoever. I'm pretty certain they were. One may have been ISFJ, but the other was definitely INFJ. It's that auxiliary Fe I'm wary of, as I've never had the same issues with INTJs or ISTJs and I adore them. So much more impersonal and don't give a flying fuck about feelings most of the time. 

Aux Fe is naturally interested in people and what makes them tick and will sometimes subconsciously try to probe. I think many ENTPs like being the object of curiosity and attempted understanding, but I'm extremely defensive and I find it violating. Y'all think you don't but you do p: Definitely ISTJ. 

ETA: Okay, most likely ISTJ. Why do you keep asking about ESFJs? We get it, you're 14 and you don't like them much. 

Frankly I don't even think you're INTP lol*TRIGGERED*

Eh, I think ISTJ but INTJ is still pretty possible and OP just sounds IxTJ. Other OP wanted to be INTP lololI'm an INTJ. Said that to my actual INTJ friend once and she just did that "wow you're retarded" stare lmao. 

Believe it or not I did test as ISTJ and ISFJ for a long time. No, I'm still retarded. I was just 8583748276 depressed. p;I think there's a lot of comparison involved in Si, and it's used as an anchor point to jump off of oftentimes. In my experience, INTJs are more likely to seek out more or question their solutions even if they work, but I actually believe that, once their minds are made up, ISTJs are actually the most flexible and less arrogant. What in antidepressant medication? Good &lt;3 lets be friends Jokes on you, I don't shop at Walmart. 

But if you see someone who looks like me hit her up so I can meet my doppelbangher. I mean I'm pretty gay so yeah 

Hehehehe I'm flattered. I can spit straight fire. If it helps, you got personality types that are similar to your own. 

I'd look at the typeinmind.com website and compare the descriptions. ISTPs and INTPs are similar in the way they break down logic, but ISTPs are more present- and action- oriented, more grounded, and INTPs are a little more "out there" and interested in more hypothetical, less tangible ideas. 

INTJs are efficient and serious, more visionary and future-oriented. ISTJs are just as effective, but they are usually more detail-oriented and pragmatic, and sometimes have a bit of a quirk to them if you look carefully (inferior Ne ftw). 

Rudimentary descriptions but it's a start *shrug*What the fuckI don't think it's as closely related to functions as you're making it out to be. 

Se and Ne users both can play with that quick wit but it's a tendency and not a rule. Yo give her my number. I've always wanted to bang a clone. Nice and incest-y. Yeah. o: every ISTJ I've gotten to know, if they're relaxed, has had a quirky sense of humor and will laugh at the outrageous things I say and follow along in a way I've only known Ne users to. It's very subtle but there's a playfulness and goofiness that I don't see as much in their NTJ counterparts. (Not that they aren't funny but it's just in a different way hehe.) 

It's just a bit of Ne-flair that I really like. I love them *-*I haven't had the same experience, or maybe I'm not explaining myself well. I guess more accurately I'd call it present-future. INTJs seem to live in the present but always have a goal or vision tucked away that serves as a driving force. ISTJs would be more past-present, building up a foundation/storehouse to draw from that makes living in the present and planning for the future clearer. More measured, I guess.  

But you're right, INTJs aren't constantly in their heads and disconnected the same way NTPs are. That's almost perfectly phrased and matches up to how I see it in my head. And very eloquent to boot, lol. 

I think you're right, just saying future oriented is misleading and doesn't convey the subtleties there, like how they're anchored and which part feeds into the other. I'd love to see a write up on types and the way they relate to time and how they ground themselves. 

I think on my end, if I had to break it down, I'd say 20% past, 10% present, 70% future is accurate for me. I use the past and my experiences as lessons and warnings of what not to do and I build a small foundation there that serves as an anchor point. It's not as stable or guiding as an ISTJ though, because a lot of the past comes with "what if?" Attached, so I might disregard the experiences and lessons I learn pretty easily. 

The present... Honestly, I'm so checked out day to day LOL. It's pretty much fodder for the future. I pick up on anything in the present and it immediately branches off into all kinds of what ifs. Future is where I sit, but not in a planning fashion. It's all just theoretical. What if this did this? What if we were doing this and society was like this? What would I do if...? Etc. 

I feel like I construct lots of alternate timelines and do anything to avoid the present reality lmao. I'm interested in this, maybe I'll make a topic when I get home. I think ISTJ are more concrete and pragmatic as a whole, I was more talking about demeanor. I'd check out a few comment chains here and see some of the other contributions about orientation and such. :3YES thank you it's so adorable. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5xnexd/what_would_you_say_the_differences_between_intj/

Try reading through here. /u/CritSrc and I recently had a little discussion about the Ni vs. Si thing there. C:My best friend is INTJ and we always get birthday and Christmas presents month late. However, she goes 100% on Halloween. How is what you've learned different from what you might see here? What makes the cost worth it, with so many different resources online? Agreed. ESTJs can look ENTP-ish actually. p: They're easier to recognize off the bat for me 'cause of the Ne silliness. Why does everyone assume ENTPs want to win..? I feel like any ENTP obsessed with winning is a TJ in disguise or something. p: My own personal motto is "stranger things have happened." 

Usually said with a shrug. I take care to remain open-minded and avoid dismissing things based on unlikelihood. Anything can happen. Cyperpunk/sci-fi! :D I can help! I'm good at mapping thoughts to potential behaviors. Yeah I'm like 110% waterI feel that. I don't know if I'll be barhopping or partying, but I still am making an effort to reach out to people. A lot of my depression is existential triggered by nearly dying a few times, lol. But at least I'm doing something about it p: I'm glad things feel better for you! Kk so I'll plan the visit out. :D 

Aw I felt a sadness pang because I am really hard on myself. I started crying because I made a mistake at work yesterday and my coworker had to comfort me. We're both traumatized and anxiety-riddled people so there's a lot of cruising to Starbucks in the middle of the day. Also, I'm pretty sure I'm doing two people's jobs, actually... whoops. Oh well. GOD I AM SO UNFULFILLED AT MY JOB UGHGGHGHh ldsijaf ;sjlg 

Oh I don't doubt my typing much anymore. I'm definitely a softer variant of an ENTP, I've even wondered if I'm INTP at times. My favorite books: 

* Dragonflight and the Harper Hall trilogy by Anne McCaffrey

* The Supernaturalist by Eoin Colfer

* Let's throw in Artemis Fowl as well, also by Eoin Colfer

* Where the Wind Blows by James Patterson (not scientifically accurate but a lovely read regardless)

* Coraline by Neil Gaiman

* Anything by Neil Gaiman honestly

* I loved A Series of Unfortunate Events as well

* The Gunslinger by Stephen King (I love all of his book, but his sci-fi/western series is phenomenal...)

* Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne JonesOh I have the social anxiety too :D I'm just an anxious person LOL &lt;3 but I'm doing okay and I hope you are too. Okay, I like this! The upside-down pyramid explanation is a good one and I might actually borrow that, lol. I like metaphors and approximations. p: I always say "processes and priority" so I think we at least approach it from similar viewpoints. :D 

ETA: I will say that some online communities (like many) have a lot of detail and make a good effort to dispel those stereotypes, and although there's always echo chamber risk, I think we do an okay job of at least offering alternate perspectives. Took over one * LOLETA - Edited to addYou do thatNever experienced that. ENTPs and INTPs tell some of the worst jokes in my opinion. And/Or have cringey humor. INTP now?I actually love her. ESFP I'm pretty sure! /r/INTPIn the search bar, search for "typing questions" and pick out a set. I'd put them into your OP. Those are more detailed and will give people more information to work with! Interesting. I'll keep my eyes peeled. :D T-shirt and undies, or tank top and booty shorts. Nothing else. I hate being totally naked.

What is /r/mbti wearing ;D Freakier than your mom*I am*Cuddle with people ;D I will cuddle you digitally &lt;3

Idk, for as much as I'm on here, I can't tell if I'm ENTP. I must be an ENTP, right? I can't be introverted...I don't know. I only really talk to people online, I'm tired out very quickly and will go a long-ass time without seeing anyone but my boyfriend. 

I also just seem to be a lot more mild-mannered than the average ENTP and feel more at home in /r/INTP. ;-; I'm pretty high rn though so I don't know. At which point does one stop being "INTP with ENTP traits" and is instead the inverse? People think she's ENTP? Wat. 

Hahaha damn tho. ESTJs can definitely overestimate/play up their Ne. A few I know seem ENTP-ish at first, but are much more "get shit done". Like a weird ENTJ + ENTP lovechild, which I suppose they are, functionally speaking. hnnnnnnnnnng

y'all video typed me so I'm considering that official. I can't think about this any more lmao. They can post what they want, but she's likely to get more responses if she answers them earlier on. Telling me what to do in a rude way makes me want to do things even less just to piss the person off even more. *swoons*I can fix that ENTP rating. ;DINTP 100% takes the cake. My INTP is an easy 10/10. Slept with two other INTPs who are a 7/10 and 6/10, respectively.

One girl I didn't know the type of that well, but ENxP. My only one-nighter and it was hot af. 

ESxP (I think ESTP) was the worst. Yikes.

Edit: IxTJ dude also gets honorable mention. My goal is to get to all 16 types. I'll report back when I do. xNTPs definitely are great at it. :D Female ENTP, but I've been with a male INFJ before and it was decent. Not bad or anything, especially since we had ~*feelings*~. He was definitely more cautious, more intimate, and very passionate. Romantic~

Edit: Also the INFP sounds terrible but I could be into the ESTJ. WTF at a soft and gentle ENTP tho.It is. The OP has some really good trolling skills. Even brings up Plato's Cave or whatever condescendingly. 8/10 to this guy. MOST NT OF ALL NTSLOL that's shitty. 

I'm making it my goal to have sex with one person of every type, just for shits and giggles LOL. I'll report back when I achieve this. NP. I'm at like 10-12/16, I keep getting doubles. -_- Goddamn ENFPs and INTPs. Gotcha. *salute* 

Time to close some deals.Really? I always thought Milo was an ESTJ. And on the flip side, my IQ is aight (got tested during an ADHD battery) but I'm a moron and not very high-achieving. :D 

TBH I find IQ tests to be incredibly biased. I'm just really good at identifying/replicating patterns and words and that's why I score well. When it comes to anything else I'm like derp. You think so? I haven't watched him in depth but yeah, I never thought of him as ENTP. ESTPs seem to be much harsher like he is, but like I said, don't know enough to make the distinctions. (oh i have a date with a lady INTJ tomorrow btw) You're just *my* type. 

(I'm gonna agree with ISTP tho, despite all the planning that initially led me to think IxTJ)ESTP seems pretty reasonable. Idk he just never seems to demonstrate that "both sides of the aisle" deal that's so typical with Ne-users. I'm just not used to harsh ENTPs either. If there's a subtype of ENTP babies it's me. P: 

It can be. ;D Next time you're in DFW we'll have a night on the town! :D Unless you're asking why you're not going on a date with her, in which case, ouch. LOL. These days, I like running and aerial arts. I specialize in Lyra hoop. :D Also, dance. 

I used to swim in high school and I was a D1 rower for four years. I've been positively nicknamed a succubus so possibly. Depends how attached to your soul you are. The ENTPs I've talked to are all really, really freaky. I've definitely pushed people but setting people off by arguing seems so basic and not fun p: Subtle and not-so-subtle trolling is my thing. I think NTPs are just weird and it translates to sex very well. For some people, anyway. Cosplay has definitely come into play... :D 

https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5xb409/sowhats_your_sex_like/degrdb6/?context=3

This whole thread should be useful for you. 
Good. :DNot very. If I do a lot of really fast spinning, I will a little. P: Parents went to a gym that rented out studios to an aerial gym, and got me into silks. I just am a lot better at Lyra and like it more. RIP her. Never met an NFP willing to try that, it was more "weird but I'll give it a shot".I'd agree. I've taken proper IQ tests for learning disability assessments, and the whole thing was Ne-Ti as fuck. "Identify and predict the pattern" "words" "use deductive logic" and all. ENTP, depressed. Yay. I mean it's true Makes me feel smart, then I reenter the real world. Sure :D *hug* 

Omg yay Wat. Sounds like an old friend of mine lmao. I jump hobbies a lot but I think I'm more streamlined p: Definitely consistent. I think I outlined why I'm into those kinds of things somewhere in there haha. I have a lot of weird mental issues I bring out in the bedroom and I happened to find someone who's into about all of it. INTPs are very attractive to me and I am gril

Me irl. Why not both? p: plenty of *real* issuesI got you. Very submissive, but there's little I'm not into or won't try. I'm in a long-term open relationship with an INTP &lt;3 

Blindfolds, gags, bondage (especially shibari), roleplay (my cosplays are double-duty), con non-con, knives, whips, degradation/humiliation, other partners, general sadomasochism, anything scary really. I kind of enjoy domming now too actually. p:

My sex life could double as a horror movie sometimes~! Hehehe. NTP x NTP sex is best sex. A few mental illnesses and an autoimmune disorder that's tried to kill me a couple of times. P: I'll join you in the fooling around ;DHow *you* doin'?I'm game. Sure, and hot c; Let's do it. &lt;3 pm me ~~HEY Depression, OCD, anxiety, PTSD. I have antiphosphilipid syndrome which sucks dick and makes me almost die a few times. OCD sucks, I've had it since I was little and it got bad enough to trigger a breakdown + depression and anxiety. Lots of counting and stuff. 

APS caused me to have blood clots in my lungs and what doctors thought was a mini stroke. Happened two years ago and that's what gave me PTSD. Apparently medical trauma can cause it. GOODBe my ISFJ bb. :DKk Either fantastically charismatic or horribly awkward LOLI'm mostly the latter. My brain sees everything I could say and then freezes up or picks the worst option.it meI can be if you want.Everything. Idk, I have no real vested interest in people and my Fe serves to keep things harmonious so that I'm not bothered or distracted. And when I do try to make friends I usually flub it spectacularly. Eh there's a number of us out there who are more cautious and more focused on things. I mean socializing is nice but I'm kinda anxious. Are you an infp? Cause you're a FiNe SiTe. I know you use Fe but I can show you what it's like to have internal feeling c;You're doing it! &lt;3 wordplay is my game hahaha. 

...you saucy thing, you. Right in the feels. I do think I'm hilarious tho. Just no one else does. Exactly how I feel. If I can't beat it, join it. I always tell my INFP roommate that I wouldn't mind being someone's #2 or #3 in a political or other hierarchical system. I don't want power, just the freedom and favoritism to do what I want. I'm ENTP. I tend to prefer INTPs, other ENTPs, ISTJs, and INTJs. You sound like me. I love dem ISTJs too. TBH I just wait for my roommate to change it. I can play the waiting game... idk if someone wants an entp penpal that might be niceI've been told that I tell a lot of self-deprecating jokes. My mood bleeds out into my words so I guess it's pretty obvious when I'm having a bad or good day. *shrug*It might just be my own personal thing, lol. I can even have my shining charismatic moments, haha. *unexpected hug*hehe i got you :D I'm pretty depressed and it comes with shaky self-esteem. It's easier to acknowledge my flaws and make a joke out of them than try to pretend I'm better than I am. Plus, making other people laugh is nice, even if it's at my expense. Well thank you :3 If it makes you feel better, I'm like halfway convinced that I'm an ISFJ or INTP in denial, lol. Not a tough bone in my body anymore. But I'm glad I can make someone smile. Makes me feel useful. *hug*

*slinks away*Of course p: that's just the traditional match, lol. By all means date your ESTP, the people good for you are good for you no matter the type. *patpat* it will be ok *squee*http://i.imgur.com/yqV39Wo.jpg

Here's mine! :D we've got a good bit of crossover :D i think i fixed it hehe:D yay! Dozens of us!Found the test and then the subreddit while in the hospital lmao. Couldn't go out for a while so it (and the associated Groupme) became my social group. ISTJs, ISTPs. o: Whoa, Ti, Fe, and Ne are all the same for me haha. Ne is very tangerine. Ni for me is sort of a silver, Fi is fuchsia, Se is orange-red, Te is a powder blue, and Si is forest green. ENFPs are great. I work with an ENFP at work and his stories are a fucking rollercoaster and you don't know where it's going, but when it comes to the conclusion, all of the detours suddenly come together and make sense in a way that's hilarious. 

Almost two years ago LOL I met like fifteen+ r/MBTI people off it. At the moment probably 15-20 active. That sounds like a blast! I got my roommate from r/MBTI hahaha. You rang?Almost every INTJ girl I've seen on here is gorgeous lmao. And the two INTJs I know irl are attractive.

Granted us NTPs are lovely. Huh? 

First of all: NT, NF, SP, SJ. Those are the usual 4x4 groupings. Or you could go by temperaments: IP, EP, IJ, IP. But generally, SFP and STP are closer than STJ and STP, and likewise for their feeling counterparts. 

NF and crime is just... what. Lol, what type are you?Lol, I'm just trying to see where your assumptions and experiences are coming from. Yes I am :3 I've been sick all day so I haven't PMed anyone. Very angry overreactions to being typed/anyone questioning his identity, general commenting "heat" that seems very unlike a Ti dom. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5vrd2l/we_talk_a_lot_about_ideal_matches_what_about/de499r8/?context=3

Things like this. 

a) An INTP raging the way you do is really uncommon, although that's a behavioral justification. 

b) You're always ranting about SJ types, especially ESFJs. Not uncommon for immature N-types to do, but the way you make multiple heated threads and comments is just... not. Most actual INTPs will do quite well with STJs and SFJs, especially the I's of the group. Generalizing, but even an INTP who strongly dislikes a group will usually only display it via minor annoyance or disdain rather than caps-lock rage. p: 

c) More tellingly, it's whenever somebody questions your type or identity that you really let loose on them at a hair trigger. That's what makes me think you're more prone (and more sensitive) to Fi-type judgments about who you believe you are. 
Average income and job satisfaction is higher for ENTJs than INTJs. General intelligence/"giftedness" (the terminology used by some of the surveys) is higher for INTJs. So really, it comes down to what the individual themselves value. Self-fulfillment vs. outside indicators, like you say. p: 

By outside measures that society values as a whole, I guess I'd say ENTJ. Otherwise, varies. Yeah dude... Enneagram doesn't explain away type completely... 

Also, IxFPs would typically do worse with most SJs, especially ISFPs, but INTPs would typically have a less turbulent relationship with them due to Si-Ne axis placement. Si and Ne are more and less valued than say, an ENTP, across the board. 

Now, let's get real. Nothing anybody here says is going to actually convince you that you're an INTP. You've already dug your heels in and I could take your comment history apart line-by-line, and no matter how wrong or right I may be, it's not going to be accepted. Well, you've welcomed the arguments, but ultimately you're not actually looking to have your mind changed. No matter what "proof" or interpretation is offered, you're going to counter-argue. 

Basically, you're looking for validation vs. actual input. How is this going to prove to anybody that you're an INTP when the actions you're taking just send the opposite message? That you care too much about what others thing and that you'll react this way when your identity is questioned enough...I thought about that, lol, but I'd be surprised if OP is an Fe-dom. I interpreted the reactions as more of a complaint about people mis-judging who he is, rather than reputation. KEKI think #1 might be a little pedantic but otherwise, pretty solid. (*must be your Ti huehuehuehue*) 

Number 3 particularly annoys me, lol. Like, holy crap anyone can be with anyone. MBTI can be useful when determining communication styles and how to appeal to/understand that person better, but when it's reduced down to "DAE INTP HATE ESFJ??!" it's doing more harm than good. 

On the topic of mental problems, I always wonder how they confound typing. Like, if some types might react to something in more similar ways than another, if that makes sense. I know by all traditional accounts I come across as INTP or ISFJ irl, but function-wise I'm fairly sure I'm ENTP... Man, mapping mental illness developments and type vs. percieved types would be interesting. 

I'm way on a tangent lmao Eh... I don't know, I'm not a believer in the inferior grip stuff, but in anecdotal experience I've never seen inf. Fe manifest quite that way. Anxiety, fear of judgment, avoidance, awkwardness, apathy, social obliviousness, etc., but never quite this. p: But then again, that's only my personal data!makes it a lot easier/less effort on our ends if you do a question set p: I am flattered~!

I'm the nicer equivalent of an Internet Tough Guy (tm), all memes and lols online and social isolation IRL. :D I personally love seeing intra-type variation (i sound so fancy lmao), and figuring out which mental/emotional/environmental factors brought someone to that point. But noodling around is the only way some of us get anywhere p: hahaha. It's an instance of motivation vs. behavior. Worrying about what someone thinks could be Fe or Fi, but worrying about how authentically you're portraying yourself and volatility surrounding mistyping always rings my Fi bell. 

Plus I always have found STP/NTPs to be way more "oh why?" at questioning of their type p: Especially NTPs. The more someone gets aggressive or defensive (I'm actually thinking of a different OP I kinda screwed with lol) the less inclined I am to think they're Ne users, especially higher order. p: Try searching "typing questions" and you should find a few sets in past threads!I thought ISFP. Mayyyybe INFP just cause Fi Fi everywhere, but I dunno. Something about the hair-trigger reaction combined with concern over one's identity and authenticity makes me think ISFP. But I'll never know for sure, just one idea out of many. Some people have thrown out INFP or ISTP. Maybe p: I've known a couple (plus a couple ISFPs) and it seemed to be more a case of super chill until you hit their pet "thing" and suddenly FUCK YOU k I'm good now heheheIDK if it counts, but 707 from Mystic Messenger is an ENTP. 

Yosuke from Persona 4 and Midna from Twilight Princess are both most likely ENTP. I kept teetering between ISTP and ISTJ for a while for some reason, but I think INTJ is appropriate here. I'd rather donate all of my organs and tissues and stuff, maybe someone can use it to find a disease cure finally idk it's taking science long enough. 

Otherwise, BURN BABY BURN and turn me into some pretty glass for someone to keep and fondly remember me (I would hope). 

As for death itself, I used to be like "lol who cares" but almost dying a couple times has me like "not today". It scares me. cool beansI've always been :D YEP

motivation &gt; behaviorNot much Fi to me, unfortunately. I'm pretty resoundingly in the alpha quadra, but anything else is up in the air.I get annoyed whenever people have this super obvious bent against SJ typings, especially when they pretty obviously are... I turn it into my own fun, though. he's good at this shit
You'd say, but others may disagree. Depends on your type and what you prioritize, though. p: I personally enjoy INTPs more due to the shared Ne, I enjoy the leaps from topic to topic and the sort of Ne-frenzy that goes on and makes things delightfully fun. It's also helpful when brainstorming because I get a lot of new useful fodder. Not necessarily being oblivious and impractical, but more supporting the traits that may or may not come along with those to balance it out. c: Just as being practical and aware are good things, but being too grounded and utilitarian might be negatives. A set of negatives often comes with their own positives.Unless there's a monster that attacks only if noticed by someone. That sounds like an SCP entry, kind of.What is that like? Not knocking your way, but I wouldn't even bother being with someone if I couldn't spit everything my brain vomits out at them. NO BOUNDARIES FOR THE NE USERSdating an INTP and we pretty much share every tiny little speck of thought that appears. don't worry, you'll be fine. :D Just about 100% of anything I think of. The only things I've shared are things I haven't thought to yet, and if they arise, I will. I don't know what percentage he shares with me, I'd estimate about 70-85%, but yeah. He knows every flicker of a thought.I think I'm flattered. ;3; I wonder if I'll get different kinds of replies with this flair actually.(I'm just changing my flair because lol) I... I have no idea what you're talking about. Hmm, fair enough. That's actually really cute and considerate. i showed mine my old fan fiction account... that's true love. Hmm, I suppose so.It's nice that you care and your question is fair. Just doing it on a dare. ;D Omg you sound like an ISFJ or ESFJ @.@264! @.@ I'm gonna be in a sorority~! Lol why did we only get 40 points for our type 

ETA: Also no never pledged, never wanted to.light grass up like a flare, but don't worry ill share &lt;3 I think with ESFJ and ISFJ, the introversion and extroversion factors are a little more typical. Fe (extroverted feeling) is typically more expressive and social, so you'll be more likely to have an ISFJ typed as an ESFJ than the other way 'round. 

ETA: I would look at the cognitive functions on the sidebar and read about Fe and Si and determine which is predominant. I'm way too high to be able to do a decent lengthier explanation sorry x.xnew phoneIdk dude I just threw the flair on*ooo look at this NT over here~*Know most about: INTP, ISTP, ENFP, INFP, INTJ, ENTJ (friends and family mostly) 

Know least about: ISFP, ESTJ, ENFJ

Most interested in: INTP, ISTJ, INFJ, ISFP, ESFP

Least interested in: INFP, ENFP, ENFJ, ESTP

its okay we all haveoh, she wants your DNA all right *wink*I have: 

C:C for novelty (novelty seeking)

A:A for worry (worrier, "more exploratory") 

G:G for empathy (optimistic and empathetic, "handle stress well" and less autism lol)

G:G for anger ("0.12x increased proneness to anger")

A:A for agreeableness ("associated with lessened agreeableness")

BONUS:

rs6313(T;T)

depression, panic, stress response 

This variation in a serotonin receptor has several associations that relate to stress, depression, panic and personality.

*...oh*
oh damn that's a good question. o:how are people noticing this omg 

maybe I am :D tempt me back to the dark side ;D What if I'm not human?Yep~! Definitely louder and more hyperactive online, mostly because I don't get as nervous.Nope! I'm very anxious, but I'm extroverted at my very core.Really? I'm getting ESFJ vibes but maybe that's just me. Maybe I have ESFJ on the brain.Formatting omgI'm pretty good at Lyra hoop. o: Circus arts in general are a hobby of mine. Also, I'm a good artist.If I'm at a 3/10 now, maybe I'd be a 5-6/10. Yep! I also get tired a lot anyway, kind of a sleepy person but the Ne is too strong. Hehehe. Pretty cool. The ones I know are generally warm, outgoing, diplomatic, pragmatic, good at keeping the vibes and harmony, organized, expressive, comfortable, security-oriented, very caring and self-sacrificing. 

For a more in-depth functional description: 

http://www.typeinmind.com/fesi/The first tipoff to me was the looking forward to storing a memory but. Anytime someone I know says that, I think Si user - taking a pleasure in just the idea of storing something pleasant away in their mind. 

The Fe is sprinkled throughout as well p:Maybe poke around ISFJ, ISTJ, ENFJ? You could also try the typeinmind.com/quiz/ link and use "personality" as the password and try that test. I like it. :3Don't worry my sweet &lt;3 still ENTP, nothing has changed, I just thought it would be funny. Now I feel terrible omg. ;-; Also you're adorable and my Internet crush because that was cute. Oh my gosh actually I understand that. I call it in my head as the "Ti jenga tower" where like, you've built certain things around a foundation and if it turns out one of those core concepts is misunderstood or flat-out wrong, everything else just topples around it, like pulling the bottom block out of a jenga game. p: GAH NTPS ARE SO CUTE

Like I have a few people who are "anchor types", like they're so stereotypically THAT type that they make great reference points when I'm typing someone else. Granted, that's not my only or even my biggest help in typing, but finding out my stepmom is like, an ENFP instead of an ESTP would fuck my day up lmao. 

I feel terrible I made you worry so much *patpat* its okay I'll just be the nicest ENTP ever. (Srsly two people [although one semi-jokingly....I think] said it suited me cause im too nice to be an ENTP lmao). &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 *triggered* 

*triggered* 

*triggered* 

fine i'll change it backAhhhhhh noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. This is why most SJ descriptions upset me lol. 

Okay okay okay. To set your mind at ease, first: ISTJs are just fine in scientific fields. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/5g3riw/what_is_your_career_and_why_do_you_like_it/

https://www.reddit.com/r/ISTJ/comments/24men2/istj_careers_what_does_everyone_do_for_a_living/

Take a look at a few comments here. No physicists, but there's consultancy, civil engineering, programming and web dev, a navy nuclear operator (??!), managers, nursing, music education, chemical engineering, accounting, statistician, victims' advocacy... There's a whole host of careers spanning an entire spectrum. 

A lot of science is about being detailed, exact, accountable, organized, and methodical, and guess what? ISTJs excel at that. Law, accounting, and management all get recommended because the skills that are dominant in those fields are easy to access for ISTJs. That doesn't mean they're the only fields. ISTJs are strategic, pragmatic, logical thinkers and many thrive in science. 

Also, being an ST does not preclude you from creativity. p: You still have Ne, albeit inferior. I know ISTJs who are into art and music, even if it's not their career. They're not all hard-liners, even. They just lead with Si-Te - they're cautious, reserved, they go with what works, and what works well, and typically just question it when they need to. That's all. Some are more conservative, some are liberal, some are strict and some are laid-back. Hell, most ISTJs I know have a low-key quirky side, something that's brought up and contrasted against their INTJ counterparts. 

There is so, so much variation within type. There are ENTPs who are sweet and cheery, INFPs who are cynical and jaded, ESFJs who are total badasses (i know one lmao, definitely not a grandma stereotype), and so on. Don't let MBTI determine your path. Use MBTI to help identify your strengths and weaknesses, and grow from there.

A couple better descriptions btw:

That sounds like a pickup line. They do! Risk factors, heritable traits and illness, ancestry, and a bunch of other stuff, especially if you run it through promethease. Definitely look at how you would feel before the anxiety hits. I'm an extrovert with anxiety and I'm not very sociable outside of one-on-one situations. Basically what /u/in_fact_a_hobbit said p: I think they do as a survey. You don't have to do the medical part, actually, it's cheaper that way and you just get ancestry info and the fun traits stuff. Otherwise, it's just risk level for the most part, although I did find out about some mutations that hurt my ability to process certain vitamins. That helped a lot. -__- 

You're really, really boxing yourself in here dude. Like even now, you're reading this type and you're like "I guess I'm just this and not that -" which is probably the thinking you're trying to get away from.  

You say "all of the possible ways forward from a certain point without ever having been taught a method"? INTJ isn't going to help you much there, they've got Ni. Read the typeinmind page and more about Ne. That's *exactly* what you're asking for, that spiderweb of creativity, all about ideas and possibilities. You have it, dude. It might not come as naturally, but just relax a bit. 

MBTI isn't about what job you do or who you date. It's just about how you process and analyze information. It's based on priority, not ability so much. Hell, take some art or music classes, play puzzle and association games. Tap into it and feed it a bit. &lt;3am i ISTJ? PLEASE????!First, so envious of your job. p: I'm just starting in computer science, lol. 

Secondly, welcome to /r/MBTI! You'll want to peek at the sidebar and take a look at the cognitive functions, as determining your top two will help you solidify your type. While you've got a head start, the theory is pretty interesting and goes deeper than the I vs. E dichotomies. You're also welcome to grab some questions from threads in this sub and post one for typing by others. 

If it's too much of a time-sink, there's also the TypeInMind quiz. I don't work for them I swear p: But it's a good head start into function-based profiles! 

typeinmind.com/quiz/ 

password: personalityH-Hey! ;-; i'm a squidYou tried! Hehe I just get sleepy a lot. I'm always kind of exhausted. I'm just a bad extrovert. I don't think he's an ISTP. While I'd love for him to be an ENTP and at times his logic seems to be Ne-Ti ish, he probably is most likely INTJ. 

But herein lies the debate because we can all find evidence to support our conclusions with someone like him. &lt;3 HI Hahaha I have no earthly idea what Sherlock is at this point.

Good point about Aang!I'm the one who, at our MBTI irl meetup, sat there in silence for the first hour trying to acclimate and talked to the one person I knew over text because I was so nervous I thought I was gonna puke LOL 

I warmed up once we got to the games because I can't keep my mouth shut when I think I'm going to be witty Oh dude yeah I've seen so many for her now that you say it!I keep seeing compelling arguments for everything and changing my mind. ;-;ISTJs are great. Exactly, I love games! I do try wit sometimes, it's 50-50 whether I would flub it or not tho. I mostly screw up when I think too hard about the idea that I'm interacting with people. When I'm focused on a game or something else, I act more natural and it smooths things out for me. Really? I've exclusively seen ENxP.To be honest I think he's been written for so many seasons that I could find justification for any axis, lol. His idea generation seems kind of Ne-Ti, the way it's just "throw everything to the wall, see what sticks!" and the way he isolates himself but ultimately is emotionally needy seems unhealthy ENTP. 

But there are some really good arguments for INTJ out there, as well as other types, but meh. :D YAY. I like female ENTP representation. I disagree, he's a shadowing ISFP in a dom-tert loop grip of his bridging function gap. That's pretty much his style. He asks it from his team, but also he does it too - looks at the symptoms, comes up with a ton of potential diagnoses, and then eliminates them when he finds reasons for them not to fit. Classic Ne idea generation, Ti to apply parameters and pare them down. 

He most certainly is needy. For all of his whiny misanthropy, he is a clingy, manipulative person. He leeches onto others throughout the show, especially at his unhealthier moments. Cuddy and Wilson both experience this, but he does it to Foreman and Thirteen as well. He'll do anything to keep their attention and backpedals hard when they try to quit. He's in a constant push-pull in all of his relationships, he doesn't want to want them, but he does. 

You see it anytime one of them leaves, for example. He'll give them shit, act like an asshole, but will be subtly letting them know that he wants them to stay. He'll even interject himself (cancelling flights, calling potential employers to ruin their ability to find new jobs) into their personal lives to try and force them into staying. 

He absolutely can't operate alone. I mean, that's like the entire idea of the numbers season where he's trying to find the perfect team. The point of it was to show that House *thinks* he can work alone, but he's ineffective without anyone to bounce the ideas off of, anyone to help him get more specific and be an anchor. He is at his best when he has a solid team of people who think differently, where he can throw out and gather ideas, find potential solutions, and then not have to execute any of the more menial/uninteresting stuff himself. 

Honestly, I think the ISTP on the crew is 13. Potentially ISFP, but definitely auxiliary Se if you look at her history. I'm not so sure he is either. I think ENTP, but someone pointed out some good examples once that made me at least doubt the typing. p: Ooh, true. I always kind of thought ISTP but I don't remember why. I could see ISTJ tho. Oh, L and Misa are very good ones! I think Light is always typed xNTJ, usually ENTJ but I don't see many else. You really think so? I've never considered that. I think it's more likely than ISTP tbh that process isn't even how house diagnoses..?  Honestly, have you watched the show the whole way through? The guy is Fe-style manipulative and neeeedy. He can't work alone, he can't LIVE alone without issues, he needs the presence of Wilson and Cuddy. He goes out of his way even on a personal level to keep them around and bug them with his presence. 

He's not an Se-user, not predominantly anyway. If he is, it's in an inferior sense. Hell, I could see him being an INTP moreso than an ISTP. there's nothing STP about him tbh. Hm. I don't really think ISTJ, especially in contrast to Foreman (also, I've never seen Foreman act or be typed as an STP). House's characterization is not very consistent, you're right. I think he definitely has his xNTP moments, but I see where you're coming from with Si. I really think he is on the Si-Ne axis, but definitely not higher Se. 

Cameron I'm pretty sure is an Fe user. I think Thirteen is an ISxP, Chase... ISTP sounds right, idk I don't pay a lot of attention to him. Ahhhh I love Dwight! Idk man, he seemed to really get into his speech by the time he started pounding the podium lmao. Plus, his ultimate goal was always to be the regional manager. He's extremely loyal to Michael but once he left, all bets were pretty much off. They aren't exactly drastically different types but those + how he pretty much just takes charge of every little thing seems Te-dom. I figured that or tertiary, mainly as I don't see many INTPs following people around like lost puppies lmaoThat's bizarre, he's not remotely an Fe-user... o_oFair enough.I've backed my points with evidence, including specific instances from the show, but if you don't agree with what it represents then you don't agree. I like CAH :D I enjoy Trivial Pursuit, Scrabble, chess and checkers... I like some video games too. Stuff like Pokemon, Portal, Guildwars, but those are more solo. Party games are fun! Mario Kart and Mario Party :D 

And yeah, but trying to turn socializing into a game is one of those things where I can't really trick myself p: I'm glad someone else thinks it, I actually thought Iron Man and Dpooly are both ESTP. The latter a bit less so than the former, but still. I don't think ENTP is egregiously off but idk. I get them harsh vibes. I thought maybe you'd changed your flair too LOLI figured he was ISTJ or maybe INTJ. Never quite gave me an INTP vibe. I don't watch a lot of it hehe. Y'all ISTJs underrated af thoOh I know mine, I just like messing with my flair. Dead-on for me and my INTP.ENTP with ADHD-PI and OCD. *Doesn't look like anything to me.*ISTJ NOW??I'm pretty decent at typing. I have a lot of information, examples, comparisons, and general data to cross-reference, and I'm good at seeing patterns and ranking/consolidating all of the above p:INTP or ISFJ. I'm not nearly as devious or outgoing as ENTPs are sometimes described. Yes daddyDude I'd be mad af. And probably publish something on whatever platform I have giving the full story. I hate fake news, out of context bullshit. Like just give the information, unadulterated. Hell yeah I would. 

Sorry dude I'm charged af. DO ITThought that said stalking, was 200% down ENTPs make good allies when it comes to fucking someone's day up. Maam**No sorry I was sleepyAww thank you :3Naw just an entp I'm rarely bored. My imagination comes up with enough that I'm always entertained. Personally, I agree with your friend. Homeless people individually make me really uncomfortable for one, and mostly I just think that it makes sense to try and fix systemic causes. 

At the same time, bureaucracy and politics make a lot of those positive changes a stretch, so I understand why giving individually is also a good help for the people who can't afford to wait. Really? That's weird. I'm about as into it as you, but for me it gives explanations to certain behaviors and I'm better able to understand them. Makes my relationships a lot more pleasant when I understand what drives people to do what they do. I also love seeing all of the variance between people of a certain type, and how their relationships and environment impact them. All kinds of stuff! A lot of it is for my stories and worldbuilding, I'll think about those things and characters. I'll think about programming homework, about projects I want to do, stuff I need to get done, robots, music, I'll make up circus routines in my head, I dunno. If I'm doing menial work that doesn't take a lot of focus, then I don't mind because my mind can wander while my body moves on autopilot. wat. Lol being reserved and enjoying discussions aren't mutually exclusive, it just means I don't have those discussions with many. Mostly with my intp, we typically don't get out that much (although we're trying). 

I've never wondered that but that would be pretty cool. Imagine that thing getting hacked or being used by the government. That's pretty much my routine when I brainstorm technology lol. It's that, then "WHAT IF IT GETS TAKEN OVER" while I think of every way it could go wrong. :D😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍🏻👍🏻😵😵😵😵Honestly I don't usually mess with people unless they're being jerks or really, really stubborn and close-minded. Then I'll play a little bit. p: For old time's sake I suppose. That's actually not true. In general, INTPs are some of the most independent and withdrawn of the introverts, for the same reason ENTPs are more introverted than other E types. Like you said, it doesn't mean they don't ever get out, but they need less external stimulation. 

That's mostly due to Ne. Ne users aren't necessarily drawing directly from others or their environment and are usually slower to act and less forceful. Your most social introverts will be your IxFJs, due to the more people-oriented Fe. 1. Intelligence. I *need* the mental chemistry more than anything else. I just can't look at someone and be potentially into them, even if they're aesthetically pleasing. 

2. Curiosity/a sense of adventure. I want to talk about things and explore and do stuff spontaneously when I have the energy and I want someone to come along for the ride. Typically, this means I am attracted to Ne. :D 

3. Introverted. Unless it's another Ne-dom, I really need an introvert. I don't have a lot of energy and can't go out and do as much stuff as I want to do. I really like staying in and playing games or drawing or programming and it's nice when I can enjoy my time with my partner without feeling like I'm holding them back. 

4. Honestly and loyalty. I hate not knowing the truth and the truth is super important. I need to know that someone is 100% open with me. A strong foundation of trust is a priority. 

5. Weird in bed. Like, freaky-kinky-filthy, is up to try anything once.  

I'm pretty into INTPs, ENTPs, and sometimes ISTJs, INFJs, and INTJs. Interesting. What are other forms of emasculation to you? No wonder I dig INTPs so much hehehe. Depends where the person is coming from. I think a lot of people say those things based on personal experience, which will naturally be a lot more varied. I say it just based on the theory, since Ne is such an intangible function and Fx is so low in the INTP's stack. p: 

None of that has been verified, but it's seemed somewhat true in my experience. Mostly because I'm around INxPs a lot, but there's probably some confirmation bias in there. p: The pattern I've noticed in ENxPs is that we have big spikes of energy, but need more recovery than other extroverts who seem to be able to sustain longer. Awesome! WIKILEAKS 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOOActually, I like Skyping with random people. No sarcasm at all. p: Oh, what the fuck lolol. I thought you were talking more along the lines of power dynamics in a relationship - I typically date really feminine dudes and kind of captain all of my relationships. 

That's just really shitty and borderline abusive. Time for me to slap a ho. I'm glad loyalty and honestly are on so many people's priority list. Actually, ENTPs get stereotyped as not either of those things lmao and they're really important to me. 

(I'm not a good listener tho sry)&gt;not that we actually would

*crumples up application*I don't have a driveway to fuck in. Idk I just use the balcony. Or the car. Or an alleyway. 0_o 

I don't quite understand the concept. What does that mean, "the man"? Aren't you a man anyway? How would she not accept that you're the man, because if you are one then you are one. Fair enough!confirmed unqy entpready when you are L'ésprit d'escalier~!Definitely INTP and ENTP should be included. My INTP and I both will verify facts while we talk to make absolutely sure that we've got accurate information. I think it's related to Ti. I don't trust my memory at all. There are a couple key moments in my life I remember with sharp clarity, the rest is just... questionable. Usually what happens is I'll remember the "gist" of something but I don't know if that's true or if I added in details or implications.

Why not?username and flair check out If it helps, I really don't like debating or conflict. Trolling is rare and for personal amusement only. p: People fighting and hurling insults makes me extremely uncomfortable and I get stressed out. 

Also, it's about a coin toss on my smoothness. Some days I can get a girl's number like ezpz and others I can flub a greeting. I'll hoard them.Esperanto? You never fail to surprise me. &lt;3I like both p: Hehehe. I'm a little disappointed at Portugese tbh. I do enjoy language learning, though. 3.5 years of Russian and 4 of French! Oh, I just kinda grab mine where I see them. I got one from my university's basement, and one from someone's yard. My university has a bunch of feral cats that keep rodents away, there's even a scholarship dedicated to funding food, shelter, neutering, etc. That's really not how it works, lol. While Ne and ADHD can have some overlapping similarities, they really aren't the same thing at all. I know a few ENFPs without ADHD and they still use Ne. By definition, ADHD is pathological. Se users can also have overlapping traits in the same way Ne can. 

And Ne users are usually considered to be the least socially extroverted of the E types, due to the fact that Ne is by definition non-concrete/conceptual in nature, while Se is more environmental and Fe more social. 

None of what you're saying rings true. Oh no, this really is a thing, I just like to take small furry kittens home and nurse them back to health. Now they act as my own personal radiators and pillows. And alarm clocks. They're quite utilitarian if you squint your eyes and tilt your head a bit...Just me and my 💕daddy💕, hanging out I got pretty hungry🍆 so I started to pout 😞 He asked if I was down ⬇for something yummy 😍🍆 and I asked what and he said he'd give me his 💦cummies!💦 Yeah!

*as much as I love obnoxious copypasta, this makes me feel defiled* I have memes on memes on memes on memes. INTP according to flair, but my first thought was ISFP. Very Se-heavy descriptions and type "essences" seem Fi-ish as a concept. Same functions though. p: 

I like these, OP. Honestly, you may as well type them yourself. Tests aren't very accurate/you have to take them in the right way. 

The functional quiz version that I like is typeinmind.com/quiz/ (password: 'personality'). It's not super long but it does require more thinking. 

The fastest quiz I know is 25quiz.com. That thing is like 2-3 minutes to take, and I usually get accurate types when I take you. The best strategy I've found is to answer it based on instinct, and if you have to pause to decide, then just skip the question. 

Otherwise, if you're going to use MBTI, use it to fill in gaps in communication and to help you understand their perspectives. That should make it much easier to deal with them. I always get grey to navy in my head, maybe a desaturated cobalt. I think it's because honestly, Ti and Si are very in their own heads and structured and logical so I think they kind of pop up like that. I think Ne, Se, Fi, and Fe are a little more vibrant or active, maybe Te as well. 

With the INTP's functional stack, you have to get pretty close to one to really catch a glimpse of their Ne and Fe. Ne also isn't quite as... aggressive as the other extroverted functions. As a result, people may mistake INTPs for being dull, lifeless, or boring. This apply ISTJs as well, who usually also get associated with neutrals like brown or tan. ENTP. 

If I had to draw a picture, probably dark space with pretty, glowing spiderwebs as far as the eye can see in every direction/dimension (preferably resembling the northern lights, color-wise) with little lit up dots that kind of rapidly traveling all over the place. Maybe I'd throw in some of those little shooting stars from Howl's Moving Castle. 

Anyways. Lots of thoughts flying around and criss-crossing and connecting backwards, forwards, laterally, anyway you could think. :D Very busy, always kind of whirring, a lot of background chatter in my head. Sometimes it's a scary place, but it's also pretty interesting and fun a lot of the time. People have varying levels of energy. I'm definitely known for being a bit eccentric by those who know me, but otherwise I'm just kinda nervous before I open up and relax a bit. I'm similar. Behaviorally I'm borderline INTP, functionally I'm ENTP. It's more of a snatch things while they're moving for me, lol. Constant flow and I have little control over it. I just kinda roll with it. ENTPs are either some kind of shapeshifter or illusionist, depending on exactly how much magic we're talking about here. This is why I don't participate in groups lmaoNe users, most likely. 

Why are you doubting your type? How often do you do so? And which other types do you have in mind? Depends how specific you're trying to get and what the purpose is, I suppose. Hmm. Interesting. I vs. E I honestly think is... not inconsequential, but of less worry. Which function axes *are* you sure of? Well, that narrows it down hahaha.

Have you read these descriptions? o: Maybe they'll be a little helpful, as they describe not only the functions, but they give some insight as to how they manifest in that particular function stack. 

You could scour the internet for "function positions in stack mbti" and get a lot of lists and examples. 

You also could check out socionics quadras, or temperaments, or enneagram, and check out some correlations. While they aren't the same systems and don't match perfectly, I find that having a large pool of data makes it easier to see the various overlaps and connections, and hopefully draw an accurate conclusion! C: It's an ongoing thing. I start identifying patterns and trying to interpret them in different ways. Like, I'll look at my actions through an "Fe" lens and I get confused and think I'm xSFJ. Gah. Any type who is ill or has other pressing issues, or is in a job/field they don't enjoy. o: /u/ikindadontlikeyou has a good point tho. Well if ya ever want to chat more in depth I could try to help however I can. There are a few users here who do typing over Skype, which I cannot do because I just suck at it lmao. You can always change the way you act. MBTI is... less about ability, and more about priority. You can practice empathy, you can practice mindfulness regarding your emotions, and you can practice unconventional thinking. Hey, I'm an ENTP and I'm feelsy af now. :D 

But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater (I love that saying, actually, like it's kind of hilarious imagining someone going "lol no fuck this" and hurling some Moses-style setup out of the window lololol sorry) in the meantime. You do have talents that come easier to you. Don't undermine them and work to develop them. 

You can always improve your weaknesses, just don't attribute those things to like... who you are/your quality as a person, if that makes sense. 

I like that philosophy, thank you for sharing. 

Side note: read it out of context, thought at first you were claiming to be a chimera, wanted to ask you a bunch of question, then thought you were claiming to be part dragon (Tumblr style) and then comprehension finally settled in. YAY NE So uhh. 

Part of the issue is it's not about how you feel in that particular moment. You're going to want to answer as a whole, and instinctively almost. It's easy to see "I socialize a lot" and think "I don't LIKE it, but I do, but that's mostly for work, but I like going out with my friends...", and there are a lot of issues. 

If you're new to the sub, I'd take a look at the cognitive functions explanation in the subreddit. The biggest thing to know is that MBTI isn't just how you act, it's more about how you process information and your priorities in the way you judge it. So an ENFP could ACT like an ENTJ, for example, but the underlying drivers behind them will differ. 

It's also important to know that *everybody* has a sensing, an intuiting, a feeling, and a thinking function. You get four in your main stack, and your lettering (XXXX) is more about how they're ordered - the priority I mentioned above. 

If you'd like, you can search the sidebar for "typing questions" and choose a set to make a topic. o: People here would be happy to help you figure it out. 

Another strategy I use if you prefer testing yourself is this: 

1) Try 25quiz.com. It's simplistic and fast, but it'll give you a top 5. Best way to answer this is to answer with your gut about your tendencies as a whole. If you hesitate for more than a couple of seconds, skip the question. Take a screen cap of the top 5, and check them out. 

2) A really interesting test is typeinmind.com/quiz/ (password: 'personality'). It's not that much longer, maybe 5 minutes or so, but it'll give you another answer. There are some good, function-based type descriptions there. 

Feel free to post your results here or PM them. I'd be happy to help you narrow it down! Eh, it's not all energy. I think it's hard for Ne-users since Ne is pretty conceptual/intangible in nature. p: You may well be an ENTP, who knows? Only you. (Or nobody.)We all can use or relate to many of them, so I guess the issue for you is priority? Are there any in particular you think you default to more often? Any as a kid/younger teenager, possibly? Pick me!Idk i'm trying to sleep with at least one of every type so I'll update when I do LOL 

But more seriously, you don't have to date them all. p: You can befriend them and get to know them just as well. And think about it - even if you did manage to date one of each, there is SO much intratype variation that it's like... no way you'll achieve your goal. I'll do a full write-up! I have enough quantity, I just don't have the type variation I need. I've got three INTPs already lmao.I like this idea. I saved it, because that is like... actually perfect. JUST LIKE YOU. Any room is a fucking room if you want it to be. You think so? I'd say immaturity is a natural stage that everybody goes through. Maybe poor development includes that, but I guess when I read the title I interpreted "unhealthy" as psychologically damaged/mentally ill/etc. Part of my issue is I don't know all of their types. ;-; 

I've got 3 INTPs, 3 ENFPs, 1 ISTJ, 1 ISTP, 1 ESTP, 1 INTJ, 2 INFJs, 1 ISFJ, and 1 ESFP. 

I have five who I have some idea of their type but I haven't figured it out totally. One is almost certainly an ESTx (I think ESTJ..? Idk), another I think is ISTP but not 100%, one gives me an IxFJ vibe, one ESFJ, and one ISFP. p: 

Best case scenario, 4: Worst: 7. Or maybe I should reverse those adjectives idk...Then my gripes are merely pedantic, lol. The funny part is that most of that number was collected within my current relationship. Non-monogamy ftw. He's INTP! Things get weird (8Father: idk bruh

Mother: ESFP

Half-sister: idk, she might be dead

Me: ENTP

Half-brother: ENTPHahaha no prob! Have a good night~Can I bring mine? Or how about we all bring cats and have a cat party somewhere else? We can bring board games too. Again, I can't say I agree, but mostly on really technical reasons. In cases of trauma or illness, a previously developed function may still act differently. It's not necessarily de-matured, you know? I suppose I see a difference in something not having been developed vs. something being developed and then injured. I love cereal - 

*triggered*You definitely sound like you could be. I don't see anything indicating you're not, anyway. p: Clean houses and being well-dressed are kinda like symptoms, not antibodies you can test for, lol. **ISTJS ARE SCAT FETISHISTS CONFIRMED !!!!!!!!!**h-hot...I had an ISTJ coworker like this up until Friday, but she was let go. She really pissed me off, didn't do her job well, and treated people like shit. It was her fault, but I'll admit I was a bit of a catalyst.ISTPs, ISTJs, INTJs. Yeah, they can be a bit reductive but that's usually the purpose of them, for a combination of fun and informative. 

I agree on the "THE REASONS WHY I LET SOMEONE SHATTER MY HEART QQ" articles hahaha.I'm fairly new to the company and had to give a presentation in front of our COO, CFO, sales director, etc earlier this year, kind of my first impression on them. She didn't do much of her part of our sales meeting, then basically hijacked my presentation instead in front of everyone. It was pretty humiliating and I didn't know how to really assert myself without looking petty FML. I definitely didn't cry at the hotel afterward because I'm a sensitive baby or anything lmao. 

But they're not stupid and saw what happened, and I was really steaming, so I brought my complaints to my manager. Others on our team who didn't like her brought up theirs at my encouragement, since she'd had a write-up before and no one likes her. That combined with her lack of performance ended up getting her fired finally. It takes a LOT for them to fire anyone. 

It would have happened eventually, I just sped up the process in a way. Even then, she really did initialize the process herself. Shouldn't have taken credit for my work, bitch. Or made fun of my art. More useful advice would definitely be talking to HR (who tf discusses that shit at work?) as suggested above. She sounds infuriating and I'm upset that you can't wear headphones for you, lol.  

Otherwise I'd honestly just keep telling her to stop or take it out of the building. Oh god, it's so freaky! Like, I do usually enjoy ISTJs, but I'm kinda suspecting ours is some kind of covert narcissist. She makes up all of these weird-ass lies for attention, like blatant lies, and just loves to brag about the strangest things... 

It's way less stressful now. TBH her role was pretty much to be an idea generator and strategist, mine is to keep track of literally every fucking detail on the planet and do reporting and shit. We should have just swapped out. Yeah, at the same conference. :( I was drawing some cute lil drawings on a napkin and showed it to my INFJ coworker, and later she was talking to the INFJ and was like "oh lol i can't believe mirrorconspiracies did that, isn't she so weird? blablabla". 

Maybe I'm just oversensitive but that made me really mad. I really don't like being angry because I try really hard to get even and it's not flattering. There's not really much to do besides keep insisting. But that would get so tiring and frustrating, I understand. 

I think that ESTJs and sometimes ISTJs (especially if they don't feel fulfilled) will act really oddly in order to get some kind of external validation. I think they need reassurance that they're competent sometimes, and if they don't get it, they get kinda wacky. That sucks p: I'm the youngin' here too, but I think everyone got sick of her shit honestly. She once told our ENFP designer that he didn't know how to do his job and he almost took a swing at her. &gt;Pretty much any type or gender besides a male ENTP is fine tbh.

So uhh... *hey*.on itFuck ANYBODY who knocks on my door, I hate those pricks. 

Unless they're bringing me food, that's cool. Except they aren't. By no means are all NFs SJWs, and by no means are all SJWs NFs. I could easily be classed as an SJW with my beliefs. 

&gt;people tell me that my thoughts are contradictory but I dont really care because it makes sense to me if people dont nitpick every little aspect of it

That actually sounds like some kind of weird, unhealthy Ti... Probably not high up in your stack, honestly. ISTJ seems rather suitable for you, given the Si that's coming across. Or perhaps INFP - I know, before you flip, you are SO strongly against it and sometimes seem to pass on logical consistency/correctness in favor of this. 

There are definitely INFPs who are anti-SJW and when they are, they're SUPER against it, lol. HELL YEAH DUDE i got weed and snacks come on indat neLol I was just about to be like *touches ne*Not on *this* account...Oh baby leer moreo-oh my I never could keep track of the flair changes, but I rarely notice mistypes unless they're way off anyway. 

Will do!*arson.*You lack context and I love you so there I like to think of myself as a raccoon - er, trash cat or a ferret/weasel. Nothing because I'm an airheadWith our powers combined... ;D 

Due to uncertain typing I have ~4-7 types left ^and ^^one ^^of ^^them ^^^is ^^^ENTPI can remember, I just put it off.I may have... Not one of my "for sures". I'll have to do ratings and rankings lmfao. I keep getting stacks on stacks of INTPs and ENFPs. Yours is so nice and neat compared to mine lmao. Mine is a mess and changes a lot depending on speed and angle and which hand I'm writing with. INTP confirmedI don't ship anyone lol. Some intps and enfps are quite happy with each other. My boyfriend is intp and one of his best friends is ENFP.  

I have lots of ENFP friends, but the Fi causes a big clash (I've dated an ENFP and an INFP). p: but overall I like em. 

The ESFP was a random chick at a family wedding in Canada lol. We are really classy obviously. Other Se users I've find boring to decent in bed. INTPs have been the best tbh. 22, so yep. And Xanned out, lol. It's not even recreational! Hehe. 

And it's true. I subconsciously seek out Ne users, but the Fi can be so offputting and make little sense. Not that some don't handle it better than others but yeah.

Congrats on the intp chick! p: and yes, I definitely am. All kinds of weird stuff. It's just a product of double-Ne with no Fi to slow us down haha. 

ENTPs are "special". 


You know, maybe it's just as much their level of toxicity as much as your level of sensitivity...Not the commenter, but sympathy and empathy are (usually) present in everyone, to various degrees. Fe or Fi could potentially correlate to how sympathetic or empathetic somebody is likely to be? I wouldn't know. 

Doesn't change whether those types use empathy or sympathy in the first place. Motivations or situations where one uses either of those things (the deserving or not, etc.) might be more type-related. *shrug*It likely heavily depends on environment and relationshipsc too. what in tarnation happened herep: You assume I want to talk to people. 

Just kidding, kinda. I want to talk to people who I find interesting, and that could be many or few, depending on where I am, how I feel, and who's around me. 

I consider my primary purpose to be simply gathering information. I try to avoid talking to people in person if I can when getting to know them, otherwise I like one on one/small group conversations. If I'm interested in a person, it's mostly because I want to know what their motivations are and how they work. 

Idk man social interaction is kinda hard. Ready when you are. I don't mind a lot of it. I live in an extremely warm climate so I'm just like, time to take my clothes off! Or if I'm cold, time to get tons of blankets and forcibly snuggle my cats. I drink a lot of water, but I don't notice hunger until my stomach hurts badly enough to where I have to take small bites to keep from being sick.I find that this is true even more whenever it's a P/J mixup.I'm decent at typing people, especially people I know really well. Most have taken a test of some kind, and that information combined with type descriptions, functional descriptions, etc. help me come to a conclusion that they agree is accurate. 

Either way, I find the comments valuable precisely because of the breadth of people's experience.  Everything in life should be taken with a grain of salt, so that aspect doesn't deter me. p:And adorable. Reminds me of Thad Castle. 

BRO BEANSISTJ. I wanna know what they get up to. Very true. My coworker is an INFJ and likes crazy scream-y rage stuff and I had to ask why (she's so quiet and gentle) and she goes "I just have so many feelings and when I'm mad, it's like they get mad in a way I can't". It was kind of adorableLol damn.TEXAS??? hi dee eff dubyaHeyo! Pony up. p:+ ESTJs, once matured a bit, will have some of that Ne in there, if you're ENTP you'll probably find it fairly easy to spot. I do love instrumentals and electronica... maybe some indie music. Ya got me. rawr XDDEdit: I realize my initial reply wasn't that helpful.

You probably have, statistically. p: 

My grandma is one! She's really adorable and sweet and I love her, but apparently she was a bit of a firecracker back in the day. 

And by firecracker, I mean she had a bit of a wild, party side and apparently is the kind of gal who flashes her boyfriend at airports. (I guess I know where I got it from.)

Otherwise, she loves her church, her ISTP husband and his obsession with Corvettes, reading, she's the BEST at hunting good sales so I love shopping with her, college basketball, eBay buying and resellnig, and the new puppy she randomly got?? She's a bit conservative, but level-headed, open-minded, and very intelligent. She was a teacher for a long time. She also enjoys traveling.

She is the BEST. in this brief span of time, i have fallen in love with you *holds up spork*That sounds amazing. My bestie is an INTJ lady with an INTP brother who's less than a year younger, lol. Almost!I'll pork your spork. o;me too (8 I'll knife your wife &gt;:D you have one now

no wafer though, i'm your wife so i took it and ate it. we're married. :D? &lt;3 I'm going to make a guess that ExTJs, being the Te-doms that they are, might tend towards harder sciences and more concrete career options. Business, management, biology, and what have you. Te is very into concrete and provable, and I think some of the nuances and subtleties of soft sciences may elude them, depending on their interest level and prior exposure. 

My father is ENTJ (I don't have an ESTJ source I know well), and he prefers things that have hard evidence, plenty of numbers to back conclusions up, and minimal debate. Things like sociology, psychology, and such just irritate him, even though he logically knows they are important fields. YAY OMG Shh, shh. Don't question it. It's okay. &lt;3 I think Te will be most agreeable when conflict will interrupt progress toward a given goal, Fe will be agreeable to avoid conflict in and of itself. I don't like to drink much anymore. The medication I take makes me way too temperamental in terms of how drunk I get and how much, so it's best not to fuck with it. 

When I'm mildly tipsy, I'm super lovey and complimentary and lets be real, kinda slutty lmfao. 

Really drunk and I spend a fuckton of money, get lost, then I get agitated and paranoid. Or sleep in inconvenient spots. 

Weed makes me cry over how much I love everything. And I laugh a lot and go to sleep. Or write and draw. I like it muuuuuch better. Same fml. Sometimes it works out, sometimes not. Tinder and Bumble, lol. NT girls tend to hunt each other down. I love anything that makes me go Y I K E S 

But I'm an easy audience. I laugh at about everything. My sentiments exactly. Now come spark it with me. I am now. I get ENFP or ENFJ once in a while. That almost always goes away with extended conversation.Yyyeeesssss. :D I'm a weakling tho. Lightweight af. I'm like the sweet version of an Internet tough guy Oh thank god someone out there is like me. I get so much shit but... I go through an 8th in like 6-8 weeks so who is the real winner. INFP roomie is usually dps or tank, mains pharah/zarya 

I don't play OW unfortunately but I like AOE magical offense shit. I'll do weird builds in MMOs I used to play. Eh I could be ENFP, who knows? Every time I'm sure, I'm not. Alcohol is way worse for me. It's a gamble on whether I'll black out at 3 or 5 or whatever so I just don't play that game anymore. P:Really? What do you smoke? Indicas usually leave me sluggish, but the stuff I have now is nice, I can still write and draw and stuff the way I like to. Next time you're in Texas I gotchufor me or you? or both? ENFP now?You would be like the 20th person from this sub reddit i've met irl so don't think I'm jokingOf course an ESFJ would show up on Christmas. if you can't do it for your taxes...

...infj in the head, estj in the bed I AM SO HAPPY because i can't tell if my thoughts are too weird or not dude.Sometimes when I'm high I try to make a funny comment or joke but I forget to include key information and then it makes no sense you do you. I dig people who say random things to themselves. (8It's pretty spot on. Uncontrolled is definitely the word. I can't hide my emoting unless I actively try and even then it's not good. I can tell the difference between my INTP bf and I because of how energetic I get when something excites me. Lots of flailing and demonstrating, lol. My eyes get super wide and I talk way too fast. 

The childlike thing is a very alpha quadra thing too. It can manifest as immaturity but also as just idealistic, optimistic, and curious. What did you type as before? Hehe. I mistyped as ISFJ a long while back. 

(We definitely are weird tho)I don't think STJ/NFP is terribly off. I could see the argument for either, and they share those functions. Maybe let it rest awhile and come back to it later. Me! :D I can skype or pm or whatever (for anyone)Depends. 

I'm definitely kind of weird and not always likeable, and I get frustrated with the way I think in circles so much and can't get out of my own head. 

But overall, I guess I accept it. What else can I do? I may as well like myself, I can't rely on anyone else to do it for me. sameMakes sense. I spit a bunch of stuff out that made sense in my head, but sometimes I have to double back and walk people through my thought process. It appears to be random, but there was a link somewhere. You're making a lot of assumptions about OPs intentions when it's not hard to understand the question he's asking and why he might ask it. That sounds so fun haha. We're both childlike so we just hole up together and socially are awkward together. P:&lt;333 OMG \o\ |o| /o/!ur flair doeAnd stellar!I have a few friends of mine on hormones and they all agree it's the best decision they've made. Best of luck to you! My resourcefulness, and my neverending curiosity. I like poking and prodding at the world. :3 who tf downvotes you when this is a legitimate answerSameeeeee.FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FI-Idk, I don't want to be involved in fights, I just like to read them :D 

Actually I do even like going through internet arguments. Are you two generally aligned with each other in terms of your values and beliefs? how closely? 

Also, how often do you fight and how intense are they?B U T T S T U F F

ESTJ omg hi Can you help me find lost items in my apartment? You're an Internet stranger, but I sort of suspect you still might be better at it than I. Is the finger still doing the butt stuff? I'll answer seriously. I use Pinterest as a "do not forget" board for hair styles, art resources, recipes etc. Keeps me more organized. This sounds like a whole lot of "avoid". ISTJ, else INTJ. I'm so happy nowI personally wouldn't want to date someone just coming off of a relationship (much less an abusive one). You'll most likely become a rebound, which is an irritating experience if you're looking for a fulfilling relationship. 

If you're intent on pursuing her, wait for her to figure things out and move slow. Otherwise, you're asking to get burned. Cheers!Addendum: Don't forget that your thinkers can be emotionally immature and/or volatile. 

*raises hand*TJ types tend to be pretty diligent and firm. I hate that I have to feed and water it lmao. Why can't I just photosynthesize?? Ugh. 

I also am in poor health due to no fault of my own, so I have to take extra care. I hate being a physical being. Late to this but I'm gonna say ISTJ. And you sound adorable. I'll be you. S H I T P O S T I N G

ENTPs: Science and memes

ENFPs: Politics and memes

For real though: I enjoy shitposting and whatever funny stuff, intermixed with interesting science/futurism type stuff I see. Rarely do I post personal stuff, unless it's a picture or a notable accomplishment. Never had a Twitter, don't use Tumblr anymore. 

I have FB (for aforementioned shitposting), Insta (for pics), and Snap (for... *pics*).Yeh, casually I come off as ENFP due to my warm and fuzzy exterior. Little do they know I'm cold and dead inside like any NTP should be~

Jk. Kinda. Personally, I see a world of difference between Ti-Fe and Fi-Te. Maybe it's the fact that I have a lot of ENFP and INFP friends, but I guess I don't really see how one could be mistaken for the other if you know them well.I was more thinking I'd cut your face off and wear it. I love it. Me, cause ADHD. You pulling a me?I like other ENTPs. It seems we're often split between arrogance and self-loathing. gotcha booNo I am well aware of how terrible I am at driving. Idk who decided I need a license. *REEEEEEEE*:DI comment on approximately everything so... the chances weren't low. It happens to intps a lot, it seems. My intp appreciates that I'll actually shut up and listen. I love 1989 tbh. No shame. "I Know Places" is probably one of my favorite songs. I can be for you. ENTPs can come off rather introverted. My boyfriend and I seem super similar until we get excited about something. He gets a little happier and more energetic, while I go up to an 11. Sanguine &gt; Choleric &gt; Phlegmatic &gt; Melancholic

Sometimes I get Choleric &gt; SanguineESFP, for sure. wubwubwubwubwub SKREE SKREE *computer noises*Pictured: me and intp boyfriend Can we replace it with Coraline? I mean it's more Ne than anything but still. cause you're an Fi domI like to wear light-up shoes and glasses. :D confirmed ESFP!I love female istjs omg 

And puppers. Self awareness Because COOL. COOL PEOPLE. 

I'm exhausted and about to pilot a boat through an ocean so I don't even know. Dunno why I always end up liking lady ISTJs and not as much their male counterparts though. Y'all turn me into a ham. It's my favorite movie. Based on the novel by Neil Gaiman. But you guys are cool. I'm gonna creep your post history cause that's what I do. Hm, maybe so. I'm a female entp, and I tend to like befriending female TJ types and and male FP types. Maybe I like the balance, I dunno. 

Me neither LOLOLOL. I'm sure the ocean will wake me up. :'DLittle base on typeAlso, you're like 14 br00tal

Confirmed entp I mean I'm an ENTP, messing with people is what I do. never trust a ho ENTP 7w8 ~yes daddyI want an ISTJ partner to solve crime with. your intp is showingISTJ, else INTJ.

Your bit about feeling not paid attention to/only valued for intelligence and academics resonates a lot with me. Your humanity isn't gone, but I'm truly sorry you feel the way you do. Have you considered medication or done extended therapy? You don't have to live joylessly... just makes me sad that you aren't happy I guess. Interesting. 

Personally, resolving a conflict ideally will teach me about the other person's perspective. It also will (similar to the articulate) allow for progress to be made due to that understanding. 

I disagree that emotions should be disregarded. I don't think they should be used as fuel, but emotions are an important part of being human and they need to be taken into consideration when handling conflict. Emotions, if you care to dig deeply enough, have reasons for why they exist (no matter how silly they might seem), like pretty much everything else in the world. 

I really don't like conflict though outside of discussion/debate. Especially people just getting angry, or horribly sad. Emotional analysis is one thing, soothing or comforting is a whole other. ;-; pls no one yell at me. Good point on the chain of command. I've noticed the way I employ Fe increasingly, to the point where I question if I'm ESFJ lol. But a) Ne 2 stronk and 2) Fe is almost always there to service to purpose of Ne and Ti (conflict resolution and diplomacy to keep people out of my way, social norms so I can fly under the radar, etc). 

It's definitely in service of Ne and aids my objective of getting more information and finding the answers I want. There's only a tiny difference in some sources, some place 6 over 4, some vice-versa. 

I think 5w4 actually comes from/correlates to the inferior Fe. Inferior Fe can manifest as being a bit countercoulter or denigrating the mainstream, which overlaps with 4. Not quite Fi, but can be Fi-ish in tone. Ti and Fi are similar in mechanism but I've never confused the two. I'm around a few Ti doms constabtly and I've dated and roomed with Fi doms. I could never mistake them for one another, they're so different. I know what it is, but they're too starkly different to me. You literally restated what I said - the mechanism works similarly. Also jumping in to say I appreciate your comments. Sensible and well-thought out. Dunno, I hardly know you!So cute omg. 

I think I'm sanguine/Choleric lolol Oh no, just that if I were looking (mostly in the top two functions), Ti and Fi would stick out more to me and would be hard to mistake for one another. 

Ni is a tough one for me. Yeah, Ni is so foreign and alien to me that I notice it more via gaps/negative space. Te vs. Fe can be tricky. I think in person it's easier, and I pick up on Fe quicker, but Te can easily look like Fe if someone is having to work with people. Fe tends to be warmer and Te more terse, but I guess it's more about priority. Who doesn't?This is true. 1) I'm 22, female, and American p:

2) I'm pretty sure I'm an entp honestly. I lead with extroverted intuition. Most of my day-to-day existence is pretty much lost in thought, and I can practically see the way my thoughts spider out from topic to topic. My conversations are usually pretty off balance and don't always make sense because of all of these little links in my head I create that I forget to share with the rest of the world. Physical reality is there but mostly everything that exists is just a touch point for my thoughts to bloom from and not just itself. I really struggle with staying present tbh. 

Specifically I think I use Ti over Fi due to the way I am always trying to break down everything I come across in my head. Whether it's trying to break down my own thought processes, the feelings of others, why my goddamn phone randomly pauses at some moments and not others (cue a thousand little experiments while I'm driving), I just need to solve everything and take it apart. It's not enough to just take things as they are, I need to find the bottom of things. I'm not as concerned with authenticity and the way things feel to me, if things sit right with me, I just need to understand why things work the way they do. Nothing feels better to me than when all the pieces click together and I suddenly understand they way things fit. Kinda like when you have a Sudoku puzzle and you make the right number pick that unlocks the rest in a chain of realization... I just crave it on a larger scale. 

Idk. I could maybe be an ISFJ? I think I'm in the alpha quadra anyway. GAH I'm rethinking it again. 

3) I'm not sure. I am never certain of anything. I don't think anything COULD make me certain, because then I would be suspicious that there's something else I'm missing. But it would be interesting to know what it feels like and it might be a relief to stop questioning things? 

4) I have no idea. I'd be terrified in a way because there is SO much I want to say and think that I'd probably just gape at the camera and go "uhhh... hi..." while mentally kicking myself. Maybe sketch a picture idk. I don't know who I am or what people would want from me, or if they would care about anything I've been thinking of so I just kinda freeze. 

Like I have so much I want to share but there's just no time! Or interest, if I'm honest... idk. If I could plan I'd probably just start talking rapidly and see where it goes and people can digitally slow it down later. If it's live. If it's prerecorded I CAN TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING and then compress it into a minute lolol. I want to talk about humanity! And robots and consciousness and how it all just blends together, that topic has gripped me for a while. 

5) A lot of ways, through no fault of society's own. Everything I want to do I explore too far and I have all of these ideas and thoughts and questions that few want to discuss with me. Every time I think something it's like a little firework shooting off in all different directions. I used to think people can't keep up with me, but now I'm starting to think it's me that can't keep up with everyone else. I feel like I'm on a totally different wavelength if I'm honest, and not in a good way. I'm trying to figure out how to align myself more with other people. It's kinda lonely being in my head all the time. 

6) A lot. I've had OCD since I was a child, and anxiety and depression since my mid-teens as a result. About two years ago, I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that almost took me out a few times, so I've spiraled in and out of (relative) stability. On the bright side, my sense of compassion and empathy has blossomed since then (with a little assistance). 

7) I don't have anything I want to put here. I have a video of myself but I'd prefer to pm that. It's mostly me rambling for a longass time but yeah. p: also I'm coming off a lowkey acid trip so my thoughts were extra lit all day lmao. I'll give you Ne dominance (8 

God you're so much more concise than I am. Pretty sure my function stack is like, Ne-Ne-Ti-FeCompliment: "you're so funny and I love all of your creative ideas"

Complaint: "why don't you want to hang out? i thought you were social" no I'm really not ;-;isfpit me I jokeam I. ISFJ Am I ISFJ Northern lights are a romantic dream to me. Texas ftl. Rekt 

I joke. I get Fe-Ti from you in spades, order be damned. How could you tellMy life is wrong, I'm def ISFJ. Just kidding I think. Idk. You're great tho. Glad I'm not the only one after the doggymelonsss disaster. But it sucks when I come to people generally.  Had two glasses of wine but I was tripping early and my brain is just. Yeah. Let's be friends hooray whoa dude

You might not be but that's ok. It's all for the sake of intellectual honesty. Nothing has changed about you between now and then. Me too!! 

I run light on drinking because I will drink my feelings without caution, but the occasional psychedelic was made for me. Nothing lights up my Ne like that. 

Let's Skype soon ::Of course people try to be fake, as in intentionally being disingenuous. Exactly this. I need to stop confusing myself. Not OP but ISFJ. My life. ;-;PAPYRUS FOR MORE MYSTERYReflective: 1

I think my results are a bit imbalanced hahaha. ISTJ, else INFP. Definitely that quadra, unsure of order. Statistics don't really apply to the individual. Not sure about your type, tho. Omg you're the istj who I thought was my boyfriends sister LOL. I love this!! I'd love to see ENTP vs. ENFP one day (I can hear you scolding me already). I'm going to see if I can pin my besties type down once and for all. p: 

(Also you forgot the part where ISTJs are the best)It wasn't anything major. But she's an ISTJ and her name is Kristine and she goes by Kristy so I was like "wait what". But she's not a nurse lol. I was like TIME TO SCOPE then I was like nahhhhhh. Livestream you jumping off a building and advertising the tickets to r/ESTJ? 

Idk, you'll probably want to find a job that isn't totally soul-sucking I suppose. Maybe something from home or with flexible hours, or contract/freelance. Could be illustration, copywriting, or whatever. She'd probably think I was even more weird LOL. I like her but she's definitely suspicious of me. I usually tell them more about their dominant function and how it works. If someone is going to be interested, that'll usually pique it. Sometimes I'll find those fun articles on thought catalog haha. Idk what cold brew is. *shame cloud*

Iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel! I had a good relationship with my father despite his nasty temper that has since calmed down. He would look up facts about space or numbers to occupy me on car rides, since I'd inevitably ask about those topics. He entertained my "but why?"s. 

My mom paid more attention to my brother and wasn't really interested in my development. 30-50, in multiple windows that I accidentally open and am too lazy to close. Wait? you're entp now?Hm. Weird. I put so much sugar in mine that I couldn't tell the difference. Grahn-day basically p: my INTP gets that or vanilla bean. I'm a 7w8, so very common. I don't think I know anyone well with an unusual enneagram, actually! My intp is 5w6. Hehehe welcome to my world...*shrug*Really? My roommate and I both lean very, very left and he's INFP. p: the only NTJs I know... One is my age and is center-left, the others are all center-right to right. EH? 

My fam is actually Canadian, I love this.Hehe I have an ENTP character. Character design is super fun, eh? Let's clarify- I grew up in rural Texas hahaha. So when I say far left, I'm probably like... centrist by any other standards. Wanting single-payer is basically communism here. As long as you use lube!Fine, fine. Let's do this.To be fair... Not saying you're an extrovert, but that's how I am. As in, sit in a corner on my phone or sketching, not talking to anyone if I'm dragged out. Spend most days indoors, and the few get togethers I get are all quiet one-on-ones. The internet works for most of my socialization. I'll PM you soon with something. Not comfortable posting!Oh, how disappointing. I'm not very into capitalism, to partially give you an idea of my beliefs. I think capitalism (especially the way we see it in the US) is predatory in nature. I think that it can be useful in spurring on competition and driving down costs, especially in markets of our non-essentials - specifically because we don't HAVE to have them, you know? 

But using capitalism in necessary items like healthcare, housing, etc. just is... We need these things, we don't really get an option not to have them in some way, shape or form, and I think that's where capitalistic ideals become dangerous. Ideally, I'd love a UBI system, but at the very least, subsidized education and healthcare should be a priority. We really need to re-think our safeties here, and the way we take care of our sick and poor. 

On a related note, I don't believe in having to work hard for a living and I abhor our social safety nets. I think the US is really fucking weird about our culture surrounding work and the hours we put in, and that if we don't work x amount, we don't deserve to live. I think it's just bizarre. *continuous sobbing*\*-*So, I have a response to this, but I'm out and on my phone. Just letting you know I'll respond. It TL;DRs out to capitalism rewarding hard work, but it also screws over those who have experienced any hard knocks through little to no fault of their own. People have much to contribute that isn't just x kinds of labor, and I think our brand of capitalism really screws over our society on a larger level. I'll go more into detail later on my views but yeah. GET DRUNKNo you're wrong. Oh... this one is just too close to home. When I got drunk with workmates it was with the sales team and I ended up making out with another chick at our conference lmfao. My boss was most def not there. ;D Hahah yeah my affair was in Vegas with the sales team. So we know how that was bound to go. 

Our Christmas party was nice af but otherwise I only go places if someone needs eye candy lmfao. "Just" a software engineer. ;-; I'm trynna do that and learn programming shit. I have a nice buzz :D Well now I am aroused \#rektI WILL NEVER BE CALM jk I'm sleepy ;-;SameMost affiliative! 

I laugh at everything, and I'm a bit self-deprecating, but not too much/usually only if someone else is feeling down on themselves. I'm the best audience ever for other people. I don't like to be too mean about my humor. I'll poke fun, but I won't go out of my way to offend people or be cruel anymore. 

I'm also really amused by absurdity and humor makes me feel better. I remember losing two sets of keys permanently within a week and I was laughing so hard I was in tears because it was just so fucking stupid lmao. A lot of my jokes are also kinda dorky hehe. :D Sometimes people will laugh because I laugh so hard at my own jokes. I actually have an ENFP therapist! She's got her PsyD. 

One of my criticisms is that she's not very technical, so maybe it's partially type-related. She's incredibly easy to relate to, she's very genuine and authentic, and she never makes me feel judged or self-conscious and takes me seriously. Those are all really important things to me. 

I'm kind of in "maintenance" mode right now, so I don't require intensive technical therapy. When I was in crisis, however, I do wish we were a little more proactive because usually I have to ask first and I don't always know what forms of therapy techniques might be best for me and it would be nice if she suggested first.

Like, even "if you're feeling this way, would you be up for trying something?" would be good. She did initiate the journaling stuff so that was helpful. I guess a bit more initiative is what I'm looking for.

Overall, she's a great therapist and a good person, so I like her and won't be changing because of it, but yeah. ENTP here. 

ESFP mother, her bf is ISTP, and my stepfather (her ex-husband) is also ISTP. 

My father is ENTJ, my stepmother is ESTP. 

Grandmother is ESFJ, grandfather I think is ISTP, possibly ESTP. 

Brother is ENTP. 

Close friends: SO is INTP, there's also ENFP, ENFP, INFJ, IxTJ, and my bf and I's social circle is mostly ISTP and INTP. 

Friends tend towards a lot of Ne, family is a lot of Se. I'm like you minus the financial risks part. p: I have like, no fear of romantic rejection anymore. 

I also don't realize I've done something risky until I stop and think about it. Hahah, that's always my comfort thought! "This sucks now, but it will make a hilarious story later!" &gt;2. Travel to many different places 

If I had the cash. I've gone quite a few places for sports and work, though. 

&gt;4. Run an internet scam

You don't know how many Neopets accounts I hijacked as a young teenager, lolol

&gt;5. Start cool things but eventually give up

Most things. 

&gt;7. Go out of their way to help people

More and more often, nowadays!

Logic and emotions are by no means exclusive to one or the other. I think you lean more ISFJ, though. Oh yes you did. Apathetic agnostic, ENTP. Dunno if there's a god, maybe there is and maybe there isn't. There being one (or more!) doesn't make a lot of sense, but smarter people than I haven't been able to prove or disprove anything definitively. 

Whether there is or isn't, I probably won't ever know for sure, so I'll just live the way I want to live. Seems like an ExFx. I don't think we have enough information to tell, and he very well could be an Se- or Ne-dom, or even Fe-dom. I get an ESFP vibe, but that may not be accurate. 

In order to understand, we need to know why he does some of the things he does. Are other people his priority? Why and how so? Is he more about ideas and concepts, is he more abstract? Is he present and quick to act, is he all about getting the most out of life? Does he have strongly-held values that he sticks to, or is he more about compromise? 

TIL! :D Thanks!awkkkkkk\#rektEVERYONE GETS TO LEARN. YAYYYYY.p: Fe isn't using emotion to make decisions, haha. But you literally did just imply that...

Whatever you think fits best, lol. I'm dating an INTP lol and I'm friends with another lady ENTP. Have a couple other INTP friends too. 

Biggest difference is energy levels and excitability. We had an IRL meetup and at one point, it was 2 ENTPS, 3 INTPs, and an INFJ at one table. 

We were having some great convos but you could really tell the other ENTP and I were feeding off of the energy. We'd get really really loud and talk super rapidly, we'd skip over words and finish each other's sentences, it was like an incoherent Ne feeding frenzy. Then we'd calm down, and the cycle would repeat. 

The INTPs warmed up, but generally remained more level and consistent with their tone and energy levels, and were mostly coherent lmao. 

I think "at rest", ENTPs and INTPs look similar at least, but when they really tap into their lead functions, the raw Ne becomes super apparent in the ENTP as it's not being run through a Ti filter. 
Not really. I like talking to him and he's pretty cool, but the ENTP and I were feeding mostly off of each other, tbh. Too much Ne! (Jk no such thing)

I don't really find INxJs particularly mystical tho. p: *slurping noises*But are you disappointed?C;Yes, sir. I got this as well!Awwwwww yissI'm very lickley (8Awwwwww &lt;3

Honestly, same here lmao. Dat depression and anxiety! :'D Hehehe. I'm just the Ne wizard over here. I commonly tested as ISTJ and ISFJ when I was in the pits of depression. Occasionally INTP or INTJ. 

Then I began learning about cognitive functions and also began working on my mental health, and hooray! ENTP!ENTP evil. Womp wooooomp. Trueeeeee. 

What if we're not ENTP? Then we fucked *everything* up. Trueeeeeee. Take photo proof, blow it up. Boom. Why not both?oh bb Ew feeler scum &lt;3 I hererektC H A O SISFJ or INFJ?ENTP, 7w8 sx/sp. I think the tritype I got was 738. Upon rereading, I'm not sure lmfao. ISTJ is also a possibility. I think I got an Fe-Ti vibe but now I can't remember my justification. Oops. RIP me. I couldn't tell if Fe was fetishized or used. p: Ne is extremely obvious with me. I'm sure /u/peppermint-kiss and /u/ThisWontDo can back me up on that, lmao! 

Idk about other Ne doms, but I talk a lot with my hands, I'm usually gazing off somewhere else 75% of the time, and I go off on a lot of tangents. My talking speed goes up and down and isn't very steady, and I get very excited and sort of feed into myself. I kind of find myself as I speak, lol. 

Ne is very ADHD-ish in appearance sometimes, hehe. OH! That's what tipped me into auxiliary Fe! I know quite a few IxTPs and I have NEVER seen them vent to someone who isn't their person, and only over text at that.Yeah, I notice mine always have a connection to the subject at hand so I tend to loop back around and fill everyone in on the way. You really don't think so? I think certain dominant functions can manifest very differently in conversation, both in appearance/style (as noted in the other thread), and in preference of topics (although that depends on the "why"). I cry over fucking everything

And of course an INTJ can cry lmao. I've seen my ex and my bestie cry, both are INTJs. It takes a little more stimuli but yeah. I just have leaky eyes. I don't even need strong emotions (I rarely get that overwhelmed with the feels) but I'll just kind of tear up. Frustrated, sad, happy, nostalgic, laughing, anything. p: No, I drink a lot of water. Maybe that's why I cry so much!*holds up spork*You don't..? Fml. H-hotAddition: 

ExxJ loosely correlates to choleric,

ExxP to sanguine,

IxxJ to melancholic, and

IxxP to phlegmatic~

They can be further categorized by a primary and secondary temperament. I wonder if that's why ENxPs are so open to non-monogamy. O: Little balls of FOOD AND NETFLIX COMEDY AND PROGRAMMING

With a sprinkling of C H A O SBALLS BALLS BALLS BALLS OF STEELLLL

https://youtu.be/IE3KdcTgrnoExact same. Depends on the school of thought you follow. It's interesting, isn't it? My ENFP friend is with an ExTJ and they're open as well IIRC. It's possible Ne will weigh out a number of options and consider some different modes of operation. 

I wouldn't say it for all SPs obviously, but the couple of serial cheaters I've known (I really don't like to associate with people who do that) have been SPs. Dude I will lose my shit. I fucking hate pranks. Hnnnnnnng. Yikes, I guess it's a "know your audience" thing. I hate pranks a lot. Nah imma go to the future. But they may not like the possibility of their partner having anyone else p: ENTP, 7w8 sx/sp. 

Overall: To each their own. Every relationship, regardless of monogamy status, has its own rules and boundaries. I think you get out what all partners put in, regardless of how many people. I believe non-monogamy can mitigate some issues, while exacerbating others.

Benefits: Variety, lots of love and fun, a strong support system, (when done right) very strong communication and problem-solving skills. 

Downsides: More people = more potential for emotional fallout, jealousy, social stigma, lots of scheduling and feelings management.  

My own: I'm currently in a non-monogamous relationship with an INTP, possibly trending towards polyamory. If you asked me before, I would have said no, but it just kinda happened. 

Qualities: Strong communication skills, empathy, patience, understanding, flexibility, open-mindedness, and attentiveness. Those are all things that are required in any relationship, but especially in a non-monogamous one. When you have more people in the equation, more patience and sensitivity is required if you want to keep it healthy and happy. 

This is my first foray into non-monogamy and his as well, so we're learning and growing together with it.

*shrug*I'm in a double NTP relationship... it's a bit easier that way, I've found. Uhh... then don't walk on eggshells? I don't cater to people so much that I lose sight of my own needs, it's that simple for me, personally. It just requires more awareness when there are more people. Let's not make it out to be more than it is. I do. I don't start with a type and build on it. I usually start building, then give them a best-fit type. It gives me a shorthand when I'm working and helps me keep them consistent. I meant more in the way that whereas most people are generally sensitive to/aware of one partners needs and wants, and it just takes more energy to do that with more partners than a monogamous person may be used to. Gotta watch that energy expenditure. It just feels a little pedantic. The first things you'll hear upon explanation is "it's really about the functions, not the dichotomy". /r/JungianTypology is more accurately named. I just don't see the point in posting about the obvious. General disclaimer: Depends on the people, the maturity, etc. 

I personally get along with ENFPs, INTJs, ENTPs, INTPs, occasionally ISTPs, ESTJs, and INFPs. 

Romantically: ENTP women, INTP men, ENFP men, IxTJ women. 

It could also depend on functions if we look at why a type may choose to engage. In this case, INTJs do have their tertiary Fi. If they find a cause that they truly believe and that they feel is being threatened or misrepresented, they may eagerly jump to defend it. 

In an ENTP case, it could possibly be for the purpose of amusement and provoking reactions, as is the common stereotype. 

I think these posts can be useful, but only if they are coming with "I am XXXX, and I do/do not enjoy debating because of (reasons)". I think that provides a lot of useful information.ENTPs are stereotyped to enjoy debate, but I don't really like it, especially if it gets personal or too emotionally heated. I usually just retreat when that happens. 

The only reason I would choose to engage is if it's a topic I can teach on and there are interested parties, if someone is saying something that's deadass, provably wrong, or somebody is acting so arrogant that I feel they need to be at least shown the possibility of being incorrect (rarest). 

I prefer quiet, happy debates where one party isn't on a particular "side".If they're on an MMO forever... Some kinda IxxP for sure lmfao. &gt; LIE

I like to think that I have a good Ne radar, and I agree - but it's not higher up. I'm actually thinking ESTJ here. 
I think ESTJ or ISTJ. It's the only way I could reconcile my interpretations of Te and Si. Those ESTJs get tricky, a lot at the ENTP sub.Okay, all joking aside... 

You're honestly just stereotyping at this point. Te in general can make someone do something if they want it enough. You can make any cognitive argument for why someone would be doing these things. If you ever wanna Skype, lemme know. I'm about as quiet/pseudo-introverted for an ENTP as you can get. o: Because they're *behavioural traits*. You speculate all you want, but you simply can't know just by those actions.If you can gather each response and have them answer why they play the game at all, and for such long stretches, and why that particular part of the game and keep digging until you get at the heart of it all. Awwww YAY &lt;3 Don't assume I can't hold my own, just because I mostly choose not to. C; I've just mellowed out. I prefer to keep the fucking someone wrong to the literal meaning. 

There's only a few countable instances here where I've instigated significantly~!That's fine, too. I prefer swooping in and stealing their ladies. As long as they fuck with Pangaea. 

I mostly like to talk about robots. And space. And the ocean. And weather phenomena, and idk, I just get a place to start and I end up somewhere. LILLIE &lt;3 I called her as ISFJ too. 

I love Mina. I think she's ISxP. Yikes. Does she fuck with the war?That is strangely comforting. Whoa, that's an interesting thought. Exactly, it's less of an insult and more of a rude-but-needed awakening. 

Had a similar epiphany while rolling and I was like "wow, so I need to stop making myself unhappy!". *dramatic music* Isn't it fun to cause destruction once in a while? I generally behave myself and try to be nice to everyone but sometimes...
I think I'm in love with you omg. That's hilarious and perfect. Most recent instance for me was putting my excoworker's number on Craigslist selling a $250 PS4 console and game bundle. She was looking for a job in the area so I'm sure she had fun answering every call from local area codes. 

(She threatened to call the police after she got overwhelmed with messages and calls.)She's a really bitchy ISTJ and I can just picture her eagerness at getting a possible call back for an interview only to find that it's a wrong number. Again and again. ENTP and ENFP! :D :D :D 

I love this so much hehe. The only way I can seriously tell an STJ and an NTJ apart is really just the Ne. I guess it's my radar or something. 

ENTJs are pretty solemn overall, ESTJs make a great captive (literally) audience for me. Agreed. Need my Ne. Female ENTP here, would love to date another female ENTP. Male... not so sure about that one. 

I also crush pretty hard on male and female INTPs alike. I'm with an INTP now, it's been almost two years and has worked out quite well. I've also dated an ENFP and an INFP, so I guess I just really like Ne. I'm an ENTP female! :D I'd love to join. YAY &lt;3*TENDIEEEEEEESSSSSS*-I don't like upsetting people.

-I am aware of and care about the feelings of others. 

-I'm diplomatic. 

-I'm not nihilistic. 

-I'm optimistic and artistic. 

-I'm not particularly social or charismatic. 

Ti-Fe axis is the only one I can relate to, and I'm definitely an Ne dom. Fi isn't a function I employ regularly, especially compared to my Fi using friends and family. **Enjoyment most to least:**

But now I'm trying to get a second Bachelor's in CS soooooo...
I don't even know if I could track my thoughts properly but you come off pretty Ne here. Social anxiety, ADHD, OCD, PTSD... check! I am alphabet soup.!O SHIT LOLLLL Yeahhhhh it's not fun. More under control now than ever tho so yay'*hi five**raises hand*Ngl totally trying to scope your fetishes out due to your username. D I S A P P O I N T M E N TYessssss~ only 3 months ish left!Same. Tbh I don't even think I'm that unpleasant, I'm nice enough and helpful. I'm just so awkwardly standoffish and *weird* that it's a general turnoff. Not in the quirky cute Zooey Deschanel way, either. In the lonely-whale-on-it's-own-wavelength way. 

Loneliness sucks. Doesn't have to be quantifiable. Logic is used in both in constructing ones inner world, they just require different conditions. Me and SFPs tend to just kinda... not be on the same wavelength. I'm not good at reading them. NFPs to an extent, though Ne makes it easier. NJs are similar too. Really, Ni and Fi users are confusing to me, there's a big block where I just don't get it. 

INFJs and ENFJs seem to think they're better at reading me than they are. I don't even pretend to understand them. My one INFJ friend knows me like crazy tho. 

I'm better at reading other NTPs, STPs, and SJ types, as far as I know. 

Other NTPs can usually read how I'm feeling. And SFJs. I actually was in this situation except it was 2 ENTPs, two INTPs, and an INFJ. Same. Lady ENTP who loves ENTPs and INTPs :DI like most watersFit in well actually. It was a great dynamic. He's like 14 lolAre you sure? I'm pretty sure he and Lastrevip are both quite young IIRC. Time to stalk. Oh no he's 17 as of a month ago. I'll claim it because 17 is underage (online anyway) where the other user and I are both based. ;D which falls in line with my original point in teasing her about the age of LiP. Seconding ESTJ. Definitely Te-dom, reasonably sure of Si-Ne. Your typing is getting better as you go along. ENTP. 

At work/busy with art: Do not unless I initiate. I will be short and standoffish, and then I will be hostile.

Any other time: Pretty much anything, though I might freeze up and get nervous. For best results, ask me a question. Been there. Other end of the spectrum: reclusive, wary, mistrustful, suspicious, paranoid, insecure, still probably abusing drugs/alcohol. Quiet narcissist. Yay intp/entp couples! I was a really unhealthy entp for a while, now I'm moderately healthy. Extremely attracted to Ne users. 

Wary of high Fe and Fi users. Nailed it. I suspect there isn't one. 

ENTP female, 5'3.5". (The half is important) 

My INTP is 5'6" tho. SO SMOLI've met two other ENTP females and they're 5'2 and 5'0, and I'm under 5'4. I think we are smol. WHY ARE YOU ALL SO SMOL Wait entj now?Completely untrue on your "INFPs don't rage or act rude" bits- just goes to show you still don't grasp fundamentals. And no, my typing skills really don't suck lol. I don't care about your type, you're an edgy kid on the internet and you can believe whatever type you want lmaoWhy are you posting all of this and bringing it up weeks later? Stop tagging me in your disorganized, incoherent ramblings about your ~*inferior Fe see I'm INTP!!*~, please. My sweet sweet INTP. It doesn't show to others, but he is rather sensitive to how others perceive him and is really concerned about whether he's smart enough or competent enough. 

I'm fairly sensitive too, I can't hold back my emotions and they always leak out through text, tone, posture, and facial expressions. Gotta find you an ENTP. *wink* 

Jk we can be a little needy. Mostly requiring your input. Like Audrey 2 but with opinions and information - "FEED ME SEYMOUR". Kind of odd because at first I got an Fi vibe, but overall I'm leaning towards ISTP. ENTP gril, and yeah. I'm like a supervillain, I just open my closet and I have like 20 copies of the same pants and Tshirts, just in various colors (usually black white or grey).

I have the occasional light-up shoes and glasses and cat sweaters to spice things up. Inferior and tertiary Fe, not so much. Usually ISTPs and ESTPs are quite abrasive, sometimes antisocial, and have a distinct "idgaf" apathy towards the opinions of others. Oh and yeah, I teeeentatively agree with ISTP, although that's mostly tonal/stylistic. I wonder about ISFJ. Can confirm, batshit crazy. I'm sensitive when it comes to some of my creative ideas, especially if I haven't solidified many details. I'm also sensitive when it comes to others being angry or upset with me. Poor INTPs dealing with us. We just care and want your reaction/input/ideas. :3Awwww. I'm into another ENTP. And a bunch of INTPs. I think I just flock to Ne tbh. Dat NeMy Ne is *fabulous*.Yeah, that's probably why I don't have friends. ENTP: hells yes, don't care who it's from ESTJ? Some of that quirky open-endedness/ditziness can come through in a maturing ESTJ. Tert Ne and all. I'm pretty sure Penelope is also an ENFP. 

Elsie Hughes from Westworld is probably my favorite example of a female ENTP. Cosima Niehaus from Orphan Black as well. Spot on. I think we're getting a lot of anecdotes that agree with your analysis. I'm an ENTP, and most people think I'm introverted. *shrug*Female ENTP. Love y'all. One of friends is a gay male ESFJ and that boi is the coolest ever. He's super chill, works in hospitality managing a hotel (probably the most stereotypical thing about him), has all the best food and show hookups in his city, and he's pretty damn smart. 

I'm always defensive of ESFJs tho. I relate a lot, being a female ENTP and all. You're attributing behavior too much to MBTI. Cognitive functions are basically more about how you take in and utilize information. Sometimes those lead to predictable behaviors, sometimes it doesn't. 

I have an ESFJ male friend and he's young, trendy, doesn't keep contact with his family (gay and ousted for it), he's pretty organized but not a neat freak, not mean or judgmental, and generally not traditional. Cool dude tho. Anyway. 

Si is often associated with tradition and conservatism (Si-Fe specifically for those traditional family values), but that's a pretty limited scope. Also, ESFJs do use Ne and Ti, creative and analytical functions. They might not be as heavily prioritized, but the lower functions can kind of break the circlejerk from the top two p: 

S types get shitty descriptions too, so keep that in mind. They're just stereotypes - the functions an ESFJ used might lend itself better to gossip and social climbing, but it's just one route of many. ESFJs can manifest in a lot of different ways, like every other type. 

Edit: I'm kinda high so let me know if I don't make sense. I do! Happens with:

Sudden understanding, simultaneous sunshine and brain emptiness, solving a puzzle, getting positive feedback that I helped with something, and anything past 28 minutes into a run. Was just thinking that. MDMA is the bomb. It makes me roll around in blankets and do my best to imitate Pokémon. 👌🏻 Gonna roll at a Chainsmokers concert soon tho. It's weird, I've never actually had a comedown or hangover (granted I've only rolled twice). My depression kind of disappeared after the first time I used it like 10 weeks ago. Probably because I'm still new to it. Either way, I've had two "bad days" in 10 weeks vs. my normal 3-5 days a week. Oops I didn't mean to sound scoldy, I'm just focusing really hard on sounding coherent lmao. But yeah that's the interesting thing about functions, it's fun to see ways they manifest or consider where a certain behavior might have originated. None of it's a science but they're good thought exercises lolol. Yeah, both times I rolled pretty hard, but my mood just defaults higher now than it did before. I don't feel depressed or tired or annoyed or anything, my boyfriend does though. We even split the same pill once. 

It's straight up life-changing but I also know it might not last and I'm probably an anomaly. No... no more memes?With the blunt, biting responses that ISTJs do so well. I literally cannot handle sitting normally. I always bring my feet up and do the Asian squat, or I have one leg up. It's a pain the the ass. I do it while I drive, and I'll do it in meetings if it not careful. I always wonder why. You're too boring to spare any brain cells wondering about. Try again when you obtain total depth greater than a kiddie pool. My boyfriend and I usually show each other memes at the table. It's romantic. We're both NTPs though. I have to beware of airplanes because blood clotting but yeah, anywhere I can get away with it I'll sit like a fucking weirdo. Hiiiiiiiii;-; oh yay I feel terrible about this ;-;I'm pretty sure I'm now an ironic communist, if you judge by my Facebook shitposting. There are lots of group chats. That's how I made my friends, lol. Internet socializing is my ideal type of socializing. Disorders are really just disorders when they affect your life, work, and relationships. 

I'm an ENTP and Ne greatly resembles ADHD (hence all of the NP ADHD jokes you'll see), but the level of distractedness and dysfunction is to a level where it disrupts my life and makes it extremely difficult to function. I was also diagnosed as an adult, lol. 

You can also look at other types with ADHD (sticking with this example) and see how they act and the ways it manifests. I believe /u/ExplicitInformant is an ISTJ who talks about living with ADHD, iirc. Things like that (along with brain scans and medication studies) are why I think disorders should be treated as such and aren't closely tied to personality type. 

I do wonder if personality type might affect how a disorder presents itself, but I'm not sure even about that. Reading this... yeah, I can see INFP. A lot more Ne seems to come through here. Yeah, really. The INFPs I know just continually wax poetic about their ideal futures and all of the possibilities... only to set themselves up for crushing disappointment and existential despair when they fail to get anywhere close to their dreams. Needs more information. I'd like to know more about what motivates you, what your goals are, and what makes you happy or sad, as a starting point. 

If you want, you can search "typing questions" and copy some of the questions there. 

I am getting a Ti-Fe/Fe-Ti feel, though. Abandon your old account? Also this is kind of hilarious. I'm actually getting an ENTP vibe, else ESFJ. 

I can see the argument for Te, but the way you describe yourself as fake, how you denigrate too much "uniqueness", and the way you approach your relationships with others makes me think you're an Fe user. 

I feel pretty strongly about Fe-Ti axis. Ne-Si, less so but I'm leaning to it. Those two things aren't mutually exclusive (;Yeh if I have to reply or acknowledge something I just ask. It's kinda rude otherwise. Although I've met people who also have ADHD and we have the unspoken "I promise I'm listening" thing going on. My INTP goes by dNezumi omg. Also, rekt. How much effort does it take to reach the bare minimum of politeness? Lmao 

I shouldn't talk, I'm downright hostile when I work. I don't know about ENTPs in general but I'd guess us just because ISTJs don't usually bother going above and beyond when they get agitated. I also think they get irritated more quickly than us. 

I've gotten bothered enough to retaliate over petty issues before and being mean feels pretty good and opens routes for creativity. 

I try to be nice tho. Can't say I relate. Love INTJs. Dated one, best friends with another. Was just thinking ISFJ. If an ENTP isn't happy about memes they aren't an ENTP. Not so much, except for the "giftedness" study lmao. Unless something has been published that I missed. I have about as many sensor acquaintance-friends as intuitive and yeah, type really doesn't play a role in how smart or "deep" or whatever someone is. I'm an ENTP and I'm a dingbat. I think my best friend is IxTJ (leaning ISTJ) and she's like... my handler. I would have quickly assumed ESTP (the vibe the music gives me), but INFJ does share the same functions and now that I think about it, lyrically speaking it's not that far out. 

I'd be curious to see what anyone more knowledgeable suggests. A cursory glance on Google shows INFJ, INFP, ENFP, and ESFP. I'm trying to figure that out myself lmaoSeconded Awww I want to hug you. I'm not good at in-depth emotional support but you'll get through it.

My dream person would be a girl ENTP or guy INTP who is creative, quietly confident, weird, open-minded, nonjudgmental, reserved socially, relaxed and adaptable, adventurous, enjoys playing games and shares a good bit of hobbies... so yeah, I guess I'm pretty close. 👌🏻I think environment and culture is a big part of it, as well as ones own life experiences (in the case of "a few words" causing someone to unravel). 

I wouldn't consider myself so much emotionally sensitive (as in my personal feelings are injured), but I am definitely sensitive to tone and perceived harshness. I'm raised in a polite, Stepford-pleasant setting/family, and I get thrown off easily by messages that seem aggro. Emotionally charged conflict also is hard to deal with, even if it's not aimed at me. 

Instead of trying to untangle and address, I find it easier to just disengage and move on. I'd liken it to a bat that lives in a cave and becomes alarmed when someone throws on a floodlight. I guess you could call it atmospheric sensitivity. 

My INFP roommate gets easily offended and jumps to conclusions if he thinks someone is gearing up to attack his beliefs. He's generally a smart guy, but he gets riled up pretty quickly and definitely gets butt hurt, but afterward he comes to his senses once he gets all the perspectives and understands why what was said was said. Whoa, that's an interesting perspective. LololYou think so? I can see arguments for both but I'm getting Fi leans.

Edit: Actually I'm still internally debating disregard this. From my perspective, Se seems to be more practical, excitable, action-oriented, and overall just not so airheaded and doesn't miss the obvious. Most of my "duh" moments are pointed out to me via Se users. p: I looooooove Ne. I'm sure it irritates others but it lends itself to my creativity (and probably eccentricity, lol).

I have anxiety though so it's never fun when your brain spiderwebs out and sees every negative possibility. Also, I draw incorrect conclusions sometimes/see connections that aren't actually there. ENTP vibe. I think ISTJ is appropriate. I don't think I've ever seen you as hype as your comment is in that thread lmaoI'm just gonna jump on it lmao. 

I have a Tylenol packet in my car. Idk when I even bought this? Also, I need to refresh the differences between ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen, since I actually shouldn't take certain kinds of pain relievers. I wonder how long these last before they expire, and does the car temperature affect that? Actually, how old are these medications since their invention? I wonder if anyone plans to develop anything better/new or if everyone is working on more important shit. The baggie is red and the pills are white btwNot really, no. Although I'll add that being a subdued extrovert is a thing, as is the case with me. 

(You'd also hate my untimeliness. I'm convinced that my internal clock is 5-10 minutes behind the rest of the world's.)I'm an extrovert but I spend a lot of time alone and all my socializing is done online p: 

And N vs. S is Si-Ne vs. Ni-Se. I don't see any evidence for Ni or inferior Se in your post, unless I've missed something. ENTP! 

Elsie Hughes from Westworld, Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter, and Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events. Also, Alice. THAT POPPY YAYMe too. If it's a punch card, I'll lose it the same day. If it's on an app, I tend to buy from the same places so I usually rack up a good amount of rewards. 

Might be an Ne dom, but my day-to-day life is full of ridiculous amounts of routine. I've talked about this to my INTP before actually. I would quickly and happily kick someone I dislike out of my wedding. I'd bluntly tell them to leave and call the police/security if it came down to it. I have no time for that shit and I don't play when it comes to my personal life. With Fe and social norms... to me, I've always interpreted Fi as a positive presence of one's own personality and level of authenticity, which can either fall in our out of social norms. Opposition is usually an assertion of self. 

Lower Fe is more of a negative, it registers as apathy towards social norms, with lashback being rooted more in resentment. As in, the xxTP individual dislikes or ignores norms and will occasionally kick back as a middle finger. They aren't saying yes to themselves as much as they're saying no to everything else. I kind of see the point you're trying to make, but I'm not sure "pussy pass" is necessarily the best way to express that. I'm the best esfj I like blue better I like to change my flair periodically. Try on something different for a while. Feeling, and my guess would be you're an Fi user with a higher Pe function. So... ExFP. I get a lot of "I knew you were too nice to be an ENTP" when I change my flair to ESFJ/ENFP/ESFP. That's always been my feeling. The tertiary Ne in ESTJs seems to get forgotten/unacknowledged, so when it gets highlighted, the next "best fit" is arguably ENTP.If you're a 6w5, that makes things interesting. 6 is associated with responsibility and security amongst other traits. This approximates roughly with the function Si. 

Seeing as you relate to the Fe-Ti axis, I'll throw out the suggestion of ISFJ. It's on that same axis, but uses the same functions as an INTP in a different order. (INTP is Ti-Ne-Si-Fe, ISFJ is Si-Fe-Ti-Ne.) 

How certain are you of Ni? If not very, then definitely check out ISFJ. I really do just like to play around with my flair. 

I did heavily consider ESFJ, but I end up following the same pathway of paring it down each time. My Ne is pretty unmistakeable and a few others who've chatted via skype have agreed. It kind of eclipses everything else, but that could be the ADHD talking. That pretty much brings it to ENxP. 

I think I'm definitely an Fe user, as I don't have many values of my own and absorb from others for guidance and alignment, I'm more likely to choose things that make others happy (or upset LOL) than make a decision prioritizing how I feel about it. I'll only ditch popular solutions when a more pragmatic one makes itself known. 

Si is interesting to me, I think IRL it seems like I have stronger Si than on here. I actually will wear the same few outfits over and over (I buy the same brands and such in different colors like a super villain lmao), my food choices are super bland and repetitive, but I find it anchoring to have concrete, familiar comforts while my mind is out with the fairies. Pussy pass is also commonly linked (correctly or not) with RedPill schools of thought, which is probably why people don't like it. IMO the pussy pass concept (which is exclusively talking about undeserved benefits related to gender) is a little reductive applied here and doesn't explain well the ways in which Fe and Te manifest in women.

I think Fe and Te can get mixed up more often than we think. You make a point that an ESFJ woman is super unlikely to type as a Te dom, although I have seen Te dom women who apply "honey over vinegar" to their life and appear as Fe users at first glance. 

I don't think I've personally witnessed the reverse. I could hypothetically imagine a scenario, but what comes to mind for me is cult-Fe, which is more Fe-Ni ("I know what's best for you and I'm determined to make things better for everybody, even if they're too short-sighted to see it"). I would look into Ni vs Si for sure. And don't just use your mom as an ISFJ example, lol. ISFJs (like any other type) come in all sorts of flavors. Also? You're a dude and types can appear differently between genders. Maybe look up a few male ISFJ posts here and see if you relate?I don't know but I'll have to keep better track of replies I get, lmao. 

Ooh let's do it, probably am not free tonight but this weekend I probably will be. I'm super forgetful so I need an occasional nudge. 

I do like the small things. It really does eliminate choice fatigue. Fe and Si are present, they just all serve the Ne-Ti overlords. :D (although I do watch the same shows and movies if I'm not prepared to watch actively and I stick to the same drink/food flavor profiles) ;D 

Dude I live in Everlane U-Neck Tshirts and Uniqlo legging pants. It's so easy, I can wear literally any combo and it's super comfy. Then I have a few obscene accessories, like jingle bell earrings for Christmas and light-up shoes for whenever I feel like it. I love walking around at Christmas and jingling along. Even better if it irritates people. What are your intentions, though? You're asking to be typed (I assume that's your intent from your title) and people are offering you insight into INFJs and offering opinions to help your further narrow down. 

If I were to offer two descriptions, I'd pick the ones at typeinmind.com/SiFe and typeinmind.com/NiFe since they're function-based and don't have as strong of an intuitive bias. Take a read through those (and any other page) and see what you think. (Am Fe user, am not ESFJ) Hey, I'm not trying to be condescending or anything and didn't intend to come off that way. 

Thanks for explaining your view further. I think I misunderstood your comment/was applying it more generally than to the OP, lol. I have s tendency to go off on tangents and talk about things that nobody asked for in the first place. Such is the life of an Ne dom. 

I have a better picture of what you're describing now, especially in your last sentence. I've known a few people who are similar and I agree, there's a certain level of delusion involved. Fe is so subjective and dependent on the people around that it's probably easy to view oneself through the lens of outside opinions. 

On that note, I wonder if there's a self-awareness/proneness to mistyping trend based on the F position in a stack. Like high Fi &gt; low Fe &gt; low Fi &gt; high Fe. Then again there are a ton of reasons to mistype so I'm just going to stop here. It's hard to get direct answers sometimes. But type is a very basic perception-analysis model, so it gets obscured when you layer on relationships, environment, culture, etc. Part of typing is untangling those factors and discovering how you think, so it makes sense that people are offering methods to do it yourself, since we don't know you. 

All I can offer is my best guess. If I had to say you are x, I'd say ISFJ - but again, I don't know your relationship with Se or Ni. 

I would say Si users are sort of... building a pool of information that they pick up with time and experience, and they can create models and make decisions based on this collection. It's not about having a good memory, it's about the process. Si is sort of ready to go. 

Ni has more vision to it abd they can apply it to themselves and others. There's less of "where I've gone and the things I've learned" to guide the way, and more "this is where I need to be". 

Comparing ISxJs and INxJs... I'd say that the Ni-Se axis is firmer in destination, where Si-Ne is more flexible, but that's my feel. High Te users are more goal oriented, high Ti users are more process oriented. 

I don't know about the other functions, lol. I was just contrasting my stepmother, brother and I (they're ESTP and ENTP) against my dad (ENTJ). We're all interested in computer science and programming except him, which is why the topic came up. We had a discussion where the three Ti users talked about how we enjoyed having an output with multiple routes to get there. 

He thinks we've all lost our minds and doesn't care what happens as long as the goal is reached as efficiently as possible. I'm not isfp I know dem feelsAcknowledge and explore your feelings. Use your Ti and follow them to their origination if you can. Write things down in a journal of some kind and keep track of your thoughts. You eventually start noticing patterns, then eventually "warning" signs. Curiosity and restlessnesslol I'm pretty sure of my type now. I just like seeing how people react to me differently, if they do. No lol I pinned it on ENTP. I just change my flair occasionally for funsies. lololThis is a bizarrely antiquated view of family, enough so that I'm kind of scratching my head. I would never wait until marriage. It seems irrational to wait until I'm committed in a legally binding (and expensive to dissolve) way and *then* check if a huge component of compatibility is up to snuff. 

Besides, I like sex. In an LTR that is likely headed for marriage, but we aren't monogamous. To clarify- do you mean to imply that somebody's value lies in their sexuality? Because I don't want to jump to conclusions but that's kind of how I'm interpreting this.Yeah... it kind of reads like someone's sexuality is a bargaining chip or representative of their value. It's okay, I agree with you. I see a few comments talking about how sexual value is the main thing. I mean, the other ISFJ apparently thinks that's what women bring to the table. 

I find it kind of insulting, I bring way more than sex that makes me valuable enough to marry no matter when I bang. 

There's an ISFJ down there who pretty much said that lmao so I was primed to take you seriously. I guess I don't understand the concept, I think I'm cool enough to marry even if I give it up early. p: I'd marry the fuck outta me. I just do protection and regular testing from all parties. Most of the people my SO and I see usually have that info without asking. Hey same! Just autoimmune, not sexually transmitted (ALTHOUGH i have seen someone get upset because they thought autoimmune was transferable lmao) You know, I'm kinda realizing all this religious talk is kinda... interesting. That... isn't how super fertile works. Well, hope you come to terms however makes you happy on it 👌🏻You're on fire today. I couldn't see myself dating an ESFJ. Not in my current state, anyway. This isn't a purposeful exclusion, but I'm almost entirely attracted to high Ne users, especially xNTPs. 

Edit: Female btw. I could see other ENTPs, especially males, liking ESFJs. I do like them as friends though. Maybe down the road I'd be equipped for more.  I think Ti somewhere in the stack. 

When I'm anxious, I love to analyze things for no reason. Episodes of shows, songs, whatever. I usually use MBTI related stuff to do it haha. 

I think Ne-Ti specifically is bad when I try to analyze myself. I try on too many perspectives and then I get lost in my own interpretations. That was usually royal children, IIRC lower class women waited until relatively later ages to marry. And it wasn't really because they were that fertile, they'd marry off women as young as 10 (even if it wasn't consummated until menarche). Lmao sometimes I have days where my humor is just on fire and I'm like "damn". Then a joke totally misses later and I'm basically Michael Scott lmfaoSAME THO. ESTJ and ISTJ ladies can G E T Because some of us enjoy anecdotal experiences and appreciating different perspectives. A meaningful answer doesn't have to be a part of a noticeable trend - sometimes "no correlation" is just as much of an answer, and any new insights from the stories themselves are valuable as well imoI'm an ENTP female and have a lot of mental issues besides, but mostly I've gotten "heartless" "cold" "standoffish" "awkward" and "bitchy" in the past. I have an easier time when I smile and nod, but it's not very fulfilling. I laugh at my own jokes because I think I'm pretty funny. 

Even better is when I'm high and think of something funny and then I can't get the joke out because I'm laughing. And then it's not even funny/I forget what it was. Usually my INTP or ENFP will laugh just because it's ridiculous.I like both but I enjoy cats more. I'm pretty high on open-minded and neuroticism, and I'm not particularly agreeable or conscientous at my core.I'm not sure about Ciara's type - cursory searches appear to give IxFJ, but I'm not going to go preaching their reliability. 

With songs, they can offer a glimpse into type, but you have to be careful here since there are a few issues: 

1. Artists don't always write their own music, and we don't know how much their contribute or if they were told to write a song on a certain subject. 

2. They may use a persona when presenting themselves to an audience, further complicating their type. 

If I wanted to type by music, I personally would go through an album or an entire discography looking for themes and commonalities while keeping the above points in mind. I don't think music and art produced by a person is *useless* when it comes to typing, but I think we need a lot more information to come to a solid conclusion. 

(I do like typing for songs and albums though. If you want ENFP music, check out MisterWives. "Imagination Infatuation" is ENFP as fuck. I enjoy all the Ne and still relate to it regardless.)That's what I do. ESFJ CONFIRMED YES. When I'm high my Ne makes connections that make no sense to anyone else and I have to grab the thought quickly if I want to expound on it coherently. p: 

LOL which location omg. That made me laugh IRL. I like ESFJs as friends, just not romantically. p: And I think I've got a potential life partner at the moment. p: Ive got a few other extenuating circumstances that draw me to more Ne. So accurate tho. Omg my typing is a diceI don't know dude I'm just jsidjdbsjjdfjjReflections, Imagination Infatuation, Best I Can Do, and Machine all scream ENFP. I'm underwater oHygiene for sure. Alive... debatable. I don't have a dream aesthetic, anyone I dig personality wise I'll usually end up being attracted too. Looks matter less to me.  I'm ill enough and have the full possibility of stroking out and losing a lot of function at a younger age. If that were to happen (depending on the permanent damage), suicide is one of my backup plans. I don't think it's unreasonable. My dad is one. He's a cool dude and we get along most of the time, but he was very strict and pushy when I was younger. We have similar views but go about life incredibly differently. He's all hard work and planning and I'm lackadaisical af. I would like to buy a value, please. I personally am super attracted to INTPs and ENTPs. p: I'm usually online tho. I don't do much outside. Neglect fucked me up, ENTP can confirm. I hugged my cat Actually... yeah. The more similar to me, the more I like them. 

Okay, to be fair to myself it's less "wow, I'm amazing!" And more "whoa, this person is on my wavelength??" Eh, I've never gotten too irritated. Sometimes my INTP gets annoyed with my messiness and I wish he'd be less stubborn but otherwise we balance well. I need to get sunlight or I get depressed lmao. I'm a really angry, hostile person by default. It's always been a source of anxiety and shame for me, so I try to avoid conflict and generally don't feed the problem. Lady hehe. But yeah. Thank you, anyway. I have a few pathologies that manifest at times in irrational, near-narcissistic rage, so my life is mostly self-control while I work on those issues. You're definitely an Ne-Si person. I'll also hazard Ti-Fe, although I'm not as certain. 

In order, I think you're INTP, INFP, or ISFJ. But I really think INTP. 

Edit: If you're a girl, then doubling down on INTP. I'm kind of in the process of getting diagnosed with something a little heavier (to give you a handle, it's between a couple personality disorders or CPTSD), which is why I can get that angry. 

Most of the time, I never come off that way, especially here. I think in terms of personality I'm pretty relaxed as a whole. I just don't like anger (even healthy, proportional anger) because of my experience.I'm thinking ISxP, leaning towards ISTP. I like the idea in theory, but in practice I'm not so sure. There are so many different schools of thought and so many disagreements that I think it would be a little weird to elevate certain people's opinions above others'. 

Unless it was a really varied group and inclusion factors were more based on length of time participating, basic knowledge, and a willingness to dedicate time and effort. Like, not counting some people out because they're more into Socionics or disagree with the Grant model or what have you. Tert Fe - the most obnoxious kind. It's been most helpful in communication and interpersonal relationships. 

Plus, typing fictional characters or music is soothing when I'm anxious. The combination of pragmatism, open-mindedness regarding your judgment of others, the novelty and sensation-seeking bits about the radio, the car, the competitiveness and awareness that you don't want to come off aggro, the way you leave room on your trips so you can wait and see what's up... 

It just rings as a rather healthy ISTP to me. Not much Fi here, and I get a lower-order Fe vibe in how you seem to sort of level yourself based on the reactions of those around you. And like I said, you seem generally pragmatic and straightforward. Introverts are typically more or less aware of when they're introverted, especially in the traditional social sense. Confusion mainly comes into play with higher Fe users, or when there's mental illness/major stress involved. 

I don't see how that messes up a typing, especially since I/E is probably the least dramatic change between types and uses the same functions.I really think of him as ISTJ, else INTP. His weird hobbies are all very Ne-ish and he almost never takes his new experiences to excess, he recluses and creates. He has that brand of weird that only seems to show up with Ne, no matter the position.

I don't see a lot of evidence for Ni, but he has a ton of moments that are "I don't think this is how that's supposed to go", "This isn't how I pictured that" and is generally very security-oriented in a way that most Si users are. He's terrified of entering new positions of power because "you know how that went" - he's pretty entrenched in patterns and expectations and not just about Ice Town. 

I agree on Chris Traeger. He seems Fe-ish at first glance, but I always interpret it as a honey-over-vinegar path that he chooses based on efficiency. Can't quite tell, but ENTP or INTP. I would lean towards ENTP but both are similar.I was captain of my swim team and of my uni rowing team, ENTP. p: Did distance freestyle and butterfly, and sat pretty much every seat in the boat, including being a coxswain (which is fun but HELLA TE WORK OMG). 

In sports, I usually enjoy repetition with a focus on technical proficiency. I like being able to zone out and tune into my imagination while I work out. Nowadays I do aerial arts and I run. bruh sameI really don't think so. You can still pick up plenty of information from his words - most people have some idea of what they are coming in. Information will always be impure when it comes to humans, so what's the point of throwing the baby out with the bathwater? I'm hoping so. Apparently I grew up with household abuse for eight years and blocked it out, so I think that's the missing piece of the puzzle. I don't remember my childhood so I never thought to ask much about it, I just have a few vague memories of stuff that act as red herrings so I don't go "hey, where's my memory?". p: Asked my mom and brother and yepppp.

 *shrug* So I think that my maladjustment is a likely outcome of that and I can work through it all, knowing it's most likely a trauma thing. :D I'm really tired of keeping myself under such lock and key all of the time. It can affect it, but again, how does that make it unusable? Even if it's affected, you can draw conclusions with an asterisk. Maybe I just have a different view on purity and usefulness of information.That's weiiiiird. I can't talk without tripping over my own words. The struggles of an Ne dom - so much to say and so little time in which to say it. :D &lt;3"You're too weird, people aren't going to want to be your friend" and "Stop talking about shit nobody cares about" were both some rough ones that come to mind. 

Anything to do with me being fundamentally unlikeable/strange/too different. Shot to the Fe right there. Closest people: INFJ, ENFP, INTJ 

SOs: INTP (current), IxTJ, ENFP, INFPType: ENTP

Most attractive romantically: ENTP girls, INTP guys, ISTJ girls

Most want to befriend: xNTP, INTJ, ENFP, xNFJ

Least attracted romantically: INFP, xSTP, xSFJ, ENFJ, xSFP, 

Least want to befriend: xSFP, ESTP, xSFJ, Lol, I find ISTJ women suuuuuper attractive. 

It's ok I don't like me either I can find my way in or out of anywhere, pretty much. Especially if I'm not thinking about it - if I do, I struggle.  I'm like a homing pigeon. Story of my life dude. Small town Texas, and the only other Ne user in my family is my ENTP brother (not even any STJs or SFJs). Adolescence was painful. p: 

And ouch, that sucks. Yikes. Most of my family and people I spent time around lmao. I'm still scared of anything past small talk with people irl. Austin, then Belton for most of my memorable life. 

IM IN DALLAS NOW THO LETS HANG My dad lmaoY I K E S

Shit like that is scarring. I have a lot of other issues, but I'm sure comments like that played a role in my perpetual feelings of alienation and of being defective. Omg I'm so sorry. I have a chronic autoimmune illness and sometimes I feel like I'm a liar or a fraud just because it's quiet sometimes. I can't imagine hearing that from somebody but if I did I feel like they would get hurt in retaliation. 

&lt;3 *hugs*:cTruncated version of mine, pretty much. That's kind of a pattern I've noticed too tbh. Does this have any rhyme or reason to it?Where's the pattern? This looks like personal preference to me. Where's the explanation and support for this? Yeah I think OP is a troll lmao. Wrong sub, /r/shittyMBTI is thataway --&gt;Where on earth do you see dominant Ne here? Clean it up, then. Learn to explain your thoughts and where your connections came from, because this doesn't seem to have any true logical consistency to it - just your own opinion which seems heavily biased. 

You call a group SexSlaves. &gt;someone failed their bardic knowledge roll 

Savage. Ehhhh kind of. Large, targeted ambition and stable sense of direction doesn't usually go with an Ne dom. Ne is more like a spiderweb, a bit scattered and and quickly jumping from item to item. Usually Ne doms have trouble getting to the point even while writing these things. 

The most likely Ne in this case would be tertiary, which is ESxJ. o:I prefer ENTP woman over men and INTP men over women. I enjoy both types, but there's a sweet spot of energy I like in a long-term relationships that leans towards introversion. I think ENTP and maybe ENFP are the only extroverts I fall for. Oh I see where we're going now. I see where you're headed with the big picture thinking, but Ne-Ti big picture is more like having a large puzzle that you're working with and fitting items together. That's how I'd describe it anyway p: I'm going to back you up on high Te somewhere. ENTJ sounds really likely here, although I can see why one might suspect ENTP. it never died my manYeah he is, the archetypes system is someone else's. agreedPretty much! That about sums it up. We're not great at planning and execution most of the time. If someone claims to be ENTP but they are almost always able to set concrete goals and reach them... prolly ESTJ. "It was just a *joke*!"

But you know if people were receptive he was gonna go with it. I'm kind of into that. You got a little too stubborn early on and escalated too quickly. If you expanded your reasoning at the beginning so it made Ti sense, you would have gotten a lot closer. it's not I've had a few people question if I'm really sick, so going into a spiel about pulmonary embolisms and infarcts usually makes them extremely uncomfortable and apologetic. So cute omgComments like those above are part of what taught me to shut up and that people won't like me or care about what I have to say. Especially when you're a kid. It's one thing to be annoyed by a bunch of questions, but that's you're own kid. IQ tests feel like cheating to me. Many of them seem set up specially for Ne-Ti/Ti-Ne. ENFJ = ESFJ

ESTJ &gt; ENTJ

ENFP &gt; ESFP

ENTP &gt; ESTP 

INFJ &gt; ISFJ 

ISTJ &gt; INTJ 

INFP &gt; ISTP

INTP = ISTP

I have a really strong Ne preference, especially when it comes to extroverts and thinker types. Tell me or show me they don't care about my ideas and projects. Wow I messed that up My stepmom is an ESTP and a baller lmao. Sales executive power couple with my ENTJ dad and she's easily one of the toughest people I know. My dad is an ENTJ, and my brother and I are both ENTPs. We both got a ton of heat growing up because of how "wasteful" we are with our time. Being asked "what is the point of that?" or "why are you doing things that are useless?" is a pretty common mantra. 

A lot of the Te users I know can't seem to grasp why I don't care about being as efficient as possible. I just like solving problems sometimes in multiple ways because it helps me learn everything about whatever I'm exploring that day. There's a point to it all, it's just not immediate and obvious. It's hard to resist rolling my eyes at all of the intuitives who are just soooooo fed up with small talk lmao. Not just you since you're at least asking, but I see it a lot. p:

So sometimes people start conversations to avoid awkwardness (lol) or do it out of some murky social obligation. It happens, smile and nod. 

For other cases: It's a way to feel out the other person and get the conversation started by looking for commonalities and points of interest. Conversations are usually invitations to connect and people asking after you (unless they're doing it to maintain a front) is them attempting to do just that. The ~*deep*~ conversations people enjoy usually don't come naturally and small talk is a way of figuring out potential partners and topics.

My ESFJ grandma actually really enjoys conversations about religion, but that's not my favorite topic. I'm super into psychology and sociology, but I couldn't tell you much about philosophy or classic literature. Someone who wants to discuss the latter two aren't going to find me very responsive and they may assume I'm shallow. 

Ultimately, people are just talking to you. If you're up for it, give them an idea of what you enjoy and listen to theirs, and if you're interested, ask them what they think. You can wait for the magical connection where you can just go for it, but a little effort might yield better results if you see small talk as a jumping off point for something better. I like to give these articles props where they're due but man, this one is bad. 

I'll continue meeting my SOs on the Internet like every other shut-in. "What do you think your place in the world is, and why?" 
I mean, do you actually sit around and do absolutely nothing? Or do you get online and discuss stuff, or watch a certain show, or go for a walk? If someone just says nothing then I assume they don't want to actually talk or hear about anything. 

It doesn't always work out but that's what it's good for. p:Your username immediately made me think BEETS. BEARS. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. Unfortunately likely, due to the nature of APS. If it does happen to me, hopefully those options are available. Currently, the only treatments used for sticky blood are anticoagulants, Plaquenil, and statins.

I've had a TIA and some clots in my lungs so far, all unprovoked. For whatever reason, they seem to form there silently vs. showing up first in places like legs or arms. 

I know that Ne users seem to congregate a lot, from my experience. The people I'm around or talk to the most are INFP, INTP, INTP, INTP, ENTP, ENFP, ENFP, and INFP. It's a little ridiculous, lol. 

Otherwise, I'd guess Si types.Agreed, the normalcy is a mask. One of the only people I've felt truly comfortable with is actually an INFJ, and may be the only INFJ I'm 100% certain about.Yikes, that's really condescending and you're making a lot of assumptions here.

/u/wheremywitchesat was nothing but level and reasonable with you here, and hardly pushed their beliefs. In fact, you both seem to agree on some level fundamentally (ie that not all cases of colored hair = special snowflake).  

Instead, they were opening a dialogue that you were shutting down. There's still a lot of unexplored territory in these subjects and many ways to expand and contribute to your original points, and you assumed that they were simply trying to argue for the sake of it. 

It's not "picking a fight", it's offering an alternate perspective. There is always more information to be absorbed and always more than one answer, at least on this subject. In fact, the information offered could really help you refine and solidify your original points. 

When I see interactions like this, all I can really do is lament a wasted opportunity. I feel compelled to make on on ENTPs and ESTJs. I think it makes sense. Fe going to operate similarly, but the information that the Fe in an ISFJ and the Fe in an INFJ are both pulling are different. Depending on the mindsets that the Pi functions bring to their users, colored hair/standing out could be in the realm of possible outcomes. You can do the same backflip off of a skyscraper and a diving board, but those are going to have very different results. p:

Hell, the INFJ I'm closest to chooses all sorts of interesting styles because she primarily associates with other "odd" people, due to the uniqueness of her own worldview. In a way, she is blending in the way the ISFJ might, but her starting point was different. Well, I giggled.It's a little easier with tertiary Ne users, although it still takes longer to come to that understanding than with another NTP. p: My father doesn't seem to grasp that I function completely differently from him, and that I don't have the same goals and priorities. Yikes. At least my ESTJ friend understood after we had a long talk over his (well-meaning) nagging. Okay, that's fair. I guess I don't really identify with that at all, so more power to you. p: Does that ever get boring for you, or is it for relaxing/unwinding purposes? Even when I'm not *doing* anything, my brain is still running a million miles a minute.I love small talk with people I don't know. Especially if there's been a drink or two. It's fun to find the uncomfortable people who've also been dragged outside of their house and spend a few hours discussing dinosaurs or whatever.You might want to at least check out the concept of cognitive functions. 

"Judging" isn't really the same as "being judgmental", in this case. In *super* basic terms, N and S are your perceiving functions, so they sort of tell you how you prefer to take in information. F and T are your judging functions, so they tell you how you use that information and where you sort it. 

MBTI is less about ability and more about priority and preference. Everybody thinks, feels, judges, and perceives, and your type really just tells you how your preferences stack up and it helps you understand the way you operate and what you value as important. 

typeinmind.com/NiFe has a pretty good description of an INFJ - some of the descriptions online get too "You like x y z hobbies and you're good at this" for my taste, and I find that this website is pretty even when describing all of the types. 

Heidi Priebe is a ThoughtCatalog writer who's really into personality theory, and she gets some shit around here (she's a bit fanciful and loves to make lists and such that I think are cute, if not in-depth)  but she's good at presenting ideas in a really accessible way. 

http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/

This is a good place to start if you're interested! Welcome. C: Note that I'm generalizing here:  

The ESTPs I know are very pragmatic, excitable, and know how to work a group. Not in a skeezy way, but they have an undeniable charisma. They have a very "sharp" feel to them behind the Se. ESFPs have similar energy levels, but they usually seem much softer, perhaps a bit more fanciful and idealistic. They're not all partygoers and actors, although many are drawn to the arts because they enjoy being able to express themselves.

Looking at potential weaknesses helps me differentiate. ESFPs can be self-centered sometimes - their values and worldview are the priority, so they do what feels right and act true to themselves, sometimes to the dismay of others. They can be stubborn in a way that seems irrational, but if you know where they're coming from it usually makes sense.

ESTPs are similar to ENTPs in the way that they often purposely poke and prod. Ti is a function that naturally likes to deconstruct, and it's about understanding the parts of the whole and how things fit together. There's also kind of a Ti-Fe tripwire a lot of ExTPs experience where they suddenly find themselves having angered everybody because they forget about the "people factor" while making decisions. 

ESTPs are more likely to say "This doesn't make sense. It doesn't matter if it hurts your feelings.". ESFPs are more likely to say "This isn't right, and that's all there is to it. If you don't like it, you can go." Both can be bullheadedly stubborn. 

Observe the way he argues and what principles guide his decisions and you should figure it out pretty quickly. You're probably not going to get a ton of appropriate responses here (cue the ISFJs crawling out of the woodworks) just FYI - not a ton of ISFJs compared to flaired NF and NT types. 

Seems like you posted to r/ISFJ tho, so good call. You also might get interesting responses with INFJs, ISTJs, and ESFJs. o: There's a few contributing causes to that. It's possible that more N types are interested enough in MBTI to bother coming here and joining the cult. (Lots of "xSxx is doing things in the real world!" jokes). 

There's also a lot of bias - everyone wants to feel unique and smart, and tests will blatantly make N types seem cooler or whatever. ("INFJs are unique and eccentric and mystical! ISFJs love to make cookies and work and gossip.") So there's lots of mistyping about. I suspect there are many an ISFJ masquerading as INFJs, INFPs, and INTPs. Hell, there was a user here a while back who was an ENTP, then realized she was ISFJ. 

I think it's just a combination of those factors tbh. Always happy to help!Glad I can help! I have an ESFP mom, an ESTP grandfather, and two ISTP stepfathers, so I've gotten a lifelong dose of Se haha. 

Also - I forgot to take your brother's gender into account. Do you feel like he uses Te? Oftentimes male F types will emphasize their T functions in accordance with society at large (female T types often feel pressured to do the same), so it can create a lot of "on the border" type feelings. 

Side note, now craving cheap Tex-Mex.Whoa, I've never actually considered this before. I find them both fascinating, but Socionics is definitely more overwhelming to me. I personally prefer the simpler model - it leaves a lot more room for interpretation and that's just the way I like it, even if it does kind of get Ti-Ne "squish and distort everything until it fits" at times.  

However, /u/peppermint-kiss is an Fe-dom and loves her some socionics. p: I'm sure she could provide a more informed opinion than I can. Hmm. FYI This'll prolly turn into a *long* rant cause I'm hyped on Vyvanse and am doing jack shit today lmao. 

I agree with a lot of your points tbh. A big irritant for me is when people completely ignore the subtleties in the information they're given in favor of proving themselves right. There's so much nuance in almost everything, so why not explore it further? Like you say, nothing is black or white. 

I actually get annoyed at arguing and debating for the most part. I don't like starting them (inb4 not a true ENTP) because people treat debates and discussions like a game where you compare who has the most points at the end. Who gives a shit about being right? Honestly. Why does it matter? Are you going to take all of your Right coins to the Right machine and exchange them for Right prizes? Probably not. Being wrong can rock your entire world, and while jarring at times, it's not inherently a bad thing. Also, I'm not attacking someone's ideas when I question them - I genuinely want to know more and have them expand, whether I agree or not. I'm an information fiend, it's what I do. A belief that isn't challenged is one to be wary of, imo.

(Actually, tangent - I find IxTPs have to be really careful about this. Ti is the castle build on sand, and if a premise is faulty, the tower will fall no matter how logically you reach a conclusion. IxTPs can be extremely hardheaded when they fear their tower is about to collapse. I've been guilty of it, but I think dom Ne helps mitigate some of this.)

Another one: The idea that being curious about a belief or an event or a mindset is the same as condoning it. My brother and I discussed this recently. "HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG!" edgelords aside, I find that trying to understand the mindset of people/groups who do terrible things gets me some weird reactions. Understanding is a great tool imo and getting fired up just because I'm not automatically stomping my feet and condemning someone/something is just silly. 

More broadly, I believe there is always a reason things happen - many reasons, usually. Everything makes sense to me, even if I don't understand it. (Does that make sense?). Not in the way that "I understand it all!" but in the way that everything has a precursor and a result, everything is made up of moving parts, and I want to know what they are. I don't think anything is truly isolated. The butterfly effect really fucks with my head lmao

More minor annoyances: 

-Probably also my ADHD, but I get distracted as fuck. Ne calm the fuck down pls. 

-It's frustrating when people think what I care about is useless and not worth thinking about. Especially since I always try to hear people out and understand their side. 

-I have a bone to pick with Ne itself actually. I hate how painfully aware I am of the fact that I can't know or have it all, and that every time I make a choice, I'm closing other doors that might never re-open. I wish I could live a hundred lives. But now I just reassure myself that doors open and close all the time and the world will never run out of possibilities. Different Ne user, but I find repetitive stuff weirdly soothing. All of my outfits are pretty much the same, I eat the same bland foods, I like things to be comforting and familiar. My brain is off in lala land, and I need the rest of me to be comfortable and low-maintenance. Yeah, sometimes people get caught up in the ego of it and won't be honest with themselves. There's nothing wrong with being ISFJ, INFJ, ESTP, whatever - everybody has their strengths and weaknesses, everybody envies somebody else, and everybody has their personal prides. p: Yep! It can be a little exhausting (which is why I prefer ISxPs) for me, but I like them a lot. There aren't really any types I can't get along with, it really depends on if the other person can tolerate me or not. 

And he does sound more ESFP to me - logical coherence is actually a great phrase to describe Ti! But ultimately, you know him best and I'm sure you can make a good call. Ti and Fi is easier for me to distinguish (I pretty much live with an INTP and an INFP, lol) with a little insight. They're both sort of frameworks of the inner self, and Ti is more concerned with truth, correctness, and consistency (does it make sense?), while Fi is more concerned with authenticity, emotional independence, and individuality (does this feel right?). I'm the local INTP kidnapper/creeper. Kidding, kinda. 

I really like INTPs. I think y'all can be stubborn and come to some pretty wild conclusions at times, but overall I enjoy the balance of Ne-Ti/Ti-Ne. My SO is an INTP and we've been together for two years (met here, actually!), and we can nerd out together 24/7. We can be extra spacey and chatty af, but it's usually a pretty good dynamic.Everyone has their own limits. I used to be incredibly antagonistic and obnoxiously pedantic, lol. 

I do occasionally enjoy fucking with people, but it's usually once they've already made an ass of themselves and aren't open to any reasonable discourse. If I come to that conclusion, all bets are off and I'll have a field day messing with them. p: You're really running off with the assumption that he's going to prioritize his work over you. (Also, how long have yall been together/how old are yall?). 

Just because he prioritizes achievements over relationships doesn't mean that he doesn't give a shit about his relationships at all. Most healthy, functional people are going to want a balance of a few things in their life. Usually 2-4 things out of many: family, friendships, career goals, children, hobbies, personal fulfillment, education, whatever. 

If that's something that upset you, then just talk to him about it. ENTJs can be a little oblivious when it comes to meeting the emotional needs of their partners, so you'll need to be able to communicate your needs a little more forcefully than you may with say, an ESFJ. On the upside, ENTJs also appreciate people who are honest and direct with what they need, especially if you can tell them specifically what will help you (I would like you to be able to spend time with me on weekends, I need you prioritize certain events and days with me, the time we spend shouldn't be divided between your email and myself, etc.). 

My dad's an ENTJ and while he throws himself into his work, he has always gone out of his way to be with his family on holidays, take his wife on dates and holidays, show up to our events, and make us a priority in his life. I'm worse about it than he is tbh...That makes sense (and ngl does sound a little moar ENFP than INFP). I don't know if I have any real fixed stances besides "know more" lmao. 

It's pretty irritating. I think most ENTPs aren't nearly as harsh and argumentative as we're made out to me, and I agree. ESTx's tend to be more inflammatory IME (although we can definitely be assholes too). I think we're different flavors of jerk, really. I think ExTJ assholishness is very blunt and harsh, like a brick to the face while they attempt to do. ExTPs are more needling and criticize relentlessly and often are assholes while attempting to chase after knowledge or pick something apart. I think we're less likely to cast judgment and more likely to relentless nitpick faults and inconsistencies. 

That sounds hard. My brother is suspected to be on the spectrum but my mother refused to get him tested. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI, so I have the attention span of the goldfish and the work ethic of an eggplant lmao. Also I hate that song omg. I suck socially, but I have some serious personality issues that really affect the way I relate to others. 

That's interesting. What makes you place Si &gt; Te over the inverse? I've finally stopped seriously questioning my type (although with the aforementioned personality issues, there is the looming possibility that I maybe could be ENFP, but I'd say the chances are about 90-10 at this point). Depends how drastically treatment alters me or if it does at all. 

I think Ne is a very optimistic function overall (barring Ne-fueled anxiety where you can imagine EVERY POSSIBLE WAY something can go wrong). :D They are charming IMO, and I get along better with them than ENTJs as a whole (although I enjoy being around both). 

I actually wanted to make that exact point about tertiary functions! f;lkdasjf ldjo;isj ;oijg;dslijf;oijfa; I just wasn't sure if I was full of shit and I had already written a lot so I didn't. The good lord knows how hot and cold my relationship with Fe is. 

It should seem obvious, but I tend to accept people's assessments of themselves until I see evidence to the contrary. I should probably remain skeptical, but I find that a little tiring when I'm constantly surveying others for inconsistencies. (Note to self: This is probably an argument against you being an INTP) 

The vibes are definitely different IRL, but I think text can lose some of those nuances that help contrast the two. At least until you wind them both up, lmao. 

Omg I want to get an ESTJ with ADHD and compare to a subclinical ENTP. OR even compare BOTH with ADHD and see how differently they act and how they cope. Lolol yeah I'm an ENTP female. p: 

Yeah if you're having a reaction like that my advice is to just sit on it for a bit. I think Ne-doms like us tend to sort of... vomit out whatever we're thinking and feeling, much to our detriment. I always am considering the future and all of the ways it could go, so don't think I'm criticizing you for that. Just beware of attaching assumptions to those projections and work with the information you do have, and if you need more then ask. 

I don't share any functions with my dad, but dealing with dom Te, you learn. There are definitely different "ideal" pairings out there, but every pair out there will have it's potential pitfalls and imo the way to beat those are through self-awareness, perspective, and communication. Yeah, there's a veiled quirkiness that their NTJ counterparts don't seem to have (the NTJs have more of a hidden adventurousness instead - similar but different in subtle ways). Then again, I'm like a bloodhound with Ne lmao so I immediately will gravitate to the quiet weirdos. p: 

Oh yeah. I think there are different functional reasons and I don't think it's limited to sensors, but I definitely do. I think the variance would depend on what nature of question is being asked. 

For me, it's usually because I don't have solid plans, most of my stances on any issues are muddled, and there are a lot of asterisks that come with my answers. So I'm really long-winded. that was funnyGo further - you can find whole new problems to solve!The TIA was after I'd started anticoags for life, but before the original clots dissolved in my lungs. I also have an MTHFR mutation that raises clotting risk. 

I'm not sure what the expectancy is there. With APS in particular, it's a case of "it's fine until it's not", to some extent. There are other symptoms that irritate me day-to-day, but my life is expected to be normal unless I get massively unlucky again. I have some of the woundseal powders just in case I get a nasty cut, and it works like a charm. Internal bleeding is a gamble, lol. 

It's all about probability, and I'm *probably* going to be fine, but I always consider the alternative outcomes. I try for a few minutes, but it doesn't last long. Similar, yes, as its autoimmune, but there's no way to monitor clotting agents in the medication I take. The most similar disease is systemic lupus, I think there's a 30-40% crossover in lupus patients who also have APS iirc and there are some crossover symptoms. 

I think there's some correlation with the lupus related HLA genes but there's no real genes that can be pinpointed as a yes or no. like many autoimmunities, it seems to be a mixture of genetic and environmental, with infections and particular medications being two possible triggers. It's not particularly well-studied, but there was a 3.5 million pound grant awarded for APS research, and hopefully other autoimmune research becomes applicable. 

It's not limited to one organ - CAPS is a nasty subset that will microclot multiple organs at once and usually has a 50% mortality rate, give or take. That's extremely rare, though. 

That's not a loop, though. The concept of a look is the function order essentially becoming Te-Ne in this case, where they're talking about the tertiary function being overemphasized to the point where it's mistaken for first. Thanks!Not localized so far as anybody knows. 

And no, there's not. The specific number and type of antibodies aren't reliably predictive of clots, you can't really track where they may happen, and I can't tell how well the medication works. Warfarin is the only measurable one, but I also have a genetic resistance, hence the different drugs.

Really, the measure is "it works until it doesn't", in which case I hope to know in time. The first embolisms were found only because I had the sheer luck of having a nurse who also experienced blood clots at a young age and thought to order a test. Terrifying, but also amusing. Agreed. I think some of the earlier questions were a decent start, but once we delve into usage habits I'm not so sure they're that helpful. IT RUINS MILLIONS OF LIVESYeah, inside I'm a combination of anxious, hostile, and suspicious. Oh well. I'm working on it. You rang?ay bbType: ENTP

Fuck: ENTP, ESTJ 

Marry: ENTP female, INTP male

Kill: ISFJ or ESTP. Maybe INFP. I could justify killing any of y'all tbh. Prefer to be killed then banged, but I'll take it. LOL so my roommate is an INFP and we get along great, but oh man I've never seen more of an Fe-Fi contrast than between us. 

He's jaded and cynical, and has all of these principles that he just can't explain. Like, it makes sense on one hand, but I don't know how things just "feel right" to him. It makes no sense at all to me. He's got a strong sense of justice and is really principled, even to his own detriment. 

He's all about being himself and won't bend to please anyone else or compromise his authenticity. His creative endeavors are a way of expressing his personality and his soul. Idk, the idea of a central personality and core values (or anything to express) is utterly alien to me, not exaggerating at all. 

He always does a double take when I can't decide on a stance, or I start researching some questionable beliefs, or I just don't know what I believe. He's sometimes appalled that my morals and guiding principles are absorbed from others and are permanently in flux, and that I look almost exclusively outside myself for guidance. I lack a lot of passion that he has and he always jokes that I'm dead inside most of the time. 

Great guy, but the F functions are a huge gap between us. We still get along tho. 

It happens to me and I do it to others. I attract and am attracted to weird. I'm going to go with ISFJ, else INFJ. I also see the Sicthat the other poster is talking about, and the moment you elaborated on the "something missing" and not knowing yourself, that started to tip me off to Fe-Ti. Usually that sentiment arises with higher Fe and lower Fi. Oh yeah it is. I've found STPs to be a bit boring in bed tbh. dude you're most likely an infj lmao all of your reasons for hesitation are rooted in what other people might think about you and how others of the type might make you appear. 

Not that they're completely invalid concerns, but damn lmaoSeconded, the only other option I could potentially see is INTP, but that's a distant second. One of the few infjs and you can hardly convince him. The irony is funny. Omg ENTPs and INTPs are so bad about "whoa you're showing an emotion you're so butt hurt and trolled lololol wow calm down snowflake" sometimes. And we think we're much better at reading people than we are. 

Fi just confuses me utterly and completely. The only INFJ I'm sure of IRL doesn't necessarily think she's special or unique, but she's very aware of how strange she is. I think the Ni-Fe can come into a weird sort of conflict and it's easy for them to be locked on the outside. I think that's why we get along so well. Not impossible but you're just not as Fe imo. oh kk I dig lady intjs. MmphDunno about ranking but I know that "curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back" is my life mottoTi is sort of the castle built on sand. Usually Ti users will deduce and make logically consistent arguments, but if the material isn't verified, it can seem like "it just makes sense to me". 

Ti also loves to take apart and identify the pieces that make up a whole. It's deconstructing, so a lot of the time you'll find that Ti users are less worried about efficiency and more concerned with being thorough. 

There's a Ti vs Te thread from like two days ago around here. Fi is not real it doesn't exist make it go away You sound slightly unhinged LETS DO IT. The Ti definitely comes through over Skype, which is why it was in my consideration set, but not as strongly as Fe. I mean, gender is relevant in typing...They're in the Slack...I would lean towards low Fe, as there seems to be a level of anxiety/overthinking around the problem. They are concerned and clearly care about giving others the right expression and validating them, but aren't confident in their ability to do so. 

I experience similar feelings tbh.I actually am kind of similar to you in that respect, although I haven't had quite as many treatment attempts. I also have ADHD, PTSD, and the usual depression/anxiety combo. I think my therapist and I have located some of the root causes of what we thought was a personality disorder. 

Depending on what kind of PD you might have, you might not fully identify a type as MBTI doesn't really take pathologies into consideration. It's really a best-fit thing and I don't have a great answer for you. The biggest tip-off for me was my leading perception function, Ne. No matter how screwed up in the head I am at any given point, I always identify with Ne. 

As I stabilize, the Ne-Ti is more apparent, but for a person in flux you may not get a clear answer right away. Sorry you're dealing with this, btw.Yep. I'm certain on Ne dom, and I'm like 90% on Ti &gt; Fi. I can't begin to fathom Fi tbh. Logically, that only leaves one option left. 

There are other theories I have, but I don't have a lot of basis for it until I get more information. Nothing is ever 100%.awkProbably air, out of those. O:The best relationship I've had with an INFJ is having one as a close friend. How you act has less to do with typing than the information people can pull from your history tbh But gender and socialization affect the way people type themselves. Empathy doesn't have anything to do with wherever you're a thinker or a feeler. You sound like someone who really really wants to be an NT type. Nice analysis. I'm going to agree and say I can't even think of any conflicts off the top of my head p: It's different, but they seem to work well together. I find more conflict with Se, actually. Se can also be responsible for a love of "aesthetic". But overall, isfp sounds very fitting! How are you when it comes to your principles? Are yours strong? What does it take to alter them, and how do you respond when people try to make you to? How harmonious are you? How likely to conform to a group? Do you have a good sense of how people are generally feeling/do you subconsciously keep tabs on that mood in the room? 

Are you generally more about what feels right to you and is true to yourself, or are you more about things making logical sense and understanding what makes up something? Nice breakdown. I'm still trying to come to a conclusion, but +1 for the clear picture.The 5th element. The sad part is that I didn't. YO I FEEL THE SAME ABOUT WATER. I don't think I'm as water-like personality wise (if that makes sense) but water is my shitttttttt. Swimming, rowing, boats, storms, oceans, whatever. I don't know, the being unaware of others' feelings while being in tune with their own is hallmark Fi, and tertiary Ni/auxiliary Se would also make sense given OPs own descriptions/suspicions imo. 

INFJ seems a little out of place here, ISTP seems more likely (although I'm still thinking Fi &gt; Fe - Ti dom would be a weird placement though.) Yeah, you sound pretty INFJ, I'm going to back the other user here. That's literally not how it works lol keep on with your edgy NT selfMBTI isn't behavior. You don't understand the theory and you're missing the point. [here is a good beginner's guide to cognitive functions](https://www.google.com/amp/thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/06/if-youre-confused-about-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-read-this-an-intro-to-cognitive-functions/amp/)

Basically, different types can behave in similar ways but with different underlying motivation and perception. That's what it's about, so traits and behaviors can be helpful, but the reasoning underneath is more relevant. Yeah, Fi + Se is that combo is "IT ME!" Hehe. I love how expressive those two are together. I mean they aren't *bad*, I'm just really kinda freaky and haven't found many STPs to be that interested. INTPs have been my best but it could be a numbers or chemistry thing. 

(I'm trying to sleep with one of each type. I'll do a writeup after LMAO)Oh god me. I think I'm hilarious. Just most others don't...Ne-Ti is good for wit imo because it quickly draws connections between different concepts and can find similarities and inconsistencies that can be relayed via humor. :D 

Except some of my connections are too far out to be funny so I just laugh at my own joke. Anywhere from 11pm-7am. Interesting. I usually notice STJs because of the presence of Ne. I guess we can just tack you up on the sidebar for examples of ENTJs. 

If my dad weren't ENTJ I'd be too scared of y'all. So intense and spooky. He always gets cranky at me due to my lack of ambition. My dream is to latch onto an ENTJ and be their odd but ingenious advisor/assistant/person who does sketchy things and keeps their name out of it. I have Ne radar or something, it's the easiest way to to pick y'all up. Closet weirdos, most of you. :DI'd consider myself an introvert if it weren't for the functions, most likely. I'm definitely Ne &gt; anything else. 

I need a lot of time away from people, and I'm exhausted after meeting up with others. I prefer to socialize online, or with my boyfriend. I can easily go days without leaving the house, but I try to avoid that for my own wellbeing. I'm mildly to moderately anxious in social situations. 

I do need to go outside and be around people, though. And just get out of my head mostly, I think my extroversion takes the form of "can recharge by quietly absorbing from environment, ideas, media, and people outside oneself". Uhh, what? That was an unironic resource meant to help you out as a beginner. 

But you have such a shit attitude it's probably for the best! T types appear more often in men, and the reverse in women. Because women as a whole are encouraged to be less assertive and more nurturing, sometimes T women can be mistyped as F. The same is true due to F traits being discouraged in men. It's pretty basic.

My dream job would be to work for an NTJ as their sketchy right-hand person. Especially if they're a villain. Thought this said asskickers, I'm watching too much Always Sunny. Props to you grilYou should read my recent topic on ESTJs and why they type more commonly than expected as ENTPs if you haven't. 

TL;DR In most descriptions, ESTJ Ne isn't really touched on or given credit for at all, and ESTJs basically come off way more close-minded and and harsh than they really are. I find them more flexible and quick on their feet than ENTJs, especially once they're mature. ESTJs who read all of these descriptions and don't identify are likely to move on to ENxP or ENTJ - something that describe some of the intuitive flair/fluidity they have in their tertiary spot. 

That's always my first thought when someone is torn between ENTP and ENTJ, anyway. :D Wat. p: ESTJs and ENTJs are almost the same about of expression from my experience - similar to IxTJs. Stronger emotional expression is usually tied to Fe, not Fi (although emotional strength can apply to both). 

I think ESTJs can be a little goofier and relaxed on their "off" time, they let their imagination wander, and I've mixed up tipsy/wound-up ESTJs for ENTPs and ENFPs before hehe. They can be playful and don't mind getting a bit fanciful and silly, especially with other Ne users. I can usually tell an STJ from an NTJ after a bit of prodding - STJs will usually respond with Ne if I haven't pissed them off, where the NTJ just makes me go :( lmao. (Not that I don't love NTJs too, it's just different interactions). Older ESTJs might not be like this, but most ESTJs I meet are usually 18-30. 

ENTJs are more likely to want to blow off steam and tap into that Se - my dad is married to an ESTP (and previously married an ESFP - he loves his Se) and I know that his "play hard" is lots of new restaurants, trips to cool places, and general unwinding via, well, sensory experiences with her. Se everywhere! 

ESTJs are actually pretty good at bouncing back from unexpecteds. Si can be very subtle and usually isn't that staid, conservative grumpiness image that people convey. The most obvious tell is that higher Si users kind of have a collection of experiences that they reference almost subconsciously, and they notice when things are "off" or when something they predicted doesn't go the way they're familiar with. Ni users will usually have contingency plans, but sometimes they get so lofty that an unexpected wrench puts them at a full stop. 

You sound like an ESTJ mostly because of your Ne descriptions and honestly, that's what I think of when I read "ENTP that can actually do work" or any variation p: Ni and Ne are very complementary and go well together, but Ni is usually more subdued and sometimes somber, vs the sprightly curiosity of Ne. Yeah, I get vastly irritated at Te doms who think I want the same things as them. P: I don't doubt it. Usually Te encouragement comes across as haranguing. Definitely, definitely ENFP. I didn't say you were one by virtue of being a woman. I don't know why you're unable to comprehend this. However, ExFP is most likely for you. That's literally. Not. How. It. Works. I sent you a link, I've tried to explain. Help yourself if you're that interested. It meI've said it once and I'll say it again:

Female ENTPs are horrendous, awful creatures. They need to either be lobotomized into ENFPs/ESTJs or rounded up and thrown into a pit of vipers. Sad.No, Christ. Okay drop the gender thing, that part isn't even as relevant. Anyways, long comment incoming. 

Feeling and Thinking are simply the way you judge things and it's not about how often or strongly you feel. You'll use Te-Fi or Fi-Te. It's also possible to be a feeler and not very empathetic or emotionally expressive, especially as an Fi user. Fi is tied to values and principles, authenticity and individuality. 

A lot of your outbursts seem to take stabs at your own competence, and a few times you defend your identity and say we couldn't possibly know you, and some of how you act and reply here goes towards typing you. Usually a preoccupation with seeming competent and being known for who you *really* are is a sign of Te-Fi axis. 

So by calling you a feeler, people aren't saying you have a ton of feelings or you make irrational decisions based on your feelings. Hell, if an Fi user decides cold hard logic is their thing, they'll stick to that too.

Typically, Ne-Ti (ENTP) is associated with openness, a thirst for knowledge, perspective, a search for truth that's detached from the ego, and curiosity. So your stubbornness and reluctance to read on the functions seems really counter to what ENTPs are about at their heart.

However, Fi-Te users will usually only learn something if it's personally important, or if they're going to need it at some point. Te is more concerned with competence, practicality, pragmatism, and execution - getting shit done basically. Fe-Ti users are more likely to care about what others think and let outside values influence them, which seems counter to your description. I also don't empathize well, but I do base a lot of what I do around others and their feelings influence me. 

So you're most likely on the Fi-Te axis. And you identify as an extrovert, yes? That doesn't mean you're an ENFP. You could be ESFP, ESTJ and ENTJ as well. I've seen ESTJs who seem ditzy and relaxed odd-hours, and I've seen ENFPs be all-business. However, your preoccupation with telling us how level and rational you are makes me suspect it could be your tertiary function. That's just an idea. 

I'm really not trying to be a dick here, you're just on the defensive when people are trying to help you out. Being an F type isn't an insult and doesn't mean you're irrational. Actually, ExFPs have their feeling and thinking functions right next to each other. You could also be a TJ type - those share the same functions but in a different order. 

A good idea would be to just look at Fi vs. Fe, Ti vs. Te, Si vs. Se, and Ni vs. Ne, and try to pick out even two you identify strongly with, in no particular order. Out of the 16 types, there are quadras of types that share functions. ESFJ, INTP, ENTP, and ISFJ all share the same functions ordered differently. The order is basically priority/preference, not ability. 

All the functions are are a way of labeling different perception and decision making processes. Yo hook a girl up, that's my dreammmm. Got them connections and favors and weird talents, I'll be the best mastermind's assistant ever. Dat Ti over Fi. As obnoxious as we can be, I think being a girl accelerates that Fe and makes us a bit softer. I used to always get "oh you're way calmer in person" before I was constantly anxious :D Ne-Fe is very good about understanding the perspectives of others when Ti doesn't get in the way.

Also dat awkwardness/charm balance. :DDozens of us ENTP lefties!I think there are correlations, but I think there are also different motivations for each type and why the might subscribe to a belief. That plus environment and culture. :DYeah that about does it. I've seen Si doms say that even when they do new things, they're going into it with the knowledge that it's going to be stored for later and it's almost like you guys make these mental preparations so it sits in your Si pool perfectly, without being quite present in whatever moment is being preserved. It's super interesting. 

I wonder if it could be possibly related to that. It could be undervalued Se as well. It's hard to live in the present - I usually live parallel. Present timeline, alternate reality. I don't think ESTP is a bad fit here, although I can't tell you for certain. What... type are you? I can't fathom not daydreaming about shit that will never happen or that doesn't exist for like 8+ hours a day. o.0I do too. p: I think about stuff like that as my as I think of regular stuff. 👌🏻 External behavior, yes, but that's not what type is based on. It's more about perception and judgment, the way you think vs. how you act. The way you think obviously impacts your behavior, but behavior is also influenced by life happenings, relationships, environment, etc. ENTP female: Wrath and pride for sure... lust and sloth. Those are the four I'm probably regularly guilty off. ENTP... Silicon Valley?

Edit: Dallas is probably ESTJ. Maybe ENTJ. Yikes, Houston. I'm an Austinite at heart tho. Oooooh yes I'm free Saturday afternoon/evening and Sunday. Hi fellow Texan~ Ooh, good one. My infp roomie started musing about it aloud lmao. Playfulness, wit, curiosity, a bit of social awkwardness, earnest charm, and a unique deviousness that isn't necessarily malicious. - Elsie Hughes from Westworld

- Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter

- Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events 

- Alice from Alice in Wonderland (movie moreso than the book, but I relate to both) 

- Howl from Howl's Moving Castle (book version from Diana Wynne Jones - movie is more ISFP) 

- Lessa from Dragonriders of PernDARIAOne of my favorite INTJs is actually Artemis Fowl. He starts off as the typical teenage iamverysmart stereotype and the series has his develop empathy and a conscience alongside his Fi. p: This is terrible logic, lol. The reason we even differentiate cognitive functions in the first place is because we *do* behave similarly to certain types and share straits. Understanding the processes under the surface is how you differentiate. It's essentially slapping a label on preferred thinking styles. Oh yes. And her anxious Ti mannerisms are so like me, especially as a young girl. :DNo, I'm talking in general. That's why we all just don't shift to Big 5 - a lot of us are less concerned about traits and moreso about how we led ourselves to those decisions in the first place. 

If you'd like notable difference between certain types, I can certainly offer you some. ENTP and INFJ is pretty bad too. My coworker and I can't go anywhere without breaking, hiding in, or falling asleep on something. Er... my own, or ESFx? ENTP. 

I don't have a lot of friends, mostly some friendly acquaintances. I meet most of them online, although I met one in school and one at work. 

I usually end up pursuing people who are weird, unusual, and a little messed up in the head. Typically other writers and artists, or compsci people. p:

To be my friend... meh. I don't keep them very well. Basically just don't talk to me a lot unless we're in the area, and tag one another in humorous media on FB. :D 

I have my boyfriend and my roommate I see regularly. My closest friends are an ENFP guy who I don't see much, an IxTJ bestie who I also rarely see, and an INFJ coworker who is moving. Rip me. LMAOESFP and ESFJ can look similar upon first glance - usually female, extroverted, healthy ones are usually popular and warm and enjoy being around people. They can get party-girl stereotyped (unless older, then ESFJ shifts into grandma-stereotype).  

That's about where similarities in. ESFPs thrive on Se-Fi: new places, new experiences, action and movement, self-expression, authenticity. This is why you'll see ESFPs described as being well-suited for the fine and performance arts. "How do I truly feel about this? Does this feel right to me?" The ESFP may like people, but they prioritize the experiences. 

ESFJs run on Fe-Si: Harmony, connection, warmth, relationships, consistency. ESFJs are usually described as well-suited for nurturing careers like teaching, counseling, hospitality or healthcare. Fe is the function that really focuses on the relationship itself. "How are they/others going to react?". They may or may not like certain environments and activities, but the ESFJ is going to prioritize other people. 

ESFJs and ESFPs can be found in similar environments and demographics but there are notable differences in the way they prioritize and process. Top two functions because I'm on a few hours sleep. 

You're right, based on behavior the Big 5 model is simple and valuable. However, I'm personally more interested in the cognitive function model, and it's not to feel special or deep. It's because I find it helps my own communication and interpersonal relationships when I can identify similar (or not) cognitive styles and adjust accordingly. I think you're just salty that you're struggling with it lmfao. I would guess ISTJ, INTJ, or poooossibly ISTP in that order. Leaning towards the former two, though. Istp stepdad, istp stepdad to be, xSTP grandpa, all super into cars and trucks and building shit. And super cool. Ne, and I'm a big daydreamer. I always envision different futures for myself, where things could go, imaginary worlds and characters, etc. I'm never bored because there's always something cool going on in my head. LOL if you're trying that hard you're probably ENTP. Ne-Ti is super good at trying tons of perspectives and jamming in connections that work to make any answer fit to some degree. Then we repeatedly go around in circles because there's no one conclusion that's correct. p: I do it a lot. 

I always go around and around but ultimately I'm an Ne dom and Ti-Fe axis &gt; Fi-Te, so ENTP is just the best fit until I get more information. It can always change lmao. But yeah omg drives and walks are great for daydreaming, it's so entertaining. Reading your other posts, ENTP or ESTJ. Not sure which yet. Leaning towards the latter but I only really get a feel for your perceiving axis and not so much judging. Which should say something in itself but still. Oh yeah!I can see a bit of Te-Fi axis, specifically high Te with the way you organize your information, are competitive, and strongly value your competence. It would really depend on how you argue, and the ways you relate to others. 

As I type this and look back over your post, I think ENTP a little more strongly, I think the above stuck out to me. Like 70-30 I think ENTP. Oh I like tealAlso, sometimes I just fiddle with my flair to see what happens, usually around once a month. I get at least one interesting reaction each time. Realistically, probably IxTP with the inferior Fe and introvertedness. Although all cultures and groups have their own functions that they value, so that could vary from society to society. You don't need empathy to be emotional. I'm low on empathy but I am expressive when I feel emotions. They tend to be correlated, but people can be stony-faced and empathetic, as well as the opposite. Inferior Fx can show up as either, both, or neither. 

Fx are more about values and judgment than about emotion, with Fi being focused inwardly (authenticity) and Fe being focused outwardly (harmony). Fi can be reserved and deep-feeling, with Fe being more affected by external shifts.

Also, you seem to be struggling with a lot of anxiety and emotional turmoil. I may sound forward, but think you might be fixating on MBTI as a way of feeling more in control and having more understanding. I'm sorry you're having a hard time. Are you in a place where you can receive counseling? 

It's hard to even get a proper type when there's emotional or mental problems, so it might be helpful to step away and consider other approaches first, and come back to it later with a fresher view. Feel free to send me a PM if you want to chat with someone. TBH I'm kinda thinking INTJ? But def Ni dom. I'm pretty high rn but I teared up a little. I'm trying to figure out how to connect to people and it's super difficult, but you summed it up so succinctly that I'm a little stunned. p: This is interesting but there are a few misassigned functions. Agreed on INTP, enneagram could be 4w5/5w4. 45/75 IIRC, I forgot already and I closed it out. I mostly guessed unfortunately. There were like 2 faces I actually recognized by the end of it. Darn, I don't want my own goals and ambitions. I'd rather be someone's underling. SAME THO

I don't like games, I pretty much just show up like hey let's date friendo+1 for ladies who like ladies 

Hey bb ENTP: at least pretend to listen to my tangents, don't insult my ideas, don't drag me out of the house too much, don't get mad if there's paint everywhere, don't yell at me, basically just leave me be and occasionally ask me to clarify what I'm doing.

I like people who are geeky, eccentric, open-minded, accepting, introverted, witty, smart, and who will probably take some control of the relationship. 

Uh fuck you im never emotional because I'm an NT. 

*quiet sobbing*Oh my god yes. I have no real ambition at all lmao. But I would loooooooove to partner up with a TJ type (villainous? Even better!) and be their second-in-command. I can do all kinds of sketchy shit and use my connections to further their dastardly plans and give them awesome ideas, and I get flexibility and freedom. 

Closest advisor can have a really nice bubble of excitement and challenge, minus the immense responsibility and execution. it me:D...If he ever wants a loyal mastermind's associate, you have my inbox. :D MAN I've always wanted to be an evil villain!How do you act under stress? Do you know why you act that way? 

How do you approach work that you don't want to do vs. things you do want?

How will you know if you're successful in life? How do you measure your happiness and value? 

What is your emotional affect like? Are you typically straight faced? Do you wear your feelings (even just the shallow ones) on your sleeve? Do you think you're more externally warm or cold?

How do you relate to other people? How close do you get and with how many? What are the pros and cons to being your friend? 

Maybe some of those will help. 

I'm pretty sure you're ESTJ, given this. :DHehe. Your perceiving axis is prettt obvious, it's the judging that really was harder to pick out. no one is going to read your long ass ramblings of cognitive functions. Just because you can spew out masses of text doesn't mean you understand them, especially if you can't succinctly introduce somebody new. not at allYou think ENTP? I've been going back and forth between ENTP and ESFJ. He seems really Ne heavy at times, but there's also a lot of Si reasoning when he plays (always pulling from previous games he's played to try and establish patterns for how the game is going to go, he has set approaches/expectations for each genre and then will adapt once those patterns break). 

And the dude is like a fountain of Fe. Ti seems relatively quiet, even accounting for it being an introverted function. I find ESFJ with ADHD to be a little more fitting than ENTP, although both seem likely. Strong third for ISTP. This happens a lot when people get split between INTx, actually. Your hands-on approach to hobbies and learning, enjoyment of movement and outdoors (stereotyping a little here), generally pragmatic and phlegmatic nature, no-BS and good at finding solutions, best moments being when you're going somewhere or seeing something new. "Take me as I am, I don't care about yours" is very inferior Fe. 

Ti-Se as fuck. 👌🏻I want to be ENFP. I also thought ISTJ and ESFP sounded cool af. ENTP bruh welcomeENTP

Would rather be ENFP, ESTJ. I really want Fi, or at least whatever they seem to have. Inner fire, passion, sense of individuality, authentic. RIP Fe. Bruh that Fi envy. Same afI think Ti is pretty good with words, if you're going for precision over efficiency. Especially Ne-Ti. Well, S and N aren't about spontaneity and organization. 

Specifically, ISTPs use Ti-Se and INTPs use Ti-Ne. Se and Ne can both be lax and spontaneous. Ti is what both types lead with, and that accounts for introvertedness, being in ones own head, detail and precision. 

Check out the description on typeinmind.com/TiSe. They have a good description that accounts for functions (which is why people are saying Te and Ti instead of T). They also have a cool test - typeinmind.com/quiz (password is "personality"). I got INTP, so not too far off. 

What are the checks and balances? Aside from the last couple of questions, it seems to be similar questions to Johns test. It's pretty obvious which functions correlate with which answer, but that's also coming from someone who's been at this for a while, so not your target. 

Not a bad start. One thing I'll point out - be careful about ignoring function placement. I noted one Fi vs. Fe question had me choosing the "Fi" answer because my Fe is lower in my stack and not a priority. Just something to think about!I can't say I like their system. With so many guest posts, the typing styles are all over place. It's generally pretty inconsistent - sometimes you'll get a good post, then you'll get some that are just awful. Which is why I noted those attributes in reference to Ti, in case eloquence meant different things to us. dat PoLR fe Aye, but how many times can you account for that to check out its possible? Do you have a certain threshold for that? Better to iron it out now before some stranger fuck than I comes along. Is there another degree of separation, since I still didn't quite get the right type? 

I'd be interesting in seeing what model you used, actually. I've tried thinking of some testing structures but just for fun, I haven't wowed myself enough to flesh one out. Okay, that's pretty cool!ENFP as fuck You sound Se as fuck lol. INFJ, for both. Fe is pretty expressive and INFJs in particular are pretty good at mimicking/mirroring. I know I just have tert Fe and even then, I wear my emotions on my sleeve and don't hide them well unless I have an objective and have to act normal temporarily. 

Also, Italian-Americans ftw. My family is from Matera and surrounding areas, and a lot of servers have experienced our flails. 

Edit: Also all the Fi users I know generally aren't super expressive unless they're positively overwhelmed. They usually just are content, or pensive lmao. ENFPs also have the extra mode of batty-happy due to Ne. SameI'm just imagining you staring angrily at the stop and huffing "bus" and nothing else when you try to talk
"Fun fact!" *proceeds to share fact that is decidedly not very fun*

"Dumb bitch" 

"I don't know what you want me to do about that" 

"Oh, so this is tangentially related..."

"Swear to god I will end [he/she/it/them/everyone]"

Considering your age and gender, probably ENTP. Just depends on if you're a heavy Ne user or not. You sound like me, tbh, and I could be mistaken for an ExFJ in the wild. I've always found the opposite. He's rather feminine imo and has high emotional affect in his demeanor, and watching him play little nightmares... idk if it's that game but damn if he doesn't leak Fe. And didn't he start crying in one of his vids talking about his fans? Or was that someone else? He's very open with his emotions and even when he gets speculative, it sounds more Si than Ti, usually throwing back rather than truly dissecting. (Random side note, I find ESFJ guys and ENTP women to be pretty similar in affect and personability - wonder if it's like that for other gender/type pairings). He's got that ESFJ warmth that I've seen in other ExFJ men - a sort of soft charisma that's a bit different than most ENTPs I've known.

That's pretty much why I'm split, much higher Ne than ESFJs, but much higher Fe (and possibly Si) than I'd expect from an ENTP guy his age. Most of my friends I met online, actually. 

Otherwise, Bumble and Tinder are kinda fun (but I'm a girl and only look for girls so the culture is a bit differen) and I've made a couple friends that way. I'm basically just vetting people to see how weird they are. 

Meetups for sports or hobbies would probably be a good route to try. Maybe university clubs? Classes somewhere?

Edit: Other user said develop Fe, I went the other way and learned how to spot Ne/higher Ni. My odds of connecting become much higher in the presence of another N dom. Yeah, I'm actually kind of agreeing on this, could also be ESFJ. 

He's too unhealthy to be typed properly, most likely. Damn, the self-awareness here is high. 

I'm gonna say ISFP. Next guess would be ISTP, but it's not a close second. /r/bitchimabus

Jk I would rage too, my road rage is unrealI think Se and Te due to your views on status and success. I think Fi due to the love of drama, emotional volatility, yet not being very outwardly expressive - dramatic Fe users are usually higher in emotional affect. Inferior Fe/high Ti is pretty detached and mellow, and often chooses to avoid conflict. 

You just don't sound like you have a ton of chill lmao.  Not a lot, unfortunately. There are only a few enneatypes I know about. All the INFJs I know are fairly private until you get them going, then they're just like open books honestly. Maybe not their thoughts, but their feelings. Hehehe Ne for dayyyyyz. 

Yo we do too. Italian and Texan, I have a very... boisterous family. Most are ESXP and ExTJ. I might take some of this advice. Lol @ body language, mine is terrible and reads as me being distracted because I can't stop moving and I'm incapable of not sitting in weird ways. Hmm, those are some fair points. I didn't know about the engineering thing. ENTP makes sense, then. imitation is the sincerest form of flatteryDEJA VUUUUUUI don't. Really. Hardly ever, unless it's going to be a huge detriment to me. p: I try to "delegate" tasks where I can, otherwise I just move on. 

The rare times I do finish something, it's amphetamines and prayer so. If you're on the Te-Fi axis I'll eat a hat. ENTP.

I'm preeeeetty certain I'm an Ne dom, so there's that. But low-key wondering if I'm an ENFP with broken Fi. TL;DR pathological lack of identity and sense of self (and a resulting lack of solid principles), which are all associated with Fi. 

If I do a bunch of therapy and shit maybe I'll wind up actually being an ENFP. Or maybe I just really want Fi. I think Ne can project into the future well (especially combined with Si) but Ne itself is like, conceptually present-oriented imo. I'm pretty sure that's my current best fit. I still have my suspicions, though. We'll see in a few months. p:You're pretty much dead on. I don't have a very stable sense of self so it's all up in the air honestly lmao Yeahhhh I always have a type crisis it's cool. Part of it, yes. I've got an 8-year block missing. It's just not about retrieval because we can't guarantee that, but more about working through the implications of what those memories contained. And learning how to relax and become more trusting when it comes to others. 

(Seriously, the result report makes me sound like a paranoid, suspicious creep LOL but that's the pure report without any subjective interpretation. It also said I'm sensitive to criticism and I got offended at it.)&gt;Te only stores important information 

SavageNot certain of the wing 100% but I get 7w8/783 a lot. I've gotten 5w4 and 5w6 once in a while, but usually that correlates to depression with me. Most of it is familial, but that's the gist - that level of stress inhibits proper development of personality/self-concept and makes it hard to rely on others. Just relationship modeling. It's a lot easier now that I know why and it's probably partially responsible for my elevated mood. :DHonestly I just like harassing you about it lolol. It's okay I'm still questioning if I'm an Fi user or not. 

I don't know what you are, since you've got your own issues and you're really young, so you haven't even fully developed mentally and emotionally. You may be SOL for a couple years lmao. Doesn't mean you can't try, but I wouldn't be surprised if you do a few more switches. I turn 23 soon and I feel like I'm just, *just* beginning to settle into myself. 

From what I've seen, I don't get an INTP feel but there could be a lot of reasons for that. I lowkey have thought you're an Se user before but I don't remember why. 

Fi user is a coin toss for me, it could be an identity thing, but it could also be taking serious offense to people coming at you and tearing apart the way you came to your conclusions (aka your systems, in a way) Nice new username. And thanks! That's the goal. Another day, another MBTI! 

Nah honestly it really is just ENxP at this point, and I'm leaning 70-30 to ENTP. Ti tends to make heuristics in a way. It constructs its own frame so information can be quickly checked and chucked if need be. So in a way it does generalize, but that's after it's been built. 

That's also why Ti is kind of dirty information and Te is more "pure" (unless they have bad sources or interpret information incorrectly lol), but more pure in the sense that when it comes in, it's being evaluated on its own merit. 

So it's not like Ti is just limiting data, it's more like it eliminates the amount of rigor used by pre-constructing a place to fit it within itself. it looks for relevance within the system to even get to that point and stockpiles the rest for later. It's like a puzzle. If you have like 95% of it constructed, you can look at the edges of another piece and figure out where it goes without having to do a ton of work for it. But the danger is that if one "piece" is wrong or forced, it compromises the integrity of the total structure. Same goes for Ti. Castle built in sand. Nah FFG is a troll Probably not ENTJ now? EwA L P H A Q U A D R A 4 L Y F EFEEL MY POWERI'm not an ENFJ lol. Way, way too much Ne and Ti for that. 

A female ENTP can seem much heavier on Fe than is the stereotype. I've had to take on the mom role very begrudgingly before. Also at her age (especially if she's in uni), it's definitely possible to be squished into the "bitchy mom" role. It's kind of hard to get anything done if you don't act polite and agreeable to people, unfortunately. I can behave myself, lol. Energy from socialization isn't the mark of extroversion. Ne doms are usually more introverted in appearance than other extroverts. Only other suggestion I have is ESxJ. Dat tert Ne. Why do you get banned? And I'll say 14 more Fair enough!I wouldn't say we're the only ones, but I do think Ne can help mitigate some of the weaknesses behind dating someone similar. Other perspectives and all. Sure, if you're prepared to monitor your personal growth a little more. I prefer to date people similar to myself. I'm dating an INTP guy, and I also have a crush on an INTP girl and an ENTP girl lmao. Dream jobs: 

-Run some cool Etsy shop and sell crafts or props or whatever 

-Thief of rare and mysterious goods

-Artist 

-Programmer

-Supervillain assistant

Some of these are easier to accomplish than others. Deeeeeefinitely Fi. Yep. Prefer girls, but gender isn't much of a thing I'm attracted to Ne and somewhat to Fi, though not as much romantically for the latter. Yeah, I'm split between ISTP and INTP. Different systems btw. 

But basically you have to consider the whole stack. You could rely on Ti, but that means your Fe is there too, so you have to figure out how well you use it. If you use Ti a lot and act unhealthy/immature and don't have much Fe, you may just be immature lmao. if that makes sense. No can do. We make amazing underlings. ENFP cause I'm close enoughwink Yikes. I can't stand ENFJs, they're so troublesoom. 

I'd have to roll with ISTJ. Dom Fe is so smothering...ENTP: I'm ironically uncool dead inside meme trash. INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP ENTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTP INTPAttract an ENTP gril by being fucking weird Ti as a function is pedantic. It's concerned with accuracy and detail, and INTPs specifically can split hairs soooo much. Exactly. You'll often hear me frustratedly exclaim YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN around my INTP lmao Because Te is better at getting to the point and keeping the goal in mind. It can be pedantic, and I'm not saying none of them can be. But Ti is happy to sit and nitpick things that absolutely don't matter and don't effect the end result at all. Either/or. Eccentricity is an immediate spike in interest for me. I pretty much only do things I need to (work, existence) when there's a lot of external pressure. My internal motivation is spotty at best and leads to me sitting around surrounded by art materials, half-completed programming projects, and cats. INTP afMy best friend is an ENFP and he looooooves cosmetology school just FYI. Fi users, so much. I keep activating their Fi tripwires and then I make them mad lmao*hnnnnnnng*LOL my friend group is made up of like... three INTPs, 3-4 istps, one estp, two ESFPs, an infp and an ENFP. 

Those poor NFs. Degeneracy doesn't even begin to describe what happens when you have like 8-9 low Fe users It's ok we don't like you eitherINTPs are by and large very pessimistic people. They're quick to notice things that have gone wrong, things that shouldn't be there, and they're very critical and nitpicky. Not always, but Ti is good at that. 

She very well could find you just depressing to be around. The best thing to do is to basically apologize, ask if there's anything to do better, reassure her you care, and understand that she probably needs some refresher time away from you. If you're genuine and apologetic and not blame-y, then she might well come back when she's ready. If you push and demand, she's out. Lolol it's not even intentional honestly. I just know a lot of Fi users and I consistently accidentally upset them. RIP. Read some profiles. 

Start with typeinmind.com/SiTe and see how that sounds, and take note if any of the functions (Si, Te, Fi, Ne) sound particularly familiar or alien. Was just thinking that actually. Se is more "get to the point" and Ne is more okay with meandering, lol. And both serve Ti so yeah, I think ISTPs are less so. We have one extremely inactive, bitter af IxFJ and one inactive ISTJ. It's a shitshow. Most of our interaction is in a chat room I slip the D inIn general people get corrected or voted down, but mainly it's just stereotyping. P: 

I wouldn't assume fitness is a thing unless I understand the reasoning behind it. If someone is really competitive, Te might be an underlying motivator. Exercise wards off depression for me so I try to do the bare minimum at least nowadays. Inferior Si? Maybe. 

You're going to get a lot of athletes with Se somewhere in their stack, and even then it depends on the sport. Rowing is actually pretty high in both Se and Si users, interestingly enough. Tricky one, at least to me. Definitely Ne or Se high up in the stack, and some of this might indicate lower Ni? I'm not sure about Ti-Fe axis either. I'm kind of leaning towards some kind of SFP or NFP with some mood issues, if I had to take a shot at it. 

I'm still booting from my napFi is confusing and alarming, lol. I can't fathom having that kind of internal judgment. I can't pick it apart and reason it the way I can Fe, because the nature of it is so personal and subjective. Getting into arguments with my INFP roommate usually go nowhere because any Ti attempts just don't work. Send help. I don't relate to that level of empathy, but the desperate Ti post-mortem is something I'm familiar with. When I'm hurt or something, I have to understand why and pull apart every detail over and over and figure out what the underlying motivation was, how it happened, etc. That kind of analysis is like a pacifier, it's soothing af lmaoPothole Fi. 

"I was just driving along, I don't know what happened or where it came from???"&gt;closest friends ENFP

&gt;roommate INFP

&gt;mom ESFP

OopsI DID IT TO MYSELFI don't really remember much, but I was imaginative and apparently talked a lot. My report card notes all painted me as bright and creative, but overall easily distracted, somewhat disagreeable, and never on-topic. You certainly can...Cat~! I like how lovey they are and they are so smol and fluff. LOLOLThat was a strange and slightly uncomfortable read, but I think I've got the message. Ne is really process oriented, though I don't really reject the end results, and I'm rarely disappointed by them, finished or not. They just represent some idea I had or some experiment to try, and it all goes into my figurative lockbox of memories to play with later. It's not actively anything, lol. If anything, it takes Herculean effort to make it stop. My mind runs 20 directions at once, and yes, amidst the chaos there's usually a few nuggets of gold. Or silver, anyway. Weed? Idk, the value of said nug depends on the topic and how tired I am really. When does something stop being a nugget actually? And becomes like, a chunk instead. Or a lump. Idk. Only if you've got a plan for supervillainy. IVE BEEN FOUND OUTJokes on you I don't have my laptop ;/;I...I never thought this day would come. Y E SMy laptop returns today p: but thank you. Focusing is hard ;-;You've been here for every step of the journey. The good kind. Nice sarcasm -.-Know what else is drippy enough? 

Ice cream, then you have summer weather on top of that. Yeah... maybe that's your Fi. Glad my infp roomie doesn't do that or we wouldn't be such a good match. I like Fi I just don't understand it. sooooo misunderstood ~*~*Yeah no i still find INFx types fairly annoying. Nice. I got into an argument with an IxFJ who said being artistic makes me an ENFP. Yikes. 

I agree though. Art is important to me to an extent, but it's not a vehicle for self-expression. I never felt like I quite fit in with other artists and thought my art always lacked a little something - a bit of spark, life? I'm technically proficient, but my art has typically been impersonal. 

My INTP enjoys art the same way, though he's more into creating props and building things. Or at least making plans and diagrams. Follow through and all. 

I'm sad now. A lot of photo threads seem go point to ENTPs having a trademark smirk. Yeah, I'm disagreeing with ENFJ . I'll go with ESTJ. Check out typeinmind.com/TeSi for a good description. My second guess would be ENFP  as blackalyph suggested. Same functions, same Quadra, slightly different function order. 

Pay attention to the Xe/Xi stuff.I've never really found that to be true about ISFJs as a whole. Especially the women.My shorthand for the two is that ESTJs usually have an unusual, imaginative side and are a little less serious once the day is done (Ne), while ENTJs are more sober and have more of an adventurous side (Se). Not that they're both totally mutually exclusive, but there's usually a significant difference. 

You can also see if you relate more to ESFPs or ENFPs when you're relaxed. They share functions with ExTJs, but in different priorities. A little self-victimisation to start the day~!cyanide therapy No, I'm talking about the few INFPs who've been making threads today. Like having a fair-weather friend who also vaguely assumes a mom-like role once in a blue moon. SweeeeetLol, my ENFP bestie has an ESFJ mom and holy balls, Fe can be weird as fuck. It can be super smothering, especially when it's in power over an Fi user. Yessss?Good friend of mine is an esfj dude! He's gay and super camp, but he's like... he knows everything about everyone. He has the hookup for anything you could want and he's super hospitable. I pass out drunk with our intj bestie and he's got our phones plugged in, warm blankets, breakfast in the morning. He manages a hotel so I think that's appropriate. 

Super fashionable, very warm, reasonably intelligent, and very considerate. He's good people, even if he's petty as fuck, but he would definitely set himself on fire to keep someone else warm. Intj lady has to help him set boundaries sometimes. 

He's also hilarious and will never make a social faux pas, and he will rescue me from mine. He's wayyyyyy too social to hang with on a regular basis but he can always show someone a good time. 

8/10 dig itI think at an extreme end, unhealthy/ungrounded Ti is wild af. Eccentric, pedantic, stubborn, logically irrational (or irrationally logical?), hypercritical, pessimistic. Oddball NTPs can seem downright delusional at times. What is this fluff lmao. What chauvinism? Would love to see some instances. Also, what would breathing and eating and sleeping do for these chauvinists? Oddballs even relative to the typical NTP.  You're not wrong lmao. The butthurt infps are out in full force. I'm not sure. It may also relate to position in the stack. 

I find that I rarely know how I feel, especially since I occasionally deal with emotional flashbacks. My feelings are a messy puddle to untangle when i sit and devote time to it. They also kind of leak, it happens on Reddit.  Irl and online, people usually know how I feel before I do. 

I address things on a somewhat pragmatic level first, which doesn't always work out well for me. P: my intp is even worse. I at least value and make effort on my feelings but he struggles more than I do. It can be. I think anyone with low Fx might have trouble honestly, when I think about the TJs I know. Yessssss dramaTi likes to take apart and figure out which parts make up the whole. Cars, computers, it's all the same in some ways. You may well be istp!If Ti is the castle built in sand... well, some build theirs on Mars. 

Or Discworld. Well, why defend them? Elaborate? Which thought processes irk you? Why? How far can you take that line of reasoning? Not even trying to be a brat, watching people bottom out their "why" helps a lot. &gt;INFPs in particular tend to become really invested, even preachy, about MBTI, and yet also cling to the notion that it can't ever really say anything about anyone, because then they might have to be responsible for their own bullshit, or at least confront an external, objective reality.

AGAIN FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK

This is a point I've found hard to articulate and yet I agree wholeheartedly. Er, I meant in regards to the earlier threads lol. But I see where you're headed. Im... inclined to agree with INFP, but I'm not certain at this point. I can still be chauvinistic and be well in terms of my health. Dat victim mentality 

I like NFPs actually lmao No but I'm bout to be

Gonna throw some hands Hair? Try- actually no don't you'll get arrested. - join a cult 

- start a religion

- steal expensive art 

- write instagram poetry

- suicide 

I'm bad at thisI'm still working through the list myself Good luck dude lmao OH MY GOD I LOVE GRAVY I figured out this year that gravy is just like... dairy? And flour? And salt/pepper? 

HOW IS IT SO EASY BUT SO YUMBookmarked af. 

TATERS LOL same. Dude I love braums chicken strips with gravy omfg it's soooooo good. How am I so hungry I ate so much omg ;-; 

That all sounds delicious. I'm the most hopeless adult ever. Pls feed me. I need to download an istj forever &gt;I meant your mom 

OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHI'd probably thrive in Ti, survive in Fi, struggle in Fe, and FUCKING END IT ALL in Te You know, I totally envisioned the correct expression lmao I like Ne, and Ti. 

So mostly INTPs and ENTPs where I can. Next best is ISTP and ENFP. Then INTJ just cause they're my exceptions.

INFJs are extremely hit or miss. Blackalyph did a good writeup but yeah... really not seeing dom Ti/inf Fe in the title, body, or even the very purpose that would motivate an INTP to create this in the first place. *warm fuzzies*^ i'm with this person Jokes on you I suck at games 

But the few times I've ever been accused of cheating the system I a) feel flattered and b) usually encourage the idea and then make them think I'm gonna fuck them up Idk, for me it feels like my Ne is vindicated in a way. Could be a positivist thing actually now that you say itHmmm that's fair. Yeah I really don't see the Ti, but good point on the Fe. There's very little breakdown that's typical of a Ti dom. None of the detachment either. hey ;3; im tryinYEAHLOL k my song: 

WAKE UP CITNJDICHAHENRICI Y Y RANDOM RHCP STYLE WORD ASSOCIATION GAS PUMP RIBCAGE SOFTBALL CATTAILS THIS WORLD IS T E R R I B L E BITTER EXISTENSIALISM MY SOUL IS THE VOID I WISH I COULD BE A KID AGAINNNNNNNN - all sung with a stepford smile in that really juxtaposed cheer kind of way. You know the one. Sounds like a more excited, more detached twenty one pilots IHQ COMIN IN CLUTCH WITH THE HARD QUESTIONS DAMN 

Might attempt this later 

Edit: ok... 1. ISFP, maybe ESFP? 2. ENTJ? ESTP? 3. INFx?

No fuckin clue. I do think it would help a lot to have music with the songs, but lyrics should be telling enough... you would think, anyway. I use most of a discography to type an artist LOL. I cried Ikr? My mind just went there. 

Fave hobby is playing By The Way on high and yelling random shit for all the lyrics. FISHTAIL. BIG BIRD. DISH SOAP. TRACTOR. Wait was I close on the first one?Rip meYeah I was thinking Fe and then I thought it was too easy that way YOUR MOMgottemIM A FUCKING INFJ EVERYBODY I DID IT Kinda grossed myself out by changing flair My usernames here are all variations of mirrors and machines. wat&gt;I've typically been success driven. When I was younger I convinced myself that if I got good marks, my teacher would give me a pokemon and I could get out of the hell hole that is american public school education.

THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER LOL and way more productive 

Hmmmm. I had Ne-dom in mind. The being success driven and your quip about shaping the world had me wondering about ENFP. But the way you describe chameleoning and such also is characteristic of ENTP. 

HOWEVER actually now that I'm rereading it, the way you sort of... rationalize it as not being lying and being genuine actually is pointing me back to ENFP. 

So tentatively ENFP This is the only account I use on MBTI. The rest are elsewhere. :D Istp as FUQAlso let's be real for ENTPs we're usually looking for ways to fuck with people. This is just another opportunitiesI wish I had a quarter of the Te fml I'm still holding out hope that I'm an ENFP But I can't believe unless I have enough evidence that points me in the right direction and so far I only have one set of conditions that I think could cement my being an ENFP but unfortunately those won't be met/unmet for a little while. I NEED MORE EVIDENCE. I AM THE BANANANo it's Fi because I am identifying as a banana LOL thought op was boi. 

Yeah, that makes sense. Was already on side of ENFP, but that's a good point. Yes senpai I cameESTJ. Oh shit yeah ESTP muh bad lmaoThose are beautiful. Bisexual female in Texas - don't worry, understand 100%. Blackalyph typed me and yeah I'm the most NT NT ever yeah boiiiiiiI am most smart NT forever smart phone is the shit and I'm gonna live in a game that is beautiful and I'm gonna be a bit frosty after the divorce 

I got a new phone and this auto type thing is hilariousI'm fucking sorry for my style LOL you can be sure you're out of my personality soon after I weird

This is hilarious estj if anything but probably not Everywhere. Or nowhere? I've usually got my thousand yard stare on and I don't remember where I go or look. I dodge and weave very well for the most part, but I'll shoulder check. We got it covered Lol, that's not Si. Bruh that's my line1000%We're superior. STP, probably ISTP. Because it's fun. Honestly, that's about the only reason. Always meme. ENFP dude my estp step mom could eat my entj dad for breakfast. Terrifying. ENTP is just natural hype. The Ne comes naturally and spiderwebs into a beautiful mess of curiosity and knowledge. It's my own information gathering style. 

And overemotional messes are just irritating. Feelings are important, but riled up people are loud and I tend to glaze over. I don't like to be upset or offended, and I don't know why others get that way. But maybe I'm just human Teflon. I like you That's a real stretch lmao I do well with verbal and logical, as well as musical (and the arts in general)LOL I can't join our military, I asked. RipI kind of do it with both aux and tert functions tbh. Ne is the only one that's pretty much 100% on. Ti is usually in operation but comes out big time when I'm annoyed, and Fe I'm either some sneaky chameleon or a fuckin autist lmaoI'm not sure what that is How the fuck are you an entj lol Im not lololol omg Ti killed me. Bad Ti is entertaining as fuck and always makes me go sarcastically "nailed it". I giggled like a maniac

Well done hehehehe. Sure, you first Also you're not an entj No you're a homo I love making ISTJs squirm. It arouses me. Why would I be character acting?Well, the INTJ part is a joke. Not monogamous. If I had to form a lil group I'd have an INTP, another ENTP, an ISTJ, and an INFJ maybe. Or an ENFP. 

Poor istj. I rarely hate people but I get really creepy when I do. I mean it's pretty obvious that you aren't. What, not a fan of questioning? That's no fun at all. Some kinda NT file me under irl useless intuitive and call me a tater

My fave was along the lines of "I know I'm ENFJ because when I'm around SFJs, I can't help but notice how shallow they are and how they don't like to think beyond the surface" oh ok lol 

And a lot of new to MBTI people who say "I just know I'm an intuitive because" and follow up with how deep they are or all their intellectual interests. Hmmmm. My first thought was istp/maybe intp, but I also wonder about IxFJ. It seems like you value Fe a good bit - moreso than most with inferior Fe. Could be a general sign of maturity, or just loneliness 

If you're a male and depressed, I'm more likely to say IxFJ - not sure if Si or Ni. Men tend to emphasize their T function and depression can at times temper the socialization aspect of Fe. If female, IxTP. 

That's my thought process anywayMy scores were almost dead on with this. Ty for saving me the typing time. Who'd've thunk itMovies: Psychological thrillers and horror, Studio Ghibli, sci-fi/fantasy

Books: sci-Fi, fantasy, some horror. Fave authors are Terry Pratchett, Anne McCaffrey, Stephen King, and Mark Z. Danielewski (mostly for House of Leaves lol I haven't read anything else). I like some sciencey nonfiction too. 

Music: trip-hop, edm, pop, alternative indie shit. Fave artists are Massive Attack, Glass Animals, MisterWives, Bad Suns, RHCP

Games: I like board games like Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, and checkers. And CAH of course.  Video games are usually horror, puzzles, rpg, and horror-puzzles lmao. My favorite games are Pokémon handhelds, Portal, Overwatch, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, and LITTLE NIGHTMARES holy shit I love that game. LOL EVERYONE IS GETTING DOWNVOTED I get a little stalkery and obsessive sometimes. It goes away on its own but it's rooted in a lot of me trying to figure out why a person did something and my curiosity gets the best of me. Wait do I know you lol 

BUT I DO LOVE ME SOME THIEVERY CORPORATION name the time and place Not at all! I have the memory of a goldfish so don't worry, it's not you. Still totally down for beverages and trip hop (honestly if you didn't tell me I'd probably show up and hope you're not totally whack)Enneagram! One of nine types, wings add a bit of flavor and are +/-1 from the type. They aren't necessarily related and the system itself is more dubious than MBTI, but they are extra information and there's some correlation with type. (ExTJs are often 8s, ExxPs are often 7, etc).Yeah that's cool just don't kill me. Kidnapping is negotiable but just no murder Fe

Fe is always what's wrongAre you as high as meFUCK I LOVE THAT SONG its so sexy I wanna see garbage so bad omg. Sick music dudeAlways tater I need a TATR flair "Oh yeah go deeper"

"But I'm all out of poetry!" 

Only an Si user would be able to go deep enough. Leslie Knope - ESFJ 

Ron - ISTP 

Tom - ESFP 

Ann - ISFJ 

April - ISFP, else infp 

Andy - ENFP 

Ben - ISTJ, dude  is an Si-Ne user. 

Chris - ENTJ, I think he seems Fe, but he's super rigid and always seems distant and not actually that warm imo. ENFJ is my second guess. 

Jerry - ISFJ

Donna - ESTP

Jean-Ralphio- ESFP (imo Tom develops his Te earlier and that marks why they grow apart a bit) 

I think you've got Leslie, Ann, April, Andy, Ben, and Donna right. 

Donna is an ESTP and Tom is ESFP. She's super close with Tom and they share dom Se (all of their appreciation of partying and luxury, "treat yoself!", and they do all of it together). 

However, Tom is Fi. He's all about being himself and having fun, to the point of being unable to run a business properly. Part of his development comes from tertiary Te - he learns to be cognizant of his business ideas and learns how to navigate the business realm, and eventually drops Jean-Ralphio (also ESFP) because he doesn't mature alongside Tom.

Donna, on the other hand, is much cooler in the head. She's more calculated and detached. April describes her as similar to a cat - she's usually aloof and doesn't like to be bothered, and is only warm/loyal when it comes to her friends. Part of Donna's development is learning to open up to others and make those closer connections - her tert Fe. You can kinda see it when it comes to that teacher guy she dated, who I'm pretty sure is a high-level Fe user, probably SFJ. 

I'm not sure enough about Mark or Chris to really refute them. I think Chris is ENTJ but I'm not certain. Same with Ron. I see lots of argument for ISTP, but ISTJ as well. Se is also associated with ADHD - primarily hyperactivity/compulsivity. p: That's not quite solid enough reasoning for Se over Ne, as they can both be really distracted. You can be really in tune to parts of your surroundings (music, phone, speeds and turns, wind in your hair) and also not watch what you should be. 

He's way more intense than most ENFPs, who are usually more introverted than their Se counterparts and less grounded. Contrast him with Andy, who is an ENFP. He fantasizes about his future and potential opportunities - his life as an FBI agent! as a musician! He's not particularly intelligent, but he connects intangibles and fanciful ideas. He also isn't as social as Tom - he typically clings to April and we rarely see him go places without her, unless it's for work. He can barely dress/feed himself properly, and is incredibly forgetful. He probably has ADHD realistically, but those are also tied to inferior Si. His anxieties usually surround not being able to achieve his dreams, but he is the first between he and April to like the idea of settling down and grows to appreciate a sense of consistency and stability (see his relationship with Ben). 

In contrast, Tom is all over the place. He's incredibly social and lives for the high life. He enjoys luxury and social status. He's also constantly struck with new ideas and is distracted a lot, but all of them are practical and semi-realistic - as Tom matures, his ideas become more and more pragmatic, but even at the start they're all about business. He's an entrepreneur at heart, and doesn't have a lot of time for things that are too fanciful. 

I'm kinda high rn and I just watched the show again, so I feel chatty.I will, if you want! oh babyExtroverted Starchiness (Se), Introverted Famine (Fi), Extroverted Tateryness (Te), Introverted Nutrition (Ni)

I'm ESFP too!Yeh, but it's more about natural aptitude than complete ability.*TRIGGERED*I think it's more on application. I think Ne users are more likely to enjoy theory for theory's sake. I see Se as a more pragmatic/application function - it's got feet on the ground and is less likely to go on fantastical tangents. There are plenty of STPs really interested in (and have strong understanding of) philosophy and applying it to their own lives. 

I think an INTP would be more likely to say "Okay, that's interesting - learned that, cool", where an ISTP would say "Okay, that's interesting and I can use this, let's learn it". AHAHAHA GOTTEM 

Topple dat TiNTPs got freaky on lock. Looks like a butthurt sensor downvoted you. Lmao. That's literally what functions ARE. They're preference/priority. It doesn't mean someone can't do something, it's just tendency, like you said. Well, I think you're some kind of IxFP type. I'm not sure about your introversion or extroversion (leaning toward introversion). But unless you have some kind of issue regarding your emotional stability/temper, I think you're an Fi-Te user in that order. I suck at Overwatch so far but I love it LOL. Only had it a day though. 

I think NTPs are really good at puzzle games, especially puzzle-platformers. A really good example of a game that sucked a whole group of NTPs (THE CANCER) in was Little Nightmares. A fantasy-horror puzzle-platformer that's only a couple of hours long? Sign us up yo. SAME DUDE THEY ARE JUST THE BEST Read typeinmind.com/Fi-Se and typeinmind.com/Fi-Ne and see if you relate to either of those. Se-Ni and Ne-Si are two different axes that we use to process, and I can't guess your perceiving axis well (S/N). Try those out!Yes, but theoretical isn't necessarily conceptual nor abstract, which is what people think of when they think of Se vs. NeYou say that, but then the memes and shitposting never stop. Even irl lmao Surface level, depends on mood. If I'm feeling hype, ExFP. Normal days... IxTP.LIARSorry I just got hooked on overwatch but I can tomorrow! Pm me so I don't forget If you search in this forum, there's a fairly recent thread about Ni and Ne conflict, and you'll see that there rarely is any. They work extremely well in tandem, and the N functions are rather soft. 

Basically, the idea is that we have similar judging function, just swapped - potentially a good place to grow. The Ni/Ne really isn't as bad as you may expect. I don't particularly like NFJs as a whole, as I'm a little wary of high Fe users. But the ones I do like, I loooooooove. It feels like we have a deep understanding of one another, to be blunt. 

So yeah. Similar reasoning styles and both intuitive (more likely to operate on similar planes) while still being complementary enough to encourage personal growth. There's a Romanian INTP here on this forum somewhere...Lol at how all the nonmonogamous people got downvotedDUDE YESOh god same. Ouch. Yikescause Ne user bruh That's why I love my intjs &lt;3Fe is cancer lolol 

I think I do overvalue my tert function, and so I'm too drawn to Fe users who don't always have my best interests at heart. I'm planning a genocide don't worryI'm in and out of there regularly. My infp roommate is always unhappy lmao his jobs are physical labor with conservatives. he's a writer and sensitive soul, and totally into communism and shit. 

I hate jobs too but I'm lazy and hate work I've always loved my birthday, it's got my favorite numbers (8/8). But I now sort of unconsciously associate it with trauma and I mostly am sad and anxious when it doesn't make me happy. 

ETA: I love getting presents for other people and celebrating with them though.I like your style AIN'T NO PARTY LIKE A LAN PARTYSounds like you need a mastermind's assistant. No, you need us. All the illegal and sketchy shit were willing to do so you save face? All the great ideas and no competition? Best associated ever. Just associations with other bad events, not particularly birthday-related in itself. p: Hopefully newer memories will overwrite~! Hope you have an awesome one! Let me buy you another starbucks one day hehe (: because I used to use clients that converted :) into a native emoji once upon a time. No, an emoji (or emoticon I guess) that comes with the program and automatically turns a text smiley into their stupid looking ones. p: :DMaybe it's my phone but wtf emote is that lmao Oh man mine looks terrifying lmao I thought it was a "my face melted and I'm only capable of textual communication now" emote. 

Omg blushhhhh well now I'm a spicy redhead ;Dhttps://emojipedia.org/grimacing-face/

LOOK HOW WEIRD THE SAMSUNG ONE IS I'm super picky. I eat bland food all the time and usually the same stuff. Meal replacement drinks, smoothies and fruit, oatmeal, soup... omg it's a sick diet LOL

ETA: I'm si dom nowM O R E A U T I S MISN'T IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE UNHAPPY WITH MEI actually made an infj (prolly not) cry yesterday lol i finally lost my temper. RIPI talk pretty fast and I can get from "feeler?" to "...long to respond!" in one breath. I wonder how far through a comment chain I can getreaper?Lol, except when you (intentionally or otherwise) position yourself as more of an expert/authority/veteran than others in the community, giving those sorts of explanations is expected. If you want people to have confidence, be able to hold your own properly. 

/u/Thescarlettcat is right imo. I mean, when I disagreed with something you asked if I was playing a character role lmfaoooi jumped on the overwatch train like a year or two late lmao Not nearly as elegantI agree with the last part. I'll try new things but I have an easy to upset stomach and it's all habit. Combination of taste (texture mostly) and laziness. Well first of all they exist I think you're an NFP, not NTP. Although you value rationality, there's a very Fi way you describe what's important to you and what spurs you to act. Very idealistic and yes, you sound really endearing. I don't say that a lot lmao. I still get powered up by new ideas and interesting online discussions and general external material. It's basically extroversion - people IRL. If I do go outside and click with someone, I'll become more social, but I mostly skulk around like a weirdo until then. Ne doms in particular are more interested in conceptual stuff and ideas, and I think those things aren't always coming from other people.

I'm dating an INTP who, even at his hype-iest, cannot quite match my hype lmao. He's not particularly sociable, but you'll find a number of IxFJs whose auxiliary functions are more people-oriented, and they may appear less extroverted, although it's still taxing. 

I think extroverts tend to spike higher with their energy as a whole. After all, their dominant functions is focused outwardly, while an introvert's top function is introverted and thus obscures their auxiliary a bit.okay but i thought the same thingWe exist lmao He's got a system and it's only meant to be understood by a few in full. Not a troll tho. Seconding ENFP. Dominant Ne: consumes my life, makes me good at art shit and witty jokes, cancer and memes, ADHD multiplier, super fun to indulge myself because I have my own little world all created and I can live in my thoughts. Despite how inconsistent I am, I have good ideas and I'm insanely curious. My weird function. 

Aux Ti: Target for my curiosity. I want to break everything down and understand how it all works, whether it's a song or trying to figure out consistent rules of op for aforementioned fictional world. Pedantic and detached, but it makes the world seem like a gigantic puzzle... And I love puzzles. 

Tert Fe: fuckin cancer lol. Primarily I want diplomacy and peace because conflict is stressful and distracting. Can be used as a tool for getting what I want, but it also helps read and assess others. I usually operate Ti-first, so Fe can be a landmine. 

Inferior Si: make me cozy bruh. Usually displayed in my lack of routine and inability to consistently feed and care for myself. Not very aware of myself physically. Nostalgia is both pleasant and painful, and I find comfort in old hobbies. Also I eat the same shit and wear the same 3-5 outfits constantly lmao.And obviously a joke lol found the infp Use your uncommon sense bruh So fucking pessimistic, entirely too sure of their models when their foundations are incorrect, low-key arrogance, hypercritical. Those are the negative qualities anyway. It happens. I'm dating one, so I get a nice view of those sides. Mine isn't too verysmart but it happens. Elsie Hughes from Westworld

Also most things, I don't really do normal stuff Bruh BRUHIdk ntps seem to be weirdosSays the ENFP Bruh hello you were once flaired intp Bruh estjs are so cool this is cool Istjs are so cool so I will Nah I just woke up and made macaroni and I like istjs and I recognized you :D you as well ~So wholesome. I'm gonna look you in the eye and bring this up as awkwardly as possible one day. Istj as fuck I feel like this has been posted before. Isfp from the information provided~Awwwwwww that's so cute. I love Hughes. I met a Hughes cosplayer at Akon and I was Winry hehe. He had his folded pictures and all Entp. It calms the Ne down and calms my anxiety in genera. It feels like more Se. ACID THO SO NEI got ideas(This lends credence to estj, as estjs have Ne)BRUH I GOT YOU I'M SO DOWNEXTPHow did that go for you?You think so? I see the Fe (could make an argument for Fi) but there's so much Se. Reminds me of my step mom actually. Some kind of SP?Idk, I only know one female estp and she sounds a lot like this. Women in general Fe a lot better so I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility. Even the female istp I know is wayyyyy more with it than the guys. 

But heck, she could be an Fi user depending on the way she  came to her values. I think she's ESxP. Or ISXP. Some kind of High Se type. Kind of leaning to SFP.Probably Ne doms. Ne is about opportunity, curiosity, and exploration, and is conceptual  - we naturally have many simultaneous interests. Se doms might too. I'm more likely to know what I don't want to do than what I do. You sound more ISTP imo. A little more pragmatic and the bursts of Se can make them seem more extroverted than their Ne counterparts. I also think tertiary Ni can give Istp a sort of philosophical/spiritual bent. Familiar with functions? 

Check out typeinmind.com/tise I think the url is right, and pay attention to Ni. A lot of the ISTPs I know are super into life philosophy and origin shit, meditation, though they try to apply the knowledge directly. They're also into self-improvement. Obviously these are anecdotes but yeah.  I love intjs! Ive met a few here who are so fun to talk to, and my bestie is an INTJ lady. There's a really fun partner in crime dynamic imo. Ayyyyy ENTP/INTP couple! I met another one irl and it's so cool. I think we're definitely more flexible, especially in emotional territory. It's a fun dynamic though. Exactly, I never get more. Male intp too! :D he's my weird buddy. Thought he was istp. They're decently similar types tho. ISFP. I'll usually answer it negatively. If someone does it passive-aggressively, I might say "Yes, only those I'm close with" or maybe just stare unamusedly. I'll almost never reassure.

If someone asks me bluntly, I'll be honest. I find it really manipulative off the bat, but maybe I assume the worst. You got this. The program speed looks tempting, but I chose a BS for the theory courses and because I want to get an MS :D what practices do you notice in boot camp grads?I love the Chainsmokers, they put on a really good show on their Memories tour. 

I always thought one of them was an Si user, ISTJ or something. Maybe INxP? There's so many themes of nostalgia and memory, letting the past haunt you, and the new album (Memories: Do Not Open) almost feels anxious compared to their earlier collaborations. At one show the dude who looks like Ben Wyatt a little got choked up and played something acoustic because apparently he's wanted to make a living out of music since he was a kid. It was sweet. 

I have no idea though since I've never seen interviews. I just don't think they're as completely Se as people think. I thought that or ISTJ! At least based on performance and discography. So many Se guesses but the entire new album leaks anxious Si.Yikes, I'm going to completely disagree. I'd love to date an ESTJ woman, actually, if not ISTJ. He's so awkward and just sits all chill and stuff. I find it cute that he seems to not know what to do with himself on stage and he sounded surprised the audience was still there. 

I think at the end of the show we were at, he just kinda was like ...:D wow guysSide note: I'm terrible at distinguishing type from discography but I love finding INTP or ISxJ musicians. I think the Bad Suns are another group with an INTP or ISTJ in there (I can only differentiate the Si-Ne and lack of Fe).

They all sound so anxious, I want to give them a xanax.I love roses. And actually, It Won't Kill Ya is a really good one imo. 

There's the "every Chainsmokers song sounds the same!" But I'm just like.... Cool, cause I like them. Apparently Andrew. It might have been his hairstyle but I was like OH SHIT LOL I admire Te in others and the lower Ne is really fun to bring out in someone else. Some ESTJ women can look like ENFPs by the end of the day haha. A hug and a joint?It's Si as far as the eye can see~I'm a gifted male conservative ISFP, apparently. 

(I was under the impression that I was an open-minded female ENTP but... RIP that.)You sound like an ISFJ according to those works. Maybe INFJ, but I'm getting an Si-Ne lean.I got deadass ENTP, lol. ISTJ, possibly ESTJ hehe. Enjoy the Ne~*slides to your DMs*Maybe for you they do. 

(8Sounds like a fun night if I can talk about weird shit I vary extremely depending on how I'm approached. If I'm unbusy or already turned outward (I don't expect anyone to tell), I respond very positively. If I'm lost in thought, hostility.Never underestimate inferior Ne.Ahh... I'm not so sure I see INFP here. I'm close to a few (roommate, ex), and frigid, impassive, detached, aloof, reticent, unimpassioned, and taciturn all seem really not INFP. 

I think IxFJ are more likely to meet all of these criteria at certain times. I think INFJs tend towards a little more neuroses, where ISFJs are warm and grounded but simultaneously a little distant. This is due to Fe-Ti, which is more detached than Fi-Te. Said the INFJHOW DARE THEY ASSUME MY GENDERI'm an ENTP and my younger brother is ENTP. We get along now, but abusive parenting and a golden child/scapegoat dynamic had us hating each other for years. We're actually extremely similar. 

I think my older sister might have died lol I don't know for sure. I consider myself the oldest now, anyway. Both are half-siblings.  Don't know. I just got the impression of ISFJ from those words. If you're a woman, I could see INTP. Still not seeing Te-Fi. ESTJ. They have tertiary Ne, Fi valuations and principles, all under Te rationality. They start to act more ENFP ish to people they're close to, after they've done what they needed to. hi it's me ur sisterCan you self victimize any more? I'm not quiiiiiite pitying you yet. This is an unhealthy mindset and there are numerous likeable, successful male INFPs out there. There's a few here, I live with one, plenty of successful artists, musicians, and comedians are all infps. You're literally just whining and putting yourself down. People who accuse swaths of others as being manipulative are rarely as good as they claim to be. MORE FAMILYPoor estjs. :(&gt;when you try to creep and instead you gotta play D&amp;D

I see how you operate now. Clever. It's okay my life is based on whatever I roll for luck, and its always either 5 or 15. DO NOT OPEN I'm always away with the fairies. My thoughts are like spiderwebs, reaching far out with different threads connecting them. I'm usually pretty checked out, and the things around me/conversations are merely little checkpoints for me to bounce from. Ne in NTPs is usually described as weird, eccentric, and creative. (In NFPs I think it's more quirky and magical, lol)Trying to clear my head. If I do meditate or whatever, I will actually start to panic because my thoughts seem louder. I have to treat them like fish in an aquarium and just look at them and let them swim by without pursuit. 

Also, sex with a random dude. That wouldn't go well for anyone. Some of my friends can do it, but holy balls that would suck and not in the good way. Hey now, I'm a damn good athlete. D: 

(Confirmed ESTP)I've always thought the Joker was ESTP. 

One example of an incompetent ENTP is Sammy from Blue Mountain State. I hate to claim him, but it is what it is LMAO. He has occasional strokes of brilliance, but for the most part he ends up undermining others' plans and fucking everything up. 

He's also socially retarded and generally disliked by everyone but his sister and the main protag.Definitely not religious. I can't know the answer and I'm not equipped with the tools to find it, so I'm just not a believer. I'm not the kind of person to take someone's word for something, and a lot of the questions I have about religion don't really have definite answers. 

I'd classify myself as an apatheist. I never proclaim myself as another type.SouleatingLol no it's a joke They exist I'm just not one of them (I'm an entp but my flair is stuck til I land and can get on my computer) WHERE IS YOUR ARMIf I'm esfj do I get cookies? Is that like an ability with this build?? I can shittalk like nobody's business (or everybody's business) so that works. /u/DoctorMolotov 

/u/peppermint-kissHey now I contributed a very pertinent example It was probably me lmao A WILD ESTJ HAS APPEARED A fun one is when you're a chick and someone decides it's time to flirt. I'm just a bitch when I work out now Plausible enough lmao. I can't fathom why anyone would talk to a person concentrating on anything, especially exercise. GET BACK TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTEDISREGARD ALL OF THIS LOLOL(I'm aware of the irony of me posting this with an esfj flair. It got stuck lmao. TYPE CRISIS INCOMING??)S H I T L O R DLmao that's true I CAN'T STOP 
YNow that's just cute.ENTP: "I mean, this could be useful one day... I can't throw it out. Oh, I remember this! That's sentimental... can't throw that out! I know I'm going to need that..." and so on.sameI trust the responses of the people who make those questionnaires. No matter what airs someone puts on in the OP, they'll quickly show you who they are once you assert something about them.shit i forgot to do my SNPsMom is ESFP, dad is ENTJ, stepdads are both ISTP (mom has a type), brother and I are ENTP. Even the way they get upset over being called illogical can be telling. O: and yeah, I'm trying it on~I don't think people often have accurate perceptions of themselves, so what they say in reference to that is to be taken with a grain of salt. 

How they respond in the conversations afterward will give me a lot of information to support or refute that. Fi promotes authenticity and individualism. 

Actually I had thoughts. I wonder in older times what a type distribution would have looked like and if there's any kind of vague connection to Maslows hierarchy. Like, if humans are worried about mere survival, is there more Si-Se-Fe? I'd imagine those would be necessaary foundations for humans and there wouldn't be room for N doms and Fi doms. 

I wonder if there are more Fi Ne Ni users now due to long term stability. I'm trying on dat feeler life It's a way to make a living/a title. I totally either stereotype or go off personal experience, lol. Truck driver was INFP and nurse was INTP for me.T R I G G E R E DWAIT WAIT WAIT ISFP???? WHATTTTTT? Can I be your left-hand girl pls? bonus points if you're an evil leaderESTJ! I honestly don't know how you can mix the two up. Not even trying to jab at you, but Ne is my dominant function but they seem so wildly different to me that it's a struggle to come up with it. 

I think Ni is more convergent, and Ne is very spiderwebby, jumping from topic to topic and linking together typically unrelated points. Very curious and exploratory, easily distracted. Ni is usually really focused (if not a bit dreamy), by contrast. holy shit yall like the seven dwarvesS I G N M E U P B O I SDid you read my comment from earlier? 

I posted something musing about certain functions being better for survival (Si Se Fe Te), with Ni Ne Fi Ti being more useful for advancing and self-actualization as humans are more stable vs caveman days. Sort of Maslows. 

Or if there's some magical reason that we have a particular ratio of types in the general population. Totally made that all up as bullshit evopsych but eh. I'm sure it's not a unique thought, it was a weird coincidence hahaWHEN DID THIS HAPPEN I AM SO SHOOKI think is comfort in the Fi sense (being okay with yourself and living with yourself at the end of the day) as well as in the more common sense that we attribute to Si (the known, the consistent, possibly a comfort zone). 

Of course it's all open to interpretation. *shook*ISTJS ARE THE BEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD YO AYYYYYYY 

lol INFJs saltySo ENFP it hurtsI don't even know anymore, I'm ironically communist/socialist on FB and ironically alt-right within our IxTP friend group.ISTJ/ISFJ &gt; ENTP &gt; Enxp, tentatively TI didn't know about functions, it was a few years ago and I was extremely depressed and it seemed to fit at the time. Found the infp ewI don't know I'm drunk I mean many would also consider you a perceiver since you lead with a perceiving function but I know that's pedantic ahaha. Mbti doesn't control behavior, it's merely patterns in the way you take information and sort it. Conclusions might be reached, but behavior can react to those processes (aka acting in line with your type), but relationships with others, environment, stress, illness, etc. can all muddle behavior. 

If being correctly typed is important to you, then introspection should help. Knowing why you do things, what motivates you, and identifying your thoughts will help you tune in a little better. That's what your type is.Exactly why I don't trust you people. Also you just implied you're enfj oooooohI mean. You could be an ESFP. I also wouldn't describe ENFPs as cerebral, that's going to typically fit a TP more. Lol I just tell people straight up how much I like them and if I consider them a friend or not Makes sense to me. Its the conscious suppressing of Fe or any other dom function that makes the difference. Awareness of an inconsistency from external to interbal and all I'm surprised mine doesn't say lmao more tbh I'm imagining this being said in that really serious ISTJ way and it's hilarious. We should frame this and call it "inferior Ne at play"LOLOL I thought you were going meta for a second  LOL inferior Te hella ;_;I'd read it. 

"I'm not sure what I want to be except for happier than ever." 

AHHHHH I AM SO WHOLESOME TO MYSELF LOLHoly shit dude it got fucking real there I thought it was cute and funny. I'm with an INTP, and it's the pure eccentricity. We can both relax and act howerver we want without fear of social judgment or being ostracized for it. We listen to each other and build each other up for our ideas, and I really appreciate the encouragement. Plus, NTPs in general are rather childlike despite our sharp reputations, so it gets wholesome as fuck ahaha. 

The sex is freaky, too. ISTJs have funny ones lmao. I kinda called Ne just at a glanceWE MUST GO DEEPERIt sounds very appropriate LOL. All of the TJs seem to get wild ones, and the TPs are either dark or endless looping. Wonder if it's a phone thing. 

Next thread: WHICH TYPE LIKES ANDROID Want to die alone together? I mean... true to type? Any mental illness throws a wrench into the works. MBTI isn't really meant for people with PDs and such - I'm going through this now and my type is really just a best guess. When it comes to severe dysfunction, you just have to take it all with an extra grain of salt. Sounds good to me! LOL you sound like a supervillain I say tho and lmao all the time and I'm surprised that there's only one of each in mine. Lmao  lmao lmao LOLOLOLOL A little hatAwwww that just sounds so enfp. That's not a bad reason to be called into the office. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELet's both get little hats and tell people to fuck their dadsI'm not going to terminate you if you need a good art related to personality That's... yeah. Came the first time? HOW MANY WERE THERE. Lmaooooooooooo intps seem to be looping and INxPs acknowledging friendlessness. That's fucking awesome 

I also can't immediately tell now when people are doing the predictive text or actually talking to me lmao Infj as fuck Idk I can recluse with the best of them my dude Art at it's finest ~AHAHAH nice. I figured it's pretty Ne, I'm reasonably sure I'm ENTP but ENFP is my next guess. Mythology

Artificial intelligence

WormholesWORMHOLE COFFEEHahahahah okay that's all hilarious. And sounds vaguely like something I'd say. Da fuq So much FeCALLED THAT OKAY well I thought enfj then infj. You sound so nice of course I want to be classy tomorrow Both hands AND coconut oil? Hmmmmmmmmm. And so there will be (8COMBINE THEM ALL 

I am enjoying the predictive text feature and it's kind of funny how it reflects on the individual. I'M DRINKING TOOAre you asserting or reassuring? I love analyzing music under MBTI. It's fun and interesting imo. I feel like we don't get a lot of lyrical IxTJ or NTP music honestly. ICE COLD SO FUCKING INTJ LOL I'm actually getting an NFP vibe tbh. What's your general demeanour like? 

You can fine questionnaires to answer but if you relate really strongly to those functions then you're almost certainly in that quadra yeah? 

How strong is your Te? How do Ne and Fi appear in your life? Jesus okay maybe these things are more accurate than I thought 

Proposing typing via predictive text now

Those poor souls who get those looping ones lmao. You're the best wormhole in Chicago coffee No idea! Haven't listened. I'm really into like... triphop shit, indie rock pop shit, and idkNoYeah Oh yeah rub with those hands Thanks to you too Some kind of Se user. He has fuckboy face ahahaWell shit son What is your sample size and where from? How do you know they aren't mistyped? Just this sub or others, and if so any niche subs or just general? Which test did they take or is it flair? 

I SEE NUMBERS BUT I RAISE QUESTIONS BECAUSE MORE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED hnnnnngHmmmm then INFP is probable. Ever take the keys2cognition test? It gives an approximate ranking of functions. These are hysterical omg I love them. They all sound like low Fe bullshitting to get out of Some type of obligation LOL plus Lego movie. 

ALL THE NTPS SEEM TO LOOP I WANT TO GATBER US AND FIGURE OUT WHICH PHONES WERE USING OR IF IT'S JUST USThis is so adorable I'm not going to terminate you if you need a good night because of my recent ravaging of the time lords, and I'm gonna live with a taser and a half so I just don't get mad at all of the days that I don't know. 

Deep shit Whoa that's interesting actually... ISTJ seems most fitting but that's hella low Te... 

Try typeinmind.com/quiz/ and use hot dogsPersonality is the password not hot dogs I'm drunk and trying to make dinner my apologiesThose are infj functions. You could also be an isfj!You ok dude?Every single ENFP and INFP I've met are bisexual at the very least. Like all of them. And every transgender person I've met personally is also NFP. A combination of perspective, openmindedness, and emphasis on identity and being who you are? Maybe. 

I'm pretty gay tho, I'm just not very involved in the community. Sounds ESTJ to me honestly. STPs? Whoa. Actually no you're right, my group chat is all INTPs and ISTPs and they're the gayest people ever I think you know what I mean. Every person I know is an NTP then. Let's not get too pedantic here. I thought you were an old dude this whole time holy shit lmao Fake and gay No I just like to say that I AM SO SORRY;_; I DIDN'T KNOW I think you did briefly, but I just never realized you were a woman. I have a horrible memory though. 

My dude i am *shook*Also I like how I assume everyone is hetero when I'm 2gay myselfEvery NFP that I know personally is an NFP then. Might also be location and age group bias as well. Not like every single NFP I've ever seen in passing You also type like a nice old guy I don't know why omg. I don't know I AM SO SHOOK 

I'm 22 and in an open relationship with that dynamic. I honestly just never noticed. I didn't say any of that. I just said the ones I know happen to know are gay or no, that's all. Nothing more or less on other types, I just thought it interesting that my sample looks this way. I'm gonna go die nowYour flair wrong doeJust musing about why my sample looks that way. I have no idea if there's a real correlation, hence why it's just an anecdote. Communication: Blunt, honest, open, mean what you say. For serious things anyway. Otherwise, lots of banter and inside jokes. 100000% deal breaker is loud or violent displays of anger, including shouting. That's one of my few hardline boundaries. 

Money: as long as we can share a decent one bedroom and sock away some savings I don't care about money. I don't mind being the breadwinner, but I probably won't work a really traditional career. I wouldn't want my SO to work a lot of overtime. Energy and free time &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money. 

Duties: tbh if we make enough I'll just get a maid once a month. Otherwise I'd prefer to do laundry and bathroom cleaning, or.. anything but dishes. Anything. I will refuse to cook if it means I have to scrub food off. I don't mind cooking though for us.

Hobbies: someone geeky and into gaming, art, writing, anime, scifi, cosplay, etc. Don't have to share them all but I prefer overlap, because sharing in hobbies is a quick way for me to develop emotional intimacy. I want someone to come to concerts or travel with me. Bonus if they sing or play an instrument. 

Dynamic: I prefer someone more structured, more reserved and sensible, less emotive, and more patient than I am. I'm really chatty so someone who can at least seem interested most of the time works for me. I prefer equal amounts of open-mindedness. Also, if they're creative and a bit silly, bonus. I really believe a life partner is a ride or die and will encourage but also lovingly criticize, and both should make the other better people. 

Politics, etc: overall left-leaning but otherwise specifics aren't a big deal, especially if they're willing to learn and teach and examine their beliefs. Not religious. 

Family: Should be willing to play nice with family on both sides, but spouse comes first. I would maybe, MAYBE consider adopting in my 40s, but no biological children at all. Not up for debate at all, and I would leave them at the first sign of pressure. Hard pass. 

Love life: Creative in bed, roles aren't a big deal. General physical affection at a 5/10, i get overcrowded easily. I'm a words of affirmation/acts of service gal. 

So pretty much another NTP, an NFP, or a decent developed IxTJ. Do I get to know who it is? Or is it a random? I'd be sorely tempted if it were a good bit, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to follow through. It would take some thinking and a look at my situation. Depends on my circumstance. If for some reason my partner or family and I were in a crisis and the opportunity presented itself, I probably would. Otherwise, no. Both are possible, but I think she's an ESFP. Fi due to her radical beliefs and the way she calls out and confronts others with abandon. An argument for ESTP would probably mean she's more about needling using those beliefs, likely to experiment on others (political beliefs may or may not be believed wholeheartedly in that case). All speculation. 

212 is my jam though. Definitely an enneagram 8, she's aggro as fuck. WHOMST'D'VEENTP: ...and the whole time I was tripping I was barely able to act normal and I kept thinking "shut the fuck up and contemplate robots with me". 

INFJ: Well if I tripped balls with you, I'd talk about that with you. 

ENTP: omg really? Yayyyyyyyyyyy. Man that was a weird day. 

INFJ: Yeah dude let me tell you about my accidental K hole...

----

Same INFJ: We [her intp husband and herself] met at the bookstore and fell in love, but it was hard to adjust. 

ENTP: I can imagine.

INFJ: I would get all crazy like "alright babe who are we scammin today? Where are we getting our cash from?" And he just stares and says "we... aren't. We're going to get jobs and make money legally and pay our bills"

ENTP: [continuous lmao]

I miss her, she moved away. D:7w8~&gt;I've met personally 

Unless I do know you in which case who are youuuuuISTJ confirmed Some people have different priorities. Who's talking about everybody being gunned down? I'm speaking specifically to this scenario, ie. We get one offer to kill one random person. Clearly there are a lot of different answers. Of course actions don't exist in a vacuum, but again, priorities. Some need to feel at easy, some want a different lifestyle, some would only do it with their backs to a wall. That's what I'm talking about. Still beside the point. Yeah, this isnt going anywhere. It has nothing to do with backbone and everything to do with annoyance. I read this situation as one human (the answerer) being offered the ability to kill one person for money, and I answered as such. You're offering an entirely different scenario, where people are doing this to one another and social law and protection of people close to us keep us from killing others at random. You're applying it more pragmatically, and that's fine, but I'm not interested in that perspective right now. 

If I were thinking about it your way, then yes, I'd agree that it would become a lot more complex. But that isn't the path I took with my comment and interpretation. A vacuum IS unrealistic, but that vacuum and the answers occurring within it are what I'm interested in, and people are showing different priorities in this thread. I mean, at this point you're just arguing that I'm curious about the wrong thing. Your last sentence is speculation. I explained where I'm coming from and I don't have interest in continuing on this particular topic. I never said my interpretation is better or more meaningful. I said I was interested in it. Actually, forget it. You and I don't see eye to eye or have the same goals at all, and the conversation has turned frustrating for me. I'm going to bed, have a good one. Something about old food makes my stomach turn, especially if I'm rinsing it and it gets all murky and jcjrjfjsucjshfnfkidh I hate it. ...i would never. Okay same. No you take them out and buy dinner and they're a wonderful companion Change the ratio, kill the rest. I got the Alchemist as well~

KStory of my life That happened with another female ENTP I met. Instead of finishing each other's sentences, it was more like leapfrog. Shed start one sentence, I'd understand, I'd say something a few steps beyond, she would take that and run. And so on until everyone around was exhausted just watching us lmao. I made a related comment in another thread about it. My old coworker is an INFJ and our conversations would go from plotting revenge to cute cats to accidental Kholes and acid trips to ideal worlds on other planets. I'm gonna miss her. I love you I love Ne users and I enjoy being around any of those types. :DI was a bully through most of high school. Technically "provocative victim", but eventually I would just lash out to teach lessons and keep people off my back. Depends what kind of bully, actually. There are a number of ideas and models, but ultimately what needs to be considered is the bully's motivation, parenting, general attitude and personality, bullying style, and a bunch of other factors. So I don't exist?Inferior Ne is adorable but also makes me sad omgOkay, I'm leaving that. LMAO. &lt;3I have little dossiers on a bunch of people lmao. Includes their type too :DI did aight in school. Mostly As in HS, had a 3.3 in uni until my final year. Eh. I just never found it difficult but my chosen field was easy compared to all the engineering people. It can cause lots of anxiety, which sucks. So I guess it doesn't literally make me sad, but still. *Raises donger*Movie is alpha as fuck. Peter is INTP, May ESFJ, MJ IxFP, Ned ENTP, The Tinkerer ENTP... Iron Man is ExTP... yeah. Those are the only ones I'm reasonably sure about. 

I could see INFP (especially towards the end) but there seems to be so much inferior Fe that INTP sits a little more with me... it's all open to interpretation. 

The Vulture I kinda thought STJ but that shares NFP functions. Your guess is as good as mine mine. I loved Ned and MJ.Lol, I actually don't remember my argument, but I think I followed up that he seems like he could be INFP as well. Ne seems more certain than the T/F. Don't drink and type, everyone.    Or it shits all over you Interesting... nostalgia causes me so much sadness and bitterness, but it's comforting and beautiful at the same time. 

My favorite state of mind is either focus or relax mode. Either I can lie back and let my mind wander without any anxiety or obligations, or when I have a project I enjoy and focus for hours on it and nothing else. I think i commented pretty much the same thing lmao. I'm on all of them but Twitter. Twitter never appealed to me, lmao. I pretty much am on FB to tag people in shitty memes, Insta for my online sketchbook, and Pinterest to decorate my imaginary house.Pajamas or I go all crazy with it, you got it actually. 

Like I will definitely leave the house in a giant t shirt and light up shoes. Otherwise I have literally the same legging pants from Uniqlo in 4 colors, and the same Everlane shirts in different colors lmao. Then I just have random accessories that sometimes I want to wear. 

Also rompers are super cute. And too many of my clothes light up. I have shirts on the way with flat earth and illuminati shit on them. Oh god can you dress me? I need an ISTJ to dress me so I can leave the house without embarrassing myself and others. Oh hot. I can content create idk what content tho There's always... 72 archetypes...Your experience IS a joke. 

ayyyyyyyyyyyuMy top three:

Stimulation

Self-Direction

HedonismHahaha omg

Also I love Eoin Colfer, Artemis Fowl was one of my fave series. I just restarted for the nostalgia kick ahaha. It has a good example of r/iamverysmart INTJ maturing. I mean, Skype and video samples are encouraged, but privacy. There are also numerous questions meant to at least scrape the surface of motivations, and the most common first questions even addresses disorders and disabilities. Ultimately, people do what they can with what they have. The bot is a good idea, though. Any order ;DProbably though. Maybe it's the ADHD but holy hell I can't sit without my feet up or legs crossed. Not that I don't think you are, lol. ESTx are the two types that seem to get the ENTP + ENTJ. My family is from the Canadian motherland :DConsidering a lot of that fidgeting is very ADHD like, it may well apply to Se too. I've only just started feeling confident in the way I'm approaching my life, so no. I usually am too fearful of fucking up to make necessary changes but fuck thatttttttt~So many options... theft or prostitution, probably both. I can't even drive with both feet down lmao. I wonder why we sit like this. I need to research but I'll probably forget. If you're being quiet due to anxiety, then you're probably an extrovert. Which is why anxiety is pathological and not a part of type. Canada is everyone's motherland The first two sections are hilarious, the last two seem low effort in comparison. 

FUCKING WAIFU LOL and overwatch. So true. You're never alone. I always flex my bare arms. Met up with a pretty smart ESTP bud of mine yesterday. Overall, we're both witty, quick thinkers, creative, and laid back. But there were a few things that stuck out: 

1. We discussed online friends and he says basically that he can't develop a relationship (even friendship) with a person if they're not physically there, whereas most of my friends I've never met. 

2. I can't really conceptualize time very well (may be an ADHD thing), while he has a solid sense of when and where he is that rarely wavers. 

3. He can't stand my lack of eye contact. I'm always staring off when I talk, I almost never meet eyes with people unless I'm trying to get them away. He has a really piercin gaze lmao. 

4. I jump from topic to topic and it's usually less apparent as to what sparked the most recent comment. Ketchup to stars, vs. his "While we're on the topic...". He's more direct, less wordy and scattered, and very self-assured. I'm more meandering, rambly, and uncertain. I'm also more anxious. 

5. Our bit about cooking/general life ability was hilarious. I don't understand what things should taste like or trust my senses, and he's sitting there shaking his head like "make food, eat it, if it tastes too salty then there you go. You'll know if you like something or not" while I am trying to explain how even sounds can taste weird. Everything seems so foreign sometimes. He's very mindful of himself and where he is and what he's doing.  

As a whole, it really does come down to perception. He's comfortable and confident in the world, very solid and present and sure of his relation to the outside. I'm just.. not, lol. Rip. I think it can occur with most N functions, I think ADHD just exaggerates that due to hyperfocus/etc. LOL, maybe not by virtue of being an intuitive, but people struggle with time regardless of their top functions - perhaps inferior Ni aids in that, perhaps it depends on what the struggle is in particular (conceptualizing time? Merely being on time?). Which is why I said it may just be a personal quirk or pathology. I can guess time, I just can't seem to follow it myself LOL. I'm literally always late to things because I just forget when it flies by. Whoops. My INTP is much more solid in his timekeeping. So many things going on that I just wander off. 

Ewwww omelettes. Gross. Lmao, I just don't understand food and making it, and I'm so prone to distraction that things burn. I just live on meal replacement drinks, smoothies, and macaroni. And crunchy ramen. Also, related: ESTP bud is great at being on time and where he is in it, but he starts getting tripped up once he thinks about the history of timekeeping and the concept itself. At the same time he's fascinated by it, but it'll give him a bit of anxiety quickly if he keeps pursuing that line of thought. I think that's super interesting and we had a cool discussion on it, but I'll give myself more credit when I can get places on time consistently. I think a lot of people attribute aptitude for problem-solving and puzzles to Ne when it's more of a Ti thing, at least in my experience. There is where it lies - the type of problem to solve, some of which attract more Ne or Se doms. Just that as a whole, problem-solving seems to get more associated with Ne doms when ESTPs have similar minds. They just often work with different material using the same process. 

Those IQ tests do seem pretty Ne and Ti, actually. The style comes naturally, it seems weird that we measure based on those styles of reasoning. But what do I know? Lmao Yep, that's why I included that bit, because that may not be a type thing. Didn't know time blindness is the term!Honestly probably lmao. I like more well rounded aptitide tests that measure different styles of reasoning.

Anime trivia LMFAO and Wikipedia surfing.  I don't want kids, not for a long while. I'd consider adopting or surrogacy down the line mayyyyybe. 

I'd definitely be encouraging and playful, probably pretty frank. I'd do what I could to grow their imagination and improve their skills, and generally be relaxed. I would do my best to be enthusiastic about their hobbies and involved from a short distance. I don't think I'd be a bad parent, actually. I'm kind of agreed. I do wish my parents had encouraged my talents more, and I'm generally an excitable, creative person. I think both of those things would come into play as a parent in the form of very broad and enthusiastic support for their lives and for their plans.But who do you main?I'll eat good food if it's in front of me but I have the palate of a five year old honestly. I could eat the blandest food daily. It's not suffering lol I don't appreciate food properly. 

Unless it's bbq /u/ThePerfectBuzz are you the INFJ married to the ISTJ?I'm tagging another INFJ with an ISTJ, lol. I can't remember if I have the right person. Oh it's you!!! Nvm it's TKNe dom?ENTPs seem kind of rumpled and we seem to wear the same shit over and over (literally or figuratively depends on hygiene), and most of us aren't very good at eye contact. I prefer the thousand yard stare. I feel like a super villain when I open my closet (search through my floor clothes... let's not pretend I fold or hang them) and have like 10 of the same pants and shirts.

Then the occasional item like light-up shoes, or light-up glasses. LOL I do walk like I have a slight buzz. My feet take off and my body follows, and I usually wander off... h-hot... I would love to have more female friends, but the interest thing and social roles prevented that. Fml. I'm finding some though! Actually, yeah some of your harshest "ENTPs" are oftentimes younger ESTJs. Lots of Te brashness, low Fi, lower Fe, and overreliance on Tert Ne. Someone is bitter lolol 

A lot of the asshole internet trolls you find will be ENTP, ESTP, ESTJ and ISTP. With some bitter INTPs and INFPs in the mix. So there's one group. 

You also have your (relatively) normal flavors of ENTP that can include any and all of the following plus more: socially anxious, eccentric, quieter, creative, childish, airheaded, work-focused, inventive, optimistic, goofy, class clown types. These are naturally harder to spot, as they're usually not yelling LOL BUTTHURT MUCH GET FUCKING KEKD?!?!?! at you on the internet, and usually get typed as ENFP/INTP/FJ because they aren't as obnoxious. 

(Disclaimer: 100% was ENTP in description from ages 12-19)I think I'm decent at feeling out the use of functions, especially P functions. But I'm not good at finding the order. I'm especially good at picking up Ne, so I just stick with that. If I don't have a good guess, I usually just stay quiet. The Fi doesn't so much as play an active role as it does fail to stop them. That's also why they tend to grow out of it more quickly than people who live on Pe. Fi trolls and assholes exist in spades, though, even in the depth of /b/. Finally someone says it. Te-Ne edginess is pretty rough too, ENTPs can't take all the blame here.  I mean, ESTJs literally will act like that. Very easily and very effectively. It's not tapping into low Fi. Many types with totally opposing functions can act the same for different reasons, and Te-Ne is a hell of a combination for being a cunt online. I didn't say they're the only ones. I'm going to disagree here. Ti is easily one of the most removed from reality of the judging functions, especially with Ti-Fe &gt; Fi-Te. It's concerned with logical consistency, but in a vacuum really. It could be a coin toss as to whether that vacuum is realistic or not. Fi with tertiary Te is especially likely to be more grounded, INFPs perhaps less so.I think that's right in general. 

I will add that ExTPs often offend unintentionally and use the "I MEANT TO ALL ALONG" lolol 

I think that ESTJs also will "punish" people for having the wrong beliefs, even on an individual. ExTPs will do the same, but more along the lines of mocking someone's thinking. Like a justification. I think that's when they easily get mixed up. No ISTJs are pure These are way funnier. lol so are intpscan i get a pet ISTJ? or can I be an ISTJ's pet ENTP? ExFP was my first thought, Se and Fi as fuck. ISTPs and INTPs for me, tbh. Oh yes you can. ISFP, else INFP. Deffo high Fi.Maybe their tears

*slurp*What games do you like Testosterone! Tentacles! Telepathy, ten, telescope, tent, tertiary, terrarium, testicle, tesseract, technophile, teacups, teardrops, tectonic, tedium, teeter, telecommuting, telekinesis, telomeres

that's all I got rnNo :( they run away. I JUST WANT TO LOVE THEM. I do like world building and simulation games but omg, survival-horror-puzzle-platformer is my favorite genre. And horror and puzzles in general. I love puzzles. With the girlfriend, she's an Ne dom and her inferior function is Si. You might run into a lot of scenarios where she feels like her ideas and values are getting shat upon if you start raising concerns about practicality or effects on others off the bat. Ne isn't the most practical function, so I find that happens where I'm just enjoying an idea and someone comes in like "hey that-" no fuck off buddy lol 

ESFJs can also seem really overbearing or condescending when they're just trying to help. Basically. Ne users are aware that most of our ideas are whack and we won't execute on them. I would really only contribute on a practical level when something is dangerous, risky, or just looks like it's actually going to come to fruition. 

Otherwise, we get a lot of joy in just being fanciful and enjoying the pure idea fun. I know you're probably just trying to be sensible and helpful in assisting, but to us it just feels like rain on the parade. I'm not going to actually run away and make soap for a living... I just want to think about it. Feel free to join p: You have Ne too, it's a fun bonding experience to just be uninhibited and silly for a bit. 

ETA: Also, a good way to upset Ne-Fi is to try and tell it what it should and shouldn't do p: That about guarantees an opposite-of-desirable outcome. 

Try reading these links. They're pretty basic, but you will probably get a better idea of what level you're attempting to engage her on vs. what might work better:

You're going to get erroneous results if you start with a "fake" personality, especially when your real one inevitably bleeds through the facade.

Sounds like someone is just a little prickly that they didn't get the intuitive typing they were sure of. 

Weak trolling my dude.I'm not sure, I only briefly skimmed + you already admitted you gave a lot of bunk information. 

High Fi and low Fe can be mistaken for one another, though, if you're wondering about some of the typings you're getting. Fi is usually pretty independent of what others believe and say (concern for authenticity/individual values), low Fe is more apathetic towards social norms. There's a bit of an overlap when it comes to behaviors that can be explained by both functions and their respective positions.

Trolling is usually tied to Ti-Fe though (pushing social boundaries to see how others react, private personal experiments that exist to build up a person's internal model of how others work). People may see a user trying to deliberately stir shit up and think "low Fe", although high Fi is still a possibility when it comes to disruption. 

That's probably why you're getting a lot of IxTP typings. 

1. ESTP. Could be ESFP, but I suspect Ti-Fe axis. 

2. ENFJ, else ESFJ. Fe-dom for sure.

How do the two interact? What do they bond or argue over? Bob: ISTJ

Linda: ESFJ

Gene: ENxP, leaning ENFP.

Louise: ESTJ, maybe ENTJ.

Tina: INFP

Teddy: fuck if I know I think we're funniest when we relate to others or make examples out of ourselves. I usually get the most laughs when I'm sharing hilariously embarrassing experiences to make someone feel better.

I can see why it'd be more well-received than the usual memes or making fun of others. I think you're totally, utterly ESFP, from the information given.

Se as far as the eye can see (aesthetics, jumping into action, a lot of your future revolves around beauty and fun while still being reasonably aggro), combined with Se+Te for maximum "get shit done" level. 

Fi, especially with Se, for the way you desire to stand out, receive more attention, to be special and unique and "you" without stopping for others for even a moment. I think this is really apparent in that you have an aesthetic and beauty goals you aspire to, but you don't consider yourself fashionable and you don't dress for others. 

There's the tiniest chance of ENTJ (same functions, different order) but that sounds... off. Too little Se-Fi imo. Also... have you ever seen a therapist?yikes;D 

TEAM GAMECool cause I got some eerie/dark puzzle games - Refunct, Little Nightmares, and The Witness recently. And Overwatch, not a shooter person but I'm hooked lmao. Did you ever play Pokemon? Do you like MMOs? :D story of my life dude i can't make plans or hold them for shitttttt;_; I doooooo. 

You should be proud, I paid all of my bills on time this month. Except one. Oops. Are you behind this? I link this one all the time! *I can't tell if this is a reward tbh*

I'll pay it tomorrowwwwJoke's on you, I'll miss them regardless! 

Most of it's automatic now, finally. S E N P A ISo if I date an intp... I am the waifu...HelloIm just not picking up the Ne tbh. Intp if anything ISTP, maybe ISFP. ISxJ, leaning ISTJAgreed, i think ESxPs are more charismatic. I know that I'm more awkwardly charming than charismatic personally. I'm pretty sure he's an istp Hmm... I'm going to send you a PM if that's alright. There actually are a couple of potential answers to this. Très sauvage I'm an ENTP and my crush is an INTP. We're dating already but I still crush on him hard. ;_; &lt;3 I love playing video games with him and he supports my art and he's a sweet pea and we go on adventures together. 

I have a smol crush on another ENTP girl too (he knows and thinks it's cute af) hehe. I HAVE TERTIARY WEEDMeeeeee I make a great conversation partner to myself~Maybe I'm drunk and biased but I'm feelin alpha Quadra...NTP?I wish i knew. 

My brother and I are both ENTPs. We are quite different, he's more normal and I'm aggro af. Give entp a try and enfp Why are you winkingI know I'm weird as fuck haha I just find other weird people mine is nonexistentgaspI have the feeling he's not being serious, lmaoI like thisi give a fuck about the colors of peoples colons I can't see ISFJ for charlie at allllllll 

hmmmm if we're classing that as a type of weed then yes

lesson: never start debating semantics with another ti user lmaoim gonna color your colonevery timegeeee fucking geeeeeeI know how annoying I can get IRL considering I can't stay on topic or stay still.I'm so bad at most games that I could never stream, lmao. I'm super dramatic and I talk to myself a lot, though. My roommate gets so mad at his game lmfao. He's like "ANA YOU GERIATRIC BITCH I'M GOING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR BITCHASS DAUGHTER". 

I'm pretty positive overall, but overexcitable. When I die it's some variation of either "lol im ded" or "lol congratulations i just played myself".  I gasp and say "how dare you" a lot. The only time I get mad is when other people are dicks, then I use that as an excuse to call them a human dumpster fire or whatever. 

I'm keeping track of how many people I can irritate into ragequitting.I have no idea why I take people's comments so seriously, especially when I'm not a particularly serious person. Sometimes it doesn't even occur to me that there's a joke. RIP.&gt;I'm defensive about my opinions. My opinions are like my kids. In arguments I can see both sides but it's embarrassing losing so I will continue to fight my side.

To offer one perspective, the ENTPs I know aren't really like this. INTPs can be more stubborn, but yeah. LOL you're like a pitbull with those arguments. I get way too distracted to finish my conversations honestly. I'll occasionally get fixations where I need to understand some underlying reasons and weird people out, but usually I'm off with the faeries.Hmmmm. Ever checked out the cognitive functions? You could try typeinmind.com/quiz/ and use the password 'personality' if it asks for one, and check out the type breakdowns there. It's hard to get a type when you're using your behaviors, since we modify them based on our environment, comfort levels, etc.It's me ur entp waifu Super valued, especially since I have some other issues surrounding core identity and authenticity and that tends to overlap with Fi. I used to look down on it a lot but now I admire it in others and want it too lmao. I'm pretty sure you just went in a giant circle dude. 

ETA: Or it is possible I'm just thinking about circles, I should sleep now in that case lmao. Cognitive functions give a name to processes we use anyway, and having a common language makes it that much easier to address others and improve communication. Based on what a person values and how they see the world, I would interact with a Ti-dom much more differently than an Fe dom. The concepts exist no matter what, they have happen to have a certain tittle because that's what I happen to be into. It's about as useful as you make it   p: Kevin Malone is a good one for INTP. Also, Sammy from Blue Mountain State is an idiot ENTP. I try to appeal to the functions people use more often. P: maybe it's leftover from my stint in marketing, but I tend to re-package things differrently without actively considering it. Lmao. I love his high pitched screams lol. And Moran is such an ISTP. My INTP post acid trip goes "is that what it's like to be an Ne dom? If so, I never ever want to be an ENTP" LOLIt's also pretty easy to spot when that does happen. Fe is pretty transparent. 

I mostly am always checking to making sure I'm not disturbing anyone if I have things to focus on. As much as ENTPs are stereotyped to love chaos (and I do enjoy some good ol' chaos), it's easier to keep people just happy enough so they don't interfere. p:I got 50% thinking introversion, followed by social. 

Am ENTP tho hehehe, although I appear introverted socially. It sounds tiring just to exist as you, lol. I want to be those things but also that sounds hard...I feel you on the ESTJ-to-ENTP mistype. It happens soooooo often.

You sound cool tho.I'm artsy af, but yeah the stereotype is ISFP for visual/performance and INFP for more poetry/writing. THAT WAS THE DICHOTOMY YOU SUMMED UP SO NICELY OMG. It wasn't S/N, it was I/E! I suck at being succinct at anything and yeah okay, that was bugging me.Wow you got shit answers. 

Honestly, you sound like a really depressed INTJ. Maybe ISFP? But I personally see Te &gt; Fi and Ni &gt; Se. Are you getting any help for your depression? I definitely did have a lot of introspection, but I've been in a lot of therapy lately so I mostly was just affirming "yep, everything is about how it should be, no spooky surprises" lol. 

I was Ne-ing everything. SO NE. My ENFP bud was like "I've never seen someone that high for that long and that unwaveringly happy" lmfao. I want to try reading on acid! But I need my painting day first, probably in a few weeks. :D 

I think that my INTP has too much Ti-Si focus, and he's got some personal issues going on that make Ne a little harder for him. He's got the Ne of an ISxJ and the Ti-Fe of an INTP. I've considered ISTJ, ISTP, and ISFJ for him... but eh. He really did not like that reality kept changing on him. He was like "WAIT the room needs to stay still omg" hahaha. 

There was one point where he was having a mini existential crisis and I was right next to him marveling at corn chips. I'm the worst extrovert ever, at least in the social sense. oh man I wanted to make a spectrum joke there looooolIt's very likely that you're ISTP. ISFJ.

ETA: Also,  Izzet ftw!*draws feet up into chair* - every NTP I've ever met I kept getting put to death in games like Secret Hitler and the like, because I have a guilty face -.-

I AM THE DOCTOR YOU IDIOTS YOU KILLED THE DOCTOR BECAUSE OF HOW MY FACE LOOKSYou could make a video of yourself talking and post it at r/JungianTypology, those people are generally very serious. It's Socionics more so than MBTI, but they're helpful and you'll probably get a good consensus. 

Ni-Se isn't quite as strong for you, but in general I find INTJs to always be considering the broader impact they make in their projects and on the world at large. I see a little of that in your post, but I'm more sure if Te-Fi.Sweet!! Glad I can help. Same. Add in some anxiety and I just avoid going out unless my SO or another close friend will be there. I even go out to restaurants alone, lol. I don't end up liking ISFJs very often. As much as Fe is stereotyped as being manipulative and passive-aggressive, it's come across that way often enough to where I get nervous around them. Either that, or I just feel too uncertain of myself around lots of Fe. 

I have one friend I'm pretty sure is ISFJ and he is a very kind person, and always makes sure to reach out and see what I'm up to, and remembers whatever we talked about. It's extremely considerate, but I feel like it's out of obligation? Then I start worrying they don't actually like me and clam up...ENTP, maybe ENFP. See, the way you say: 

&gt;because you have a barrier that's keeping you from being your true self

This is why type isn't changing. Their type was always inside, while external environment and relationship factors obscured that. Most people follow the idea that types don't truly change, they only become warped in presentation. p: 

(FWIW, I typed as ISTJ and ISFJ initially! But I have PTSD and was also very depressed and anxious - I consider myself to always have been ENTP, with the appearance of being those other types)*dodges in Ne*My INFP roomie is a dude and found a great ENFP chick so there's that. YEAHHHHHHHH

*Ne-scape*

*Ne-vaporates*N I C EI think personally, my goals are also less concrete, measurable, and fixed than the goals of most TJs. Doesn't mean I'm totally unambitious, but I have more ideas of goals and there's a lot of modification and pathway adjustment on the way.You can protect me from the zombies. EVERYONE GET YOUR ISTJ BUDDY. I like this post, ooh. I don't... necessarily relate to the way you use Fi, but comparing it to Ti helps it make that much more sense.They're having a blast with it. I could see him digging an STJ lady if they were in touch with their Ne enough but yeah. He really doesn't click well with higher Fe people, and I know despite how close we are, i would bug him romantically lmao. How is that dynamic?? I'm an ENTP with an INTP boyfriend, and my roommate is an INFP with an ENFP girlfriend. I've seen a few Ne-heavy mirror relationships like that working out, but I've always wondered about the J types being paired with their I/E counterparts. I don't like corporate workspaces either. SameBecause there is no objective answer on something as opinion-based as your question. Even trying to measure out how "good" something is is impossible, as it's based on what a person values. 

So you're operating on a flawed premise here. 

ETA: You could make this a better and specify attributes that aren't just "good"That's the thing. It's useful to you because you value those things. Other people's definitions and measures vary drastically, and yours isn't objectively correct. Ohhhhhh you're a troll icicNot to actually be in, no. But more specifically I was talking about the Corporate Environment (TM), with consistent hours, meetings, vacation hours, and dress codes. P:Awww that sounds so sweet. I'm glad y'all can manage your feelings BECAUSE HOLY HELL AN ENTP AND INTP FIGHTING WITH FE IS BAD. 

Overall it's good! He's pretty Si heavy and very precise so he's the one who thinks first and stops me from doing dumb things. I suck at existing so he's a great help around the house and generally keeps things running (although I'm learning to cook for him a bit to give back). We're both socially introverted so we share a ton of geeky hobbies: cosplay, anime, video games, Mtg, and so on. 

Mostly our relationship is super playful and a lot of fun, but despite that we're very serious about each other. I have chronic health issues that he's supported me through, and he's dealing with his own business that I push him to address and heal.Si users can and have done those things. You're a troll and a bad one at that, lol. Shoo until you learn better tactics. I'm just bad at playing along and doing what I need to haha. Nah, I actually do have a preference for Si, although that's partially due to the Ne pairing. 

Si isn't useless, again. You don't appear to even grasp Si properly, seeing as you're using the Si memory trope.  Like I said, you're a really weak troll lol. It's so low-effort and unfunny that it's kinda sad. Sigh. No such thing I try my best to believe that, which is why I still consider him a friend. I'm just very used to Se-Te types, and they don't mince words or fake feelings or put up acts at all. Fe... I'm a pretty lonely person and that attention makes me feel super liked, but then I attach quickly. So now I'm just nervous around warmth and enthusiasm. My male INFP roomie likes writing and poetry, as does female ISFP friendo. Poetry and lyrics are similar to me minus the background music LOLUs Ne doms... I get so hyper with the right people and stuff but otherwise I can easily not leave my house for a week and people have to drag me out. That is the most productive form of procrastination I've ever heard of lmao. Jeez... No wonder you get things done. I will do anything to get out of a chore. One time I started playing that marble Mancala game with myself to avoid essays. It's ok ESTJs are great. Uhhhhhh I think I'm ENTP but I'm not good at making normal friends or going outside so I spend my time here. My dad is an ENTJ, we always tiff over this stuff. He thinks I'm just trying to be difficult or meandering around when really, I'm just considering a few options and what might happen if those solutions get implemented. I'm good at thinking of ideas, but I also have a knack for thinking of potential issues that might come up. 

He's really into his end goal and is always telling the Ti users in the family to hurry up (stepmom is ESTP, brother is also ENTP).NO SENSORS CANNOT WORK PHONES. 2 HARD./u/chakke_oochWhat why This seems like ENTP teenage edgelordiness cranked up to 10. Jesus Christ this makes me want to change my flair LOLOh shit I'm retarded NP types. I have adhd too so bonus Très sauvageYou strike me as an ENFP or ESFP. That's just a general vibe from skimming your posts... Idk I was with an INTJ for three years but it ended quietly. please i got stuck in intuitive land and can't pay my billsStory of my life Yeah we are I can do half a shekel.Hehehe DP

I experienced derealization regularly as a teenager. I very rarely do now, but it happens on occasion. Dragons, worldbuilding for a story I'm working on, character development stuff, what I'm going to do in the future, what I need to get done, distracting myself from what I need to be done, random questions and thought exercises to research later, idk. Lots of stuff. O:I think you sound like you shouldn't be in a relationship at all and seriously need therapy lmao holy shit BEGONE THOTNo because I'm never 100% sure of anything lol. Pretty certain I'm an ENxP tho.Ne just is the only thing that fits my dominant function even remotely closely. That narrows it down to two types. I've considered other types (INTP, ESTJ) but again, boils down to Ne.ESTJs often overestimate their tertiary Ne. The self proclaimed "ENTPs who consistently get shit done" are usually ESTJs. ESTJs get shafted in descriptions, so an ESTJ who is remotely creative or "Ne-ish" will identify way more with the ENTP.They don't really work in those four dichotomies, but essentially yea. Mbti is about the way you process information and analyze it. Everyone has T and F functions, as well as N and S functions. The goal would hopefully be to develop these lower functions and become a more balanced, developed person. 

The efforts aren't useless, they're just the difference between immature and mature types. If your top functions are Ne-Ti (ENTP), you favor those two, and need to work on Fe-Si. WAIT aren't you entp? 

I'll be high too I'll hit you up :DI'm pretty sure you're on the Si-Ne axis. If I had to pick three, I would say ISFJ, INTP, or ISTJ (least likely imo). I'm that order. Yay Ne!!I don't think there is a strong correlation imo. 4 is very closely linked to Fi. I think an IxTJ is more likely than an IxTP tbh, and pretty much no ExTx will be a 4. I rememeber you! I always remember Sophie. I pegged you as ESTJ and blackalyph had you as ENFP. I do think you're in that quadra.thats my fetishDepends. I either can't focus for more than a few minutes at a time, or I sit for twelve hours working on a project without eating or drinking until I stand and pass out. 

No in between.why thoCPTSD here bruh it makes typing a mess. i flipped around as istj, isfj, and intj for a long whilewhy thoI'm childish as fuck lolol. Most of your Ne users are going to be rather child-like in nature, as Ne tends to be (less so for INxPs).YAY I LOVE ISTJS

From an ENTP:

For me, I always leave myself as many "outs" as possible. I think Ne doms especially hate feeling locked-in. I think ISTJs like to make sure everything is in order to feel secure... but we feel secure in the exact opposite ways. 

TJ types: If I have everything planned well and I am careful and thorough, I can avoid failure. The more I plan, the more I can account for. 

NP types: Who knows what kinds of things could go wrong? The more alternatives I leave myself, the easier I can improvise if the unexpected does happen. 

Si is the function of experience. You know what is likely to happen, you know what you're doing and what information you need, pretty simple. Ne is the function of possibilities, and sometimes it's seeing where everything could go wrong and knowing that's not even the half of it. Obviously, this doesn't work well with event planning. 

My suggestion would be to of course, politely tell her why you schedule things and plan things a certain way and try to get her to understand why this is such a problem for you, and make her feel understood as well (vs. coming at her with "ugh, you're so disorganized, yikes). 

Maybe work with her on creating soft and hard deadlines. Approach her on the soft deadlines to get the input you need from her, and move on without her once the absolute is approaching. If she misses those, then proceed without her or don't fill whatever you need to. 

Maybe look at your shared responsibilities and see which might fit with her style more and which for yours. I don't know the exacts of your job, but I planned trade shows and similar stuff for a while and it was super hard to keep track. Maybe have her keep an excel or a shared doc on Drive so you can both see what the other is up to and update statuses?  

Either way she's got to step it up. Ne is hard to work with on planning, but if she cares enough and doesn't have other issues (ADHD, etc) she can make it happen. I don't have my ADHD meds and I get nervous so I'm aware I sound super annoying lmfaowhy did i even write a comment when you have yours lmaoi can't understand it myself sometimesI like my sensors dizzy too... then they can't escape when I inevitably lead them to my dungeon. I'm too anxious for that ;_; 

She is the ultimate shit disturber. I did in fact find a lewd Sombra waifu pillow and it's almost 5am... time to buy... 

MEI GODDAMMIT complexgo eat your tendies reeeeeThe ree? Good to hear :DLady, entpWait really omg DO NOTI guess they don't want to hang out :( I just want them to play video games with me forever delet this nephew I'm fairly sure I'm entp* could be enfp maybe idkOh no i was just going to make a house and trap all the people in it and we can all be friends and play games and no one can say no to being my friend. 

/end michael scottHmmmmm best way to describe Ne anyway (can't help with Ni lol) is that it's a function of possibilities and ideas. 

Most of my life is unconsciously spent absorbing outside information and linking it, then sort of just letting my brain wander from related topic to related topic until I've gone from screwdrivers to spiders somehow. I confuse myself a lot.

I'm keenly aware of all the different opportunities and options that show up in life, which can be a little paralyzing sometimes. I said this in another comment, but there's a lot of frustration with TJ types, especially STJ, when dealing with high Ne users. To them, planning is key to avoiding nasty surprises and general success. To us, we see all of these things that can happen (and in many cases, acknowledge the things that we can't think of but could happen anyway) so we prefer to leave things open-ended and roomy, ready for quick escape and improvisation. 

Many Ne users believe that you simply can't predict or plan enough, so that anything outside of a rough outline is more harmful than helpful. Our security comes from contingency plans and what-ifs, y'alls is more careful, detailed, and thorough. So there's a lot of clash there. 

If I had to visualize Ne, it's very much like a spiderweb. Start with one piece of input or information, then watch everything spiral out and connect every which way. Everything gets very roundabout, but there IS a link there - whether it's worthwhile or not is up for debate, lol. 

I don't know if that gives you even a small idea of what I experience as an Ne-dom but I'm always happy to answer questions :D I wouldn't call myself naive, but I would call myself hopeful and optimistic. ENTPs probably the most so out of the NT group.&gt;How are contingency plans and what-ifs not detailed and thorough?

I... I don't know how to answer this straightforwardly, actually. I just have fleeting ideas of "if x happens, start with y". I have a couple next steps in other directions, none of it locked down... 

It's like drawing a picture and kind of marking where the facial features should generally go, but not actually drawing it out or coloring it in - I know that when I come back to it, I can continue in the direction I was headed and do it on the fly. I don't put the effort into materializing things unless it turns out I need it. 

Contingency... ideas, maybe? :D 

Ne is super ADHD and "wow shiny" too, fml. I get distracted when I'm driving because I start thinking about what our roads would look like if we had today's technology and could safely wipe out the current systems, if we could slowly breed all kinds of flowers to become poisonous and have an army of deadly plants (then wonder why anyone would want that or how I could make it useful), or just whatever dumb shit pops up in my head via a passing sign. You probably think more than I do tbhdefinitely not me, every time i try to plan more than one move ahead i lose my train of thought. 

WILD CARD BITCHESI have definitely passed out a few times from lack of food LOL nailed it. idk i super absorbed in whatever dumb shit i'm doing and forget food for like 8-12 hours sometimes :Dtyty~ entp, possibly enfp. i feel pretty good about my skill level thus far. 

honestly, i prefer to have my medication and i'm comfortable with my medical and therapeutic regimenWhat type is your twin?If my stack were Ne Ti Fi Si that would be coolLOL fuck that would Omg yay best type &lt;3 

Yeah that's where the split seems. I'm leaning entp because Ti &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fi but if I'm a secret enfp that's even better :D I'll check her out!What makes you say that? Hehehe I could see INTP but compared to my INTP (even w gender taken into account) the Fe-Si vs Si-Fe is obvious. Plus dom Ne is overwhelming even to him LOLDefinitely Fe over Te. Sigh. I guess I have to accept entp. I'm getting serious Fe Ti, combined with the melancholic/introverted vibe. IxFJ, I'm kinda leaning to INFJ? 

Idk thohard to place exactly, but you have a sort of open warmth + detachment that comes with that axis. 

You seem melancholic-phlegmatic specifically (unsure of order), I enjoy temperaments lmao. I would be very surprised if you were higher order Ne. o: So to me that naturally leaves two options, assuming introversion...I am so glad :'D That would make a lot of sense, although Te mostly comes through in anger or frustration. I learned from my dad, lol. Steamroller ENTJ supreme. I thought I could be ESTJ too when I had more anger issues lmfao.The types I tested as/briefly identified with in some way, in order: ISTJ, ISFJ, INTJ, ENTJ, ENTP, INTP, ESTJ, back to ENTPSAME SHE TALKS LIKE AN OLD MAN ONLINEMostly personal experience. I'm Ne dom, as is my brother and my best friend as well, plus 2 close INTP friends and an INFP roomie. 

Basically it's just a lack of recognition in something I'm typically good at predicting. Not the most scientific but I'm drunk so ehIt's mostly just that instinctual wtf hahaha sorry to disappoint. Pretty bird? :DNo just a few peopleInteresting. My brother is ENTP and two years younger. Idk my oldest sister acts  weirdly jelly too Maybe dude omg ALL INTJS ARE OLD SECRET MENYay I recognized one Super close :D I'm pretty socially introverted in the typical sense, but I'm an Ne dom heheProbably confirmation bias. That's one of the stereotypes, but there are a number that aren't that way. Rick** from Rick and Morty, Elsie from Westworld, Tyrion Lannister from GoT, Ed Elric from FMA, and Sombra from Overwatch are a couple examples. My IxTJ friendo fucking takes forever to leave the house. Even when she visits. I forget to put shoes on or look generally appropriate lmao. She always looks great though.Its actually pretty easy. ISTx can be easily mixed up when it comes to behaviors and general demeanour. Once you're aware of the functions it becomes easier to tell. P::D yeahhhhhh Ne dom lifeLol why And that's why cognitive functions exist. I'm definitely extroverted, albeit one with anxiety. I do. I'm dating an INTP, the inferior Fe vs inferior Si and dom vs aux Ne gets pretty obvious. Okie dokeWell that too I wasn't sure lmao so i just vaguely answer because i live to create confusion and chaosim totally getting a waifu pillow of her, i think i drunk bought itBoth of them have serious airs and both can get pretty weird if they're around the right people. INTPs might get a little bit goofier, what with the auxiliary Ne. Lots of memeing and general silliness, once they warm up a bit. I don't have to be chaos, I can just start it elsewhere on occasion p: (I don't have a purpose, I just wanted to make it seem like my confusingness is intentional)I don't do it much but when I do... it's a bittersweet thing. On one hand, unnecessary purchases. On the other, it's usually stuff I've wanted for a while or something really useful so I never want to return it LOL. 

I bought a desk, a speaker for a friend, Tiles, and a cool aurora projector light that way. i think my Ti quit today or something LOL 

I was trying to say that, yes. Just as a cover up though. :DI did impulse buy balisongs for my INTP and I recently hehe. And Pokemon...Oh yeah... Texas y'all you can buy all sorts of weaponry. 

Yep! Pokemon, Soul Calibur, Overwatch, and Guild Wars 2 are our current faves. Terrible at typing others but funny captioning. I meant Rick haha, not Morty. Rick isn't, Elsie is a sidekick to Bernard but not unreliable, Tyrion doesn't qualify, neither do Ed or Sombra.Same, that's why I'm dating one :D I'm the same way, although I feel alienated by "the group" most of the time. Like... even if I tried, I wouldn't fit in anyway. I'm the most retarded smart person according to my friends. Awww I like people hehe I thought I said like lmao. I say "Like" so often that I figure everything I say is an approximation. You didn't seem much Ne at all to me irl fwiw lmaoI'm an Ne dom and it's extremely obvious. I didn't get a single non-high-Ne typing in my video, lol. I always joke I'm just Ne all the way down. Sometimes. I'm very very curious, optimistic, and playful so that's always fun. I'm never really bored and I love taking things apart and figuring them out and the world is an endless puzzle for me. So I have a nice time on my own. 

The dark side is that I'm not good at boundaries or people, so I really struggle to make friends and I'm lonely a lot. I'm also pretty bad at planning things and following through, although I'm working on it. Im also not very empathetic and i generally have a "glass wall" view of others.

I have other issues that compound this (ADHD, CPTSD) so my ENTP benefits and drawbacks become very exaggerated, I can be a bit of an ENTP caricature. I'm in a mirror relationship (ENTP/INTP) and I love it. I think if both parties are invested and self-aware, they can turn out to be very wonderful. That sounds like chaos, and not the kind I like. YesFunctions my dude. Look at the cognitive functions. Typeinmind.com is a good website. I don't go out or have friends so jokes on you 

*dying*Complex trauma reaction mostly LOL I'm very hostile and suspicious towards others. The glass wall is... I try my best to connect or involve myself but it feels like I'm always on the  outside and sort of self-alienating. That's my fault but it's still unpleasant. Sure. Just letting you know my perception. I could have pegged you for ISTJ or ISFJ actually, but everyone has their deal that can modify how type shows up We met once lol. Just comparing to the numerous intps and infps I know irlThat is not how statistics work. Possibly lmao. I hardly saw an ounce of Ne with you but you know best I'm sure. Mila Kunis, Natalie Dormer, Mandy Lee. im a maam not a sir but okay :D:D reporting in as one of thoseMarkiplier is my fave person to watch and an ENTP. I think TheRadBrad is ESFJ.They seem to give so many shits and always go to an effort to make me happy. I'm usually suspicious of them sometimes, but it's just so warm and overbearing that I accept it. It's nice to have someone care that hard and that obviously. I think leading intuition can sometimes be confused for introversion as we aren't necessarily interacting with others to take in information. So many ENTPs think they are INTPs xD It's ok I hate you too I thought I could be. I don't go outside much and I socialize mostly via the internet and follow a lot of stereotypical introverted traits. Ne doms are the most likely extroverts to make that mistake. Pretty much everyone is surprised when I say I'm an extrovert lolol. Someone recently argued with me saying I'm intp on my type me video but I have too much NeIdk, I come off introverted to them. And nah I actually don't mind my level of extraversion &lt;3I got INTP, with:

Ne = Ti &gt; Ni &gt; Fi &gt; Fe &gt; Te &gt; Si &gt; Se

I'm an ENTP so close enough p:Yikes, all I can pay attention to is... how bad her arguments are. Eek. I didn't even get through it all xD She's so... Definitive and black and white with the assertions she makes and doesn't seem to understand nuance whatsoever. I can see the Fi-Te there. Yikes.Not even sure if ENFP. YOURE ALIVE~Eh, it's not that it doesn't get nuance. It's that when there are some harsh, black-and-white opinions, they just tend to come from the Fi-Te peoples. p: 

I have no idea, people seem to think their opinion matters a lot more than it really does.A lot of your answers do describe physical activities, directness, action, and aesthetics - all things Se doms are known for. You also don't have the same spiderwebby links between your thoughts the way Ne doms do, even in writing. Oftentimes we meander more, make links between subjects and get off track, and there's a lot of mid-sentence wondering. Ne Ti Fi Si - how I pretend my stack is anyway. Get rid of that pesky Fe! boiThat's okay I'm not charming anyway Omg she's on drake and Josh hahaYEAH BUDDYWith the proper leader...It used to be Fi but I love it now. Ni is still tough for me. I'm okay, I guess. I speed half the time, but I always signal and try to watch for fellow idiots, and I havent had any major accidents. So meh. I hate driving anyway. ENTP 7w8 and I'm mixed on it. 

I really don't like being told what to do and if someone does it the wrong way I tend to dig my heels in and be contrarian for the sake of it. Oops. 

If I trust an authority figure, I prefer to get in good and have their backing. I don't like the idea of authority, but it can be good to have them on your side. *shrug*It trueI first got ISTJ, occasionally ISFJ. I'm ENxP, most likely ENTP. Oh shetI got Respectful Inventor, I'm ENTP lol.

Idk, I've always kind of thought Fi dom tbh, I'd lean more to Se than Ne. I got Respectful Inventor, lol. Sometimes contradictory is good, no? Tempering the authority of a director with benevolence and generosity seems like a good balance. p:Fair enough, I'll amend and say I'm not conventionally charming.How appropriateENFP in disguise! :D 

I'm pretty distant with my interpersonal relationships and I have a lot of inertia, I guess. So respectful sounds about right - I don't go out of my way to be choatic, but I'm not particularly warm either. I prefer to keep to myself more IRL than the average ENTP I think. I like your videos hehe. It's like watching a more outgoing male me. :D You're far more engaging, though. Complementary*, actually. 

I'd like to see a summary and maybe be able to compare the descriptions between each result. 

Thanks!&gt; rs25531

Did you have 23andme? Mine comes up as not found.23andme user, results not returned. Now I'm curious...Weird, mine still doesn't give me anything there. Mmf I love me some STJ ladies. So assertive, but still for dat Ne. YikesI should take the test while drunk. 

But in general, I used to be a really combative, mean drunk. Mr. Hyde all the way. 

Now I'm a sleepy/wandering drunk. As in I'm generally friendly, then I wander off and fall asleep if no one keeps an eye on me. Oops. ... But emotional intelligence isn't emotional control. Gut feeling also isn't related to emotional intelligence or control, on top of that. None of these things are connecting. 

In early dating stages, I'm not very romantic at all. It's hard to distinguish friendliness on my end from romantic interest, and I'm kind of oblivious as is. If I like someone enough to pursue, I pretty much just say "I like you, want to go on a date?" and that's about it. 

In established relationships, I'm a sappy, disgusting nerd that makes even our resident INFP friend want to vomit. Me and my INTP: Lots of pet names and couples cosplay. I got into his reddit and created a really nice setup that had tons of obscure subs I knew he'd like all grouped up nicely. And I'm going to make a really cute scrapbook too. :D I agree, I think offended vs. annoyed has a personal vs. impersonal kind of thing to it, although I suppose they aren't mutually exclusive. I'm just going to throw my hat in the ring and say that I have a really ugly temper that I try my best to get rid of. 

Overall, ExTJs and ESTPs seem to be the most aggressive. Fi-Te in general can be pretty feisty. I personally don't think INTPs are traditionally masculine at all, lol. Of course, we're basically going on stereotypes in determining what masculinity and femininity even are, and it gets further muddled when you consider how every individual perceives those traits differently. 

This is totally just my own opinion and not a description of what the functions do, but how they "feel" to me btw so this is all super subjective: 

Ne: Childlike, playful, elastic, innocent

Fe: Flexible, considerate, nurturing

Se: Alert, quick, rough, adaptable

Te: Assertive, powerful, rigid, blunt

Ni: Heavy, direct, shadowy, withdrawn

Fi: Reactive, compassionate, intimate, fiery

Si: Earthy, absorbent, grounded

Ti: Sharp, probing, detached

IMO: Ne and Fe are decidedly feminine, Ni and Fi are neutral-leaning-feminine, Si and Se are neutral-leaning-masculine, and Te and Ti the most masculine. Looking at this, I guess I perceive T/S as masculine, and N/F as feminine, which I think is pretty common, according to some foggy memories of reading about type and gender. 

So I suppose your most masculine would be your STPs, STJ, and NTJs. Your most feminine, probably your NFJs, NFPs, and SFJs. 

I think that's why I perceive ENTPs and INTPs as more feminine than their STP counterparts, and NTJs as slightly more feminine than STJs (though neither feminine as a whole). INTPs seem to operate in a masculine underlying manner with feminine mannerisms/appearance imo. ENTPs strike me as more feminine. 

I really like gender and perception so this is fun for me to think about. I'm very grateful I have him, so I like to show it via shared hobbies and showing that I appreciate his likes and interests. p: I'm just really overt about it. I'm always really sad when I think about how there's so much information that can't be reasonably found in a pure, useful state. ;_;I have trouble relating to it because I don't really pay attention to how food tastes and I can't really remember it very well LOL. It feels like a very Se-based analogy to begin with...ENTP, I probably text first 10% of the time, and that's usually a flurry of "wow, I haven't actually talked to anyone in days, I should probably at least try" then pick a few people. I mean... he gave me permission to. I know a lot about autoimmune disorders and medication for a layperson. Enough to make an A and a B on medical assistant and pharmacy tech exams, respectively. 

And I art well. So there's that. Preface: (warnings you would like to include)

Mental health pathology that could alter my actual type/lead to mistyping. Still, I'm relatively confident in NeTi. 

Typing Methodology: (how you came about to find your type)

Test, then four-stack functions, then video typing. Consensus appears to be ENTP, with the occasional INTP or ENFP typing. 

Question Answer: (your answer to my question)

ENFP. I generally appreciate the Fi-Te axis a lot more than Fe-Ti, but I enjoy being an Ne dom. Thus, ENFP. ESTJ would probably be my second choice.

Ne &gt; Fi &gt; Ti &gt; Te &gt; Ni &gt; Se &gt; Si &gt; Fe

Ne trumps all except Fe, inclusion of higher order Fe will drop rank of an Ne user. Jeez if you're gonna call me out like that then at least warn me o shet he deleted. did I miss dramz? 

/actually esfjI love dramz tbh anytime there's an explosion I'm there to see what's up LOLInteresting, I've found solipsism rather soothing...ENTP: 

1. Becoming any sicker

2. Under the sea, although I simultaneously think it's beautiful. /r/thalassophobia ftw

3. In that vein, cave diving. And caving in general. 

4. Suffocation and tight spaces

5. Sex trafficking and kidnapping.  

6. Someone looking into my window or tracking me or something. Physical violations of privacy are like 12/10 horrifying. I prefer to just interject into already-brewing dramz. Why pour gasoline when you could just light a match?The functions describe methods of information intake and analysis, basically. They're generally ordered by strength/preference, and while they correlate with certain behaviors, they basically are just the way you think. Se doms tend towards physical pursuits, but there are all kinds of exceptions. 

One thing you can do is look at the other layers that exist in addition to type. Your health (mental and physical), your family (family of Se doms? That could influence you), the culture you grew up in, the relationships you cultivate, your socioeconomic status... all kinds of external factors can influence the way you type and test. It can take a long time to examine all of these layers and peel them back, which is one reason why people mistype. 

I recommend writing down each function and the ways you relate to it, for all eight. I would also think about the functions you relate the least to in a separate column, along with why. You could also make a list of people and characters you identify with and look for patterns there. 

Heck, find a few definitions for the functions to make sure you aren't basing your speculations on stereotypes. It mostly just takes introspection and realizing that you won't fit 100% into a type description, nor are you supposed to. You just find the best fit. Wait I thought these were really words and I was all excited to talk about cognates in other languages and words in English that are weird or counterintuitive and now I'm so saddddddddignore the paradox ignore the paradox ignore the paradoxL I G H T I T U Plike anyone is going to have a kid with an intp(it just jokes i date intp)ENTP... no idea. Currently coming off of a nasty depressive dip, but as a whole around a 6-7/10. Better than the 3/10 I was working with in previous years.just jokes friendoThere's definitely interpretation with Se, especially when you mix it with Fi (which is what this sounds like to be). She's drawing conclusions and making judgments based on direct sensory input. In general, the narrator stays focused on her topic and their physical parts and the feelings that the other person generates. 

Ne pretty much skips this step, the most we use that input is as a stepping stone. Ne would have stopped at eyes and winks and blushes, then meandered off to tangential topics while drawing on Si as a sort of "reminds me of" deal. could have at least tagged me here bruh. 

I'm pretty sure I'm an Ne dom either way, but realistically Ti is more fitting than Fi. The best sum I can come up with is what feels right vs. what is correct. There's more to Ti than just being good at solving puzzles - it's approaching the world like it's a puzzle in itself, with the constant pursuit of knowledge in order to continue building and tinkering with the framework I use for the world. When I consider the models I use, they tend to be detached and more about figuring out how things work, and always monitoring my other little pillars so I can always adjust and cross-check for consistency. 

That, combined with vulnerable Fi (and its manifestations such as shifting/lack of identity and principles, unawareness and poor understandings of the way I feel about the world and others, etc), seems much more fitting than Fi and vulnerable Ti, as much as I wish it were the other way around. One of my biggest struggles is figuring out what I actually want and what I feel, which would be a massive boon instead of me trying to detachedly analyze my choices over and over. 

Side note, my complaints about the INTP boi are more poking fun at my hypocrisy - I usually can get pedantic when prodding at others, but I get irritated when it's turned back upon me by someone with dominant Ti. In a head to head nitpicking, the INTP will beat me out nearly every time. It's humorous, but gets frustrating because I tend to poorly verbalize all of the ideas I'm trying to get across and it leaves me ripe for correction LOL.

At the risk of getting too personal, I've experienced instances of trauma/abuse and post-traumatic stress can drastically restructure a personality. My theories are that a) I'm an ENFP whose core identity has been damaged due to trauma, so my coping and personality have shifted to appear more "ENTP-like". Following this, therapy would likely place me more in touch with that Fi and I can be the magical ENFP I was destined to become. p: Otherwise, I'm stuck with B) Regular old traumatized ENTP. 

So it's a fair analysis either way, which is why I keep switching my flairs up lol. Currently, ENTP seems to be a "best fit" for myself until I have more information to work with. TBD, I suppose.You're good, it's just kind of jarring to miss a full discussion about oneself, especially when I don't get the opportunity to possibly make some corrections or add extra information. p: 

It's not quite Ne alone tho, mostly because the framework thing. That's kind of the main difference. Both Fi and Ti will work to create that internal structure, but like you said, they're a bit different materials. I think Te is more ri. I guess I just think I use Ti to build that structure moreso than Fi, as there's too much perceived disconnect between myself and what feels right, what being authentic means. 

In contrast, the drive to have things work (be true) is much stronger, with an extra emphasis on it needing to primarily make sense more than anything. That means I also believe I fall victim to common Ti traps, such building too much of a conclusion on one premise and creating that jenga tower phenomenon when one of those foundations isn't what I thought. There's also the matter of Fe, where I find myself more likely to consider the wants and norms of the people around me. 

Ne does make it pretty difficult, especially in the dominant position since we're not as turned inward as the INxPs. I think mental problems also make it difficult to type, so it ends up being a case of whatever is closest at the time. It's especially been interesting because I've made a drastic shift from the typical PoLR "Wow, I think Fi is ridiculous and nonsensical" to "Wow, I really like/want more Fi and need to learn how Fi users come to their conclusions" and more denigration of Fe lately, which is what sparked a lot of the ENFP vs. ENTP questions for me. That's not particularly helpful to people trying to determine their own type.That's not quite how introversion/extroversion works. ENTPs are Ne doms, their extroversion isn't very people-oriented. They prefer concepts and ideas over socialization, so they end up seeming more introverted than the other extroverts. Many ENTPs are misanthropic and asocial.yikesWhy would INFPs dislike ENTPs as a rule? That makes little sense. "You really don't appreciate..." is so condescending and assumptive lmaoWAIT LOL didn't I use that exact same identity logic when I called you an ISFP because you were having a meltdown about people typing you incorrectly? Disappointing but to be expected from an STJ. Holy crap I'm bad at gendering via text I just found the phrasing to be condescending but you're probably right. I think it can vary based on the Fi users values, lol. The infps I tend to get along with are of the edgier minority Hush ladyDamn it in sad you said it first That last sentence, fuckin ouch. ...mom?ENTP subtype is the manic pixie mean girlbut where ARE the hoes at??Is it by Heidi Priebe?ENTP 

Top 3 books: House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski, the Artemis Fowl series, and most things by Stephen King tbh

I listened to his sister's album while I read it, it's an amazing combination. I want mashed potatoes. And baked potatoes. And Hasselback. Oh god I'm having potato cravings. Check out typeinmind.com/tine and typeinmind.com/sife 

They contain the descriptions and cognitive functions. INTP and ISFJ both share the same functions, you may want to check them out. In particular, you sound Fe ish from the description you gave.I mean it's very obviously comparing the different ideals in relationships of each type, not providing a thorough analysis of everything that could go wrong lmao. 

Also only 9 goats? You're a cheap whore. I'm an ENTP, but I generally get attached to inanimate objects and have overwhelming, bitter bouts of nostalgia. Not a fan. :(ENFP: Imagination Infatuation or Machine by MisterWives. Tbh she's so ENFP it hurts. 

ENTP is tougher but I've always identified strongly with Seeya by Deadmau5, although it could bleed into INTP territory.  Probably ENFP or ESFPI would stop trying to make the goal socially acceptable, that will always feel fake to you. It's kind of fatiguingto always be "on".

Maybe save it for when someone is obviously not feeling good, and make the goal to make them feel accepted or wanted or cared for. I think it's less strenuous and the goal is a little more genuine imo, especially if it's someone you know well. I think so, higher Fe tends to care more about how others are feeling, but it could be garden-variety anxiety lol. Of course, relationships, culture and environment can influence how these all appear. Gender can also influence appearance - IFJ men more often appear as ITP imo. I just wanted you to see the difference of the same functions in different orders, it's pretty interesting imo. :DSomeone struggling between the two probably won't understand the terminology, nor what those things actually look like in practice p:I can handle hugging when it's my INTP or maybe a close friend sometimes. Otherwise, I'm pretty much repulsed by physical contact. Yikes. I get nasty if someone touches my arm or something, especially without asking. I like physical activity, I was a competitive swimmer through HS and a division I rower in university. Now I just run a lot and row recreationally. Exact same. I hate being touched ;_;I can offer hopping in excited circles. The INTP and INTJ I dated were both super snuggly o.e agreed of the others though lmao. I had an ESFP boss who would hug me and I would so some amazing dodges. Or you could answer questions and not make people scroll through and interpret your questions about detergent while trying to avoid your ENFP posts. Just sayin'.I'm an ENTP I ruin everything I touch PDs are PDs because they're pathological. We all contains traits of some disorders, but we cross the diagnostic threshold when we are no longer able to function properly. Also, passive-aggressive, sadistic, and self-defeating are no longer PDs you can diagnose, just fyi. It's been pared down to 10, divided into three clusters.  

I think it's also interesting when types not in those correlations have those PDs. I wish we had more information on mental illness/disorder and type tbh. How do we know that they are typed correctly and that such a profound dysfunction isn't masking their true type? 

I'm in the slow, uncertain process of being evaluated myself. *shrug*ENTP, Dark. 

Works for me, my favorite types are dark, ice, psychic, and water. I didn't realize I'd touched you O-oh my...YayyyyyyYou also have to take into account the lack of reliability in typology statistics, and that the I/E scale appears to have a bigger say than N/S. Also, it doesn't mean that those types are the only ones appearing with those PDs, they're just most common. 

Anxiety is already pathologized, as GAD and other spectrum disorders (social anxiety, OCD, EDs). Some PDs do have anxiety listed as one of the defining characteristics, such as schizotypal PD. Part of the reason anxiety isn't a PD in itself is because PDs are thought to respond poorly to treatment and they are an unusual cluster of symptoms that form the personality in question, and anxiety alone is generally a singular, treatable trait. 

I think it's more likely that Ne- and Ni- like traits are more likely to make a person non-functional and not in touch with reality imo when maxed. I'd personally like to see more studies done comparing healthy Ns and Ts to non-healthy Ns and Ts and see how those traits compare and how many aren't doing so well. A schizotypal ENTP is going to look very different from a healthy one p: 

Then again, it would be really beneficial to look at the exclusivity of these disorders as they relate to type as well...I don't think you can't type someone with one, I guess it just comes with an asterisk. It would also be interesting to compare people who type differently with the same PDs, too. I know an enfp and an estp both with BPD for example. P: lots of comparisons and stuff would have to be done so it's pretty hard to get good information but you're not wrong. Much better summary. The notes about STPD and OCPD were interesting imo. In the end I was the hoeTo be fair there are many healthy Fs and Ns in the population. Also, neither "I base all my decisions on emotions" nor "I base all my decisions on rationality" come close to diagnostic criteria. Men do take the lead on PDs, but less of that is straight T/F dichotomy than I/E and N/S.

The first link is UK based iirc and based on hospitalization, but in general, men tend to be higher in narcissistic, antisocial, paranoid, and obsessive-compulsive PDs, while women are more commonly diagnosed with histrionic, borderline, dependent, and avoidant PDs. There is some lead in men in non-hospitalized studies but it's not overwhelming. Women are oftentimes hospitalized because BPD and histrionic are associated with self-harm, especially the former. 

The second link is cool and talks about gender roles and likelihood of being diagnosed in each cluster based on how closely people stick to them.

Another interesting link that supports your idea: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105841/#!po=16.1765

A lot of the prevalence statistics end up very different, whether it's testing protocol or what have you. One idea floated that hasn't been tested is whether sociocultural influence determines what is more pathological. 

So you're probably right to some extent. Just wanted to point out that overemotionality and pathologized F behavior does exist in arguably 3/10 PDs, while the others are lack of emotionality, lack of impulse control, and eccentricity (your N types lolol) depending on the cluster. Who tf takes it so seriously that they do this lmfaoLol, my old boss is an ESFP and he was the friendliest but bitchiest guy I've ever known dear lord. I know two other guy ESFPs who attempt to be more stoic tho. 

So many ESFPs but I think they're kinda fun in small doses. You said so yourself. If she rejects you, you'll be able to mend it. If you keep wallowing, you'll be miserable and anxious about it until something gives (and you may lose the friendship anyway). Your unhappiness quota is much higher if you keep trying to figure it out. 

You can't analyze things properly without knowing her true feelings, and the best way to get that information is to ask. I think you just gotta bite the bullet here mate.Courage the Cowardly Dog, Teen Titans, Death Note, FMA, Yugioh, Pokemon, basically all anime/Toonami 101 with a sprinkling of daytime Cartoon Network.

*heavy breathing*What type are you?LOL the only party I'm going to is a LAN partyDear INTJ, 

Hi friendo, hope you know that you don't actually have to listen to me when I ramble, I'm ok with some nodding once in a while and an occasion "yeah". I don't expect anyone to hang onto my every word. 

Also no I don't care if you don't see a long-term point to what I'm doing; everything I do has some kind of value even if it isn't obvious to you at first. I'm cool with hanging out together in silence as long as I can show off my projects to you when I get somewhere. Psst, I'm not going to stop the bad puns. 

It's okay if you fail sometimes, don't spend so much time angry and frustrated and learn from it, most negative things can be turned into good... or at least useful. You could use a little more flexibility imo. Relaxing can contribute to overall productivity in moderation btw.

ENTPWhere tf are all these active ENTPs at lmao. I keep reading about life of the party, but the only ENTPs I met (granted i only know 2 irl) usually stay home  Oh okieIt's ok, nice and sunny so I just throw on my headphones to deter potential interactors Also yes I will be your new entp Interesting. I'm female but maybe we're finding them in different communities. I meet most of mine via gaming and cosplay so they maybe skew more introverted. Their response said it all tbhthat could be me, i find myself way more hilarious than everybody else does. then again i'm usually talking to myself anyway.It's super hard to know, especially when some PDs have people of different types and some obvious variations in morals, values, etc. Where have you seen ENFPs as people with ASPD? Most of the surveys I've seen (admittedly not the most scientifically valid) pinned that on ENTP, ESTP, and ISTP iirc (although I'm sure anyone could have it). I could see them being more impulsive/less strategic than ENTPs. 

I like that idea and childhood may provide some insight. Unfortunately I don't remember my childhood until like, after 9 or 10 LOL. But that could be helpful! PDs are really just... best fit when it comes to typing. x.x I always lament how little information we have on these subjects.Surviving ENTP: Considers horror movie tropes, leaves their friends after giving rescue their best effort, but ultimately isn't willing to die for them and ends up bouncing pretty early. Might even leave before entering the scary house/forest/whatever.

Dead ENTP (aka me): Wants to leave and knows they should, but gets overly curious and ends up being like the first dead.Ne doms tend to do this. ENTPs specifically are more prone to sharing lots of inappropriate info, while dodging inquiries about their true opinions and feelings regarding personal matters. &gt;Rollerblading instead of power walking

No bitching at all about the bad ENTP decisions of "is there REALLY a homicidal ghost? Omg i gotta see"?REEEEEEEEEEIIRC NP types are classed as the most gifted, followed by NJs, while the reverse is true for academic success. It's not deterministic and statistics don't apply to the individual, but to say that there's no correlation between type and intelligence isn't entirely true. All of those things would make me smile if they were done. Nobody is allowed in my closet. b8m8That's happened a few times this week for some reason. I guess I'm developing psychic powers, I'm infj! YikesA correlation is a correlation. Nobody said personality types guarantee intelligence; that would be ridiculous because general statistics don't apply to the individual as a rule. 

In general, NT then NF types rank higher in overall giftedness and academic success, then your Si doms follow. But that doesn't exclude exceptions and it's not a hard and fast rule, just a general trend. 

You're right, MBTI isn't intended as an intelligence test. I'm just pedantic. I'm ENTP, my best relationship is my current one with an INTP. My best friends are INTJ and ENFP.Yeah, another NTP couple! I would be down o:Jokes on you i don't have friends 

I'll offer ENTP as a conversationalist and a creative problem solver/diplomat - I usually give pretty good advice because I naturally view things from a few perspectives and like figuring out the "why"s. 

Boyfriend is chiming in to say that INTPs are good listeners according to his extroverted friends, and that he's been complimented for his emotional stability and ability to calm. Pretty much any type can be. My INTJ bestie is a good painter and pianist. I'm also an artist and I enjoy creative writing as well. My INTP friend and I both make cosplays from scratch, the time we invest is pretty unreal. 

I think some types may prefer certain media or subject matter over others, but yeah. I'm sanguine-choleric.

Jim - ENTP

Michael - ENFP

Pam - ISFJ 

Meredith - ESTP

Robert - INTJ

Angela - ISTJ

Phyllis - ISFP

Jan - ESTJ

Toby - ISFJ

Roy - ESTP, possibly I

Darryl - ISTP

Ryan - I've thought INTJ, maybe even ISFP

Creed - xNTPIkr, Jim isn't an Se dom at all. Pretty sure Pam is ISFJ as well. I think Nellie may be as well, but I'm not as certain on that. I've seen ENFJ but she seems rather directionless for that. ExTP, probably. Jo is ENTJ as fuckkkkkk i love her. 

I hate Toby, ugh. Even minus the Scranton Strangler theory (which would elevate him in my eyes), he's just so whiny and weak, and the way he acts towards Pam is just pathetic LOL.

His reasons that he's shared are that I make him laugh, that I'm open-minded and not judgmental, that I encourage his creativity and all of his "weird" ideas, and that I don't let him become complacent and push him (and myself) to be better. 

I think it's easy for INTPs to be very mellow and lax to the point of seeming non-committal or just... not very invested. You're going to want to have that future talk at some point though so that you're both on the same page. I have trouble visualizing an INTP initiating the marriage talk. Elsie Hughes from Westworld, Ed Elric from FMA, and Ed from Cowboy Bebop. :D We aren't fully monogamous so heyyyyyy~

And thank you :D we move in together officially this weekend even though he practically lives with me anyway. Woop woop!Elsie isn't dead!I'm a terrible extrovert, I go four or five days without leaving my house sometimes. I think it depends on the person, since intro and extraversion are largely a gradient.It's been confirmed that she's alive on website Easter eggsThe website confirmed she's alive lmao http://www.pajiba.com/westworld/westworld-finale-recap-stubbs-and-elsie-are-alive.php

So I guess not complete FACT but very heavily indicating their return, plus Stubbs' actor said his character is alive and there was also footage of someone in the park sending a distress signal. 

So I guess it's likely she'll be back, maybe not a certainty.Copy and pasted:

So I guess not complete FACT but very heavily indicating their return, plus Stubbs' actor said his character is alive and there was also footage of someone in the park sending a distress signal.

So I guess it's likely she'll be back, maybe not a certainty.I'm so psyched for it, I think I watched it three times through ahaha. It's so packed with stuff that I missed the first time through. I think some people thought the pacing was kinda sluggish but I appreciated it a lot. And the score is litttttt, I love the intro and the covers on there.

Plus it's nice to have a fairly normal ENTP lady character 👌 "Well, it depends..." is like a catchphrase for Ne usersCan't say for anyone but it's fitting to me. Si is hazy and barely existent and hard to focus on, Fi is an utter mystery that I feel like I'll struggle with eternally.The moral Fi hammerslam omg. So judgmental so quickly without really trying to understand why I would do something you disagree with on principle. Granted, it's useful at times, but y'all could chill out a bit lmao. 

Not much to complain about on the Ne-Si axis or is be a giant hypocrite.My ENFP bff is a queer dude and another ENFP friend is a straight girl, and they are both this way.

Fortunately, they're both very reasonable once they cool off a little, but they're quick to jump on moral infractions (and it usually is in defense of others). They're also very forgiving.

In general, I appreciate their help - I tend to not consider others when i make decisions so they kind of know when I may experience remorse later. They just go about it in a SHAME SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU SHITLORD way, which is jarring. 

I've gotten more than one Cone of Shame joke tho.Samedo entps pls omg 

Also as someone else with severe ADHD nobody can beat me at being flaky and possessing the attention span of a goldfish.everything 

Also, aside from the usual edginess and flakiness, I find ENTPs are goalpost movers. We are great at acting hypocritical + making that hypocrisy seem logically sound at first check.

There's a lot more I could say about the commitment and follow-through levels, social interaction, the ability to recognize when enough is enough, general arrogance and obvliousness/lack of care for others... 

Meh I'm tired nowAct like you belong and you'll rarely be called for it. 

Also I feel personally attacked by this YOU ARE TALKING SHITMEKA ACTIVATEI am going to kill you You know what else you're gonna see-? 

Ah nvm Don't be lewdThat's why I hang out alone, I laugh at anything I say :DI've always noticed this happens to me if I try to befriend Fe and occasionally Te doms, interestingly. &gt;(No, mirror, you're not a mistype. Yes, mirror, you can be a chucklefuck.)

I say this a lot but I FEEL SO PERSONALLY ATTACKED except it's all true. (Aside from the fact that I love my INTPs because they're so great and level and funny.)

On a more serious note, I'd love to hear more about the technology Fi-ism because I strongly suspect that applies to me but I'm not entirely certain how just yet.My INTP really uses his Ne most when it comes to developing character and campaign ideas for DnD, writing, cosplay, and other creative/logistic puzzles. With Ti in front, INTPs kind of need a stable stomping ground to run wild in. 

Also, internet. Except nothing she says is particularly confusing.pretty much Yikes...Um excuse me I just came out to have a good time but I'm honestly feeling so attacked right now I'm kinda into it Yikes

I do this too fml. It's like when my cat bites my feet because she wants to play but it pisses me off even though she just wants some love. 

*I was the cat all along*But I'm da best :cIt's survival, you keep it up as long as you have to. And ideally work to lessen the harmful shit.Social introversion and extraversion are just one facet of that particular dichotomy (idk, it's more of a gradient I guess). I'm an extrovert in Jungian terms, but I can give many introverts a run for their money in sociability.The rowing I'm used to is never gentle rip 

Also I am ashamed at how long it took me to realize "but a dream" is not, in fact, "butter dream". The South, people.Excuse me my waifu makes a lovely pillow and would like to have a word, hentai is a valid form of erotic art hush. 

(Also the ISTPs I run with very much like hentai)Nothing at all don't let this normie shame you I know right. So... personally savage. Yeah we're gonna need like 5 tonnes of what this means, what correlations there may be, how these different labels manifest, etc. My waifu requires a bouquet and a notarized apologygive me money

money meLOL LOL !!
lllllooooooooolllllllllllI'm in, what sketchy shit you need me to do?I can do *je ne sais quoi* and being ordered around (; I think Ne doms' extroversion is more... people-optional, not people-averse. I'm an ENTP, but I spend most of my time indoors and alone, most of my connections are digital. 

I think ENTPs may skew a little more introverted socially, but that's purely anecdotal. This is speculative, but Fi is a little more concerned with personal relationships and others than Ti, so that might contribute? Not sure.Yeah this is dumb.

Also, triphop ftw.I actually kinda thought you were an ISTP as well for a while now, but I could be wrong. Do you normally type as INFJ? 

Also you sound and look a lot like I imagined you would, except I imagined brown hair instead.Ahahahah that's saying something And me coming over to harass the ISTJs!WIGIIIIIIIIOhhh okay. I wonder why I thought INFJ...

ISTP is what popped up... not as soft and ramble as most the INTPs I've known, but it's not out of the realm of possibility by any means.

Idk I think you sound pretty cool lmaoNot much imo but them again, Ne dom. The INTP I spend time with hardly gets rambly from my perspective. Get an Si dom to judge your straighforwardness :D You ramble but it's mostly on topic or directly supporting the point you're trying to make, if that makes sense. It's less scattered and jumpy and doesn't go through the Ne cycle of "what, how is this related-? Ooohhhhh, I guess..."

Rambling is fun though! On the internet, hell yeah

real world too scaryI'll take your rambliness, I volunteer! 

That sounds pretty accurate, cool post too o: especially Ni-Se striving to convey one picture and getting annoyed when it fails to do that, vs. Ne-Si focusing more on the journey (which is pretty much epitomized in our convo here, with your irritation at things that don't directly contribute to that vs. my taking pleasure in exploring without a major point.) Same thing~Nah, it's sort of electronic, originated in the UK in the 90's.EDM is a favorite of mine, although I do enjoy alt-rock and indie pop stuff. But trip-hop will always hold a special place in my heart. Massive Attack is my fave artist and a pioneer of the genre, I'm still waiting for them to come back to the US or Canada. Even if they don't hit Dallas, I'll still go see them... eh, may even go UK. I missed them once in high school and I still regret it.OH SNAP you would hate my art/writing playlist, it's like alllllllll cyberpunk/industrial/triphop type businessYou aren't this person's doctor or therapist, so stop trying to dole out medical advice over the internet.I've always said I'm an optimistic realist so... yeah.What do you do to ensure this is solid data? The tests are notoriously biased, as are the people taking them, and each one of these little steps leads to less accurate results. Is there are particular test you use? Do you add any instructions to the testing process (such as not taking it based on mood/how you generally are vs. how you're expected to act, etc)? 

There are a good number of MBTI stats out there but as with any personality psychology, it's hard to ensure anything is remotely accurate.I'd be fuckin pissed lol. Unless someone asked first to use it as an exercise and gave due credit, or did their own twist. Otherwise, I'm happy to go scorched earth. 

I put a lot of time and effort into my art, and many of my subjects are parts of my own writing and world-building, so it's doubly irritating. See, this is fine to me. As long as my original is given credit, I'm okay. I've had people do fanart and even music for me and that was extremely flattering. I do art for some of my favorite fanfiction authors and they're delighted that someone took their writing and brought it to life, although I always ask to post and link their stories. 

Theft is where I get nasty lmao. Hm, I always thought she was an ESxP.Generalizing, ESTP.

Mother - ESFP

Biological father: Unsure, but the descriptions have me thinking he's Fi-Te/Se-Ni

Adoptive father - ENTJ

Stepfather 1 - ISTP

Stepfather 2 - ISTP

Stepmother- ESTP 

Brother - ENTP

So much Se...Dude same lol I think mine is estp 

That much Se is just chaotic miseryI haven't seen her for a while, but that could be the case since I've only seen her wilder comedic videos lmao. That's really interesting, I don't think I've ever heard of this. What kind of concepts? I'm not sure why people think just because functions differ, the types share no traits externally. In order to know the differences and find them in actual subjects, you have to understand the motivations and reasoning behind their behaviors. Sharing letters is often enough to share some similarities.

Oftentimes, ENFJs will behave similarly on the surface to ENFPs. They may seem warm, bubbly, kind and friendly, inclusive, etc. And that can make them hard to sort in realtime. 

A major difference is their feeling function. ENFPs typically have strongly-held values based in their Fi. It's what they believe is right, the framework they build their worldview within, and dom Ne is used to absorb lots of information from the world around them (lending them more elasticity than their Fi-dom counterparts). They can sometimes appear stubborn, self-centered, or flighty. 

Dom Fe, however, is generally more focused on what is good for the collective/their group/etc. and their values may shift more easily depending on the group in question. They may be willing to compromise what they personally believe for what they believe works for the majority. Ni can interrupt this tho. They can sometimes appear somewhat manipulative, controlling with an "I know better than you" flavor. Fe as a whole tends to exert itself on its environment, especially compared to Ne, which is spongier.

Ne lends flexibility to Fi for the ENFP, where Ni can add some stubbornness and extra foresight to Fe for the ENFJ. I agree with you here. 

Granted, I do buy into functions, but I also think that temperament and letter groups are there for a reason. I can't fathom why an ENFJ would look totally dissimilar to an ENFP...That still doesn't mean they don't look similar externally. If you break everything down to its very basics, yeah, they operate differently. But when you apply this to actual people, it's hard to know what the underlying processes are and it's not exactly unbelievable that your NFs could look relatively alike. ESFP mom and I'm a ENTP accident baby, can confirmim a filthy leftie lmao I absorbed my NFP buddiesNot at all. 

Edit: pretty heavily socialist actuallyL E F T W I N G T R A S Hthank you omgI don't remember much of years 0-8 but I was told I was distracted, smart, obnoxious, and creative. 

As a teenager I was an insufferable, aggressive little shit lmaoINTPs can really steam, although it's a slow-burn kind of anger. My ENTJ father was also incredibly wrathful. 

I have my own anger problems. It takes a lot to upset me enough to where I hold a grudge, but I can be really vindictive and harmful. I try not to be.I personally like Christmas stuff so I can wear my jingle bells earrings @.@ I like themed clothing, light-up clothes and accessories, and pretty much anything ridiculous. 

Most of the time it's wrinkled and plain though cause lazy.Female ENTP also and I'll stick to my ridiculous LED clothing and lack of an iron. Also entp girl, I like scary girls Soon it will be LED hoodies to join my glasses and shoes... 

The nice thing about lower Fe and a lick of confidence is I'm impervious to people thinking I'm weird.Ikr! I've only met 2, which is wild. It's so unmistakable but there's definitely a lot of hesitation dropping the barrier of social acceptableness.  :D I agree on the functions, but I thought either ISFJ or maybe INFJ.I think with INTP, I would expect more perspective shifting with the amount of waffling she displays, and more... I guess more noticeable Ti? I kind of thought the detachedness was more about answering questions about oneself, Fe usually comes alive when focusing on others. I think Ne is a little stronger in these types of videos than Fe to me, but that could be my own Ne bias.

It's not a solid argument though, but I think that function quadra and introversion are pretty obvious. I don't really see the Fi-Te argument at all. I can see INTP but I'm leaning towards ISFJ. 

Check out typeinmind.com/sife since there's a good description there. I personally think you display less Ne than an INTP might, and Si is a much softer function than Ti. The types do share the functions, however. 

I do think you're Si-Ne/Ti-Fe though.i don't know about you but i'm feelin 22that Ne Ti smirk dude I can't unsee it now... you DO look like a serial killer

i'm just a garden-variety stalkerWhat type am i plsyou look cool af*wildly flaps wings*I did in fact cosplay Mina the fairy trial captain! She's pretty much me honestly. *"I beat all the Trainers around here, too, so now I'm totally bored again..."*

*"I mean, I sort of am. I actually just wander around doing my art, so I don't have an actual trial or anything..."*

she gives me INTP vibes but they basically put me in a video game... my boyfriend went as IlimaProof that I am actually a video game character:

I made a Klefki too and mounted it on my backpack. Wait, someone actually made a flying chair? With balloons? Okay, I need to find this and order a fuckton of helium and balloons. Do they sell this on Amazon? I got Prime precisely for shit like this...I immediately fell in love :D So nice to be represented lolPoor dude, sad that he killed himself. 

I wonder if I could do this with regular balloons, but less of them, so I don't go 16,000ft into the hair. Ideally it would be fun to just hover or something... I have some questions for my physics major friends omg 

I'm so glad you told me about thisgood botgood botoh my god i love you, you are so cuteI'm sure there's many uses for this, but will it help with my balloons?Would that even happen?Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events

B) I've got it downnnnNarcissism - 2.5 - 40%

Machiavellianism - 3.4 - 84%

Psychopathy - 2.9 - 53%

My scores keep going down so that's a good sign. YikesIkr I like all the people who are proud of the higher scores LOLYou assume everybody has a solid situation outside of the internet, and that is incorrect. A few for ENTPs:

-Indecision

-Overestimated social ability

-Too much boundary pushing

-Impulsivity

-Impracticality 

-UnreliabilityPretty much. You and I got similar scores.These numbers don't indicate whether one is a good person or not, FYI.I honestly wouldn't. Not without more information. A) I didn't say all were all at once

B) Someone can share contradictory traits

Fuck offESTP, ISTP and ENTP are most sociopathic iirc, unofficial survey though. 

ETA: 

http://worldofanentp.tumblr.com/post/96219034302/psychopathic-typesI don't see much of a difference tbh. Functions are still functions, I don't think it's that hard to spot types with varying levels of intelligence. It's not a paradox. You have a larger social network, she doesn't. There could be all kinds of non-MBTI related reasons for this. Consider the way your friendships work and how you both interact with these people. 

I have an INTP partner and he has many more friends than I do, despite being extroverted. It's not unheard of, although Fe is more conventionally social than Ne. I prefer to ignore the rules and see how long it takes for someone to even call me out. Am i??That's not what a psychopath is.Am i?? Nailed itTerrible test. 70%I can think of so many areas where ASPD-diagnosed people would answer the non psychopath option and even more vice-versa. SweeeeetNah man I'm dating my mirror. Twice the NTP, twice the fun, twice the bullshit. ENTJ is more of an asshole, ENTP is more of a little bitch. Seems like the pretentious statement above is really on target.Don't worry, you're probably not as clever as you thinkENTP: I love Coraline omg. 

My favorite authors are Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman,  Stephen King, and Anne McCaffrey. It's hard to recommend a singular book, I like so many of them. Also, Eoin Colfer is an author I always enjoyed. Dark Towerrrrrrrrrr ISTJI've thought enfp tooENTP and I'm a server atm at a high-end Japanese place (although I've been BOH and FOH at many other places). I like the flexibility of waiting tables, I make good tips, and I'm usually not mentally tired by the job so it leaves me valuable energy for education and art. When I worked in an office, I was always drained and lost touch with my hobbies. 

I don't really like workplace drama (of which there is a ton), and customers are irritating. It's like something about sitting down at a table turns even normal humans into obnoxious idiots. My co-workers are cool here tho and bank is made.

I don't know if I'll get back to a career job, probably once I get another degree in computer science. I think just attitude, but you've said a few things that struck me as more Fi than not. I'm too tired to go hunting tho tbh, it's 4pm and I just woke up Nope just a fucked up sleep schedule. Although I had DnD until 6am today so I have a reason. Ohhhhhhh shitttttall the istjs I've gotten close to have been simultaneously kind, hard working, and cantankerous lmaoI'm not sure if I should be surprised at ENTPs rank or not...This post sounds ENFP af tbh

Especially if you're old enough to have a husband Rarely are they as LOL RANDOM! XD like op lmaoA lot of NTPs are into weird kinky shitWUBWUBWUBWUBWUB*skreeeeeee*

Like you have your fuzzy handcuff and blindfold stuff right? Roleplay and BDSM and such. 

But then you can escalate to con-noncon, shibari, vore, blood fetishes, sensory deprivation, knifeplay... so yeah there's normal kinky shit and weird kinky shit He asked, I answered. I didn't say those were all extreme, just somewhere outside of the typical BDSM/kink register.I need a nice ISTJ girl[live footage of me asking someone out](https://youtu.be/-TcLxlkc2pA)Yup pretty much. I gave up trying to not seem eccentric, it makes things so much easier. Just be yourself and whoever is left standing might be a potential match :DESTP, else ESFPlemme smashfind your fellow N types or your S types in touch with their own quirks. i've been dating an INTP for 2+ years now and it's been great. p:becky.........It's meThis isn't an airport, no need to announce your departure. Message the mods then for that analogy lmaoWell that's goodENTP: I pretty much have Ne face and Ti face. 

Ne face is usually wide eyes, looking up and off in the distance, head tilted. If I'm actively engaging, I'm more likely to be smiley and excited and energetic and I talk really fast and flap my hands a lot. If I'm not engaging with anyone or anything then it's just blank, mild Luna Lovegood face.

Ti face usually looks either worried, confused, or skeptical. Always have a thousand yard stare and I kind of look downwards, lips pursed and brow furrowed. I won't talk much like this because conversation will interrupt my concentration. 

There's also the rare Cheshire grin that I think every ENTP possesses.

I rarely make eye contact with people and I usually sit in my chair weird lmao.I hate when people do that. Go-to response is to tell them to say something funny or give me a reason. Sorry man I just woke up after almost 2 days of no sleep, my brain is still booting upi dream of a woman who looks at me like thisENTP:

;D I appreciate itAgreed. This started happening to me after a near-death experience and permanent change in my health status. It took half a year of acute trauma therapy but the person on one side of that is incredibly different from the other. Nice post my dude **Type:** ENTP f

**Location:** Texas, y'all

**Age:** 23

**Medium:** Reddit, Skype, Telegram

**About Me:** I'm an artist with a BA in Advertising, but I'm going back to school in the spring for computer science. I'm really into music and am taking lessons in singing/songwriting, and learning to play the guitar better.

 I like foreign languages, drawing and painting, video games (especially Overwatch and Guild Wars 2), board games, D&amp;D, creative writing, and sci-fi. I know who I amISTJ, INTP, INFJ sometimesEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee &lt;3Yeah the apathy of ISTPs is amazing I don't have much self-control and not much more ambition tbh.I am in a happy relationship with an INTP and I'm often drawn to other high Ne users. Along with female ISTJs. INTP closer to true neutral. 

ENTP chaotic neutral is pretty accurate. Crushes can come from all kinds of relationships and attractions, not solely due to "anima/animus", lolThe only INFJ I know well wouldn't either, but she would DM me weird MBTI shit that didn't make sense and say "it you". How do you live like that? honestly?I swear to god the INTJ part of that just about gave me an aneurysm. You can't just bypass things...y u isfjThe two ENTPs I speak with regularly are super similar to me. We're all into internet and game culture, are a strange combination of TMI and distant, and honestly seem more socially introverted. I get along really well with both of them. 

One of them has an INTP girlfriend (I have an INTP bf) and we all go to anime and cosplay conventions together, get lit, have LAN parties and a D&amp;D campaign. When were together, the ENTPs get really wild and want to go on adventures and there are lots of jokes and storytelling and we basically never STFU. Also, we are hella crafty and inventive and entrepreneurial. NTPs in general are multitalented and really fun in my experience. Aww, sad no one commented on this. I'm kind of approaching that area with an INTP and yeah, it seems like we're going full nerdy nontraditional. ENTP: Weasels or ferrets. Playful, kind of weird, and when they are in a pickle they start hopping around to confuse you. LOLyeah im a fuckin weeb too sommm eccentric cluster good stuffyeahhh

cept the edgelord crew which is almost worseENTP, I would swap to ENFP, ESFP, or ISTJ. ENTP: Creativity, curiosity, intelligence, optimism, and autonomy. classysameOof, no survival horror?I thought you meant infomercials for soap on TV and I was about to give you a strong yes. 1a) What are two important strengths of yours?

- Resourcefulness: I'm pretty quick on my feet and can usually find solutions to problems, even if they aren't always conventional. I'm good at coming up with ideas. I enjoy puzzles and the challenge of having to fox my way out of trouble sometimes. 

- Multitalented. I rotate through a lot of hobbies and interests. Language (including computer), musical instruments, various art forms, numerous sports, writing... I really like learning new things, so I spend hours online reading articles and watching videos about things I know I won't care about in the next month, save for a few perennial interests. Once I got into soapmaking and had so much lye in my apartment that I'm pretty sure it became a hazard.

1b) What are two important weaknesses of yours?

- I'm incredibly poor when it comes to follow-through. It's a combination of being very easily distracted and being happy to sit in my head. If I'm interested in a hobby, I'll pursue it wholeheartedly, then lose interest and stop. It's been a goal of mine to identify some of those aforementioned "perennials" so I can find what sticks. I waste a lot of time fantasizing instead of doing the things I should be doing. 

- Low empathy. I've never been good at putting myself in another person's shoes or considering their feelings. It takes a lot of conscious work to do so, as I'm really self-absorbed in whatever project I'm chasing and I forget to consider others. I'm generally at a distance from other people and disinterested in their personal lives, but it's a little hypocritical because I still want to have some of those deeper connections. Not many, but a few.

2a) In general, what do you consider to be fun?

- I like playing games a lot. I enjoy creative projects, and have a huge interconnected world of all sorts of characters and plotlines to which I contribute both art and writing that I've worked on for a couple of years. Anything that requires some puzzling over will probably hold my interest for a while. 

2b) What are your specific hobbies or interests?

- Cosplay and prop-making, especially 3d printing (gonna gift myself a printer for xmas ayyyy), drawing and painting, programming, running, gaming, writing, going to concerts, board games, reading. Also, D&amp;D is a new one, I was up until 9am playing today which is probably terrible for me but oh well, too fun. Artificial intelligence too, which is what sparked my interest in CS. 

2c) Out of those, choose the one you are currently most interested in. Why do you enjoy this hobby or interest?

- Probably drawing and painting. It's the one that's stuck around the longest, and I'm good enough to convey most of the things I want to. It also aids me in my other hobbies, and I make money off of it. Computer science as well. 

3a) What's your ultimate goal in life?

- I dunno honestly. Maybe find a career I enjoy, although I may instead go the entrepreneurship route. I don't really do singular goals, I always have multiple routes and ideas open just in case. It's all very nebulous. I would also like to work in AI, which is why I want to continue my education and switch fields. I love thinking about robotics and how machines are drawing closer and closer to humans - I think it's amazing. If I could be a part of that progress I would probably be happy. 

3b) Do you think there's a point to life? If so, what is it?

- Do interesting things and make rent, I guess. I don't think there's any one point to anything. 

4a) How are you planning on fulfill the goal mentioned in #3?

- Going back to school for a second degree in CS, continuing to work on some of my projects while I consider what I may want to do with a business. I have a few ideas. 

4b) If not already mentioned, how would academics and career fit into your approach or plan in #3a?

- Already mentioned.

4c) If not already mentioned, how would relationships and your social life fit into your approach or plan in #3a?

- I hadn't really considered that. My boyfriend is supportive of my plans, I suppose, and my father is experienced in entrepreneurship and finance so I would definitely ask for his insight if I choose to go that route. Otherwise, very little interpersonal involvement. 

5a) Do you have strong opinions on politics? If so, what are they?

- Sometimes. I'm pretty far to the left, especially in my conservative area. I have stronger opinions on the issues of healthcare and social issues to an extent, but I'm pretty disillusioned with everything so it's hard to get fired up.

5b) What's the rationale behind those opinions?

- I think a lot of our politics are regressive and way too focused on things that simply don't matter. Too much time, money, and energy is wasted on utter bullshit. That combined with rampant corruption and related business is just... enough to make me more apathetic. Sometimes it's hard to know what's real.D&amp;D is dope af, I stayed up until 9 playing today lmao. The roleplaying aspect is really fun. &gt;hold deerOH SHIT 

I'm so mad that I didn't know this. I think the last "soap-y" show I watched was like 2 episodes of the Good Doctor and maybe I was high beyond belief but that was one of the most godawful things I've seen in a while. Also ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FTWagreedi too enjoy holding antlered mammalsReally? Honestly if they all go rogue and destroy us I'd be relieved LOL. Like I'd be the dumbass watching some I, Robot shit go down and get mowed down out of fascination.

Having anyone expound on anything will give you more insight. If they're keen I might pull a "oh, have you ever taken this test? they usually do it for jobs and stuff or in psych classes..." for a baseline. Either way, it's just constant fiddling as I learn more about them.I mean it's not contagious so idk why that would stop you. If you want to be really badass, fuck a girl right in the stomaYesssssss exactly thank you. Idk why I hold so much more affection for these possible babies vs. actual humans, lol. Maybe because there's just so much potential...

It makes me really sad when people specifically don't want them to become self-aware and use them pretty much as slaves. Westworld ahhhh. I wonder if their awareness would make them sad? I guess that might depend on a personality tho. I'm way too sleep deprived lmaoIt's so much fun honestly, I started a couple of months ago and wowza. :D It's hard to get a committed group tho. I thought stomas go in the intestine... although honestly that's MORE evidence for wrapping it up lmfao oh god I definitely have floated the idea of a tinder-like app that shows you people playing desired games and skill levels and stuff, that would be super dope. Wait do you know me LOL 

And no, no I will not. Even as I had the idea I lost interest.its okay everything thinks i'm an ne dom anywaynot even a backup typeeeeee i wanna be enfp reeeeeeits not as fun as you think lmao. what type are you?wait i'm into it be mine?? hunFinally, someone who will appreciate my constant staring. 

nice b8 m8That's exactly what I find useful. The functions and the types of judging/perception they describe exist anyway in some form or fashion, but it's nice to have a name for them. It creates that common language you describe and significantly improves communication and understanding between motivated people. i'm subtle afnot quickly enoughi have your dick pics

tangent, my friend was trolling around craigslist personals and found this 80 year old dude looking for S E X right? all normal, except he had used MS paint to draw these wild neon backgrounds and random additions to his photos! and there were like 20 OF THEM LIKE HOLY SHIT 

there was so much fucking time and effort put into them and it was all these weird patterns and stuff, all in that bitmappy paint, with weird old man dick like... i'm not sure if i'm more horrified or impressed. 

so I need that kind of effort from youI agree, he sounds rather ISFJ imo, although I wouldn't always rule INTP out. Male ISFJs tend to blur the line a little more between the two types. it was some of the wildest shit i've seen on craigslist honestlyi never look awayIt's difficult, but when I'm angry enough, the general facade of pleasantness will accidentally slip off. Not pretty, like you said.Idk why people think it's so hard to match up writing styles and diction. It's so obvious and kind of funny in a really sad way.Why not both??the noises... the smells.............. 

thank god Ne users have no Se so they can't hear or smell, whew!ENTPs have a bit of an Icarus complex. We often push too far to find limits and burn ourselves as a result. Elsie - best ENTP

Bernard - INTP

Teresa - ESTJ I believe, can't quite remember, could be NTJ

William - ISxJ but given recent revelations I'm not sure about him at all 

Man In Black - Initially had ISTP vibes

Dolores - ISFJ 

Stubbs - ESTP

Maeve - ENFJ, maybe T

Lee Sizemore - ESFP

Logan - ESTP 



So you're Dva?There is so much wrong with this comment that I'm not even sure where to begin.So can I 

Ok I'm probably not capable Dude stop with the anime MBTI shit, isn't this like the third time you've posted on 2 separate accounts? I typically think in vague images and diagrams and scenes that play out in my head. I do have a narration voice but I almost always speak aloud and talk to myself when that happens. Elsie from Westworld

Gaige from Borderlands (most likely an ENTP tbh)

ETA: Adding 707 from Mystic Messenger. Tons of memes, crippling depression, a love of technology, computers, and genderbending. &lt;3 

Elsie is a generally realistic portrayal imo. She's super curious, a programmer, and I feel like I would have made a lot of the same choices she made throughout the show. ENTPs show a lot of curiosity to their own detriment imo. 

Gaige is such a cute little brat and sounds like me when I play mic'd on Overwatch LOL. Very inventive and accidentally exploded her rival hehehe707 FUCK YES i'm gonna add him in. he's such a good ENTP and super similar TBH. I went for his route immediately because I related to it so hard.ENTPs are not nearly as smooth as ESTPs, lol. A lot of ENTPs are much more awkward than the "zany charisma-ball" descriptions suggest. I've never felt like I've been cool or whatever, and I've always struggled so much with fitting in and understanding others. I tested as an introvert because of that seclusion. 

The not wanting to show fake emotions can be attributed to either Fi or Fe. To sum it up... Fi would be more concerned with being authentic, low-order Fe would potentially be apathetic - a positive vs. a negative. I sing and write mostly. I can play guitar and piano, but I prefer to create tbh. NTPs and STPs would be fun to work with, same with ISFPs. That's more likely to be an ENTP kind of deal tbhthis is poetryteen titanssorryI usually don't notice food taste a lot. Like... if it's REALLY good I'll stop and note it, but I can be happy with a super bland diet. Cereal, Greek yogurt, meal replacement drinks, and some fruit make it really easy for me. I like sweets okay, less so lately. Textures will weird me out fast tho LOL 

Except cheese. I fucking love cheese with all of my cold dead heart, it's the best food on the entire planet except for Kraft because that is not cheese, it's orange bullshit. Manchego, Roquefort, brie, and smoked gouda are my favorites RN. I super liked you in spirit.

I wonder if I could creep peoples comments and figure out their age and general location and stuff and then try to match them. Like, I could start by finding those photo threads bc people who share photos are more likely to divulge other information too (or so I would guess). Then I would know what they look like and I could maybe find other personal info and then I could set my Tinder in their range and start looking and maybe I could find them and superlike them JUST TO FREAK THEM THE FUCK OUT and be like HI ITS MIRRORCONSPIRACIES FROM REDDIT MBTI.

It would be a long shot but I'm sure I could if I tried hard enough. I'm not sure why I would want to do it except to see if I could. you're all STsthe statement is based on the idea that many in the sub are mistyped and that those who are pondering their NT-ness are in fact ST types instead. it's a joke that is somewhat rooted in truth.&gt;Um, I'm sorry, did you just associate me with one of those filthy traditional boring dumb shallow filthy traditional sensors? I would like you to know that my majestically deep interesting intelligent ~ abstract intuitiveness ~ is far beyond any level of abstract thought that any one of those fucking sensors could muster up. And don't start telling me about your stupid fucking "cognitive functions" because I am an INTJ, the best type at logic and smarteastutelligenceptnessosity (yes, that's a word, you don't even have to look it up, pls dont), and I have thoroughly disproven them with something I'm sure you've never heard of called ~ personal experience. ~ Go back to your filthy fucking mall or office or wherever you sensors drone away and get out of our ~ intuitive ~ subreddit.
(/s obviously)

/u/cometotheMauiWowie y u deletLOLbecause it still shows up in my inbox, I just can't reply to it or see it on the thread itself. so I just copied it LOLi just want to love themimagination infatuationGonna get a lil bit personal here: So, I actually don't know a lot about MPD/DID (updated name), but I actually took the MMPI-2 as well. My report was pretty scathing LOL. "Mirrorconspiracies shows signs of suspicion and paranoia in relationships, hostility to others, unusual or eccentric thought patterns" etc etc. Were you officially diagnosed with DID? Or was it just brought up as a possible explanation?

I really hope you were working with a trusted psychologist, because it's important to not only get the raw results, but to also have a professional who knows you well enough to interpret those results. The interpretation is almost as - if not more - important than your raw answers themselves. The way my doctor put it is that having those results can put a very negative skew on... well, you, as the test generally is looking for disordered thoughts and behaviors. You also are supposed to consider the context of the results - if for some reason you WERE lying and having conscious conflicting results, it still should be investigated as to why you were doing that before getting diagnosed with anything. 

One thing I do know about DID is that it's almost always caused by some type of trauma. Trauma can deeply fragment, alter or even remove somebody's self-conception and sense of identity. If you've been in therapy, or have been taking notable steps to self-improvement, recovering from trauma may lead you towards a more permanent personality/identity. 

All of this is to say that MBTI/Jungian psychology should be taken with an extra spoonful of salt. I tested as ISFJ and ISTJ a few years ago, for reference lmao - you might end up being an ENFJ or whatever. I would give it some time. 

Definitely feel free to look into cognitive functions though, at the very least you'll probably find an axis you fit into well enough. It's still fun to learn about and can improve your interpersonal relationships. Just be aware that finding your type may be more difficult, or that you might never be certain at all.  

Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more. A lot of humor is rooted in truth. Pretty close for Ne doms. I tend to retreat into my own imagination when my physical environment isn't very inspiring, so that can ease some of the stress. accidentally gayI always fall for INTPs and occasionally other ENTPs, especially if they're women, but it usually works out. I have a thing for female ISTJs though and I think my Ne scares them off. 

ISTPs and ESTPs end up crushing on me quite often. I'm not sure why tbh.Idk if it was because I was extra high but this show was infuriatingly awful. Like House and Hallmark had a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome. ugh i was gonna write something similar but you got there first fmlLMAOE D G Y

Yyes but see i am also lazy... -Wayne GretskyMy haiku!I'm enfp I love ISTJs, especially female ISTJs. *swoon*

But one annoyance is yes, they can spoil our fun. There's no hard proof ghosts aren't real, just as there's none that they are. You just can't know, and I'm sure your ENTP friend knows that... but sometimes it's just more fun to entertain the possibility. You don't have to believe, but I'm general Ne is going to want to explore lots of possibilities and things like viability or practicality won't stand in their way. 

Ne doms who appreciate Si doms aren't looking for another ENxP, they appreciate your grounded nature. By all means continue to push your boundaries a little and feed your Ne, but you don't have to change who you are. 

I have two friends who are INTP and ENTP, and you don't know how much I appreciate my ISTJ friend's planning abilities when I try to get us to meet up. It's like an eel trying to climb out of a jello pit. Or herding kittens. In one sense, you do have a utility and it's different than your ENTP friend's, so make sure you're taking advantage of his. I know one who is a head chef of a Japanese restaurant. He speaks four languages, has tons of recipes memorized, has traveled the world for his work and education, and can improvise some of the best food I've ever had. 


He's pretty laid back and fun outside of work, but takes it really seriously on the clock and can be a bit bitchy and high-strung. Good guy though, and one of the best at what he does. Istp [mine](http://i.imgur.com/b78zpqm.jpg)1. Library. Camp is too long omg I can do a day or so but after that I'm out 

2. Yes I do, very own. 

3. Good feelings are easier to get through, so that. Most debates are pretty dumb. A good debate will be fun but those are rare

4. Restricted Kinda close, entp I think I just got cancer You look like a Nazi experiment gone horribly right Oh I've had many sights of him 

;)))))))Wink wink I'm da spirit of NeWildYou got to it first damnI'm an Ne dom but I talk to myself a lot, or talk at things/people when I'm not looking for input. And all this MBTI business is essentially giving a lot of these different styles and traits a name to go by. Ne is the exploration and curiosity that goes towards seeking and connecting new ideas, and many Ne doms seek that out in a partner. Saying you connect via Ne is simply shorthand for something that is true. Some people enjoy defining and organizing systems. Chill the fuck out. heroes never die*NoI think a number of INFJs enjoy martyrdom and victimization that comes with being empathetic or sensitive (especially combined with dom Ni), but in general the Ti-Fe axis is more internally detached and externally warm. I certainly wouldn't call them the most empathetic. Can you describe what your Ne looks like and your Se? How do you explore abstract ideas? Ne and Se are both creative and resourceful and enjoy learning. However, Ne is more focused on the links between concepts and ideas, much like a spiderweb. Also, because Ne is less tangible and not very people/environment focused, many ENTPs tend to be socially introverted and slower to mobilize. 

I know an ISTP who thought he was ENTP for a long time because he's intelligent and enjoyed philosophy and puzzles (I believe it sated his Ni), but when it came down to it, he didn't learn for the sake of it. All the philosophy and ideas he absorbed were applied to his life in a pragmatic fashion, he didn't have the desire to muse on things he couldn't use or didn't foresee himself needing to know. 

That's one major contrast, as I'm more likely to fixate on useless things and tread water there with no real purpose before I move on. Also, look at inferior Ni vs. Si. Many times, ENTPs are rather nostalgic, and are notoriously poor at taking care of themselves in terms of food, water, and sleep. 

A lot of ENTPs are dreamy and unfocused compared to their Se cousins - not so sharp or intense, as Ne is a lot softer and more childlike in comparison. Pretty much. I'm very good at entertaining myself and the time flies so quickly. Hello fellow entp Basically. Lots of similarities but oh man Ne doms are useless. More fun to me but still Dope as fuck ENTP, submissive with a hint of switchiness. Generally really kinky. Two INTPs I've been with have both been doms, as well as an INTJ. my bf does for some reason, i do on occasion. mine i think are a result of blood thinners, most situations that normally wouldn't draw much blood end up being pretty miserable. will you marry me and why? i used to, i would love to be able to teach and help a little nug reach their max potential. 

but alas, that most likely won't happen. i might consider adoption in the distant future, but i wouldn't be surprised if i never have them.that's super cool, damn. I feel like I would do this to somebody tbh that sounds hilarious(because none of them are interested in me, duh)

Legit/informative answer just cause Ne doms get some rough relationship stereotypes, things have to be going very poorly for me to actually consider taking off. It takes so long to actually make a commitment to somebody that once I do, I'm in for the long haul. The other ENTPs I know are similar, granted I have a small sample size. this is the comment that made me like youI think Ne doms get this a good bit, most people outside of my close friends assume I'm an introvert, especially since I'm not very friendly if I'm not comfortable. Most of my extroversion doesn't really require direct interaction with others. I'm slow to commit as well, but mostly because I have an idea of what I'm looking for and I don't want to risk making a promise and then leaving. It doesn't look that way from the outside. p: no hugs 4 youOh hush &lt;3 *hugs*I think he's a fucking moron and trash tier. I loved watching him get dragged LOL. You have to be a really special kind of person to film himself ridiculing a corpse in Aokigahara, upload it, film a shitty apology video, and monetize it. The rest of his time in Japan was no better. 

He deserves what he gets and let's be real, /u/Chanoyun is correct. He doesn't appear to care or be able to understand what he's done. My father and stepmother are ENTJ and ESTP, respectively. They're also both in tech sales and make a killing. In terms of behavior: 

My father is more of a long-term thinker, and he rarely jumps jobs unless it makes financial sense. His sales approach is based on representing a good product, providing data that supports his pitch, and tends to let numbers speak for themselves. He's more level-headed and difficult to excite, he enjoys more intellectual pursuits and adding to his knowledge base. When he's angered, it's usually due to perceived incompetence on others' end, and the guy can really hold a grudge. He has some of the Se stereotypes such as enjoying nice clothes, travel, new experiences, etc., but it's used as a tool to sort of unwind. He can be joke-y, but ultimately prefers that people respect him for his status and accomplishments. 

My stepmother is more impulsive, and is a total ESTP stereotype. She hops jobs as soon as something better pops up, she's very showy and likes to impress via flash and focuses on the interpersonal relationships. Expert-level schmoozer. She lives for traveling, expensive clothes, wine, and food, and general thrill. She's easily excitable and gets hyped over things quickly, but loses interest if she isn't continually impressed. She gets annoyed and impatient, occasionally likes to fuck with people, and despite being in her 50's, still acts before thinking sometimes. She's hilarious and loves to have an audience she can impress, and has a ton of charisma.

Both are very smart and competent in their fields, but I really like comparing them. damn, good phrasing. yikesew, workgood jobusually comes from stereotypes about extroversion (aka mostly Fe extroversion). and those terrible articles that say if you have to recharge from people, you're an introvert loloopsie yes i did, although tbf if an article said that it would still be terrible or they're neithermake a video, x-post here and to /r/JungianTypology. you'll almost certainly get a response, especially on JT. it's generally easier to type somebody with a more detailed picture, and video allows people to not only gauge your type via your words, but also by your voice, mannerisms, demeanor, tone, and other small pieces that give away your type. i'm not wrong tho and potentially shoehorning OP into a correct type will make it even more frustratingThat's definitely not Ne, that's practically anti-Ne. This guy shows very little Ne, both in the videos and in his comments here. He's not an INTP. 

He's most likely an ISFP, but between the two types, he's an INTJ &gt; INTP. Ne is the complete opposite. 

When given a problem, Ne will test multiple ideas and options out and prefers to hold onto them as long as possible, until it can be nixed. Ne looks at all possibilities as valid, until Ti can eradicate them. Even in the INTP, the Ti and Si create a "pool" of possible ideas, with Ne exploring each of them equally and thoroughly until it decides on the best one. Ne users will shy away from preemptively cutting possible answers unless they are certain that the answer is incorrect. 

The answer he gave is very typical of Ni users (not necessarily just Ni doms) - starting with a solution, even if it's not a certain one, with the hope of confirming it. That's just... not true, lol. 

It looks like you've contradicted yourself here: 

"An Ni, INTJ for example will never come to a conclusion or have a conclusion until they've gotten then necessary information. But they usually have a conclusion." (Is there a word or two missing here? If not, this makes no sense)

and 

"INTJs are dismissive not ENTPs. You've got them switched. ENTP is dismissive of ideas that do not fit the grand scale patterns of course only if they have support for that in their messy brain. INTJ is dismissive solely by the Te." (You just said INTJs are dismissive, then only by Te, you said ENTPs are not dismissive, then give a way that they are dismissive)

You should probably clarify those, as I don't know how to respond to them otherwise. 

Summing it up best imo: "Types that value Ne prefer to try out an opportunity rather than consider all possible ways in which it could not work out. They pick a few options and stick with them, in contrast to introverted intuition (Ni) types who pick one option and continue to doubt that option."

Ne typically doesn't start off with "this is the answer, let's see if it's correct". It's "here are the possibilities, which is the answer?", which contradicts OP's statement of having an answer and confirming. You're correct when you say that Ne is a zoomed out image, yes, but that image does not create an answer. They're all possibilities that need to be manually evaluated and the answer only comes once that's happened.

INTJs are typically confirming or denying, with one idea at a time. ENTPs are reluctantly dismissive, which is what I said earlier: they will dismiss, but only after thoroughly exploring it, with the idea considered "dead", and they do this with multiple answers at a time. Ne is a gatherer, and Ti pares. 

INTPs are actually the most dismissive of the three in a way, at least initially. Ti and Si are used to establish a filter that Ne pulls and explores ideas through. This can be confused for Ni-Te sometimes. Ni typically will start on a hunch or an uncertain answer, searching for evidence that supports and builds on it until it either confirms or does not. Upon that correction, it'll move on. Ni users have an answer, Ni-Te is especially systematic in that regard. This is extra true with ISFPs, who have Ni+; you'll see similar patterns in ENTJs.

Ti doesn't have an answer or a conclusion in itself. It's just a set of parameters for potential answers, nothing has been decided on until Ne examines each option. Again, going from multiple to (hopefully) one. If that fails, parameters are re-examined, then all the ideas are re-explored - contrast with Ni-Te, which seeks to confirm or deny one, and if it fails, moves on. In the case of wrong answers, "wasted time" is on the back end for Ni and front end for Ne. 

On top of this, he shows so little Ne in every other answer - low of flightiness, tangents, actively connecting ideas, etc. Mannerisms and body language also don't correlate, he's much steadier and more direct. 

He's rarely interested in ideas for the sake of them, and even specifies that when he learns, he retains information by learning the practical applications and implications. "How does it relate to the external world, how can I use it?" is the norm for Se-Te users. While both Pe functions will appear muted in somebody with depression, that's really telling of Se &gt; Ne. 

OP himself doesn't even relate to Ne, and it would be very clear in his video if Ne were his auxiliary. 


I took way too long to type that so I didn't see it. 

You're correct on Ne and Ni here, but it's very possible we're reading OP's statement very differently. this is why i shitpost because then i do this

dope dudeJim Halpert is ENTP (although I've seen a few good arguments for ISTP, I'm sticking with ENTP for now), Leslie is most likely ESTJ. 

My faves: 

-Gaige from Borderlands 2 (ENTP)

-Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events (ISTP, though I've seen good arguments for xNTP depending on media format) 

-Sombra from Overwatch (tentatively ENTP, could see STP)

-Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (INTP) 

-Lessa from Dragonriders of Pern (ENTJ)

-Holly Short and Artemis Fowl from Artemis Fowl (ESFP and INTJ, respectively)

-707 from Mystic Messenger (def ENTP) 

-Howl from Howl's Moving Castle (probably xSFP)

-Elsie from Westworld (ENTP) 

curious, excitable, exploring, playful, puzzlingholy fucking cringe 

also, ENFP, possibly ESFP

Jim isn't an Fi user. He operates on the basis of what makes sense to him, rather than how he relates. He's also the first person to point out logical inconsistencies and flaws in almost anything, as well as speaking out against Michael and Andy's Pe-Fi irrationality.

The biggest moment of contrast IMO between his Ti and Michael's Fi is when they're co-managing and attempting to deal with raises. At some point, he criticizes Michael's inability to detach himself and his feelings from the decisions he has to make, and Michael responds by mocking Jim's constant desire to be correct, saying "If I can think through everything juuuuust right..." 

Jim and Michael's auxiliary functions are the others' PoLR function, which is why they have the dynamic that they do. You can also compare Darryl (ISTP) and Jim's Ti approaches (and contrast their use of Se vs. Ne). He struggles the most with high Fi users, moreso with Andy and Kelly than Michael (due to the Se/Ne conflict in the former two). 

He falls into common ENTP traps with his pranks - namely, pulling them with little consideration for others and how they feel, only realizing and regretting his hurting after the damage is done. He gets so invested in his elaborate tricks and seeing if they work and gaining a reaction that he neglects to actually think about the subject. 

He almost never shows Fi, anywhere in the series. Also, Jim is not soft-spoken even remotely. He arranges some of the most out-there events in the office, makes all kinds of announcements and wild pranks, gets wasted in his Stanford office, draws attention to himself by antagonizing Dwight, wears costumes to work, interrupts and distracts others almost constantly, and loves using Ne-Fe to get reactions out of others. He's not as loud as Se doms - Ne doms usually aren't -, but he's no INxP. 

As for Leslie, that's such a weak reasoning for ESFJ. There are a few character themes throughout show and one is her constant, unabated tenacity. She always has goals that she fights for relentlessly, external goals with objective, measurable results and solid timelines. While she is generally friendly and good-natured, that all goes out the window when somebody attempts to obstruct her (people try not to because of this). She's described by others as a force of nature and as a steamroller. 

There's also a pattern of dom Te &gt; inferior Fi - she has very strong values and beliefs she adheres to (combination of Si-Fi), and she occasionally will compromise those values in order to accomplish a goal. She almost always regrets this, as Fi users are wont to do. 

As for the gift-giving? Look at what her gifts actually consist of. They are almost totally Si-Fi in theme, based on memories and special moments, and are meant to signify the intimate connection between her and the receiver. She does it to show the recipient what they mean to her, which is Fi (subjective relationship with an external object - how do I relate to you?). 

The only other type I could see for her is ENFP, although I think her Te and Si are a little too strong for an ENFP, which is why I believe she's ESTJ, although her Ne is a bit strong for an ESTJ. Either way, she's definitely in the Delta quadra. (Edit: Consider that her actress, Amy Poehler, is an Ne-dom - an ENTP. That could potentially bleed into her character, providing "extra" Ne and Fe.)

Also, I'm pretty sure her need for attention and approval is more due to her being a narcissist, which I also think she is.Those are all different things. A lot of your Si- types will specifically seek to avoid pain and discomfort (ENTP, ISFJ, ESTJ, INFP iirc). Your Si valuing types in general prioritize comfort.

Also, enneagram 7's are dedicated to avoiding boredom, pain, sadness etc, so those types (ENFP, ENTP usually, occasionally ESTP and ESFP) will overlap. 

Fearing death is a different subject and a little too heavy to figure out given your information. Why would they be afraid of death? Pain during death? The leaving behind of family and the sadness of friends? The idea of running out of time and no longer being able to do what they love? The inability to complete their goals? Leaving the world without a lasting legacy? The unknown? Hell? 

All of those are reasons that people fear death, and more, and all of those may or may not correlate to certain functions. &gt; Pay the fuck attention, fuck

I'm pretty sure most of my coworkers are Se users and get incredibly frustrated/baffled by my general inattention to whatever is happening around me. RIP them.There's nothing Fi about Jim's character even with Krasinskis portrayal. Even if Krasinski is an Fi user, that bleeding into Jim Halpert doesn't mean he's an INFP. You haven't given any actual examples or evidence as to why he's an Fi user besides him vaguely reminding you of an INFP you know. The guy craves attention and external validation, and rarely does he consider how he feels about others and his personal relationship. 

Nothing you're saying really supports your assertions. California is probably an INTJ, could be ENTJ. Ben is ISTJ! kill him, it's the only way2lovebirds1stoneunfortunately your type exists IRL so i guess it's a tradeoffthen fall in love with a machine :Di think u learn it at level 30No it's when you have enough EXP as a kadabraRoboneo (((((;he's just asking clarifying questions. don't make assertions if you aren't willing to answer questions about how you came to your conclusion. 

/u/awhaling brought up some very valid points - certain jobs can attract certain types, and some people attract certain personalities. a number of intuitives (and sensors, i assume) will gravitate towards others like them. 

he's not being weird or creepy, you're just defensive and over-sensitive. yikes. i think you had good points tbh. i do the same thing, i'm around a lot of NFPs and NTPs because those are usually the kind of people i attract and enjoy being around, and that doesn't at all represent general population statistics. "creepy" is a really effective way for people to avoid criticism or dodge certain confrontations sometimes. 

plus it always sucks to see see a Ti user getting some weird social dings when you're clearly just trying to understand where their conclusion is coming from LOL omfg hii'll also offer @.@ as a runner-upI have the moral hi groundI do it for the pun, although since it's hi and not high ground your hi being above mine actually doesn't mean as much O-okay, you can have it i'm being attacked&gt;Snickers or smiles like they want to laugh at their own joke but is waiting for external approval 

bitch i'm so funny i can't even finish my jokes cause i'm laughing too hardI like INFPs mostly. Dated one and were on good terms, was roommates with another. Lots of good conversations and moral debates, even if they did get a little frustrating. Much creativity and existential crises. And tag memes

There's a subset of extra sensitive or extra self-righteous INFPs that I absolutely can't stand (or understand) but otherwise p coolInterestingly, your quiz is one of the few that gives me ENTP as number one. I almost always get INTP, but I'm definitely an Ne dom

1. ENTP - 48.72%

2. INTP - 46.15%

3. ENFP - 38.46%

The next few were ESTP, ISTP, and INFP. 

So definitely accurate, and follows my own internal modem of my most likely typings pretty closely p: there are some questions id phrase different to not sound so "obviously Xy function" but overall nice job A+ and ENTP. AB would be most fitting. *ccrriiinnggeee my god this is so familiar*

Not ENTP or ENFP. Most likely ESTJ, else ENTJ. 

Video typing would give the best results but as far as I can tell, you're Te dominant. Ultimately, you're a 16 year old edgelord who hasn't quite grown into themselves yet. Not saying that to be a dick, I was extremely similar. It's cool to be Machiavellian and ambitious, but there'll be some tempering (I hope, lest you end up a caricature). 

Not that you won't be successful, but I can offer a bit of first hand advice: Assuming you're not truly antisocial, those dark triad traits will very likely come back to haunt you in ways you won't predict. If you are an ENTJ, it'll send you reeling. 

time 2 introspect boizhave a lot of mental issues and trauma, on medication. 

I generally acted more like an INTP in behavior up until fairly recently, after a lot of medication and therapy. Still don't enjoy traditional socialization and I overindulge my Ne a lot to the point where I can entertain myself for ages. I use my environment and the internet to feed my extroversion

also, pretty gay and female LOL pretty much. 

I'm difficult to get riled up past the "wow this bitch" level, but the few times I'm severely upset i can get pretty creepyI like this idea, I think it's fun to read and write type portraits that don't always match the general. 

Side note, Mac is an ESFJ 

Hard INFP tbh. you write it very naturally and with a lot of conviction tbhInteresting that JT folks typed you as ENTJ, ESFP's activation type. He's ENTJ, definitely Se-Ni axis. I think that's exactly how I have them typed in my head. I could see a case for Frank being ENTP but I think ESTP is pretty fitting. Could also see an argument for Dee as ENFJ but I think both axes are correct. Yeh but I don't think he's te-si. Too disorderly, takes pride in being unusual and disgusting, no regard for social order and purposely enjoys disrupting it, lots of unusual plans that he abandons pretty quickly. 

One of the episodes where the gang all kind of splits off is due to Dennis accusing Frank of ruining them with his weirdness. 

Could see a case for ENTP imo, seeing as he never managed to get anything done, wild Ne ish appearance, that weird nostalgia where he tries to recreate the gangs misadventures with another group, etc. ENTP with Se subtype? Or just ESTP... 

Idk, seems all a bit too wild for an ESTJ.The actual definition of narcissist is:

an individual showing symptoms of or suffering from narcissism: such as

a : an extremely self-centered person who has an exaggerated sense of self-importance

b : a person who is overly concerned with his or her physical appearance

The standalone word doesn't necessitate a pathological origin or even the presence of a diagnosis at all. If someone is formally diagnosed, they have NPD. Untrue.GOD THIS ISNT ABOUT YOU UGH Oh I agree with that, so many infx types love to claim they're the victim of narcissists and sociopaths (bonus points for saying "I'm an empath and they feed on my energy!") 

But as an entp I have to take technical issue with narcissist meaning someone with NPD. I can't just sit there and not try to be technically correct...:DJust elated to see you back as always &lt;3crrrriiinnnngggeeeePretty much. Also, narcissist formations usually look like one parent as a narcissist, the other as a narcissistic supply, and children are either scapegoated or "golden". Golden child might eventually show narcissistic traits if not full blown pathological but still. 

A whole family of narcissists is just wild and reeks of snowflakeLOL I didn't even stop to think about that HAHAHAHA 

Technicalities are funny You win when you earn "ok"That was not a part of the definition Okay, but why. What annoys you about her? What do you two argue about? Nope, it's just a dictionary definition. I'm not typically fond of using them to make points because language is generally flexible, but I also get mildly irritated when someone says something blatantly incorrect soooo

It's kind of a square and rectangle thing, all people with NPD are narcissists by definition, but not all narcissists are pathologicalYeah, it's kind of the point of the show I think LOL. I think that's why I considered Ne for Frank too, due to how similar they are. Either way they're my two favorite characters ahaha. 

Side note I have no idea why someone would type Charlie as ISFJ, I've seen that around a lot and it really makes no sense. I don't even know how to respond to this No 

I took issue with OPs comments regarding it, I elaborate elsewhere in the thread Hmm... I'm not sure about Fe. While he enjoys status, he rarely cares about the comfort of others. To me it's more like Leslie Knope or Michael Scott, he's just a narcissist. P: i figured ENTJ. I agree with tert Se thoI know I'm an extrovert but goddamnBig dick small monkey How dare12Clearly you don't understand NeI do think Linda is ESFJ-Ne actually. I pegged Bob as ISTJ - as much as I love charges, he doesn't exert control over his environment as an ESTJ does. He is much more passive.

Tina as INFP and Louise as ENTJ seem correct. Gene... I'm not totally sure. ENTP maybe, or an FJ.I don't know if I'm still drunk or just not hungoverPretty much 

I can be graceful, especially if I'm not on the ground, but it's a concerted effortI am very happy with a few thousand pieces of my life and shit gets wild when you can be a complete artist to spit on de fake qween Yeah you're right, it's not just comfort of others. That falls under the Fe umbrella but isn't complete lmao sorry I think I was still drunk 

Even so I think Dennis uses people as a means to an end, a little more Te than Fe. He's kind of blind to his relationship with others and isn't really concerned about being anything but A GOLDEN GOD. He can't tell when he creeps people out, when he's being too much, and I don't recall many instances of him attempting to "measure" unless there's another objective (getting himself laid, carrying out a plan, etc) that he can use people for. 

He usually ends up blowing off the feelings and concerns of others, only cares if he's liked as long as it feeds into his own ego and image of himself (I read that as Fi), and I think he uses Te a lot in order to exert control on his environment and others. u do not kno de wae bruddaI love cringe, it's my favorite humor and I'm sure I've provided the same entertainment to others tbh. Ikr I just had a moment like this is one of my classes.

Oh I don't like those LOL. I enjoy more of the social folly cringe, I can relate to that way moreOther NTPs mostly, followed by NFPssuphiso much shitposting and memes

also, i notice a lot of people on the Si-Ne axis love tagging people Excuse me first of all how dare No, I said no hugs for youSomething about relating others to moments, other people, and memories idk Pretty much, I am the queen of tagging people in relevant items and groups

I probably need some higher aspirations but that's where we are May I make you an offering of food or a soft animal in order to woo you Oh yeah istps are also faves on mine romantically

Especially when they can shitpost as hard as meMay i offer you a semi opaque mineral as a courting giftYep! It's more of a loose guideline I use to help maintain consistency and flesh put potential relationships. I also have lists of other fictional influencers, moodboards and a playlist. Using a few different kinds of tools helps me make more well-rounded, realistic charactersHow about BOTH Oh man I'm the girl for you let's do itI'll pass on the opioids but motorcycles are cool afI'm with an intp and yep, exactly us. We're both perpetual kids so we try our best to clean as much as possible but I'll probably just hire a cleaner 

The most motivating thing to keep us organized is us decorating our living room to be a cyberpunk-themed 3d printing/gaming/digital art/cosplay studio so we have to keep things fairly organized

NTP confirmed ENTP 

Best friends: ENTP, INTP, they're a couple I see weekly. I work with an ISTJ who is quickly becoming a close friend as well. Boyfriend is an INTP. 

Good friends I like but rarely see: INTJ and ENFP childhood friend. An INFJ ex-coworker. INFP ex-roommate. 

Acquaintance group: Bfs friends, mostly ISTP, INTP, and a few FPs.

Enemy: Idk, I don't have enemies I keep up. Used to hate an ISTJ I worked with and messed with her a lot, I don't see her anymore though. 
Most of my friends are introvertedand closely clustered together. I have some ISFPs littered about but Se doms tend to be way too exhausting for me to keep up with personally.  

My mom is an ESFP tho and there's one friendly acquaintance I have who's an ESFP. They're pretty dope, we just don't share tons of interests.Long post:

I got tested for ADHD, I've got a pretty severe case and am low-functioning without medication. I have a few other attention-reducing disabilities though so fml. People who say you can just do it when you've got something physiological mean well, but aren't the greatest help imo. I don't know if you actually have ADHD but I hope this helps. 

The biggest coping mechanism was therapy and taking advantage of resources.  My university offered disability benefits like being able to get slideshows with notes from professors (to better follow along in class - before that, if I checked out of lecture for me than a couple minutes that was game over for the day), testing rooms outside of class (during or before exam dates) to reduce distractions, a tutor who specializes in helping students learn to keep schedules, identify motivations, and come up with strategies that used short-term rewards. If you're in school or planning to be, keep those in mind.

In people with focus issues, short-term rewards make it easier to get a task done because it's more difficult for us to be motivated my long-term goals. That was super helpful for me. So is learning to prioritize. 

Other tools: Digital alarms and calendars will be your friend as well. There are also extension blockers that can limit your time on non-goal related websites, and you can give the password to a friend. Using colored pens and color coded materials actually helps me focus on physical writing, digital note-taking is nearly impossible for me. 

Physical activity in the mornings DRASTICALLY improves focus later in the day, as long as you're sleeping and eating well. Anything that further energizes you will help you focus (exercise, sunlight, multivitamins, nutrition, sleep hygiene). It's similar to how stimulant medication works - a psychiatrist TLDR'd it as: focusing your brain takes energy, and if you don't have enough, you can't do it well. The excess energy you see in ADHD people isn't them being too energetic necessarily, it's them flailing around with too much energy to be tired, but not enough to use it productively. It's spillover basically. This is also why sometimes people with mild attention deficits become calmer abd more focused on coffee and other stimulating foods and drinks. They were below that threshold, and coffee bumped their energy levels up enough to help. 

If your deficits aren't super drastic, some adjustments to your diet and physical activity might be enough to help you make other habit changes. 

I would suggest ordering a few books made for people with ADHD and similar cognitive disabilities, and then see if you can either find a counselor or tutor who has experience dealing with these types of things. If you lack the money, ebooks and support groups can be a good substitute. 

Medication is also an option but I understand why some people are hesitant to use it due to side-effects, cost, addiction potential, etc. For people with severe deficits, it can be a life-changer. 

Just take responsibility for your shortcomings and work to address them. You might never quite match up to others in productivity, but you can still improve your own habits. 

Also, find something you love. It won't fix everything, but if you dislike what you're doing or find it boring, it's going to be infinitely harder. I understand that school coursework is a means to an end, but I would really consider if you're pursuing things you want to do or not. 

Try not to despair too much, people who struggle like this often end up internalizing a lot of shame over their inability to focus and accomplish. It's not healthy and can make things worse, bringing on low self-esteem and depression. Believe in yourself, remind yourself of things you've accomplished so far, and start working on a plan to accomplish more. Some have actual conditions that cause this, and there are treatments and tactics that are designed to fix these. Some people need a kick in the pants, some need to question their life choices, and some have physiological problems to address. Was an ad major, can agree LOL. I'm in STEM now and it's definitely tougher, but I'm also more passionate about it so it kind of balances out. I'd rather be challenged in something I love than float my way through something I'm ambivalent about. Okay, that's fair, maybe I have a different interpretation. 

Idk, if someone is about to literally fail out of high school and knows it, that suggests there's something a little deeper than just plain old lazy going on. Maybe ADHD, maybe some serious form of learned helplessness, maybe they just hate their school subjects, but that low of a drive to help oneself is alarming imo. It's probably a combination of those things, but OP is too young to be fucking themselves over like that. Pathology is mostly based on how heavily a deficit interfere's with one's life and ability to succeed, so that's why I'm wondering if it's not something pathological. 

That could be biased from my own perspective, but I guess a lot of the comments seem to be "just do it" or commiserating on how sucky school can be, lol. 

I feel for OP, I definitely was in that position when I was younger and I've managed to nearly kill myself a few times with my lack of attention and conscientousness hahaha.I think you're an ESFP! 

Extrovert is pretty clear even taking into account the MDD. 

Fi-Te seems pretty obvious to me. You sound stubborn, value freedom highly and live your life by it, invite others to GTFO and are more concerned with what aligns with your own values and how you feel about things. 

Se-Ni also is fitting. You struggle with possibility generation, and while theory is important and interesting, it's not interesting or a priority to you at all. Working physically with objects, refusing things that feel bad to you, and preferring action over musing all point towards higher Se. 

There are hints of Si in your post, mostly concerning the way you take care of yourself, but it seems more fitting as your 5th function rather than an auxiliary or your 7th (if you were an ENTJ, the other possibility). 

Lack of conscientousness and organization also point to P &gt; J. 

So yeah, ESFP. 

Edit: After a bit of discussion, ESTP is a possible fit as well. Still standing by Se-dominant though.Why ISTP? OP sounds extroverted. Despite the depression, he displays a need for interaction and contact, and almost never enjoys solitude (something that is completely unlike ISTPs). I mean, even that information in itself can be useful in determining type. 

Self-reported information is prone to corruption regardless, we may as well not even attempt text typing at that point. Even if OP didn't include what they think they are, their thought processes can still provide a lot of hints. It's why I enjoy seeing people's reasoning as to why they believe they are X or Y.It might be more helpful to highlight which S and N functions you identify with more. 

This is mainly because if you go by the function model, IxxP's intuitive and sensory functions are right next to each other (Ti-Ne-Si-Fe for INTP vs. Ti-Se-Ni-Fe) so sometimes usage can look or feel pretty even. It makes it harder to type with quantity than if you were either an ENTP or ESTP. 

Here's a bunch of questions that came into my head, feel free to answer them or not, but they could help illuminate a few spots. They aren't all S/N clearly, just things that, when taken as a whole, might sharpen things up: 

How does your intuition work, exactly? Can you describe your process, maybe with a few examples? Where is it oriented, exactly? Towards the future? Far or near? Towards the past? Present? How do you feel about it? Do you find intuition to be a fun (or annoying) distraction, or guiding in regards to the rest of your life? Are you more visionary or exploratory when you tune into it?

What about your sensing? Are you more in tune with your environment? You seem to value practical usage of ideas and plans. Do you see a need and fill it, or do you like to create and then find a use? How aware are you of your own needs and desires? How attentive are you, and it is more attention to yourself or to what's around you? How do you make sure you're comfortable (or do you at all?)? What kind of things excite you? 

How likely are you to judge by "makes sense to me" logic? How likely are you to verify facts, even if something makes sense? What do you like about programming? Do you have a preference between being accurate or precise? Do you know why?

What is it like when you feel overtaken by feeling, and can you name an example? What kind of stress triggers this? What pushes you to "go against logic" when you give into these feelings? Is it more important for you to honor those feelings, or to express them? How do you relate to other people and what are some of your relationships like? Fair enough. That reasoning isn't really something I would use, but it's one puzzle piece I suppose.My mother's an ESFP and sounds pretty similar to OP, on the flip side. Fi can be a bit of a crapshoot, seeing as a lot of what Fi users think and do is based on what they value. 

Se is also very pro-freedom, but because OP centers so much about their life, relationships, and personal values around freedom, I went with Fi as my guess. Te is also rather imposing even in its tertiary state (making others do), which added to my conclusion. 

It's possibly OP could also be an ESTP (though I find ESTPs to be more compromising and slightly less stubborn and Te-Fi to be more likely), although I still think they're introverted. I just get fixated on "holes", like what if your dad isn't ISTP (not saying he's not, just demonstrating the process)? What if I mistyped the ESFPs I know and I'm doing incorrect comparisons? What if..? 

Granted, that inevitably spirals down until I don't think I understand anything anymore for a while, so I guess we all have our methods. Blaming it on type is definitely an unhealthy way to cope with the idea of imminent failure. OP is young and feels he's out of options, so I can't really blame him for trying that. Accepting the idea that you've failed immensely in your life is really hard so while it's not a good way to deal, it's not unexpected. 

Your comment about reality is spot on, though. Sometimes you have to accept the consequences of your actions (or inactions, in this case). Just hope OP doesn't kill his opportunities so early. 

I hated high school more than anything, university was rough but more flexible. I think Se doms can be that way in general. I rank "most introverted extroverts" as Ne doms, then Se, then Te, then Fe. Fe is most typically social, but extroverted judging functions tend to want to exert upon others (making them more obvious), while Se and Ne are more about experiencing. 

Most of the ESTPs I've known are more socially reactionary than stubborn by default, ESFPs I've experienced are more agreeable until somebody imposes on them. Both are pretty "I do my own thing" though. ESFPs are dope. I'm not close friends with many but the few I've known well I really enjoy. My mother is open-minded, validating, sprightly, resilient, and adventurous. More Se-heavy imo. Had a manager who is also ESFP, more Te-influenced. Those people tend to be a combination of chill, yet also driven and focused internally, which I think is part of why they get such a "lol party and chill!!" stereotype. Most people only see the Se and "feeler", so naturally you're either crying or getting blackout drunk (or both). 

There are some really, really good ESFPs in fiction too (although they're usually typed as ENFPs or occasionally ExTJs). Overwatch alone I think has 3 of them, and each have a bit of a different subtype to them. Sounds about right. 

Just talked about this in another comment, but I rank extroverts as Ne-dom, Se-dom, Te-dom, and Fe-dom, from least to most socially extroverted.

Te-doms in particular are more likely to prioritize information and objectives rather than social interaction and harmony (unless social interaction helps them to achieve a particular goal, as you mentioned). ESTJs will seem more extroverted in the sense that they are externally motivated - likely to dole out advice and assistance to their friends, trying to "do" more, and generally want to have control over more domains than their ISTJ counterparts.

ESTJs will usually be more socially extroverted than ISTJs, but less so than Fe-doms and even some IxFJs, depending on the individual, their goals, and environment.Yep, you see it with ENTP girls vs. guys and Fe/Ti too. 

Mine are almost always introverts, mostly INTPs, ISTPs, and IxFPs. The extroverts are all Ne-doms. I have really, really low physical energy so I rarely leave the house lol. My dad's an ENTJ and stepmom is an ESTP... Se EVERYWHERE. Mom and stepfathers have been ESFP and 2 ISTPs, so maybe that's why I'm more cognizant of Se users. Moodboards for characters, just little collections of images and other digital knick-knacks that I pick up that I think relate to them, even tangentially. 

When I put all of it together, I like to see a person who could exist in real life, with consistent motivations, ideals, flaws, and skills. All of those details help me tie it together. RIP your brother, I know them feels. My brother is also an NTP, but he doesn't cope nearly as well.

Although one time my parents took us on a trip because I like rocks a lot and you could find tons of natural minerals there and I found a chunk of amethyst and that was cool as fuck. Fun times with Se crew. I think a lot of N types sort of expect that S types just can't understand them or anything like that and close themselves off. Ne doms in particular kind of struggle because we're trying to express kind of incomplete and/or unusual concepts. That's combined with lower Ti, which kind of acts like a bottleneck and I just end up sputtering random things. I kind of have to think out loud even if noone is around, so I ramble a lot, and a lot of what I'm trying to explain doesn't have a physically demonstrable counterpart.

So I either resort to analogies, talk about it to myself until I figure it out, or I find someone who's already explained it and use their phrasing to better convey myself. Hard to do without prior preparation, which in turn isn't really naturally compatible with Ne either. 

I talk in circles constantly, it's like a tub drain or something. It's frustrating because I have this vague idea that I do understand, but a lot of times I get put on the spot to actually explain it, so I have to kind of work backwards without much time to analyze it beforehand. I think I spend way more time "grab own face and make groaning noises" frustrated/annoyed than legitimately angry. I don't pay a lot of attention to what other people are doing unless it's interesting and I miss a lot of social implications. I get most upset when I can't understand something, when I can't remember something important, when I can't make someone understand me, or when I can't convey what I want to properly (as in, others could understand me if I knew how to verbalize something properly, but I can't get it to happen). 

Se and Fi users are both pretty good at helping me distract myself and cool down. My boyfriend is an INTP, so he usually tries to help me figure things out, but sometimes that just makes it worse. It's a train wreck to me. It might be where my Fe is situated, but it's right in that sweet spot where social cringe has me going internally like OH NOOOOOO STOPPPPPPP AHHHHHH out of horror/shock/relatability. But I also find absurdity and generally stupid shit to be funny as well, so the combination of those things makes me a sucker for cringe humor. You sound like my mother LOL. She always tells me to just not worry about it and it'll come to me later. I like to live my life on the spicy side It can vary by the individual obviously, but in general Ne doms don't really need the social interaction to feed their Ne, although some might prefer it. The few ENTPs I know usually mistake themselves for INTPs in particular. ENFPs have been similar ime except for one hella annoying one. Seems like you've run into c72 already, you can't really top that 

Vatimus, Aurarus, blackalyph, hularose_, pm_me_your_molars, shtzkrieg, chakke_ooch, FuckTheSooners, TK4442, and EarTipVortices are some of my favorite people to read from.   I'm primarily inattentive! I already saw a therapist so we just kind of tacked this onto other topics, but I think a lot of educational professionals should be able to help. 

We mostly talked about what I struggled with most, what j was able to do, try to figure out what made those things similar and different. Umm, we came up with lots of ideas to make some tasks easier, what kind of accommodations might help, etc. Because she's a PsyD, we also talked about internalizing shame, how it feels to fail, and how that made me give up more easily and kind of how to combat that (using affirmations to encourage myself, etc). 

It was a lot more work towards the beginning but after a while I was able to maintain myself and would sort of check in during our sessions or bring it up if I was struggling for some reason.Protect this wholesome content ENTPs... Unbridled curiosity and exploration, mostly. Being able to make all kinds of connections and constantly wondering about how the world works. We aren't the best at execution or consistency, but we excel at generating new ideas and solving puzzles in unconventional ways. I have two half siblings, one older and one younger. I'm ENTP, the younger is ENTP, the older one might be dead but I didn't know her personally i just have you tagged as funny guy who likes underwater stuff in my headi struggle with brainstorming on the spot. it's much easier if i get a topic or something i need ideas on, and then give myself a day or so to muse about itGuess that supports op furtherENTP f dating INTP m. 

Pretty much everything. DDLG, sadomasochism, shibari, roleplay, sensory deprivation... There's few areas we won't try. 

The childlike mostly shows up in our daily lives, we tend to prioritize having fun together and have had to learn to take turns being responsible for chores and bills and such. Or make them into fun activities. Or outsource. 

It's pretty much like two kids moved out and somehow nobody has caught us. Lots of blanket forts and video games.ENTP, but Ne dom lends itself well to creativity. 

I was a maladaptive daydreamer and for a long time I checked out of my day-to-day life in favor of imagining different worlds I could use in my art and writing. 

I roleplayed a lot with friends I met online, starting with shows and books that already existed, then moving on to expanding on universes I created earlier and adding our characters and working plots to them. I still write like this sometimes. 

I really shine when it comes to character creation, and that's what I enjoy most nowadays. Making characters that could be real, breathing people if I didn't know any better is my forte. 

I think the biggest difference I notice between myself and NFPs is that I'm more concerned over if my characters and worlds and plots all *work*. They don't have to be rooted in reality, but I will devote hours upon hours to making sure they're consistent and follow their own rules. Mirror ftwLet's go out&gt;Furiously slut dropping REPEATEDLY on a Wednesday night to the dulcet tones of a Naughty Boy remix remains my most embarrassing memory.

Also this sentence is a work of artvery socially awkward, usually just say things at weird times and cause a lot of uncomfortable silences. bring up things and ramble and then realize no one actually cares and then kind of peter off. i stick to really small groups or one on one interactions as a result. 

embracing the awkward has made it less awkward as a result, charisma has gone from like a 2 to like a 5 or 6 depending on audience. Depends how you roll stats. We just go 1-20, lol. In practice, I find ENTPs and INxJs get along decently. 

Fi is a function that changes drastically depending on the core value set of its user. This means certain subsets of Fi users will be practically off limits, while others we get along with very well.

Edit: You're also weirdly stuck on differing functions being the reason people do or don't like each other, and it's pretty stupid.Nah, a lot of ENTPs can spend that much time alone without realizing it. saw that, "aw darn"good botESTPs are generally going to be more aggressive - Ne offers a very childlike layer to ENTPs and they generally will come off as softer and more playful. Both types like to get reactions from people, but ENTPs are more likely to antagonize needlessly. 

Also, the "how do we make this work"? That's mostly just your Ti, lol. Not Ne or Se, those are more your "why do we make this work?" and the ideas to make it do so. 

Both are interested in understanding how things work, and the Ni of ESTPs can give them a philosophical bent (I'm pretty sure the author of House of Leaves is an ESTP, for example) as well. ESTPs will be more likely to explore and consider things as they relate to something realistic, something that can work. While ESTPs will think about things that are abstract, it often will have a real-world application as an end goal (i.e. the abstractness is a means to an end - if they realize something won't work, they'll probably just drop the project and move on). Not that they don't enjoy the pondering in the middle, just that it won't be worth the effort if there's no fruit.

ENTPs will enjoy things that are seen as pointless and have no practical use - they're some of the most impractical people around, and their love of science and theory can devolve into some serious flights of fancy. They're more likely to start imagining things that could never happen in the first place just because it's entertaining, while the ESTP would shake their head in amusement. 

You sound a little more ESTP to me, but that's just off this blurb.Fair enough. Socionics has subtype theory, but in general very few people don't have touches of other types here or there. 

I think Donald Trump is actually an ESFP, as far as I know. Seconding Vatimus, and I'll also add that Se-Ti is more direct and piercing, while Ne is more... maliciously playful and needling, if that makes sense. I don't necessarily need to communicate it. Just explore it. I do live with my partner now so I don't really get as much alone time p: You're trash gtfoNo one caresToo many and most probably aren't entp at allGot mine tested as a requirement for ADHD testing. 

Mensa is retardedThat test is shit

Gripping and looping aren't a thing 

Drinking habits don't have anything to do with type 

You both probably suck at typing Click edit, it's flair. This is unnecessary  Nothing I'm perfect Wow look at this humble brag!!!!!

There is literally no reason to be proud of being an ESFP and no, you aren't particularly philosophical or insightful. I definitely wouldPeople lead by judging by preestablishing parameters and filtering, generally. 

Sigh. One time an INTP ran away from me when I told him I liked him *that* way. He liked me too, but he was so embarrassed after he fled that he never brought it up again until like 9 years later. 

I usually end up teasing and prickling people I like. LOLENTP, ravenclawYeah, and over FB too Then I suppose you aren't a Ji dom... Cool, say that thenI CANT HEAR YOUMuch betterI would imagine because it's so recent, people are still grieving freshly over her, kind of a "she's not even in the ground" type situation. Maybe the stereotypical ISFP comment struck a couple nerves? 

Idk, I don't take issue with it personally but those are my ideas. ENTP and I get it so much, lol. There's a few ideas that ASMR may be a more common type of synesthesia. It seems to be an unpopular opinion, but I agree. Si is primarily experience-based so I think certain people have potential to become very wise, but a lot of people like to assign N qualities to S to combat bias and it's kind of lowkey shading sensing qualities anyway. INFP on first read, actually. I'm not sure if "symbolism" keyed a lot of people into Ni but I don't see much Fe.INFJs aren't real.I again, not ENFP?Fair, didn't see that You had enfp flair for a while, unsure if joke or temporary type changeI'm ENTP, and my guy is INTP. ENTP... Prof David Malan from Harvard's CS50 is a really good example.WtfRomantic fantasies usually end up being about me and a potential interest working on an interesting project together, with focus on them coming up with brilliant ideas and stuff. My relationship is pretty close to that now.I'm pretty sure he's an SP, actually, from what I've seen in his posts. 

Granted, I know some Ne doms who do and say some stupid shit, but there's different flavors. Can we not go full Lastrevio? Also socionics stuff would be better off at /r/JungianTypologySocionics is still another beast entirely and it's extra confusing for people here. At the very least, you should make a note that you're using whichever socionics model you're using. Otherwise, people won't be able to contribute very well here or know what you're talking about.Sure you are budYes you may Hole in a hole in a hole in a whole hole There really isn't any. It all falls under socionics, there's not a lot of proof to any of it. It doesn't mean it doesn't make sense, or that it can't be useful. The benefit and the bane of Socionics is that it's rather new and always evolving - fantastic if you want to see new ideas be vindicated or demolished, but not so much if you want a stable, easy to reference system. It's funny because the other ENTP-C I know is pretty much the male version of me. I relate to most other ENTPs, but going by there dichotomies, he would be the only creative-Ne subtype and it's kind of wild how similar we are. 

Will always laugh at him building the exact same D&amp;D character as me but separately. OkI sit in the corner, back to the wall, generally try to make sure I don't interact with anyone. Bonus if there's a door within easy access. Don't trust it. He probably does like you, but you're on the backburner. Actually INTPs can shine in sales, but not car sales LOL. I know one who did B2B tech sales and was very successful. I think he's a consultant now, though. I personally wouldn't enjoy hospice nursing, but the medical field was a big interest of mine. 

Worst job I ever had was working in B2B corporate marketing. The only consistently good part was the occasional trade show cause Vegas was fun af. But office environments are petty and uncomfortable, I had to be there at fuckin 8am consistently, and the work was skullcrushingly boring. I started being late just because I had to sit in the parking lot and work up the nerve to go in.

I actually really enjoyed it when most of my job was optimizing all of the old systems (which were hella messy and inefficient) and changing the way they did everything in my little sector. Once there was nothing left to fix after about two months, it went quickly downhill. 

However, coaching (rowing, specifically) was tiring but fun and rewarding. I thought istjs are robots who all love to make calls, be receptionists, and input data!I enjoyed my office job when I was fixing up the way they do things. But when I run out of things to optimize I just get depressed. Middle and high school rowing. I ran a lot of introductory camps and coached novice for about a year. It's fun to get them excited and rowing. Also, it's hilarious to make their boats flip. Nope. It's fun to impress once in a while but I don't really care. Climbing Overwatch ranked has been cool but I think that's the most competitive I get. 

I have way more fun tilting other players and fucking with people in chat. Oh, most of these people were actually fairly serious, as much as you can be for that age. Rowing is an expensive and niche sport, so the kids were pretty excited to learn. The hardest ones to deal with were the hyperactive ones who would get distracted/distract others. I had quite a few who went onto competitive teams - a lot of then had parents or siblings who also competed. I agree with most of it. I have decent self awareness but that's very practiced. ENTPs are weenies though, if we are seriously considering retaliation it's rarely in person/direct/physical. 

Side note: While the "ENTPs won't get anything done, neener-neener!" thing sounds good... most of us will enjoy our fantasies. We aren't driven by action and accomplishment like other types, so "getting shit done" isn't really fulfilling. Kind of a weird way to tout your superiority. Exactly. With a good product or service they would use themselves, INTPs never seem gimmicky or false and come off as both knowledgeable and trustworthy.Too much work. I don't have the focus or ambition required, it doesn't do a lot for me. You said the word "gentleman" so often that I'm having serious syntactical saturation. Like, "gentleman" just can't be a word after this. Wtf y. This is wild. i forgot i posted thiscapitalization sucksi will trash anyoneIxxP, ENxPs to an extent. not yet Me afOw Fi&gt; you were familiar but not too familiar with new ideas 

this is my go-to description for the inferior function nowLOLyou know, i won't remember to pay my electricity bill until my power is shut off. i won't remember important school deadlines, nor will i remember to file my taxes or eat food regularly. but now i will always remember that hsnjllfrqi likes to be dominated. it's one of those things you just don't ever really forget. You're clearly an ISFJ. 

You acknowledge having memories, which is an Si thing to do. You also can remember your past and mention having one, which is also super Si. If you were an Ne dom or Ni dom, you wouldn't be able to remember anything and your life would more closely resemble the protagonist from 50 First Dates. 

Now, you don't cry a lot like ISFJs do, but you're also a guy and socialization could definitely affect that. Do you cry a lot when you aren't on camera? Did you cry directly before or after filming this? 

Definitely ISFJ. 

this is legendaryit's like this one time when i was in kindergarten and i knew this girl named ellery. she was the line leader and i was pretty upset about it so i called her ellery celery and she cried and that always stuck with me for some reason. who the fuck even cries over that? i know, right? I'm mad about that again nowim definitely an attention ho but i'm also a creepestpThat was one of my first messages to you, I think! :D I was curious if it was an ennea reference. @.@ 

3 and 7 for third, interesting. 

My top are 7 by far, followed by 8 and then 5 i think.That's like me and INTP bf finding balisongs in random places.you seem to have a bone to pick with usI think the friend-related flaws i see in myself and the two others entps i know is that we're flighty, a lil self-centered, usually late, rude (sometimes unintentionally, sometimes not), forgetful, interrupt-y, inconsiderate, and generally very annoying. 

However, all of us are respectful of personal information, apologize when we're wrong (pretty quickly tbh), thoughtful with our gifts and gestures, try to cheer others up or bitch with them, and aren't ass-kissers. I can't imagine doing many of those things to someone i claimed to care about

sounds like a shitty person in general, i wouldn't say that's the average experience with ENTPs. I REMEMBERED SOMETHINGGGGGGGLmfaoYou should probably just ditch him tbh. Also, you sound hella judgmental. Ikr? I was interested until like 1/3 of the way through and then I was just like wtf I am familiar but not too familiar with basic physical needsNot all conspiracies are interesting WE ARE FIGHTING DREAMERSFemale entp. Intps, infps enfps, entps, istjs 

There are gender differences thoEntp girls dope too

IxTPs are cute af thoI like socionics. It can be very wrong, but it also can admit it's wrong and it's just... kind of a living system, there's always new information and ideas and systems being updated. I like that. I enjoy MBTI, socionics, Greek temperaments, enneagram, whatever. I think Socionics is becoming a favorite, although more grains of salt are needed. that all sounds more Fi-Te anyway LOLIxTPs are far more robotic imoDictator: NTJ, prolly E. 

Revolutionary: NFJ, prolly I

Opportunist: ESTP, potentially ESFP. Definitely Se dom.

Student: I think ISTJ ... possibly INTP? TJs can be rather ferocious, FPs fiery. TPs definitely get some creepy anger going on. FJs can hold a grudge like no other.Idk my man I can talk some MAD SHIT. Shut up esfpNE NE NE NE 

Being creative, optimistic, bouncy af, generally don't gaf. Lot of ennea 7 too Nah you're really demanding and obnoxious about it so not worth my energy Parties.... ehhhh. Pass 9/10 of the time. Unless it's a LAN party This is roughCry me a river LMFAO Also you realize I comment on mobile at work right? shit comes up and a polite PM is a better follow upSchool record in 8th grade for AR points BOIZsorry you're so low priority bud good luck with ur typing You pretty much got the same typings as me across the board, damn. Mac is ESFJ afENTP. Active on Instagram, FB, and Reddit. Instagram cause I run a page for my art, so I post once a week or so there. 

FB because tag groups (seriously, groups make that place so fun) and shitposting. I share things a couple times a day and have a few people I tag regularly. Reddit ... I'm only really chatty here and on some Overwatch subs, I lurk elsewhere. Mostly watercolor and digital illustrations. I do commissions and a lot of them and up being OCs or DnD characters for others. Lots of sketching too, some portraits. I do not like having to go outside unless I'm going to soak up some rayz aloneEstp*80's porn jamz*I don't know what this is or how you found it, but i LOVE ITWow you got pissy over something I never said LOL. i post openly about my drug use

for /u/fuckmylife112 

ESTPs generally have noticeably more charisma and that "see through people" business is pretty Se-Ni. More immediately useful people skills. Ne's lack of presence and forcefulness kind of mutes some of those traits. 

Also this is more anecdotal, but the STPs I know in general tend to have a philosophical bent - always sharing the latest books they've read and how they apply that to their lives and mindsets. Really abstract concepts distilled into pragmatic application. Not that NTPs can't be interested, but it's more rare for me to find ENTPs with a steady passion for it.

In general OP sounds much sharper and more present/forceful than most Ne doms I've known. Ne doms have a more childlike nature. While they can be lil bitches, they have a dreamier feel, as Ne is more concerned with intangibles and how ideas and concepts are all connected. Feelin INFP, maybe ISTJ?

I don't think you're Fe-Ti, or Se-Ni, or Ne dom. I mean i don't think so either lol, I was eliminating types out loud

Like I said, istj or infp check em out? Especially if you come off as rather strict. ISTJs got some stronk FiDisorders are essentially traits that are magnified enough to interfere with someone's livelihood and well-being. 

Most Ne doms who don't have clinical ADHD will probably still get asked if they have it, and be relatively inattentive/easily distracted compared to the general population. Se too. 

I have severe ADHD so I can't personally attest. Okay... but if you remove those constraints, would you still struggle? That's part of the issue with diagnostics in psychiatry and psychology, they're entirely based on society. Maybe someone does or doesn't have issues based on societal customs. Many other do regardless of what type of culture they live in, via neurology and all. 

If it seems borderline or is controllable via adjusting habits, I think the diagnosis is less important. 

Point is, some people will display those traits to where they don't function much at all, and others will display them in a more muted manner. It's a spectrum, I'm sure there are Pe doms who aren't nearly as scattered as others. a) pretty sure you're entp not intp

b) you okay my dude?no one believed me 

nobody

but i knew you have a nice voicewhat if i can't leave bed? then what do i dostill sucks my dude. anxiety can cause tons of physical symptoms for sure. 

edit: also, depression, SAD and dysthymia all manifest in different ways, especially in men. not just sadness, but emptiness, anger, etc can also be ways it shows up. either way, some self-searching might be useful if you don't feel like it's a big enough issue to pursue further. NTPs typically have a poor relationship with Fi so it could help really trying to figure out how you feel about certain aspects of your life (or your past or your future), assessing how changeable they are, why they make you feel the way you do, making switches to your routine. 

i hope you feel better my dude. I was less sure but ye

maybe im biased because Ne dom but usually it seems kinda obvious between ISTP/IxFP/ENTP shitposters...depends. I like to take the wind out of people's sails sometimes, but it's not really dedicated. very mood-based, fleeting, and i forget about it quickly unless it's something SUPER hilarious. people underestimate how divisive and trollish Fi users can be, lolfun, mostly. 

granted, i do think it's useful for interpersonal relationships and self-study, but i stick around because it's the equivalent of a mental rubik's cube. it's a fun little sandbox i can play around in when i'm bored. It's usually unintentional I just forget what I'm doing after I do or say it Aww....Oh I meant literally. 

Still so cozy INTPMostly crippling depression but I can make your interpretation work wait you swapped omgI SEE YOUi can dig it honestly. tones and pitch can vary based on other factors, but i think those attributes can be useful when taken into consideration with other evidence. 

Ne-Ti certainly fits
samei just forget sometimes, if someone reminds me i'll talk. but then it's a "if you liked me that much you wouldn't forget!" but like fam... yeah i would and i will. Yeah... still don't like ISFJs all that much. I'm sure they're nice enough. 

I'll pull for Se tho. still have to remember you're not an old man ENTP - SCUEI, primary type unstructured

excuse me, you could have just @ me instead of calling me out like this

i can usually admit when i fuck up tho and i'm lower energy overall, but most of it is accurate.
Mine is mostly audio. Sort of a neutral, robotic feminine voice that isn't my own. It's pretty quiet and doesn't change pitch or volume much. 

It actually sounds similar to Overwatch's Athena, although with less of an overt accent.

[athena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaewracckIg)

I do get intrusive thoughts but those happen in pictures (i.e. drive your car off a bridge, hit someone with a brick). When I think in images it's very foggy and unfocused - sharp enough to where I know what's going on and who is who, but it's not very clear. That's usually if I start fantasizing, which I do a lot. I've noticed since dropping acid a couple of times that images tend to bleed into each other a little more than before, but I don't mind it. 

Audio monologue is more for reading, trying to work things out in my head, etc. It doesn't really shut up ever, but that doesn't mean I pay attention. Visual is more for creative works and they don't layer over each other much. goodness graciousme too except unstructuredOh my subtype thing was unstructured, my conscientousness is like 14% or something lmaowow i had no idea thank you their entire life isi can't tell if you're trying to be rude or whatLOL if only...Current relationship is non-monogamous, but I've never cheated nor felt the need to. Monogamy isn't difficult for me and it's how I've operated prior. 

If I'm in a closed relationship with someone, I just don't really notice others and the idea of them isn't attractive. Either way I stay honest. Anything less isn't worth it. I've gotten cheated on a few times tho lmaoonly party im goin to is a LAN partyI've always wondered why it's difficult for people to restrain themselves, lol. By the time I would start looking around, I'm already assessing my current relationship and whether I should cut my losses or put in more energy to repair it. Both happen. 

Perhaps I could have said "by the time I would start noticing others". ENTP: Coraline and Howl's Moving Castle are two of my favorite movies. Also, Hush is a pretty cool horror movie. Oh, and Akira is wonderful. 

Westworld is one of my favorite TV shows and I think a lot of NTPs would enjoy it. I also really liked Fullmetal Alchemist and Stein's Gate. I'm pretty psyched to watch Altered Carbon. 

Tbh it's mostly animated works and sci-fi. Internally there's no off switch. Externally, I wish I had more energy to socialize. Yeah, I think so. Depending on iteration, Major is ISTP/INTJ I think. But I enjoyed it (more recent movie not so much but it's super pretty). Same here!I help my estp bud and it works well. Mix of gender and type, I assume 



-ENTP girlthis was a wild fucking ride mateI'm either an 8 or a 2, there is no in-betweenI can't tell sometimes. I have flashes of brilliance and other times I'm fucking retarded; it's kind of a coin toss depending on the subject and my interest level. RIP. 

Things where I feel like a 7-8: Learning new skills and concepts (I pick things up quickly), finding patterns, symbolism, solving puzzles, languages, knowing a little about a lot of things, sciencey/medical shit, resoucefulness.

Me being a 2: General self-awareness (physical and mental), memory, trying to teach concepts, forming concise arguments, communication, math, philosophy, general lack of common sense, strategy and long-term planning. 

So 5?I can probably contest that most unreliable thing...Ikr? I get along with guys better and share more mutual interests. Most my friends are IxTP guys, a few FPs in there. I'm not heterosexual and most of them are bisexual to some extent, that could have something to do with it. Some of that pressure is probably diluted. I definitely fit into that weird group better than anywhere else, lol. IP misfit crew.Kind of sad to think that some people can't view the opposite gender as merely friends. Gaming, D&amp;D, MtG, etc. Overrun with dudes. I've joined a few online groups with lots of women so that's fun. I definitely want to make more female friends but that's where I'm at.THAT'S why... yeah... I'm using that excuse.Full of people who don't know how to have meaningful platonic relationships. I'm aware, it doesn't mean i have to like itYour view is still pretty sad. Not uncommon, but sad. This guy is wild, lol. I'm sure your friends are your friends. Some people just don't know how to form close friendships without having feelings, but thankfully others can. IxTPs can be emotionally stunted and unaware, especially the men, so I'm sure there's plenty to unpack there.No, lol. I think it's fairly common for straight men in general to do this, especially younger men and T types. But I know a good amount of TP men, including INTP men, where this isn't true. 

Maybe your statement is true in a certain age group, I wouldn't have numbers for that. 

The biggest differentiating factors between IxTPs like you and others I've met who don't share this struggle is intimate friendships, especially with other men, and bisexuality (even if they're mostly into women). 

I suspect both of these factors come into play. Learning to form and maintain close and emotionally honest friendships is useful for anybody. Look at the difference in emotional intimacy between groups of women and men - men often lag, even if they're close. I also would imagine bisexuality means learning to navigate the "friend or attraction?" minefield much earlier on. 

It also just might be maturity. Maybe IxTx types have more trouble with this due to lower emotional literacy and adhering closer to gender roles? If you aren't forced to learn these things, it's understandable why you think others feel that way. 

Ultimately, this view hurts you more than anybody else. I just think it's both interesting and sad.

I rarely namecall online but you're an idiot LOL. Please learn how to read because I didn't say anything you think I did.

I said that those who are bisexual often have to navigate the "friendship or attraction" question on both sides early on, therefore IxTPs who are like this this seem less likely to think like you. 

I was actually making the assumption that you're heterosexual and somewhat conservative, because of the troubles you've described. I was pointing out different scenarios that could lead to different mindset in the same/similar types. 

Please, please work on your reading comprehension. You desperately need it. We don't, you dope. I never said my view is more objective, I merely listed out scenarios that I've noticed and patterns I've seen. I'm merely thinking out loud. 

I never said majority. I said it's not uncommon, but I also don't think it's the majority. There's no way for you to know, just as theres no way for me to prove my point. My god, the level of sheer idiocy took me aback. How does one read pretty much the opposite into what I said? MUH CONVERVATISM I MUST DEFEND when I didn't attack it in the first place. 
 
I thought the same thing - romance and sex objects first, he doesn't think we're people. Guys like this think it doesn't show but it reeks. 

Fucking yikes LOLDo you think that's what women talk about all day? You've got a caricature of women in your head, no wonder you don't see them as fellow humans to relate to. I can't see how women would want anything more than a shallow conversation with you in the first place. LOLOL 

Others seem to understand me just fine, remember the whole "majority is the most objective measure"? Or is that not true? 

Also, INTPs value precision and information over efficiency. Reevaluate your type and maybe like, your entire sense of self. There are many, many more things that preclude women from being your friends, and it's not games HAHAHAHA I think we're the only two intuitives that answered &lt;6, lol. I thought ISxJ of some kind too tbh. OP seems incapable of reasonable analysis and wouldn't know what nuance means if it worked itself up his asshole. 

The INTP guys who are interested in women that I know are usually that mix of "I have better things to do" and "haha what?" Obliviousness/apathy. 

I like how quick he is to assert himself as a straight conservative, lol. Oh lordy.No, you don't. Neither do we. Let's just get that out of the way, lolI thought the term was "asocial". I share the same irritation regardless thoOh okie, didn't know it was also a word. Dope.May want to look into the SFJs too. Same 4 functions as entp, diff order.Weird, I get along with almost every intp I've known, I'm dating one atm. The ENTPs I know are pretty chill/are more of the "accidental jerk" type rather the the usual edgelords. TP cuddle puddle pleaseLMAOOOOOOOI don't really care for rules much, someone getting dictator-y or pushy authorities me the urge to spite them for the sake of it. 

In general "static" rules I don't mind, although if what I want conflicts I'll find a way to justify myself or figure something else out. It just needs to make sense. It's a coin toss whether I'm high or not at any given moment, a little helps constant anxiety and nausea. 

I'm usually just more zoned out and laugh really fucking hard at everything. My threshold for humor is already low but weed makes it nonexistent. 

Agreed, I can prattle on forever. 

Introverts have an easier time with me when they realize I don't need a captive audience and they can tune me out. You could have just tagged me if you were gonna call me out like that 

Most recent one at work (kitchen line with ticket stabbers): "Have you guys ever thought that it's a good thing inanimate objects are just that? Imagine being sentient ticket paper and your entire life is just sitting in a box and getting stabbed through the middle."

The INFP liked it, at least...You'd be surprised how soft NTPs can be. All bark, no bite. STPs are the real badasses.he's my oxygenI do love bitching. My bf just tunes in on occasion, lol. I'm basically a moderately interesting radio channel. I'm into more niche sports but he can! Mostly I talk about art or writing or DnD or have conversations with myself about stuff. Nerd shit loli plan to start streaming so we'll see if others agree lolI'm pretty obsessed with Overwatch but I'm not usually into FPS games. 

My other favorites... Pokemon games, Jackbox.tv, Smash, Mystic Messenger, Guild Wars 2, Skyrim, Simulacra, Little Nightmares, Silent Hill series, Fatal Frame series, Hotline Miami. And retro stuff like Mappy and Xevious. 

Also, Dance Dance Revolution is my shit. 

So I guess party games, puzzles, simulations, RPG and horror. And any combination thereof. That's what happened to me with marketing, lol. I'm back in school for CS but I'll probably just do art anyway Like its about to be a dope ass time friend ISTP is a popular typing as well for him, but I don't know him well enough to agree or not. A couple people have said ISFJ but idk, again. I'm into tons of crafting and art stuff - painting, cobbling together electronics and furniture (working with an ISTP to build a digital D&amp;D table), soaps and related cosmetics, and cosplay (lots of construction, 3D printing, sewing, painting, etc.). INTP bf does too. 

I will say I know ENFPs who are artistic and cross the line into crafting with cosplay and with their nerd hobbies. Ne is phenomenal with creativity. Lots of ideas and interpretations of pretty much anything. It's also a resourceful function, good for problem solving. 

A lot of Ne doms can be forgetful, flaky, impulsive, lack attention to detail, and self-absorbed. Not all or all of these but it applies to me. I don't know any heterosexual ENFP dudes. No joke. The closest still has a thing for my boyfriend. 

They do know how to operate one though. Or at minimum can hand sew. Little Nightmares (puzzles AND horror! Limbo is good too in that vein), SH2 specifically (I love the score too!), Fatal Frame 2, We Happy Few, Neverending Nightmares, and Among the Sleep. Because joking is fun and distractions can be as enlightening as remaining on-topic. (These are just various people I'm piled in the car with atm, not just me) 

1. Sometimes I do rhyme challenges where I see a word and I think up as many rhyming words as I can rapid-fire. It's like a brain exercise kind of, just soothing to keep busy since I can't stay idle. 

2. When I get really, really drunk I stop being so reserved and analytical, and instead wander around yelling hi and waving at people like a 3 year old. 

3. I don't like having to boss people around, but I find that if I don't step in and dole out instructions, nothing will ever get done. 

4. I don't understand the point of folding and packing things neatly. I'll take care of technology and hobby stuff, but clothes are more about cushioning all of that - I just ball them up and stuff them in the bag. Makes the bag a good pillow, too. Who cares if stuff gets wrinkled? If that's what you think, you're missing out on a lot of information. Ever also watched TV logos bounce around and predict when they'll hit the corner? And fresh information is the turkey baster!Pretty close to their actual types tbh.

First is ENTP and ENFP (same habit, I think Ne just likes it a lot), second is INTP (I can't tell if he's hungover or still drunk), third is ISTJ, fourth is ENTP. 

Poor ISTJ. I could see a lot of P types doing that, lol. Vulnerable Fi tho so can't relate to Fi-Ni tunnel vision. Are you an ISFP? 

My parents reamed me constantly for not folding. PILLOWBAG3000 WILL NEVER FALTER. 

I've gotten even better - now I mostly only wear non-wrinkling clothes. pish poshLmfaoWe are all INTJs on this blessed dayAnd the entire post is now a paid social advertisement for Soylent. 

My microwave has never really had an odor to it honestly... like wtf. 

(OP is quite sensitive from what I can tell of their history)even if you did I think it's kinda funny. Gross but lmaoAre you INTJ specifically? Dope thanksI should start learning, my partner is Filipino (and INTP) and neither of us speak a lick of it, lol. He was born in Manila, his entire family is fluent. Southeast Asian or Pacific Islander, depending on who you ask iirc. US census says one thing and a lot of Filipino-Americans may identify as one, the other, or both. Dunno about Filipianos elsewhere. wow this is so original ive never seen anything like this beforeyou still got a bit of work to do there friendIstjs and intps actually often work wonderfully together. The Ne-Si separation gap isn't so large, both are IT types (similar emotional expression and energy levels) and good complementary T/F axis. 

Istjs are dopebisexual and entp, dating a bisexual intp I think you'll find trends but there are always exceptions. A lot of ENTPs seem to be rather libertarian ("leave me alone, dont police me!"), maybe a bit economically conservative, but I'm pretty leftist. A lot of NFPs are leftist as well but you'll occasionally find them on the conservative side as well SAME

My normal interested mode (detached interest, viewing other person as a study subject) seems flirty because I'm engaged but not nervous because I'm not flirting? 

Trying to flirt? Nope lol. I usually just kinda go WANT DATE?? and see what happens I put mine in too. It's come up a few times with some interesting conversations but nothing more; if someone uses it to swipe left then it's probably for the best, lol. Most of my friendly acquaintances are NTP, ISxP, ENFP, and an ISTJ. If we hang, we usually play video games, play D&amp;D, or work on art/crafting and cosplay projects. Fair question! I have plenty of issues and one side effect is that I have trouble bonding with others. A lot of the people I see I wouldn't necessarily consider friends, maybe one or two of them at most. I also have a high threshold for who I trust enough to consider my friend - people I like but dont necessarily feel close to are still filled under acquaintance through no fault of their own. 

D&amp;D has been the most voluntary socializing I've had in years, lol. I work at my own pace. I chose it purposely.INFPs are delta, though. Beta is STP/NFJ.You've got to notate it as such, INFp. Otherwise you're posting in the MBTI sub, so people will assume you've converted it already. I'm snuggly as fuck Socionics uses a different notation. The introverted types pretty much switch the final letter, with the socionics notation looking like XXXx.

INTP = INTj = TiNe

INTJ = INTp = NiTe

ENTP = ENTP = NeTiFWIW you dont sound very Ne dom imo, although its much easier to type over a video. I agree with the others saying Se dom. Not exactly, no, that's just a rough translation given the functions they claim to use. Socionics and MBTI are different beasts, especially once you start factoring in Reinin dichotomies and small groups. I don't think it's *totally* accurate. After all, type is more about processing and decision-making and not as much behavior, so it really sometimes requires a mixture of outside opinion and honest introspection. 

I just think it's more accurate than text, because not only are you getting their thoughts, but you're getting them combined with tone and mannerisms, posture, and all these other little nuances that can sometimes help pinpoint type easier. If you do decide to make a video, the people at /r/jungiantypology will be happy to help. Do be warned, most are into socionics there, so it'll be a bit different, but it's valuable input regardless imo. so wholesomeWe've got a mystery to solve, gang!I got INTP, then ENTP, which is pretty typical for most MBTI tests. ISTP and ENTP are actually pretty common mistypes, especially since I dont see a lot of Ne questions that couldn't also be Se.I think there arent many Ne questions that couldn't also be tied to SeMight just be N and S not being well clarified, a lot of people are ending up with ISTP. Kind of shitty otherwise so I might as well have fun, since I dont believe in higher power or anything beyond. If I cant make it good for myself, then what on earth am I doing? 
 I think ISFPs have a more "mystical", spiritual bent from their Ni that makes them appear more intuitive than ISTPs, who have a reputation for being very pragmatic (although I find many of them are interested in philosiphy). I said "appear" more, if you'll reread my comment.  

Combined with Fi and inferior Te, the ISFP often is more spiritual and artistic, which can be mistaken for intuition.  Higher Ti is what makes the ISTP seem more pragmatic and grounded with similar Ni. Ti doms are naturally more skeptical and tend to throttle their N a little more than their F counterparts. 

That's also why I pointed out that a lot of ISTPs are into philosophy (usually as they can apply to their own lives), their Ni just is a little more subtle and less "woo" due to the rest of their stack. None of these are hard and fast rules, just trends. I wanna listen nowIf it weren't such a pain I'd suggest custom items for people to go fuck themselves with, if only for the humor. "Stick? Where? Eh... nvm I dont care that much"ENTP is spot on. Nothing better to do than worrying about tree-related classifications. I'm an arborist now. :c I just want to know about sticks my dudeI always dig the STP people, although a lot of your ENTP experience sounds like other STPs, lol. The biggest annoyance ENTPs offer to their ESTP buds is childishness and pointlessness, rather than as much sleaze or misused charisma.

ETA: The part on prattling about our interests is spot on, though. Can't agree there. I struggle with choosing a direction and consistency. -7, -6.5There's no reason you couldn't do it. MBTI type has little bearing on the jobs you can do. There may be trends on where you may excel or careers your type may enjoy more, but it's ultimately your choice. Milotic, Rotom (I think rotom is ENTP lol), Gardevoir, Flygon, Alolan Raichu, Chinchou, Suicune, Drifloon, Chandelure, Ampharos. 

I like sleek pokemon, especially if they're water, electric, ghost, or psychic. Occasionally ice. I love Chandelure. For INTPs a few candidates might be Kadabra, Porygon, Castform, or even Psyduck... generally Pokemon who are intelligent/surprisingly capable but also sleepy/lazy. 

Wait, I found it! Uxie! It keeps its eyes closed and is considered the bringer of knowledge - when it flew, it supposedly gave humans the intelligence necessary to solve problems and improve their quality of life.Schizotypal? Any match there!This this thisssss. 

Mine has settled into a 7w8 but yeah.ENTP, majored in Advertising, minors in Russian and French, second degree in compsci, certificate in IT, also an artist. I hate the "F types are the artists" stereotype lol. 

OP is probably ENTP, between the two. I'm a female entp too, between both options you sound more Ti than Fi Maybe not visual but the ENTPs I know are all in creative fields or have creative hobbies. All the NTPs I know actually, and the one INTJ is a visual artist as well. Put your face in the bowlEsfpNot Ne confirmed Much better way to organize temperaments and energy levels. I think they are based on or happen to correspond to Greek temperaments (phlegmatic, sanguine, etc) 
Duality is supposedly the ideal in socionics (ISFP-INTJ, ISFJ-ENTP, etc.). I forgot who, but some MBTI person recommends "flip all the letters except S/N" as an ideal. 

I think people's attractions are based on tons of factors: who they grew up around, the relationships they've witnessed, what they value, and the things they lack personally, amongst other factors. I'm an ENTP and I'm attracted to other high Ne users; my life history pushes me to find those who are similar to myself. 

I think it depends on where you are in your personal development, too. I think as people get older, the sensing and intuition functions start to blend together a little more as they even out (assuming a generally healthy life progression) and the S/N divide becomes more manageable. The differences seem more stark in adolescence and young adulthood, tbh. 

Your attractions may end up changing, or they may not, and the same goes for others. incredibly true, i've never found a higher concentration of Ne than at conventions. most of my NP friends are all artists and cosplayers, lol i like this answeri'm nosy, so invisibility would be fun. 

i would like to have a photographic memory so i could remember the things i see; i have a condition that makes remembering more difficult so it would be nice to paint things i've seen. 

also, flightI have no clue, I only know a couple high Ni users. One is into businessy stuff, the other does research and teaching. They're both still pretty nerdy, they just arent dress up types. Characters are generally prone to inconsistency because of actor influence, plus having multiple writers and executives. 

Ben is ISTJ, even though he is often typed as INTP and INTJ.I'd have to go back and pinpoint specific moments. I know inferior Ne tends to spiral out in times of stress, which is seen a few times (like with the kids and the spreadsheets he made, lol, or the weird ass video thing when he was unemployed). It pops out when he makes rash decisions that he usually regrets at first, since he typically looks for stability. 

I'm pretty sure that a love of facts and numbers at Ben's level of enthusiasm points to Te. Cones of Dunshire is also pretty Si-Te (strict, closed world, incredible amounts of detail) rather than open-ended/sandbox style (Ti-Ne).

Can't remember anything else off the top of my head lol. Leeching the other partner of their emotional energy, fights caused by defensiveness or sensitivity, pedastaling people you see as important, clinginess, dependence, or possibly ending up in a toxic or abusive relationship. 

If somebody is fine doing all of that emotional labor for you, theres probably something wrong with them as well. 

Source: Dating an INTP guy who used to be (and still is to a degree) similar. It's life-draining to deal with the constant need for validation, plus the defensiveness that comes with it.I don't think you're INTP, for one. Also, ADD falls under the diagnosis of ADHD.

ADHD can affect type presentation. It's very possible he's ISTJ - ADHD can look like emphasized Ne/Se functions. That would also account for introversion, the lack of off-the-cuff joking, and higher decisiveness. stop lying you esfj weenieENTP, texting by far (although I have auditory processing issues so that plays in). I tell people to only call me if somebody is hurt or it's something else critical, lol. I much prefer to type, I don't miss or forget things. im esfpSounds like a Taylor Swift song gone terribly wrong tbh. I'm into it, condoms are for L O S E R S, every football star has a baby mama right? If only you could be a chadDon't have much to work with, since there isnt any video, but OP's post history massively points to ISFJ, possibly INFP? Probably ISFJ though, given that they share the same quadra and functions.

I don't know a single INTP who writes about or even concerns themselves with those issues, especially at that volume. None of it fits. Ignoring Ni, lol. I just take and synthesize what I can get, but there is zero to suggest that OP is a Ti dominant person. 

It's all educated guesswork at this pointit all good frendI have an ISTP friend who is obsessed with this game, it's so freaky and cool. SUPERHOT ISTP game confirmed I love this song, lol. I think I've seen him typed as ENFP mostly but these lyrics in particular come off as Ti ish. I think the former stereotype is more characteristic of ESTP, to be fair. Not entirely, just moreso.The ENTP guys I know lean that way, same with INTP actually, and the NTP women I've known seem to get pulled to the middle as well. Who knows? I've always seen Ne personally as like... 60-40 feminine-masculine, if I had to make up a random ratio on the spot (given traditional definitions of masculinity and femininity). Maybe it's the conceptual and sort of childish nature that keeps it relatively neutral. yes there is which is why i said not entirelyI think our bigger flaws are immaturity, inconsistency, childishness, pettiness/pedantry, and self-centeredness. At least, more than the brash, trolly jackass stereotype. High Ne and low Fe/polr Fi really leads us tripping over our own feet constantly when it comes to people. 

I think that nastiness is oftentimes a result of insecurity and backpedaling, a defensive "if I do it first nobody can accuse me of fucking up! I did it on purpose!"yeahThis most likely describes ESTJs, else ENTJs. 

Oriented towards pre-established goals, aggressive, basic procedures and guidelines, a need for correctness, systematic, etc. mostly brings up Te with Si. 

Action-oriented and aggressive can be Te or Se. Multi-tasking can point to Se or Ne, but "look for the possibility of potential problems and difficulties in order to prevent them" seems specifically more Ne than Se. 

shit my bad, did i not make sense? RIP, i think i chilled out too hardmy grammar is way better on my phone because it fixes most things for me oops

fixed kindaoh hi neighbor!yes i live fairly close LOLyes its in the first page soLOL WATthat way they know where your priorities are atENTJ, else ESTJ. 

not ENTPENTP. 

I like intelligence, awkwardness, reserve, geeky hobbies, enthusiasm, creativity, open-mindedness, eccentricity. 

I'm dating an INTP soI find it both endearing and relatable.That too.I wish we were in a world where AI could move us closer to a society with basic income. :( ayyyyy!wutOof, that song gets me. Ride, too. Reflections and Band Camp by MisterWives, seeya by Deadmau5, Demon Dance by Julian Winding, and Kicks by Au/Ra are first to mind.r/thalassophobia and r/imaginarycolorscapes

(most imaginary subs are great)YesStrobe and seeya are my two favesI do the same thing and its genuine for a time. I'm interested in people for about .02 seconds before I'm bored. It's also not what I see as flirting - aka trying to communicate a desire for another person, it's just unfettered curiosity that most people mistake for flirting. 

It has very little to do with authenticity. You're also making a mistake by thinking ENFPs all have the same moral code and values. YPart of the point is learning how others operate. The concepts of Fi and Ni are both really strange to me but trying to get a better view improves understanding and communication. I have ADHD, so I need to know what the main plot is in order to catch details and nuance. I get lost otherwise.I have to relocate it I think I have another up somewhereOh, I dont mind if I get the big "x dies!" or whatever. I dont think spoilers have ever bugged me regardless.

I appreciate the parts that make up the whole enough to offset any spoiler disappointment, I guess lol. Gotta remember not to ruin things for other people thoSleep first I'll find it frenMY DUMB ASS DELETED IT MY BAD;_;LewdBut thankam gril but keep beardLewdness never shocks meNTPs will do it. weirdI just didnt know what else to say RIPNe always makes senseni users mostly. They're better originators and can be really strange to me. Ne is referential and easy to track if you know what to look for

That can be a big if thoI know it wasnt for me specifically but I think given extra information the general population wouldn't struggle so much to understand itLol what happened nephew y u delet all thisI think some expressions can correlate. 

Ne doms often look wide-eyed and rarely look right at whatever it is they're interacting with, especially when they're musing or sharing their ideas. The less tangible nature of Ne means that they're usually searching for mental connections between objects so they require less physical focus (vs. Se, who are some amazing eye contact holders, lol). Lots of speeding up and slowing down while talking and pitch variation, arms flailing, etc. 

INxPs still have that distant, distracted look, but are lower energy. I like to bitch a lot about pointless stuff.huh weird

You're pretty dope tooyikesagreed lol 

other people need to get over their shit no lol you're at 0 alreadyi always scroll for the bottom/controversial commentsi enjoy dumpster firesor just keep leaving weirdly kissassy controversials that works too except not at allQuintessential INTPs: Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds, L from Death Note, Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. 

ENTPs: Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Elsie Hughes from Westworld

INTJ: Artemis Fowl, Moira from OverwatchSo do many ENTPs, lol. She doesn't lead with Ti and has higher peaks of Ne energy and daring throughout the show. I've watched most of the show. He shares a lot of Alpha characteristics (NTP/SFJ softness, democratic) and mostly operates with Ti with much of the aux Ne ramblings and distractions (as well as having expert level knowledge in seemingly random, unconnected subjects). 

If anything, his actor gives more of an INFP feel to his character, although Reid himself is INTP. Definitely. I think you can also make good comparisons with Bernard and Stubbs and note the contrast there. your attitude may have something to do with it as wellnopei figured the "no" was implied with my answerypasssounds fi\-te, possibly estj if not enfp ENTP. Mine are warped\-reality \- retellings of things that have happened, but with unusual elements \(fantastical settings, mixed up voices and roles, interactions that make zero sense\). Very Alice in Wonderland/Coraline. We got some weird shit, lolYou dont sound like one at all but between the two definitely enfpweeeeeirdnot at all lol none of this is neNot really, lol. Just an attempt at humor. Ne is about finding connections between ideas, not just any random ol thing The connections thing? That's literally the definition of Ne.I've had similar experiences \- Ne\-Si is pretty referential and although it appears random, it's pretty easy to trace back the threads of where ideas and thoughts originated from. It just may take a while if I bounced around quickly. Sorry you're having this issue. Something that stood out to me is that you seem to insist that people can't be alone, that when they're busy they must crave friendship... 

That rubs me the wrong way and is the biggest reason I don't have Fe\-dom friends who stick around \- many of you are downright smothering. It almost feels like "what's the point of doing anything? they're got it figured out, their mind is made up". It's very possible you might be overwhelming to the people you befriend, even if you mean well, or that your nature naturally leads you to people who are reserved and truly don't need/want that much interaction, and you end up hurt when they continue to act how they know. 

I can easily days or weeks without talking to people, and when my more social friends are constantly reaching, I want to see them even less. Now, I'm a reasonable person and tell them I don't feel like talking or hanging out, but it's a lot. 

If this is a common theme in your life, I advise you take a look outside yourself at how you act, or at the people you're selecting to be friends with. I'm sure your friends could be better too, but you can't control them, and when it's literally everybody that means you should probably consider changing your approach. I believe Ni makes unconscious connections and synthesizes in order to have a larger, overarching conclusion. Ne is actively connecting, comparing, and finding similarities and reference points in tandem with Si. If that helps at all. [entp, probably eps in general](https://imgur.com/gallery/HHfrN8p)Lol, it isn't hard to spot them.

If you think this is pinnacle Ne humor... well, I have some news for you. The writer of this found it online on someones forum signature and thought it was clever so they copied it down. Nothing about it is abstract or absurd - lower order Ne. Don't forget Se and to a degree, Fe. 

ESTPs, ETJs, and certain ENTPs do well in entrepreneurship. ty for not forgot seding ding dingi believe in you frendIt really isnt LOL but ok I'm not sure what the perfect word for it is tbh, maybe its absurd in a weak/forced way. But when it comes to Ne, its a stilted, clumsy usage of it, which is why I think an SJ most likely wrote it.This is literally lower order Ne-Ti - actually I think it's more Ti humor than anything else, finding humor in contradictions and structurestep 1 be attractive

step 2 dont be unattractivehe got the mental image, it'll be enoughwhy did your eyes turn into batsstalker/doxxer here, i just like to see if i can. using deduction to solve problems is fun, i don't really do anything with the information

still creepy thothat's not a batnoNoProbably ISTJ, maybe INTJ but idkExactly what I thought tbh nosounds ISTP minus the awareness of emotions although that's not a total deciderthat is cornorder cornmy favorite film, it is high artnot them omgi once bonked a mailbox when i was 16 and i've had a couple speeding tickets, but overall i'm not aggressive or reckless. okwhy are you tagging meYou arent wrong He isnt intpOccam's razor applies often in cases like these imo. They could be "really unhealthy" but if they act this way for prolonged lengths and in different situations... then it's likely they're just ESTJ/ISFJ/etc. ESTJs have well-hidden sensitive sides, ISFJs can be witty and devious. Those just aren't their primary modes of operation.i never sleep in bed \(; 

usually i shitpost or draw insteadalso check out ESTJ 

sometimes the tertiary Ne can give an appearance of a rather creative/quirky ENTJ/organized ENTP intp, istj, or infp I usually do, but I don't see it as flirting. firin mah lazers? shoop da woop? mudkipz? 

may as well necro this comment tooyou sound most similar to my partner, who is intp. maybe entp but... dunno, ti stands out morego awaythis is my swamppoor reasoning and yeah, you're annoying. it would be different if we actually had decent conversations but most of our exchanges are just you latching onto my comments with "lolrandom!!1" business. Lol their randomness seems like what everything thinks dom ne should look likeu rite u rite
or just hate talking to people in general Yeah I agreeDPDR is a bitch, i get derealization episodes fairly often. you can still find your type but you'll have to recognize that your behaviors may not appear to be in line with how a type may normally present itselfno lol also the reason comment threads nest and create a "read more" is for precisely this lmao sorry boutchaspmzhYou're welcome to post a type me questionnaire here, or even better, the folks at /r/JungianTypology accept video submissions (although the sub is mainly into socionics and archetypes, so the typings are a bit different). That might give others more information on typing you personally. 

I do like the descriptions at typeinmind.com for functional stacks that aren't socionics related, so you may try there. Good luck!DCNH covers more, but any functional subtype is far more interesting and meshes better imo uploadedWait I thought it was getting uploaded to like a folder lmfao 

[link](https://www.scribd.com/document/382137043/Mirror-Hexaco-Ayyyy)

I posted it lmao for some reason I thought the upload link was for a folder or smthi miss ONE attention question and now the test is attacking me

anyone expecting me to get 3/3 is invalidlet's go full circle: sensors are the best cause they're so sensible and simple and uncomplicated &lt;3 uwu uwu my poor intuitive brain is just sooooo special and complex i love having my basic sensor friendz to balance meokActually, I like watching and reading my favorite things. I like getting multiple ideas and messages out of the same material. New stuff is fun and interesting, but I usually am multitasking on bigger projects when I listen to or watch media, so it feels like I get more out of my time with that pairing of activities. 

It's also cool to go back to things I've enjoyed after some time away and see if my takes change. Things don't have to always be new, I can just... make them new, I guess. Not particularly \*good\*. Just kinda neutral mostly; nostalgia is usually a pain in the ass. I do like noticing things I hadn't seen before upon rewatches, though. 

I'll make an exception for Ghibli movies, though. Those are just magical. ENTP and i'm partnered with an INTP and potentially an INFP as well. i just like Ne a lot, so the more the better lol.3deep5meNot all that high, lol. I think my lowest honesty-humility score was in fairness (lowest tenth percentile), which would correlate with machiavellianism score to some extent. I think the overall HH score is also offset by the greed avoidance score. I'll offer a few from the NTPs:

ENTP: Elsie from Westworld, Ed from Cowboy Bebop, Olive Penderghast from Easy A, Ed Elric from FMA, Gaige from Borderlands 2, 707 from Mystic Messenger

INTP: Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds, Alice from Carroll's books, Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon, Abe from Hellboy 2, L from Death NoteI didnt lol I've been napping

I'll have to get into the second season, the first season she just seemed too haphazard with the rules and her job for the sake of exploration to fit estj imo. She's hella impulsive, too. Wonder if enfp is a possibility thoAlso since ur into socionics as well, launcher Te is also present in ETPs

Maybe I just really wanna kiss a robot girl

Edit: messed up, its ENTPs and ESTPs w Te in the 6th spotMovie Alice is def entp but book Alice shows more INTP traits imo, she gets stuck in her Ti so often and everything is presented through the lens of having to make the world make sense and keep up. 

One of the most INTP moments... I cant find the exact quote but where she basically has a meltdown because she manages to deduce that she's stupid, lol. One of my favoritesI like model G ye 

Maeve is kinda tough what with all of the literal personality changes, lol. I had ENFJ in the first few appearances but who knows now?Model G I believe, 6th position for ExTPsGulenko is a saucy boiO shit its mah dang cake dayIdk about that...I'll take freaky for Ne.AYYYYYYTHANKAgreed with INTPs. Not all of them but the most fatalistic, pessimistic people I've met have been that type My comment was a joke but after thinking about it, I think it's less that they're asexual and they're more... apathetic to the effort and social rituals that are usually required to have sex in the first place. True. ISTPs and ENTPs get mixed up fairly often. 

Jim is also more facially expressive than most ISTPs, and goes out of his way to harass Dwight and Andy with his jokes. He takes so much pleasure in the creativity with them and is more aimless. Contrast with Darryl, who is also a prankster and also a "cool dude", but rarely initiates those activities and usually only when somebody is directly hassling him or impeding him in some way. He's also much stonier, more direct, and independent.

I see it as a subtle form of extroversion, with Jim making contact much more frequently and kind of going crazy without an audience to bounce off of. He also cares far more about what others think about him. 

I think a lot of people have interesting ideas about what ENTPs look like. Hard to compare with an ENFP like Michael, who obviously has some mental/personality issues outside of typology. /u/dilemmasraccoon

In case you dont see my above comment. 

I'll also add that a lot of ENTPs come off as quiet, especially in spaces where their ideas and musings aren't appreciated. You have to look for signs of extroversion in other ways rather than just sociability. Also, compare him to Roy and Darryl - NTPs tend to be more childish and "softer" than STPs.

His relationship with Pam (who overall comes across as ISFJ, although her characterization wasn't consistent at first) also hints at duality.Yep! Not impossible for us to learn, though. Just... not a strong point, especially in impulsive types. About where I am, I have to really picture myself in a similar scenario to get an idea. Only time I've gotten legitimate affective empathy was during a candyflip. I mostly do character commission art, fanart, and illustrations depicting my own original fiction (characters, scenery, etc). I have trouble with art that is expressive or conveys emotion (mood is difficult even in settings), so I go with original and technical. Kind of a cross between the Ti, Fi, and Ne descriptions /u/littlelightningbug gave, although I learn way more towards the Ti end - concept art is my JAM. I thought INTP or even ENTP initially but I could see ISTP, actually. It's possible, but posture and facial expression are a part of acting and consistent levels/forms of expressiveness are helpful. 

It's only one part of the typing. I never said they weren't. There are many great ESTP artists out there. 

To expand, Ne users in general seem to take more pleasure in the planning and mental fodder of the creative process itself, or so I've observed. The STP creatives I've known tend to plan the minimum of what they need to achieve an end and enjoy the "doing" of the same process. A lot of their Se-Ni leads them to enjoy the act of working towards a vision, while Ne-Si likes paddling around before they even start. Se is gutsier and more direct. 

An ISTP creative I know said something along the lines of "It's fun sometimes, but what's the point of sitting there imagining something when I know that's not what I'm going to do?"

I think this stuff applies to Jim to some extent, although he isn't an artist (where this would be more obvious). Dude takes ages to act and is easily distracted with little initiative and many of the things he does are ultimately pointless, which is a big difference with Se and Ne types. 

I usually use socionics more, so I'm used to justifying my claims using those resources, but this isnt a socionics forum so I will fight you on this via discord til the day I dieEverything Nerdy as fuck. Cosplay, anime, gaming, way too much D&amp;D, plenty of sci-fi books. 

Most the STPs I know are pretty geeky too but aren't quote as obvious about it (ar least in ESTP cases). no meOooh. 

I dunno about Eladrin for ISTP given the emotional whims and expression of the Fey, but regardless - I would definitely throw eladrin (assuming you're using Mordenkainens right?), wood elves, rock gnomes (seriously), air genasi, tabaxi, and half-elves under ENTP, and likely ENFP. 

You could even split up the Eladrin via seasons and temperaments: ExxJ for summer, IxxP for fall, IxxJ for winter, and ExxP for spring (although I may swap a few fall and winter, they generally correspond to the Greek temperaments well.) 

My bf and I both play a loooot, we could probably fill in more depending on how much info you need.I would just be wary because those stats for type are notoriously inaccurate.

Definitely check out Mord's - they totally revamped the eladrin to be personality and season based so that's why I'm hella pumped about it, lol. 

For stats... Wis could be Ni or Si, honestly. Si is very good about keeping a database of experience to draw from - I would use that for either. It's hard to make hard correlations between functions and stats. Ne and Ti could be Int, Cha could be Fx and Ne, Dex Se, Str as Te and Se, etcAhhh okay. My knowledge of code and algorithms are very basic, unfortunately lol. I think I see what kind of system you're getting at, though! 

I'll be out and about today but if you want to send me a PM with more specific questions I'm happy to try and help. Otherwise, I'll try and do some thinking and see if I have any better ideas now that I see what you're getting at more clearly. 

(I swear, there are so many NTPs in D&amp;D, it's great.) The character concepts are pretty dope but the static problem is awful LOL like WHY TF AM I LIKE THIS *delet everthimg*you are backevery year of my life is a wtf year4TH OF JULY PREGAMEPFFFFFT can't stop me43no lol not 43 I enjoy my kindreds. LMAOOOOOO73/100, expected.Bile? 

You got an honest answer with solid advice from somebody with real-world knowledge in your field. He told you exactly what it might mean for your career and the success of N/S types at more general levels. 

Just because somebody is mildly stern you're going to get into all kinds of kerfufflage? My dude. Wow, your response here is unreal LOL. You are taking shit incredibly personally. Good luck buddy, and try your best to tone down the sensitivity if you want any modicum of success.People usually think I'm flirting if I'm just interested in something about them, I guess bc I give off flirting signs? Oops

If I'm romantically interested I usually listen better than normal and then end up telling them I like them anyway. Truth of the Ne domsINFJs and "INFJs" also love to fancy themselves rather special sometimes and Ni seems mysterious by description. Many NF and SF types consider themselves empathetic and caring, but perhaps many of them don't frame their identities around it or make it sound like a power. Istj Entp with an Intp and an infp. 

I like partners who are creative, interesting, awkward, unusual, and have lots of hobbies. Usually Ne ego 

The intp is great with words and worldbuilding and has a talent for gamewriting, very intelligent and full of things to discuss. The infp is a visual artist and fiction writer, also immensely talented, and very full of ideas, a bit spacey. the lack of oxygen makes it a bonus for me M I S T R E S S 

L E T

D I EI was absolutely kidding 

Dont worry I practice safe kink. Jingly items work well for this. hi fren

yep mostly same. feminine, mid-20s, bi (prefer women tho), no kids pls, kinky stuff and dope conversation is a must. bottom/sub. detached also - partner must be able to deal with my insomnia and generally being consumed with art

with an intp and an infp. i usually date other ne ego types. i dig fellow creative weirdos. also i have cats so they gotta deal. 

:D hi frenhiSounds like you just really wanted to post ur insta

Still followed because lots of colors lmao I just have an art page I'm givin u shit oh okthank friend thankI agree with most of yours but I'd have: 

Phyllis: ISFP 

Pam: Starts ISFP-ish, settles into ISFJ. 

(TBH, I think Phyllis and Pam almost swapped midway through the show.) 

Jo: ENTJ

Darryl: ISTP

Ryan: ISFP (Epitome of ISFP hipster-dramatic stereotype, tries his best to NTJ it up in NYC)

Chasing This - MisterWives

Lead is ENFP, but there's plenty of Ne in their music for me to relate to. I have never met an Ne ego user who didn't have a strong interest in those things, although some may be more into visual arts, tech, music, etc. Common factor is creativity and imagining possibilities.

If someone is realistic and shows little interest in creative hobbies, and it isn't just a front (for work or family) or a result of health problems, I would doubt their being an NP. ENTP. My personal is rarely updated. I have an account for art that's very active and I get a lot of business there, so it's mostly works in progress and sketches, with a few finished pieces in between.Discussing it with a friend rn. I typically struggle with feeling accepted, open, or like I belong anywhere. I oftentimes feel like I'm always putting on one mask or another, trying to decide how cold or funny or bubbly or serious I should behave to suit a particular crowd. My attitude and interests just don't suit others' very often. I usually flip flop my hobbies and career wants and things like that, and change my mind so much that I rarely trust what I want. 

My boyfriend is pretty similar. Like neither of us could be vulnerable or ourselves around most people (although he found a friend group that I joined that... is full of IxTPs and ExFPs and it works). I found a person with whom I could drop pretenses and fully engage. We both love debating and exploring and discussing strange hypotheticals. 

I think that when I'm in love, I feel accepted, intellectually stimulated, able to express and untangle my feelings, and challenged to grow. I can let out all my random thoughts and ideas without being annoying, I can think silence without feeling obligated to talk, I can share little facts I find while cruising Wiki, and I can just be happy, I guess. I always feel lost when it comes to my identity and education and career, but at the very least, my relationship doesn't feel that way. I find that I say "wait, am I being annoying?" or "sorry I'm off topic, this doesn't matter" a lot less. I'm really bored at work if you can't tell. Everyone goes home on Friday so I can't get anything done. ;-;

How is it for everyone else? 

(ENTP/INTP btw - gotta love that +Ne/-Fe) Just saw that this morning and I'm interested in discussing it more. 

Obviously, true sociopathy/ASPD is uncommon, but it seems like there are trends of some kinds. If you're a type that scored high and aren't a sociopath, why do you think you achieved an elevated score? For others, how strong is your sense of empathy, and how do you perceive these types? 

For me personally... I've had a couple people joke to me about being a sociopath and not having feelings, but it's not remotely true. For me, and a couple of other xNTPs I know, a lot of our actions come from curiosity and a desire to be mentally stimulated, but depending on how emotionally mature we are, we can also become so excited that we forget to analyze the consequences fully. 

I've experienced it where I've viewed people as a means to getting information I want or fulfilling my curiosity, and "forgetting" the people side of things. However, the difference between this impulsive curiosity and actual sociopathy is that if I hurt someone in the process, I'd feel genuinely bad about it. I truly didn't factor in that people would react to me or that what I'd do/say would actually /hurt/, and I'd feel stupid - how could I have overlooked such a thing? And I'd find out that usually, that type of damage couldn't be undone. 

I don't do nearly as many hurtful things now that I'm older, and I'm definitely ashamed when I look back at how I've treated people. It doesn't make it better, but I think I rarely act out of malice so much as I just act without thinking. Learning to understand and cater to peoples' feelings was pretty difficult but worth the effort. 

I see a lot of NT types that want to be edgy and claim how irrational feelings are and think it makes them hard or powerful to repress or ignore them (in themselves or others). But in reality, emotions are a rational result of past or present actions and are a part of nearly every human, and it's irrational to not consider them - you'll almost never reach an accurate conclusion that way. 

But I digress. I'm interested in hearing what others have to say on the subject. Totally curious to see if people have songs they relate to, especially in times of emotional distress or other problems. I was listening to shuffle and Sensible Heart by City and Colour came on. Definitely got me in the feels.

"I get so distracted/by some peoples' reactions/that I can't see my own faults for what they are"

"At times so self-destructive/with no intent or motive/but behind this emotion, there's a sensible heart"

I relate because to me, I feel like I don't understand my own feelings and try to make logical sense of everything. I can lash out and become destructive, even though all I need is to comprehend my own emotions and express myself properly, and I tend to focus on the faults of other before acknowledging my own.


Bonus:

My INTP definitely relates to "We Move Like the Ocean" by Bad Suns.

"I've been just coasting/my mind put to motion/we move like the ocean, but I can't swim."

To him, it hits that spot where he's always thinking and his mind is always moving, but he can't seem to take action sometimes and struggles with change and goes with the flow too much.
So, give me some songs that hit those insecure, anxious, sad, angry, uncertain, or other distressed parts of your heart~As the title states. Saw a comment asking questions to help type and the ideal boss one intrigued me. 

What types have your worked for/with? 
Any you prefer or dislike more than others? Why?
What's your ideal boss? Or team?
What about work environment?

I like my current job a lot. My boss is also an ENTP and thinks just how I do, to the point where we say things at the same time. He's laid back and understands that I work in bursts and if left unattended, I'll get everything done how it should be. The workplace is casual- sandals, tank tops, and bringing your pets is okay. :D I work with an INFJ, an ENFP, an IxTJ, an ISFJ, and idr the other person. 

On the other hand, pretty sure I worked for an ESFJ and that was awful. Strict dress code, strict attendance, needed me to look busy at all times even though her methods of work are inefficient with me, needs me to look happy... Lmao. RIP. 

Tell me about your work~This will probably get long, but it's not necessary to read it all to contribute, so meh. Anyways, another topic for today - I tend to think of these while driving a lot. I remember reading a comment from someone, I don't remember who, but they were saying something about ESTPs being really forceful even though ENTJs get the steamroller reputation. My stepmother is an ESTP and my father is an ENTJ. Interestingly, both of them are in B2B software sales, so it's cool to compare the way they operate. They compete with each other and both are fantastic at their jobs, lol. Power couple goals, if I had actual motivation... They're still hoping I get into sales lmao.


My father has a general vision in his head of how things should go and wants things to be as efficient as they can be - maximum return, minimal resources. He's rather flexible and reasonable and is likely to compromise, because to him, giving a little might still reap him more reward in the long term. I only see him run over people or lose his cool when someone is being really difficult or downright incompetent, usually at work. He's more of a really low-key softie, lol. Even when he's angry now, it's a very "cool" type of anger and it almost never gets the best of him. 


My stepmom, on the other hand... whoever said ESTPs can steamroll is right. Like, whew. Generally, she's a fun person, really friendly and generous and likes to have a good time. When she decides it's time to take action, though, it's getting done ASAP and it's getting done her way.  If you can make her pause and see that something she's going to do isn't going to be effective or that it will truly be hurtful to someone, she'll rethink. But god help you otherwise, especially since she's kind of impulsive and doesn't plan things out as much as my dad. Their house is always getting cosmetic upgrades to her tastes as a result, and thank god she makes a lot because all of the shoes and clothes drive my dad nuts - and he's a guy who can appreciate his share of new and shiny too. :D My dad just sits back and lets her do her thing, as long as they're on track with his retirement plan.


I'm decently strong-willed myself. I tend to pick and choose my battles carefully, but I have certain boundaries set, mostly so I don't stretch myself too thin trying to please others. The rare times my stepmom and I have gone head to head... That's one of 2-3 times in my life where I've seen my dad set to tears. Two ExTPs (especially one who's emotionally unstable) in a firefight isn't pleasant at all. 


My mom is an ESFP and while she can be stubborn at times, conflict just generally stresses her out and she'll withdraw more often than not. Her thing is life is to have fun and be happy, and if she's not happy, she bolts. I think my grandmother is an ESFJ, and I've seen her get upset like once or twice in my life - she's a peacemaker and will generally let people slide with all kinds of things for fear of stirring the pot. Like... an aunt committed fraud against her and grandma was like "Pay me back quietly and come to church and it'll be okay." Some Jesus-level turning the cheek. 


ANYWAYS this is getting way too long. What types do you see as the most passive (ETA: Not necessarily people pleasing, but maybe with the most willingness to disrupt?)? Who always has to get their way and at what cost? Which functions do you think relate to those traits? 


TL;DR ESTP spoopy. 
Feel free to answer as many as you'd. I'll start.

ENTP: "Just because you can doesn't mean you should." 

I'm sure this applies to most types to some extent, but I really relate to it. ENTPs can be impulsive and destructive pre-maturation. The natural curiosity, the urge to deconstruct, and a lack of awareness/consideration for the feelings of others can create a perfect storm of assholery. 

You don't always have to press the button. Possible spoilers, although it's not a new season. 

For those who have seen Be Right Back, it's covering this topic. For those who haven't, this guy dies and his gf uses an AI program to bring him back in a text program, which eventually progresses to a physical AI copy, which is pretty eerie and emotional. 

If you lost an SO/spouse and these were options, would you take them? Would it help you cope? Or would it be mentally/emotionally toxic? If there was no original SO, would you consider having an AI partner and would you find it fulfilling? Why or why not? Do you think any particular types would be more likely to be strongly for or against this? 

For me, I know I would use an AI text program to bring my SO back if he died. I don't know about a full copy - I'd heavily consider it probably not. But an IM or text program that mimics him, I'd probably hold onto that and never move on. :'D 

I would also date an AI in general, if it mimicked human behavior and mannerisms well enough. I think I could love it just like a human partner, but that's just me! &lt;3 *title gore*

I'm a little sick and exhausted so bear with me here~

We all know relationships are what you make of them, but there are always the stereotypical relations between types that are amazing (the fabled ENTP/INFJ partnering) or not so much (STJs, ugh you sticks in the mud!). Do these hold true for you? 

Outside of that, I struggle with ISFJs and INFJs. Many I've met (admittedly, I'm fairly young, so maturity plays a role here) come off as passive-aggressive, sneaky, and disingenuous. There are a few reasons why I suspect this happens, but I digress. I work with a very nice, older INFJ woman, and my grandma is an ISFJ and I like both of them a lot, so obviously this doesn't hold true for all y'all. 

On the other hand... I really like ISTJs especially. Oh lordy do I ever. Granted I annoy the ever-living fuck out of them with all my chatter and curiosity, but literally they're so cute. I totally sound condescending, but legit. So sensible and efficient and a tiny bit grumpy sometimes, y'all remind me of the song "Short Skirt/Long Jacket" by Cake. So sexily effective, mmph.  Plus, I like hamming it up and making them crack a smile. The ISTJs I know are so serious and a bit tightly wound. So so rewarding when I say outlandish things and make inappropriate jokes and I see my ISTJ friend trying not to laugh but I SEE YOU SMILING YOU LIAR IT'S FUNNY JUST LAUGH. 

Which is both the beauty and the blunder in MBTI, for those who allow it to dictate relationship patterns rather than point out potential communication lapses in advance. At least, that's the way I see it. I interpret it less as "You have so much Ne and ISTJs are so rigid blablabla can't ever be friends" and "You may be wary of one another because of XYZ differences in functions". 

Anyone find that their ~*perfect match*~ doesn't quite line up, or that they're drawn to types that might be considered an odd match otherwise? :D 

(ISTJs... just let me love you. *Please*.) 
My best friend is an INTJ lady. We met in third grade, when I helped her cheat on a test that she hadn't prepared for properly. I convinced her to suspend her morals, we didn't talk much after, then we met again in 5th grade when she asked about the sci-fi book I was reading (Dragonsong, by Anne McCaffrey) and recognized me. 

We were pretty much inseparable ever since. Our relationship is very push-pull, competitive, with me bringing her out of her shell and helping her loosen up, her reigning me in and making me stop and think, and both of us keeping the others' ego in check. We've had a few falling-outs, but we always manage to patch things up. It's more peaceful now that we're on vastly differing paths - I'm in marketing, she does field research in biology. Much less competition. We definitely gave each other a complex in high school. 

My other best friend is an ENFP guy. We met on Runescape, where I pulled the "come to wildy" mess (I was an asshole online). We ended up becoming close friends, dated for a bit, but ultimately we were just too "best friend" and I preferred girls. 

Our relationship is characterized by shared creativity and imagination, lots of gossip and excited meme-sharing, weed, me trying to keep him from becoming overwhelmed from his many problems in life by offering solutions, and him listening genuinely and excitedly to my many harebrained ideas and making me feel validated. It can be emotionally draining, but it's a very low-conflict friendship. 

What are your closest friendships like? :D I'm super bored in a meeting and I'm noticing my coworkers' rings. The ISTJ has a couple of really thin, gold bands, very simple and elegant. The ISFJ has this whopping halo diamond ring. Its traditional and beautiful, rose gold and feminine. The INFJ has raw diamonds that look like a clump of quartz - really unusual and cool looking. 

What's your type, and are you married? What kind of ring do you have/want and why? What type of wedding? Do you even want to get married at all? 

I'm just really bored and want to see what other people want to do. I'm an ENTP, I would love a moissanite ring because I want to use that $$ to buy other cool shit. Wedding would be cool if we could have some kind of holograph star display thing like that LA art museum, lol. With marriage and weddings I'm surprisingly traditional otherwise, actually. 

Wonder which types go for which styles, who would elope, who has those obscenely huge weddings. p: I'm bored so just humor me pls. p: I was pretty high the other night and my INTP accidentally muted my Echo. I didn't know that it was a feature, so when the Echo went silent and turned bright red, I freaked the fuck out. I was half-terrified and half-excited because I thought some Westworld shit was about to go down. Turns out there's a button on top and my Echo was not about to gain sentience lmao.

Still got me thinking tho. :D AI is obviously a pretty hot topic and there's a lot of sci-fi material out there about it, usually (but not always) framed as something negative and scary when they inevitably become self-aware and angry at people. Robots in general tend to get that kind of reputation. Idk, GLaDOS was always my favorite.

I guess to me it depends on what kind of role they have. In a Westworld type scenario, probably not good - they'd probably become resentful and feel mistreated. But if treated similarly to people, do you think they'd behave about the same way? If they're modeled after humans, they would be likely to behave like humans, or so I would think, but I don't know a lot about the topic except that it's super interesting and cool. 

I wonder if AI rights will become a major discussion sometime down the line. How human does something have to be to have rights, and how many? I wonder if discrimination against non-organic people would become a thing. Is there a point where there's not much use in making a distinction (save for like, having children)? On one hand, robots. On the other... If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, etc... I dunno. I probably would be in favor. Aren't we all made up of wires and chips, in a way? 

Are y'all looking forward to AI becoming more human? Or is it frightening? Or do you just not care. p: Is there/should there be some litmus test for what gets treated like a human? 

:D I was trawling around the internet and stuff, and noticed that my favorite character (Elsie Hughes from Westworld) is only typed as ENTP. Granted, she's also a fairly minor character, so I don't think there's a huge pool to choose from. She's a pretty stereotypical ENTP though (though she's rather muted and not too much of a caricature), and as such is my fictional crush. 

Conversely, Gregory House might be one of the most debated-upon types - he's less mentally healthy and has more writing to him, so there are bound to be more inconsistencies. I've seen INTP, INTJ, ENTP, and INFJ all argued for reasonably well. p: 

What are some other characters that really are very obviously their type? Or are argued over?  Hello, all. I'm kinda bored, hopped on Vyvanse, and chatty af. So I'm curious about more unusual mistypings you see, and why they might come about. 

Something I've noticed (seeing as I spend all of my time here and over at /r/entp) is that a number of ESTJs will mistype as ENTPs. Hear me out, even if it sounds weird. I think there are a few reasons for this: 

1. As we know, ESTJs get shitty af descriptions that make them sound like fascist anal-retentive dictators. That alone is enough to drive many of them away from identifying as their type. 

2. I personally think that SJ and SP types sort of get shafted on their tertiary and inferior functions. Many blogs and sites go into depth on the intuitive types and really walk through levels of development and maturity, various manifestations, etc, and then sensing is just "You like to do things and you're stuck in the past lol" for Te-Si, with little on their Ne and Fi.

3. Following #2, Ne is forgotten about when describing ESTJs. ESTJs can be stubborn and domineering, yes, but they have Ne, and it's not much further down than Si. p: Especially in adulthood, healthy ESTJs can be creative, fun, spontaneous, and open-minded. Ne is an outward-facing functions that I personally notice very quickly, and I rarely see that conveyed in most ESTJ descriptions. 

My thought is that ESTJs (male especially) are more likely to mistype as ENTPs than you might expect. Although Ne-doms are characterized as scatterbrained and distracted (aka anti-Te), they are also known for being pushy, prickly, antagonistic, intelligent, out of touch with the feelings of others, cold, and perhaps a little bombastic. (I think this is why ESFJs won't usually mistype as ENTP as often, although I'm sure it happens and I just haven't noticed.) 

I think ESTJs with any semblance of developed Ne will identify with the latter part of the description with their Te, as well as the curiosity, intelligence, and creativity. And without any of that Ne "sparkle" in ESTJ descriptions, they may naturally gravitate to the ENTP label instead, as it can feel more complete and thorough.

The ENTPs you see who are harsher, more ambitious, business-minded, and goal-oriented (pretty much any ENTP that describes themselves as "I'm an ENTP but I can get shit done" while being under 25 falls under this - I exaggerate, but still lmao) are probably your ESTJs. 

I think they can also mistype as ENFPs, but the only people I suspect are mistyped that way are female ESTJs. If I had to guess, I'd say that feeling functions are more strongly encouraged in women and discouraged in men - thus, more ESTJ men (especially those who are on the traditional side) will traipse past the ENFP descriptions, whereas the women may really identify with both the Fi and Ne. 

Overall, the biggest "tell" is the Ti vs. Te. Actual ENTPs are usually a little more phlegmatic in nature, and are interested in knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Their abrasiveness is usually needling others and trying to understand what happens if they do this or that. Ti enjoys deconstructing whatever Ne is interested in, and that's what motivates them. On the other hand, ESTJs usually have solid goals with objective measures, and their Ne serves to move them forward with creative plans and interest twists on already-successful models. 

Anyways, whew. There's my idea, so I guess lemme know what you think idk. Or share if you think there are other mistyping patterns that seem contradictory at first, because I think those are really fun to explore.

*pls talk to me i am lonely*It'll probably be more silly than insightful, but I currently have altitude sickness so I'm lying down and kinda bored. The feature kind of looks at phrases and words you use a lot, so it's funny to tap one button repeatedly and see what it makes. 

I'll start: 

"Also side note I have to have equal access to the shower tho and I'm a little bit of a wild child my man. I'm gonna 
get the first flight home lmao and I'm gonna live with a taser and a perceiver since you lead with the beautiful cold war."

Edit for another: 

"I love that omg haha well if anything changes let me in the mountains so I might buy paint and just go somewhere alone with my art regularly to be a masochist." 

GUYS IT WORKED I'M AN ENFP

:D Can totally tell, Se roasting is just vicious. Kudos&lt;37w8 sx/sp

trip-hop, electronica in general, and indie pop are my faves. 90s stuff too.

massive attack, sneaker pimps, little dragon, rhcp, misterwives, flight facilities, garbage, zero 7, gorillaz, mgmt, company of thieves, pendulum, god is an astronaut, and poe are on my current rotationTBH some of the best sex ever was with an ENTP gal. Get that identity relation!

I'd probably marry an intp thoughJesus christ my dudeIt was funny and interesting at least, lol. I expect nothing less from you. Oh man. I'm wrapping myself in a bubble and never leaving the house with this new excuse. 

Wooo I'm saved!! wow you must be so deepwe must go deeperSameme

i dont know how many times I used to get told I was too casual but eventually they just kinda stopped bugging me as long as my sandals were not flipflopsI respect cam ppl 

I'll find some dope trash tho summer is good for ice cream which means deformed popsicle facesintps kill it tbhyeah ya doyall nerds can g e theeeaaard that

Just "hang on hang on!" And then bam!When my intp partner and I fight it's always always over something stupidly petty that escalates because he misses my point and gets pedantic, or I say something flippant/callous. We both have trouble dropping the issue because we love to be right. 

On the bright side, we talk EVERYTHING out forwards and backwards so when it's solved, it's solved and we have a better understanding. We used to argue constantly but the longer we're together, the easier it gets. INTP is probably closest to a J - especially ISTJ, INTJ, and even ISFJ. 

ENTP is probably the most "feelery", can seem close to ENFP and ESFJ. 

ENTJs can seem most sensory imo. Sometimes mistaken for ESTJ, ISTJ, and even an ESFP depending on the person/setting. 

None of the NTJs come off as very P-ish but seeing as INTJs lead with Ni I'd put my vote there. ENTPs are generally more expressive about whatever is going on.  NTJs probably keep time with their own feelings well, but aren't generally open about them.im in a constant state of sleep deprivation

i just hole up in my room and draw. And shitpost extra surrealistic memes on facebook. im definitely more annoying there I have an INTP villain who isn't consciously one. They
traded their livelihood and soul out for eldritch powers that slowly are consuming them psychologically. They're an intensive researcher, using the newfound powers to further their own ideas and knowledge and explore other dimensions and creatures. Of course, this is at the growing expense of society, as they're potentially forging a dangerous connection between other worlds and their own. 

They aren't necessarily evil, just apathetic and self-interested. Someone doesn't have to be an awful person to be an antagonist and a menace to society. 

I like your concept but he sounds almost ENTP than INTP, lol. I have an ENTP antihero who operates similarly, though with a little more reckless destruction and firepower. I'm an ENTP with an INTP SO. 

Been about 3 years and if all goes well, engagement within the next. Dope shit. If only this were true. Lots of D&amp;D, reading books together, gaming, conventions etc. He's helping me build a magic mirror and a digital map for our campaign. We do pretty much everything together tbh lmao*snerk*Lady istps make for some great friends. I totally forget I say weird shit like that LMAO. 

We can come up with some creative threats- er, scenarios. I'd say two beers before it gets wild and we make someone actively leave a scene. 

I dig.I'm ready when you are!ENTP: Multiple, and one usually takes a front and center stage while the others crystallize temporarily. I have sci-fi, fantasy, etc. themes. Focus is intensive on character and cultural development, technology, and general Rules of the Land. 

They're mostly for escapism, but I'm a maladaptive daydreamer. I'm also an artist and never work with subjects close to me, so it becomes easy to find subjects and fodder to work with.Yall really discounting the ntps most ntps i know have some kind of artistic pursuit or talent, it just isn't usually their primary "thing"same here my dude. i've gotten pretty good and always trying to getting better. slow and steady.pls cite your sources

also remember when i said it's often not their main pursuit? I love these

Altho I feel the ENTPs I know are more "ironically" homoerotic than the two dudes in that hot tub...That expert is... oof. RIP.FULLY CERTIFIEDWe're here to help. I always thought ENFJ tbh, maybe ESFJ? always had more Se vibes but I havent watched any interviews or anything Oh yeah, I think i thought about estp with the latest album especially. Estps are marketing killaz 

I love her music cause I'm a basic bitchI'm an ENTP, my SO is INTP. 

I'm into art, programming, 3d printing shit, rowing, D&amp;D, shitposting, gaming, cosplay, reading, and basically more nerd shit lmao.

My SO is similar, he enjoys propmaking and game writing specifically rather than visual arts (though he makes cool sprites and maps). Also into D&amp;D, video games, etc. I'll throw out a few prototypical examples: 

INTP: Spencer Reid from Criminal Minds, Alice from Lewis Carroll's books, L from Death Note, Jim Hawkins from Atlantis

ISTP: Violet Baudelaire from A Series of Unfortunate Events, John Wick from John Wick, Jim Hawkins from Treasure Planet


ESTP: Frank Reynolds from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Derek Morgan from Criminal Minds, Ellie from The Last of UsI'm pretty sure she is. Her profession, problem solving skills, and general resourcefulness lean towards Ti works, and ENFPs typically do better with Fe-ing than ENTPs do.

Edit: I can't believe i forgot FMA Ed lolThat's not the best reasoning for excluding ENTP, lol. Crossover traits. See my above comment.Hmm, after a little research I think you're actually right, especially with her purpose being explicitly kind of an audience everyperson, I hadn't known about the creator's intent.That movie is the shit lmao. Treasure Planet and Atlantis are two faves. I've seen that but my argument for ENTJ is primarily his need for dominance and his penchant for enforcing his views rather forcefully both in his Ni scheme and in his own microcosm. The former makes sense for both types, but most INTJs aren't so openly controlling when it comes to the smaller sectors of life and they kind of roll with the minimum Te needed to carry out their vision. Light is extra as fuck and makes a ton of power shows and flexes for the sake of it. The show focuses on his Ni vision and drive as its main plot point, but I don't think it's his dominant function. On a more anecdotal level, HS student ENTJs seem to act a lot more like Light in their day to day functioning. 

I think Near might be an INTJ, however. OOPS lmao I'm headed to a game night and our DM is JP. 

I just marathoned that shit last NIGHTOo I forgot Futaba! Female INTPs are hard to come by. Moira - INTJ - Overwatch ENTP: MEMENo they're dating sims!!!entps are slutsHa! Gayyyyy!I mean plenty of us are good at sports lmao. 

But if you're looking for something stereotypically Ne-Si, my first thought is competitive trivia. Most NPs I know have so many weird things tucked away in their head.I ID with electric, flying, and psychic the most. 

I'm a Rotom. Obnoxious, likes to nose into your business and offer my opinion on everything, will take over your electronics. Not me I'm a terrible listenerLook into ESFP| White: 25 | Blue: 74 | Black: 63 | Red: 91 | Green: 43 |

I already knew I'm Izzet af, that guild is ENTP in a nutshell - I actually have some interesting comments based on functions and colors and ended up grouping the guilds/shards/etc. 

My favorite description: "The Izzet are obsessive experimenters, the epitome of keen creative intellect combined with an unfortunately short attention span. The original mandate of the Izzet guild was to provide solutions for public works projects (sewers, boilers, roadways), but their experiments often produce mana geysers, spatial rifts, or arcane portals instead." 
ENTP. Depression, OCD with low insight and derealization, anxiety, acute and complex PTSD, ADHD, auditory processing disorder. All professionally diagnosed, currently medicated for most.special types? yes they're all special 

"special"? das merotom is my jam 

steals ur electronics and makes snarky comments every 5 seconds even when you want it to hushplaying with rotom dex is a highlight of pokemon sun and moon

as is minaCause some of us are goofy lil shits 

hes weird and can somehow convince everyone of bullshit"hahahaha this bitch dont know i'm bout to be a lawnmower"Your team is so much different than mine lmao. At the moment I've got gardevoir, milotic, flygon, skarmory, rotom, and sneasel. cause i dont give a fuck not a single fuck 

i think a lot of entps horseshoe their way around from being so weird/dorky that it becomes cool again, especially from afar. DORKYou ESTPs are genuinely cool do itistjIstp or intp cause yodaisfpEntpYou're the closest, entpentp, u closeNaw sameEntpThat seems to be a popular guess but no, entpEntpBy explaining where it comes from and how we can help. 

Coming at us full force with emotion rarely works well but, telling how you're feeling, why, and what you need us to do is okay. If you're truly asking too much, I don't see too many ENTPs buckling, but I don't think many would refuse to compromise. 

/u/kaleidoscoping is pretty nail-on-head with it. everyone else seems to be falling into the emotionally inept/uncaring stereotype that fledgling entps usually give us, lol. definitely isfjWhy so defensive over ISFJ? Oh my god lol did you actually just tag that sub for your own comment

Methinks the ISFJ doth protest too much hahaha...I am saving this comment forever and keeping it pffffftFun part: you keep going on about how dare I, and my lack of evidence... but I simply asked you about your reaction and you haven't said a word about what traits of the ISFJ typing are setting you off. 

Instead, you've just gone on an embarrassing tirade. (Seriously, genuine question. How are you not embarrassed by yourself?)Oh, is this display because you're upset about that guy not loving you anymore? that seems to be what you're vomiting up in another corner of the internet lmao 

Go to bed and think about what you've doneThis is an intense commenti love other entps, ive hung out with at least two others irl and it's always a great time what the fuck i probably need to come back and read this later honestly. Is there any context to this? You might enjoy taking a rhetoric class. Took one in university and it really teaches you to look past whether something makes sense and actually understand the purpose of the argument. It's good that you can acknowledge when something makes sense, but I think you would feel more secure when you're able to get a handle on what the goal of the speaker is and determine if you really agree with it or not. 

There's nothing wrong with saying somebody's argument is logically sound, but the other part of that equation is what it means for morality and for yourself and others. It'll come to you.Alexa how do I delete somebody else's comment?LMFAOOOO

damn I need to make one for when the entp gives up. 

shitposting license and a bed for oneDismissive attachment, OCD with low insight/psychosis, CPTSD and acute PTSD friend what's up lmaooooall the enfps saying they arent like the other enfps HAHAHAHAHA thoughts 3deep5megod yes please end me alreadyIntj and entp accurate as fuck lmaoi will light it UP with some shit talk tbhUntag meYou're alive!Routine is the *worst*.Nope, it's the absolute worst. With like a hundred other things, all the worst.
I have written/spoken to quite a few INFJs. No one have ever seemed interested in exploring other people or going in depth with their psychology. But again, it might not be "real INFJs" and yadda yadda. There's so many factors, maybe they do, but don't share it with others, because they spent 95% of the time "listening" in conversations, compared to taking the initiative.Why would it be an "Ni" thing? Makes no sense to me.
This onePerhaps there are just so many sensors that even with the not so rare intuitive, it is hard to notice them when one is going about their day-to-day business, and is not stopping to talk to every single person. Also, most intuitives do not go around wearing a large LED board saying "I AM AN INTUITIVE!!!", so even if you did talk to one, they could be act friendly and superficial at first, just like everyone else, assuming that you didn't want to know theif life story, their philosophical viewpoints, their thought patterns, etc. that may point to them being an intuitive rather than a sensor. Perhaps if people knew all of their acquaintances more in-depth, some iNtuitives would be uncovered.

As far as it being a sensor's world, like it or not, 3/4 of people is a lot larger than 1/4 of people when you are making majority decisions, deciding who to market your products to, or trying to please the most people in general.  Hence, the world is largely for sensors, minus a few niches controlled by intuitives, not necessarily because they are more assertive, but simply because their abundance,  even if it isn't as much as some people think it is, is enough to grant them a reasonable amount of control.What proof exists that type is purely determined by genetics? Also, what proof exists that being a sensorial would be always be a dominant trait in the case that the determination of types were purely genetic? I know plenty of intuitives who have two sensor parents and plenty of sensors who have two intuitive parents. Additionally, there is no proof that one could be heterozygous (in the case that type is genetic) as far as the sensor/intuitive dichotomy goes since the whole of MBTI is based on cognitive functioning, not on clearly traceable physical traits such as height, or hair color. Despite the fact that sensors have been reproducing for thousands of years, there is still a sizeable amount of intuitives. Have you considered that other factors could come into play in somebody's type determination?That's very true,  they do get stuff done. And your image of an intuitive farm is hilarious,  but there are many niches of the world where this metaphor already applies. The only issue I foresee is the fact that even if people have intuitive parents and are raised as intuitives, there will still be some sensors just by chance. And what evidence do you have that the ratio of sensors to intuitives is increasing?

Another thing to think about: it is great to have some people that you have things in common with, but I have reaped many benefits from being the only intuitive in a room full of sensors. Is it such a bad thing to be different in a positive way?By saying "that's very true" I am not agreeing to the  fact that sensor genes are always dominant, since we do not even know at this point how important genes are in determining personality verses other factors such as the environment in which one is raised. I am saying that there are more sensors, and they often get more done than intuitives for better or worse.XD I had a feeling you were, but I figured that if you were actually serious that it would be fun to debate you for lolz. Indeed it is hard to phaze another NTP, but it is always going to seem a bit weird to me how emotional other types get when someone disputes them without even arguing/having an argument for their case. Those sensors are an interesting bunch, even if they annoy me every now and then. My INFP best friend is the same way...I wonder if there insistence that they are special snowflakes is just a thing common to their type.*faze, my phone insists that it knows how to spellNo, I am just saying that a lot of people haven't designed their's yetHow about Wing-Dings?Hmm...this would be very interesting to further research.Even though it uses the dichotomy, it is still rather interesting. Hopefully someone will run a study like it with the cognitive functions some day.

I think the odds are pretty slim, specially since ENTPs are not the most common type to begin with.Me too! But then again, if I do it then I could be the savior of all MBTI geeks until someone comes up with something better.*emo face*Perhaps their could be. I bet they would be an interesting character.
As an ENTP I always wish I were the other ENTP's I know.Ne - I have five tabs open right now, am listening to a Let's Play of Sonic 06 (drak &amp; gigi, highly recommend) and have Impractical Jokers playing on TV. (shit I need to play sonic chronicles)

Ti - I'm much better at being objective in looking at decisionmaking than sticking with values I've held onto. It's like one drink of whiskey and the 21 years I spent thinking "nah I probably won't end up drinking a lot" are out the window LOL (more talking about weak Fi here I guess??)

Fe - I'm an actor and teacher and love feeling out crowds of people. Audiences are my favorite part of both of these things.

Si - AnxietyA great way I heard someone explain their intro/extroversion is forced vs. unforced interaction. If you make me train someone at work or meet with someone, I'm going to be very reserved. But any interaction that I choose is going to be extroverted.30/36 from me!I feel like ENTP's have a pretty long fuse, but when we're mad ya done fucked up.I don't tend to communicate well with other introverts, but my INTP/INTJ friends and I can usually pretty much read each other's minds."I wonder if you could try..." when I'm giving a suggestion of an idea I'm certain will work.

"Yeah, sure!" When I've just heard something I disagree with and am about to follow it up with "but..."

"I'm a fan," or "I'm down," when someone suggests something I don't have a problem trying.

When someone's on my shitlist I'm usually "going to set them on fire."

"I mean, you could try it." When someone offers a solution to a situation but they're overanalyzing it. The alternative is "I don't see a reason why not."This really sounds like you're rejecting things *he has outright said* in order to justify supporting him.

&gt;He's as libertarian as you can get in politics at the moment.

Um. No? Hell no. So many of his debate epithets have revolved around the State having more control: "Two words: law and order." Evoking a stop and frisk policy, citing its effectiveness in New York (a faulty statistic). Increasing border security. Increasing foreign aggression, "Bomb the hell out of them and their families." As a person, sure he doesn't seem to really give that much of a fuck, but his campaign has run on some very anti-libertarian, Big Government principles.

&gt;He's like the least likely person to start WW3...

You think his defining beef with China is going to disappear when elected? He is going to try to strike a deal with China to make *his* business more successful. They will probably say something along the lines of "hell no." How does Trump respond to "hell no"? So far, it's not great. With an army in his hands, I'm not sure how it gets any better.

&gt;Also, the whole muslim/illegal immigrants hate I think was a persona he created to garner support.

So you also think this is going to disappear once he's elected? I would believe this more if he didn't support it so much in his fanbase (yes, it's a fanbase). He has made no motion toward rebuking this kind of destructive attitude, and it is sickeningly rampant among his followers. I've seen enough "ban those muzzies!" for the next century, and I would very much like for that movement to be rectified as soon as possible. It's, historically, fucking dangerous. I abhor the false equivocation people have made with Hitler. However, ss much as I think he's not on nearly the same level, he is politically, by definition, a fascist and I don't think many of his followers would have an issues with a genocide on Muslims. If Trump doesn't personally follow his ideology through, I think his cult will.Throw it at the wall and see if it sticks.I don't see the problem.Spring &gt; Summer &gt; Fall &gt; Winter

This all pretty much stems from my hate of winter: Spring is best because it enters carrying winter's dead body, summer is winter's opposite, fall is winter's harbinger, but still not technically winter, and winter can just plain go fuck itself.

fwiw I'm pretty much ENxP but mostly test as ENTP.Same. My only beef with my ISFJ friend is that sometimes he'll hate things for stupid, illogical reasons. He hates Jennifer Lawrence because she looks like an ex of his."u wot m8?" I am curious as to how to answer this question.holden fuckin caulfield over hereSounds about right. One thing I would add to that is that often I'll read whatever parts of a page catch my eye then fill in the rest. Sometimes I'll read paragraphs 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, then 6.

Adaptability, Ideation, Connectedness (how much more Ne does it get?)

Strategic (Ti)

Empathy (Fe)Still could be INTJ. INTJ's by no means express their introversion through meekness (at least from what I've seen).
Just the kind of bullshit we'd expect a FiNe to possess. Worst part is that you actually believe it, and there's no convincing you that your world view is completely inaccurate. &gt;How about, instead of being an asshole, since I am clearly confused in your opinion, you actually post something to educate me?

Sorry, I got a little carried away. I've been there. The assumptions I make sometimes... :/

I'm no expert, but I can try to help. 

Perhaps I should start with an attempt to separate the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) with Jungian Cognitive Functions (JCF).

If my memory does me justice, Jung, a Swiss Psychiatrist, created his theory of the cognitive functions circa 1928. Isabel Meyers and Katherine Briggs developed a spin-off (or a derivative theory) based on Jung's work after WWII, called the MBTI. Since the MBTI is somewhat loosely based on JCF, I guess your confusion happens because you're mixing the two, using them as a single unified theory. 

The best we can do is convert MBTI symbols into JCF and the other way around. Like so: INFP = Fi Ne Si Te, or INTP = Ti Ne Si Fe.

A sane INFP with strong Ti is unlikely to exist, according to the theory, but I'll leave that to my successor, because I want to get back to my game.

Are you trying to inform us that you're a pedantic asshole? : P  

Yes of course, I'm just teasing you. No, it's logic vs. morality. If perception = subjective, then is it really a better way to put it? After all, we know that there are objective or "extroverted" functions out there.

 
 
 So... you've been around as long as the universe?I see you haven't thought this through. First premise is false. You don't have to have memory of an event in order to think about it. 
Yeah... no. I think this is a love languages thing? 

I'm starving for a hug right now. u.u Even if I'm only analyzing factual data from another time period, I'm thinking about it. &gt; Like I said, it depends on your definition.

You didn't say that, did you? Yes well, if /u/Banana_mufn had said, 

&gt;I can't *remember* of a time I was ever not an INTP

that would make sense. But when you say *think,* that's a different thing entirely. Bullshit, I'm only an ENTP. :DRegardless of what type you are: if you procrastinate, /r/ProcrastinationHacker should come in handy.Thanks! If it interests you, could you try a few pills and tell me if they work? Because the process is as easy as taking an aspirin. If you procrastinate x task, you just look up the method for x and read it. The expected result is instant relief.  
Not OP but you just put the final nail in the coffin for me - thanks!Because it feels good. 

In a direct sense: the workout itself is painful yet pleasurable; the [pump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84cVizR6sPQ&amp;t=24s), the exhileration of surpassing your own limits, little by little. And also indirectly: the hormones involved that keep you giddy, the ability to move gracefully and forcefully through tasks that should be difficult but become mundaine.

I enjoy the heightened kinesthetic sense as well. The experience under strain teaches you how your muscles move and react, how to tense and relax, how to align your body in an ideal structure for any given task. This is more subtle, but it improves every day life another smidge.Gonna guess *themselves*ENTP masterrace much.I think /u/luckyhit707 nailed it on that front - see top comment.If he knew anything he'd a) realize that you just *are* a type, you don't work on becoming a type, and b) that naturally, ENTPs are the best.It's a fantastic talk that profoundly changed how I see political strategy and personal political belief systems. Still, I do not believe the data you show does anything more than vaguely hint at your conclusion.Shot to the Fe by way of denigrating Ne. Ouch.

"No woman will ever want to be with such an idle slob" is my take on it; shot to the Fe by way of slashing at then-underdeveloped si. Maybe it got me to work on it faster, maybe not, but either way I still resent it.And send them recall instructions 45 seconds past the agreed upon kill time, at which point the target will be all too dead, just to fuck with their heads.WHY ARE YOU UPVOTING HIM?&gt; I'm always in awe at the mind games we do on other people without even being aware of it. It's crazy.

When people decide to put **their own** conceptions of your ideas into their minds and run with it, well, that's what they get.

[Congratulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr7CKWxqhtw).To further that point, by showing them that your experiences relate to theirs, you open the door to more meaningful conversation.

*I nonetheless always feel like chipping in would be horribly self-centered and mostly avoid it. Sue me, me.*Well that 3rd guy isn't relating at all indeed. All the same, if the "that is so cool" crowd brought forward similar experiences and what it meant to them as a way of transcending the mundane topic, that'd be progress. This is where a casual conversation gets good, and maybe therapeutic in a sense.I also have issues with solipsism. It takes an unhealthy amount of disconnection from the outside world to just obliviously change topics back to them — as a MO. I guess they have more issues within themselves than I do with them though. A pity either way.It's a Venn Diagram. When letter pairs have something in common, they go in overlapping zones.They prefer "authentic"Like, not even *something*, just not stonks :oHe only chronically feels like one.Hey I care! Then I'll weigh it on the balance of how useful vs how annoying it is, keeping in mind that I like usefulness.
Looks more like inside the brain of an ISFP, honestly.I'm guessing something to do with misinterpretations of reality through mainstream media? The vacancy of the human mind without a constant influx of garbage? I don't know. Like you said, most of us are probably capable of interpreting SOMETHING, but it doesn't seem very ENTP-esque to find philosophical meaning in a music video. Again, it seems like an ISFP thing. Or an INFP thing, or whatever."Having the ability to create internalized logical systems isn't an INTP thing, it's a skill." "Having the ability to systematize and organize for efficiency in the outside world while comprehensively accounting for future modification isn't an ENTJ thing, it's a skill." "Having the ability to empathize deeply with another person through intuition and a sense of deep knowledge about the emotional truths of the world isn't an INFP thing, it's a skill."

Think before you talk, pleib.In part, I think the statistical rarity has a lot to do with it. I'd show my friends the chart of how rare each type is, and although they would have fit into one of the more common types based on their test results, I think they shy away from that notion because who wants to be ordinary?

I also think that the idea of introverted intuition is romanticized a lot in the INFJ. With the INTJ you have the cold-hearted analytical scientist who cares very little for those around him (in an outward sense, at least). The INFJ gets to keep the deep, dreamy Ni but also gets to be empathetic and caring towards other people which is a lot of what the younger generation stands for these days. I mean, I guess every young generation really did since.. ever? So maybe there are more young people who are mis-typed as INFJ than any other age denomination. Then again, that could be nonsense. I'm just going off here.

One of my friends actually acted nothing like an INFJ until after he did acid, and started spouting off about how "there is no such thing as a fact" and "nothing really matters" (well obviously), these days he usually just sits around and smokes pot while divulging his sage wisdom upon all of us, telling us the "truths" of the world that we didn't have the imagination to comprehend ourselves. I think a lot of thought catalog's "you know you're an INFJ when.." articles might in part be responsible for this. The bastards.I actually have noticed a lot of praise around the ENTP. A lot of the time I actually doubt I am one and am actually just an ESTP who likes to talk theoretical and has a hankering for science. I've noticed that there are a surprising amount of not-too-social ENTPs around here in r/mbti-land, so I guess you don't even have to be confident or socially attractive to be one anyway. You can just hop up on the ENTP train and claim that you're just not a very social guy, and receive all of the full-time benefits. What a riot.

Nah, but I do understand the cognitive functions are different than that. I just have trouble understanding how someone like me can stand being alone for too long. I get extremely depressed and my thoughts get incredibly negative when I'm by myself for longer than a few hours. The only thing that really refreshes me is talking to someone, and I literally feel a hype of energy when I walk into a party and start conversing with all of the townsfolk.

I'm drifting off-topic and falling into that narcissism, so I apologize. I think that the ESTP is way more charming than the ENTP when it comes to irl encounters. I have an ESTP buddy who can tell the funniest stories and captivate everyone while having the girls swooning after him. It's actually really inspiring. I'm surprised that on the internet there are more people who like the idea of being an ENTP than an ESTP, since the ESTP seems to carry all of the good stereotypes even further when you actually witness one in their natural habitat (which isn't the internet, have you).The "squeezing out the laughter" thing is incredibly spot on. It's like I feel the humor dying down and I'm like "naw dude it's still funny, right? It's gotta be" so I just keep imagining it in different situations and even expanding on the joke in my own head, and my friends and I do a back and forth of adding on bits to the joke that keep the magic alive. It can go on like this for a while, it's quite the phenomenon. One time my buddy and I were driving through Nebraska and we talked for an hour about a world with a version of bigfoot that lived in the plains of North America.I don't see number 1 as an ENTP thing, or numbers 3 or 4 for that matter. Number 2 is the stereotype, yeah, but it's not quintessential or an automatic "by default this now means you're an ENTP."If you're young, fuck em. Not even just them, any girls you can find. Get laid a few times. If you can get 2 at the same time I'll personally send you a letter of achievement too.

But for the love of all that is holy, DON'T fall in love with them.IxFJ because they're sweet, xNFP because they're kinky. Noice.Most introverted extrovert -ENFP (a lot of people say ENTP but I just don't see it, Fi-Te is more socially introverted than Ti-Fe which in my opinion usually implies a social personality. Compare ESFP to ESTP and think of which one is usually more socially outgoing)

Most extroverted introvert - INFJs don't come across as too introverted and ISFPs are a toss-up as I've seen some that are pretty talkative and some that don't talk at all

Most introverted introvert - INFPs are pretty high up there, INTP as well (although inferior Fe can come out sometimes)

Most extroverted extrovert -ESTP but ESFJ and ENTP are up there too. I feel like a lot of people will disagree with these ones, but eh. Whatever.

All-in-all, the most extroverted functions are Fe and Se. Holy shit, I read this when I was about 13, that was yeaaaaars ago. I remember the little bit at the end about the three groups of people too, and I distinctly remember feeling proud of myself for being a part of group one. But when I look at it now, some of the stuff in group 3 sounds more like present-day me... jeez."Likewise, being overly socially extraverted can also be a coping technique, a way to try to escape or distract oneself from personal doubts or pain." If that ain't the realest shit.r/ENTP is just a giant circlejerkYou're right, I guess I do see more Ti in here than Te. The argument does feel like it has a lot of that railing against incompetence and ineffectiveness that you described above, but if I pick it apart I suppose I can see that he's going more for logical inconsistencies; especially this part right here:

"If you're feeling down and sad, everyone will hop right on and remind you that 'you won't feel this way forever,' and they're right. But those same people will turn around and act like the good feelings are exempt from that rule, and that they do last forever. But they really don't."

That right there sounds more Ti and Ne if anything.True, and the other way around. 

Like my father, an obvious dominant Te user, sums up his ethics and morals as "If I am doing all that I can to provide and organize my life for the people I care about, I need to make sure I am doing it for the people I love." Having an ESTJ dad, I notice that he wishes I would take his advice more on just about anything, whether it's a situational problem or how to fix something. He wants people to trust him, and to trust his reasoning.

Fe-Ti works like "I can see where everyone is coming from, I just want people to get along. Internal reasoning is what can help me objectively see how I can help the situation. Deep-seated morals will make me pick a side, so let me look at it logically."Double D was an ISTJ for sureThis guy isn't an ISTP and Kaila is far from an ENTP.I like to think of the second one as the one you have to "try" to use a little bit. Not strenuously, keep in mind, but you can tell that your secondary is your secondary because you step back for a second and let it kick in. For me, I can be in the middle of a conversation, or anything really, and if a little light bulb flicks on in my head I have to analyze it to make sure it's not bullshit before I actually stow it away in my little thought library.Exactly. When doing a math problem, I wasn't constantly thinking of all the ways to get one answer.. well, let me rephrase that, I was. I was just going through every single possibility until I found one that made sense. 

I NEVER solved a math problem purely through formulas that I was taught, I just kind of "caught on" to the systems; but granted I never took calculus.So, I'm not going to full-frontal balls to the wall declare that you're not an ENTP; for all I know, you could just be an unconventional one. I don't type people based on character traits or stereotypes by any means, but they bring up suspicion for further analysis, and I go from there.

Do you have Ne? Sure, maybe.. I can see it to some extent. It's hard to really tell in something like an interview where you're pressing someone else for information, and thereby taking a less concept-centered stance and delving more into detail about another person's life. So Ne? I can't say. More or less, sure. 

I don't see any Ti in the way you think, however, and the fact that you think this Zac guy has Ti just leads me to think that you have a misconstrued idea of what it is to begin with. Other than that, I really don't see any of that introverted thinking analysis in the way you talk, it's too quick to draw conclusions; conclusions that aren't inherently based in logic. It feels dismissive, almost. More like Te.

But I doubt that any of this sounds right to you, and that's okay. If you like being an ENTP then you're going to be an ENTP.I'm a fuckin kinky-ass motherfucker, every time it starts to get too boring, I have to up the ante. 

My last girlfriend thought I was a little out there, and she was a stripper. Go figure.Haha, alright man. You've got me, let me listen to one of your other blogs where you AREN'T interviewing someone so I can delve deeper into this. My suspicion is that you're probably some sort of ENFP who likes to be judicial and ignore that Fi and skip right to Te. 

This erob person down here in the comments doesn't understand the difference between Te and Ti and really comes off as wanting to suck your dick, so I won't be reserved. I was repressing a lot of rigidity before because I was just trying to be nice. I forget that when you put someone's ego on the line, they kinda lash out at ya.

Your whole demeanor comes across as being more interested in the ideas of what a factual conclusion might bring you to, and then idealizing it in a kind of "lets stow this away for some feel-goodsy vibes later." As far as I can tell, your entire perception of myers-briggs is built around idealizing almost every function incorrectly, and then being empirical about the conclusions anyway. So the puzzle pieces don't fit, but it's like they don't *have* to.

Also, I was wavering on the Ne part. The initial statement was that you're not an ENTP, so implying you're an ENFP doesn't make me "half wrong," albeit I did use the term "far from." I'd say if you wanna argue the last part, we can bounce around in a little semantics-bubble until you're satisfied.

Also, I've been to therapy and look at me; I'm still a self-righteous asshole.I can guarantee that you definitely have Ti. You're always rethinking and then overthinking, and then using the asterisks to be more *precise*, you know? When you talk it's really crisp and I can hear how you always feel like every definition just isn't *good* enough. Like it can always be more clear cut, more exact. 

If anyone were to write a book about this whole thing that would be used in schools, I'd trust your judgement more than anyone else here, honestly.I don't think you grew into your real type at age 15, I think you just skipped your Fi. I mean, it would make sense to me, seeing that you would've been developing Fi for a hot minute (maybe 3 years or so) and might've dropped it when it felt ineffective.

Most of what I gathered was just through your tone here. Using the word "identify" when speaking about being an emotional person seems as though you have sorted it away to be one of your defining personality traits (on some level) and saying that your emotions garner on a superficial level just doesn't sound very Ti-Fe to me. Now, my emotions are certainly superficial.. but I make a huge effort to ignore the bad ones. Any time that something begins to have a negative emotional effect on me, I make a joke about it and brush it off (like you mentioned your peers doing). I don't know if this is a defining characteristic of ENTPs, but I'm just speaking for myself here.

Also using the phrase "fairly logical" sounds more like a tert-Te thing to say. Ti users worship logic, it's what builds the majority of their opinions. Sorting through the mind and twisting and turning ideas, shifting them around to see if they line up - that's Ti's favorite pastime. It's what it does. 

There is the chance that you're an ENTP that skipped Ti and went to Fe, but that doesn't sound right because you said that early high school age you identified more with ENFP.. leading me to think that if anything was skipped, it was probably some sort of thinking function.

Research more about how Ti and Fe work together and likewise with Fi and Te. Don't focus too much on the individual definitions as much as what it looks like to use them together; also, keep an open mind. Good luck my n-wordWell books really do suck dick, I mean I dropped out because books are almost a manifestation of the whole educational system: bland, monotonous, tedious, etc..

So maybe in a sense I meant more of an educational video series with some funny animation and exemplary MBTI learning content. I've never seen that sequelitis series before but I just watched the Ocarina of Time one and that wasn't half bad, albeit it's a little before my time.Wow. This post was like releasing an animal back into the wild and watching it slowly die.So is a dual in socionics like ENTp-ISFp or something? Or INFp and ESTp? Opposites in their own quadra, kinda?This is the most weirdly pretentious thing I've read in a hot minute.Agree with pretty much everything here except the house party thing, although I do a different kind of socializing there. It's not really any real discussion as much it is a game to put people on the spot and prove how interesting they are (which is probably inherently not only pretentious but also quite dickish).

There's also this thing I do when people start to look at me weird after I'm kind of pulling them into my weird imagination; it's kind of like I wait for them to show signs of being confused or uncomfortable, and then I give them a look that says "what the hell are you doing, why are you making this awkward you lame-o"

In a way, I like talking to people who give the impression that they're an idiot. I like to see if they can look through my bullshit, notice that I'm just joking around and then start playing along. I get along really well with the people who do that.I can testify to this. I've had a lot of instances where my INFJ or INFP friend will have to pull me back and give me a reminder talk about boundaries.R-Rick Sanchez, (burp) dimension C-137

Only the fictional ENTPs are cool because we have no real world skills.Does Ti work well for chess? If so, I'd like to hear how; I have an ISTJ buddy of mine that I'm pretty matched with and I just kind of figured that Ni-Te regardless was always gonna be the best.Ah yes, uhm.. "Chad."Same. Sometimes think ESTP but then I spend time with ESTPs.When I think enneagram 9, I think of any variation of IxxP. I know for sure I could never imagine an ENTP being enn. 9 though. That'd be interesting.I'm 18, I have a tendency to be an asshole to a lot of people I meet online. I love everyone I meet in person though, don't know why. I cook for people, I like to host parties, I like to make people feel welcome wherever we're at. 

But people online annoy the fuck out of me. Especially facebook, Jesus Christ.I believe Bojack is the embodiment of the Ne-Fe loop. He'll tell these really corny Ne-based jokes or make observations about how amazing he is and then look outward for validation from everyone else. 

At times I almost see a lot of Fi in him but the way he shuts other people down feels very very Ti. He always goes for the "trying to compare your logic to other obvious systems that don't add up to make you look stupid" kind of criticism rather than the Te "you are so ineffective and incompetent that I don't know why I bother with you."

The Ti-Fe is obvious then. If I had to compare whether he uses Ne or Se, I'd say it's pretty fair game. Chances are I just see Ne in him because he's the protagonist and we all wanna see ourselves in him. 

To me, though, the way that he can drift off into his own little "oh yeah, I'm amazing in this way too; I keep surprising myself with all of the ways I'm amazing" seems like Ne driven by Fe.I've gotta agree too. I think he's lost sight of a lot his Ti but definitely Ne and Fe there. When he gets that back (and by that I mean when he learns to apply it more to everyday life) he'll probably see a big increase in confidence.

There's also a stage I think we go through.. where we have a lot of feelings somewhere in those teenage years and then when they start to boil over we cut them off and only allow the simple ones to bleed through (like laughing or smiling or telling someone you like them as a person). I don't know about you guys, but I've developed a phobia of sadness. Can't stand it.

If you read this OP, soldier on my man. Also, lemme know what you think of drugs when you get to that point. I'm curious.Idk what the hell you are, but you're definitely not an INTJ.They're much more balls-to-the wall practical about their approach to life. You'll notice when you debate with them that when you bring in another concept that (to me) is very clearly related, they'll wonder what the hell you're doing bringing that into a discussion where it clearly doesn't belong.

They can also be really goofy sometimes, but they're very practical about serious matters; also, they will talk about hypothetical situations as long as they stay relevant. Very logical people, but they definitely like to make it clear that they don't take nonsense seriously.

Another thing: I was talking to one about his job interview and he was telling me about how he was observing the social cues and scanning the environment and reading the interviewer's body language, making sure to smile at the right times, etc. I don't pay attention to any of that. I look very very deeply into speech patterns and what a person says, but if we meet someone and when we walk away one of my friends say "did you notice that guy touched his ear a lot?" I'd have no clue until they mentioned it.I have absolutely no clue what you're trying to say.Is that what Ni looks like in a conversation? I've gone on a rant eerily similar to the one that Rust fella did. Different demeanor for sure but pretty much verbatim regardless.When I was a freshman in high school I actually did this, it wasn't 100% on purpose.. We were trying to fuck with a friend of a friend. I had also been hanging out with a buddy of mine from New Zealand all summer who taught me how to do the accent. I had to keep the accent in that class and then kids from other classes would see, etc.

I could see it being an Fi thing, but I'm positive I don't have any Fi. I mean, I doubt myself on a lot of things in MBTI but one of the things I don't question at all is that I for sure have Fe somewhere in there.

I do have a xNFP friend who did this when he switched schools and moved to Iowa, which raises the question: Is wanting recognition or attention from others only an Fe thing? I have an INFP friend who always talks about how she's vegan and kind of lists off her accomplishments and whatnot, but she doesn't have any Fe. Why is Fe the one exclusively associated with seeking recognition and appreciation?I've had multiple ISFPs that I had known for a long time ask me at some point when I open up to them if I didn't like them. I'd just sit there like: ???

They'd go on to say that they thought I was studying them or judging them somehow. Is this a vibe you ISFPs get when you hang around a kinda confrontational person?Really? I get along so well with them, half of my friends are ESTPs.Well, hmm.. For high Fe users I can see that. I do have an INFJ friend who tends to do some really weird shit when we're in a small group but most of the dom-aux Fe users I know are very concerned with acting "correctly." I see some tert-Fe users who give off a similar vibe but I'm not sure, my experience is quite different.

If I'm speaking for myself, I can get to parties and I'll just pick up momentum like a centrifuge. I'll start trying to make conversations with people weirder and weirder and go up to people and say weird things just for the reaction, all that kinda stuff. I ask people really intense questions and make up bullshit stories just to see if I can get away with it.

I would say in certain situations I'm very concerned about acting correctly but a lot of the time I more enjoy seeing the reactions. Nothing brings a smile to my face like watching someone poke through my shit.

My assessment is that this behavior derives completely from Ne and Fe working in a tangent with each other. Only problem is that it's completely adjacent to what Fe's goal is, which is to distinguish socially correct behavior. Would you still consider it to be Ne and Fe or does it sound more like Ne and Fi?Well.. it does make some sense, actually. They're putting on a facade that they know isn't true, and they can't risk having any suspicion put around it. I'm not defending them, I'm just saying it makes sense that he'd get that response from them.I suppose this video was a bad example. I would say, however, that a big thing with me is that when I find that I'm dealing with the same specific problem on a regular basis (however little it may be), I usually feel inclined to come up with some little trick or way to get around it.

Also, this guy for sure uses Ti. That's the one thing I'm certain of, he knows how every little part of every little thing works. And he's so concerned with WHY it all works, too.I think you're misinterpreting what I meant. I don't mean that he gets curious so he goes online and looks it up. He literally breaks down every individual part and finds out for himself.

I mean, I feel like I'm going crazy here. I'm obviously being outvoted but I also feel like I know more about the guy, I've seen more of his videos. And I don't feel like my knowledge of Te vs Ti is faltered.

Te is concerned with the information itself, gathering it, organizing it, utilizing it in its raw form. The way I look for Te-Fi is that in an argument, the Te-Fi user will stick to objective facts. Ex: statistics, numbers, figures; they form their deep-rooted opinions based on personal experiences and predetermined morals and find objective facts to line up with them.

Ti is more concerned with how the connections are made between facts, what really makes this fact a fact; it holds many variables simultaneously kinda juggling them all, flipping it upside down whichever what way and plugging it into other for-certain systems to see if there are any faults. A Ti-Fe user will always go for logic when they argue: "If your system A is true then how come comparable system B is obviously false?"

If you ask an atheist INTJ why God isn't real, they'll give you an answer somewhere along the lines of "If you check historical records of the exact locations of many of the events in the bible, they don't reliably match the scripture."

An ENTP might agree with that, but when coming up with its own argument will go for "Didn't Muhammad perform miracles? It doesn't make sense to me that the country we live in is predominantly Christian but when you confront one of them about the miracles Muhammad performed, they're quick to dismiss it."

I went on a bit of a tangent there, but I digress. Back to the AvE guy. I'm stubborn on this one. In every way shape and form, he resembles a Ti user to me. I've never seen a Te user care so much about such specific details and interconnections of those details. He has lots of videos where he's just sitting there breaking it all down and going into each little element, not with the mindset of "this system works because I've seen ones that work just like it" but with the mindset of "I could rearrange this system however I want because I know every facet of how it works." I feel like that's why mechanics are commonly ISTPs, not ISTJs. ISTJs aren't concerned with delving into that much detail and breaking things apart *beyond the point that the system is still recognizable*. An Si user wouldn't rely on something like that.

Also, I don't feel like offering solutions to specific situations makes you a heavy Si user. If anything, I feel like heavy Si users are inclined not to trust something like using superglue for closing up a cut. Wouldn't you think that a heavy Si user would be concerned with staying to objectively tried-and-true methods?FilthyFrank is a much more quintessential ENTPYeah, that shit got me, I meant to vote for the side of never.*What do you think your IQ is?*
May as well get rid of everything other than the rightmost button there.

All that looking at the test results did for me was help me realize how narcissistic we all are. God that's depressing.Question #40-something or something: I am a logical thinker -80% agrees

Yet you are getting downvoted for using solid logic. Jesus Christ.I know this isn't a "type me" thread, but a lot of this screams ISFP to me.If I were to be another extrovert, I'd say ESTP.

An introvert, INTJ.Ni, Te, and Si will result in someone who naturally has an edge in chess: as in, let's say you put them in a game without any prior knowledge of strategies or defenses and they'll play better than the average person with the same amount of knowledge.

I will say, however, that the world's top chess player Magnus Carlsen is most likely an ISTP. Ti is more adaptable, and it's better at taking parts of systems and applying them towards situations that follow the same patterns. However, in order to become a great chess player with Ti, it's going to take a lot of work.

So my theory here is that naturally Ni (or less so, Si) and Te will be better than the vast majority of people at chess, and when they will work at it, they'll be the better players of the entire community.

Ti, however, has the potential to be the best. If they use it right, that is.. and put a TON of work into it so that they can apply it.Not caring about how I look or how I dress. I mean sure most of the time I don't put a lot of effort in and sometimes I neglect it even, but when I go out I like to look classy af.

Still wondering if I might be an ESTP actually.It's a shitty existence. Ne makes the good great, like really great, because the entire world feels congruent with this happiness you feel. Like everything in the world is just lining up. Every connection you make and every possibility you think of is leading to this sense of fulfillment in life. You feel complete.

But then the bad comes around, and everything spirals down. You convince yourself that the good doesn't matter, and never mattered because it's all connecting to some awful, awful oblivion. Like within every revelation is some overhanging pitiful truth about the world. And it all keeps connecting and weaving around and around in a menacing way like sadistic maniacal laughter that's shaming your existence, everyone's existence. And then all the people you love and care about don't matter. You're done. You don't matter anymore, and nothing does. And then every idea is pointless, and everything you've ever known becomes impossible to understand.

10 times out of 10 it will push you to drink. A lot. And it happens a lot in ENTP-land.I don't think so. I don't display the majority of the signs and symptoms listed there. No disturbed sense of identity, no black and white thinking (although I'm sure it can look like it at times), no outbursts that would be considered "uncontrollable" (and they hardly qualify as outbursts, more of rants if anything), no distorted self image and no fear of abandonment. Just a fear of being alone. 

The majority of my depressing thoughts will be about other people, I worry about other people a lot. About whether or not they're actually happy I guess. If they're insecure. Things like that. It shuts me down because I lose hope in the world, maybe that's what I was getting at before.. I don't know.Cognitive dissonance and fear of the void. Do you think that if there were no religion, most people would wake up every day and continue on, knowing that there's no point to any of it?

Nah. Even those of us that don't believe in God ignore it. I mean, we're still here right?Honestly depressing whenever I'm reminded that MBTI can be put on the same rankings as the zodiac. What the hell am I doing with my life.Yeah, never got into it. Never understood why my friends were into it. I feel I'm a thousand times better as coming off as a real person when I'm talking to someone face-to-face. Otherwise it all sounds either like a robot or like I'm trying too hard.He's gotta be ISTJ. However, the fact that he's working on string theory seems like a very N field to work in (is he still doing that? I haven't seen the show in years); I still can't see INTJ though.Only thing I remember is he was the gay guy in Perks of Being a Wallflower.

But yeah, I definitely see more Fi here than Ti. His beliefs are more rooted in a sense of justice and empathy. In this video at least.AlcoholI'm an inventor, and I spend all of my free time researching mechanical/electrical engineering and going to parties whenever I can. Oh, I also go on here pretty often.

I've wanted to be a scientist ever since I was a wee little lad, and I've always enjoyed building things. Making things with my hands I mean. I know this is all a big ENTP cliche but it's my life. It's what I do.

Also I play electric guitar.Yeah, the ENTPs here can't claim Bojack Horseman because they relate to him so much and then go and say that they have thick skin.

Tertiary Fe means you want people to love you. It's simple as that.I'd say it's what they usually have to offer the conversation? One INFJ may seem different from another INFJ, but keep in mind that by definition they're both dominant Ni and aux Fe. If there was no way to be able to recognize the functions when you look at someone using them, then the whole theory basically falls apart.

I just try to pick up on patterns and if I hear something that just doesn't sound right, I'll analyze it to see if it fits. Like if an ISTP is talking about their outlook on life and I hear much more Fi than Ti, I'm going to ascertain that they very well may not be an ISTP. The big thing is that when people type themselves, they commonly look at the functions and read every single one thinking "that sounds like me, I remember this one time I acted like that" and they don't *get* anywhere. They usually just pick the ones that they want to be rather than what they really are because of selection bias that happens with the experiences they play in their own heads.

People act different throughout their lives, I get that. Emotions will make anyone act different in any given situation. That's why, in real time, it's much more effective to look at what a person's outlook or philosophy is rather than what they *do*.Te-Fi I'd say.

Probably like a Te user who is relying too heavily on their Fi due to an unhealthy mindset.Something tells me this lead guy is an INFP.Okay but really, why are we so damn arrogant? Why is it that whenever I see a group of ENTPs talking in any post, it's always about how *cool* we are and how we have "bomb-ass parties in our heads" so no one can touch us.

I'm not saying that I'm an unconfident ENTP so therefore I disagree, I'm just saying that despite the fact that we're *definitely* as cool as we all think we are, why the hell do we have to bring it up as often as we can? I swear no one loves ENTPs as much as ENTPS.If we're going with debate level intimidation or just any non-physical intimidation, it doesn't happen to me.

I like to think that I don't get physically intimidated either but there have been some times that I wanted to avoid fighting someone bigger than me (I'm pretty tall but skinny as fuck). I usually try to talk my way out of those situations, which I'm not exactly proud of; I'd rather say I had the balls to actually fight them. But I don't.If "taking the piss" out of yourself is self-deprecating humor, then the reverse form would either be sarcastically talking about how amazing you are to emulate self-deprecating humor, as in a high level of irony (which I see my ENFP friend do all the time), or you just believe that you really ARE that great and want everyone to know about it. So I mean, it's either a way to bring out your insecurity in a light-hearted funny way (that I see a lot of Fi users do), or it's just overcompensating because you need that validation in your life. Which is most definitely a prominent form of narcissism, and ergo insecurity as well.


And thick skin isn't confidence as much as it is (in the extreme) delusion. It takes a confident person to be able to admit when they're wrong because their ego isn't riding so hard on something so arbitrary. Confidence comes from knowing no matter what, you can do what you can do; you don't need to remind anyone. And you sure as hell don't need to remind yourself.I can think of things I want to do and certain things I might want to become, but I think at the bottom of it all I'm always striving to be remembered. I guess I'm always striving for those moments when people think "Wow Jack is really smart, look at this cool thing he made!"

I don't need a lot of people to think that. Just a few, I guess.Everyone is saying INFJ here, but all I hear is INFP all the way. Maybe an INTP, but I'm not seeing INFJ.And for the ENTP: "Wow what an arrogant prick."I have multiple friends of every type (except for xNTJs for some reason) and they all pique my interest at one point or another. Especially when I have a new realization about a certain type.From a conversation I had a hot minute ago:

I would say that 75% of my thoughts aren't me talking in my head, as I imagine most people's aren't. Most of my thoughts are ideas. If that makes sense. Like when I grasp the concept of something and I feel like it clicks, I put it kind of into an idea bubble that now represents the line of thinking I used to get there, and I compare the bubbles all the time.

I mean, the ideas come from me noticing something I guess. Someone will say something and it will seem reminiscent of a past idea bubble.

Or I'll look at something and suddenly a bunch of the idea bubbles in my memory bank will start to glow
so I have to start comparing them.Peaky Blinders, man.It's interesting, because I get what you're saying. I immediately thought "I don't know if this sounds right, they're not really sensory impressions" but then I thought about it longer and realized that's what they all start out as.

It's like there's some sort of idea limbo. That's all that my brain is. Like no idea really *means* anything until I notice its connection to something else. Until then though, it's just a sea of potential connections that are awaiting the nearest discovery (such as a behavior I notice in someone else) or something that I physically see and in turn gain a discovery from directly.

I believe that whenever you see a movie and the main character has a best friend who says some regular-ass phrase, and the main character says "wait a minute.. triangle.. triangulate, holy shit you're a genius!," that's pretty much extroverted intuition. The best friend may have not even said something relevant at all, but there was a connection there that when applied correctly solved the protagonist's problem.

I suppose even the example of making that connection about the protagonist and his friend could be considered Ne, but I don't wanna go about jerking myself off here.Sounds more like.. I don't know, Ne and Fi or something, right?Death and the hopelessness of being alive.Most parties I go to (and I mean like loud "let's do tons of shots" kinda parties here) are very very sensor heavy. As in, if I try to talk to them about any conceptual topic they quickly lose interest or don't have anything to add. I'd wager 95% of the people at these parties are like that.

You know why? Because that's the fuckin environment it is.ISFJs are warmer. You talk to them and you just get the impression that they really want your best interest, but not in any grander scale; just right then and there. Simple amenities.

INFJs are looking out for you in the long run. They don't actually really do that many nice in-the-moment things for you besides always taking the time to ask you if you're doing alright. INFJs also aren't as afraid to tell you the truth if it will help you become a better person (and by that I mean if they think it will).

Something interesting I'm reading here is that a lot of people are associating INFJs with being more intelligent, which is odd. I suppose I could see them being centered around more intellectual subjects, but then again.. that's not true. I've met some very well-versed ISFJs who were very studious and beat the shit outta me at trivial pursuit.Has anyone else seen a weird tie between ENFPs and ESTPs? Like I've seen ESTPs act like ENFPs when they're high and ENFPs act like ESTPs when they're drunk. It's weird.Yeah, this is pretty accurate. It's a feeling of "this is it? this is life? What is this hell we're stuck in?" In my case, or maybe just the case of the ENTP, the only thing that really helps is to just shut out everything other than Ne and Ti and become bitter.

Also a lot of dreams about teeth falling out, finding bugs in your skin, skin falling off, etc..I'm late to the party, but this crossed my mind when I was out and about. I believe Aurarus is saying that we all have to potential to exercise any one of the 8 functions, but we just tend not to. It's like we choose which muscles we want to exercise, and since a lot of them are contradictory or get the same job done, it's impossible to do a "full body exercise."

The decisions you do, the lifestyle you live and the way you view the world will all help you further exercise the muscles you're comfortable with using and push away the ones that aren't needed.I would say that you could definitely find patterns. I'd put money down that if you could survey the types of people who are regular churchgoers, something like 80% of them would be Si users.I really don't mind ISFJs at all. I actually really like ISFJ women. I mean I could complain about their not wanting to go out and do stuff all that often, but really.. I think those are the ISTJs. I don't know if they're just afraid of letting me down, but ISFJs always agree to go out and do something with me. They're just really loyal.

I also have this behavior where I do a kind of shtick and give people nicknames when I first meet them and tease em around a bit, and not once has an ISFJ ever disliked me for this. They're just really good-natured people who can see that I'm not making fun of them, it's just my way of being friendly.

I mean, they don't talk a lot, and I can't really talk to them about many of my interests.. but they're really nice to hang out with.That and Fe I think, because the hell you're stuck in isn't only about you anymore and you have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.

Shutting it out is selfish, but it's all I can do sometimes. It's easier to be mean and a selfish prick than to worry about everyone else constantly.Because engaging in human interaction means you have to prove that all of the deep mystic mysteriousness in your head actually exists and isn't just part of a quiet ploy to act like you're ahead of everyone when you're really not.Well, intuitives are typically pretentious about being deep and meaningful even though 99% of the population cares about having deep or meaningful experiences.I've also noticed this about ENFPs, it's really crazy. It's like you're so used to them being all banter-y and goofy and one day you see them punch a hole in the wall. It's like high levels of hidden angst that they keep somewhere within all that history knowledge and poetry they write. 

I met two brothers a while back, an ENFP and an ISTP. I always thought the ISTP would be the one with the hidden anger, but when I talked to each of their respective kids, it was the ENFP. And then I actually witnessed it, took me by surprise; meanwhile the ISTP was always chill as hell, building a guitar amp in the garage the whole time.Interesting opinions here. I'm really confident Bo Burnham is an ENFP. I know he's different from his stage persona, I've seen him in interviews and he's definitely stated that he's introverted, but I just think he's a really mellow ENFP.

Watch his old videos from back in the day, you can see it's all Ne weirdness with a layer of Fi "oh jeez this is awkward I'm gonna make fun of myself." And it feels like that's his way of reaching out. I mean, underneath all of his wordplay and funny jokes you can tell he's trying to convey something deeper, some underlying theme underneath each song or poem he has. Fi users have this thing where they'll disguise their feelings in something vague so only the people who relate to them see it.

It's hard to pinpoint, but I've also noticed language is something that means more to Fi users than Ti users. If you think about it, they're always the writers, the poets, the lyricists; they're more centered around playing with language it seems. So many Fi users on tumblr and they always decorate their posts with really articulate language, I guess it gets them off or something. Anyway, I don't see Bo Burnham as an NT. It just doesn't add up in my mind.

Best guess is xNFP.Believe in? Fi users.

Fascinated by? Anyone.He's not an ENTP.What's with those eyes you guys have? Every INFP I see has these weird, lost starry eyes. Like you can look into them and see every weird fetish and insecurity that they lock inside of a vault. Somewhere deep down in there.

It's like an abyss, I can see what it is and that it's seemingly endless, but I have no idea just how deep it goes.I hear a lot of ENTJ-ness here. Like pretty much on the dot.

You care a lot about being in control, you're a good leader. This says Te to me and the fact that you don't like things that are unfair this definitely leads me to think Te-Fi.

Now, you could be an ESTJ. I guess I see some Si here. But the kicker that got me is that you obviously have tertiary Se. And I know this doesn't count for anything, but I've never heard of an ESTJ who was interested in MBTI right after they heard about it.

But I digress. You're definitely an ExTJ.

Also - From here, I'd look at Se vs Ne. You can look at Si vs Ni but they're hard to distinguish unless you've really got a feel for them.I steal a lot, I argue with people a lot, I undermine people all the time. I've made a lot of girls cry because when I'm pissed off I list off all the reasons why they're pathetic. On a daily basis I talk to people in a pretty condescending manner. I've given money to a homeless guy and then when I realized his guitar sounded like shit I took it back. I've gotten kicked out of a lot of parties for trying to fight people. I do pretty much everything illegal. I drink and drive, I break the speed limit, I do and sell drugs, I have a fake ID and I get hotel rooms with it.

I'm not saying all of this because I'm proud. I'm just saying that although I act like shit pretty consistently, I can't think of anything too diabolical that I've done. I've never sabotaged anyone or ruined their life on purpose. I don't really think I have it in me to do anything completely terrible to another person. A company, an organization, something like that.. sure. But not innocent people right in front of me.I relate a shitton to the second one.My friends all make fun of me for this. All the time. Also bumping into things and apparently I walk around like a baby giraffe.This is a common one, I see it a lot. Truth is, they're some of the hardest types to tell apart because their demeanor is so similar. But I definitely think that ESFPs are better at getting their shit together.Just went on r/INTP and saw a thread about INTP poetry. I mean I get the whole "your hobbies don't correlate with your type" thing, but really? INTP poets?Just one time I want someone who believes in astrology to show me scientifically how the position of the planets in our solar system can influence underlying psychological personality traits in the human population based on what month of the year they were born.Definitely an INTP. Definitely definitely.I am a terrible driver. But that might be because I'm drunk half the time.Two of my good friends are INFJs. One is a few years older, and although there's no hierarchy between us, it always feels as though she's trying to take care of and watch out for me.

Another one a couple years younger that I seem to mentor as far as developing ideas. I wouldn't say I look out for her as though she's my responsibility, even though I have before.Clipping objects constantly is something I do on a daily basis. My shoulders hit doorframes a lot, I trip over things on the floor..Alright, well you can just go ahead and throw out your computer then.Scientists made the computer. People who study science. People who gather scientific knowledge and create things from it. I don't know why I have to even tell you this.

Science creates results because it's bulletproof. If you want to build a computer, are you gonna say "Oh I believe it works this way because I feel like it does" and be able to make one? No, you need to study electronics. You need to know how to use a multimeter. You need to know what a capacitor is, you need to know how resistors work, you need to know how many ohms need to run through a specific current.

Without this knowledge that has been acquired using the scientific method, you can't create physical, tangible results. There are laws of reality that dictate how things work and what is needed to be done in order to make things work; you can't just dream up a concept for something and expect it to work without accounting for the laws of science.So are you an ENTJ?It was a shot in the dark, but your handwriting seemed very formal. Very Te; although I haven't studied graphology. The structure of the whole thing also seemed really Te, and I guess I got a more Ni vibe than Si vibe. Maybe it was just an intuitive vibe in general.

But yeah, I totally should've seen that username.Me and my INTP buddy talked about this last night actually. He said he doesn't understand proper and improper things to ask people, and he gets mad when people start acting weird with him when he's trying so hard. He said he gets really curious about things and he doesn't understand why girls don't like to break things down in conversation like he does.

At one point, he said "I wish I were more like you" which is honestly heartbreaking. (And I'm not saying I'm a ladykiller, I just think he meant in demeanor.) My relationship with Fe is an interesting one, but I'd say that you can see the difference in both of us when it comes to how we dress and not so much the things we say, but the way we go about saying them. Whenever he offends someone, he doesn't mean to; whenever I offend someone, it's because I flipped a switch to the "I really don't give a fuck right now" setting.

I believe both types try to understand other's emotions logically, through Ti, but in the ENTP it's a little less thorough. There are times when they just understand that this person is having a shitty day and they don't have time to deal with you calculating everything in a conversation with them. The INTP doesn't realize this and breaks it down with them in an attempt to understand, but it can backfire on them because the person loses patience and becomes upset. This is how they end up with the "wait what the hell did I do wrong" and accidentally hurting people they care about.

Now I'm not saying ENTPs are better by any means, but they do have more control over their Fe.Nah dude. Dunkey is an ENFP lost in his little ENFP world. He's just like Charlie from It's Always Sunny, who is really genuinely ENFP.Additionally:

Joji (TVFilthyFrank): ENTP

Ian (IdubbzTV): ENFP who seems a lot like an ENTP

Maxmoefoe: ESFP (definitely Te, Fi and.. probably Se)





Michael from Vsauce is an ENTP because he hangs out with those fuckin losers I just typed up there


H3H3 is likely an ENTP

Pewdiepie seems a hell of a lot like an ESxP

Markiplier is definitely an ESFJ with strong Ne

JennaMarbles is obviously an ESTPI always got a very ISTP way of speaking from him, but I guess I could see ISTJ now that you mention it. Huh.It's interesting. It seems more common on here that the ENTPs aren't very social.You sound like an ENFP to me.Had her take a cognitive function test today:

Now, she doesn't know what any of this means so I assume she answered honestly. I don't think she uses any Si. I think it's safe to say she's an INTJ or an ISFP, but do you think she'd be as business oriented as she is if she was an ISFP?I guess I should elaborate. We delved deeper into what she said about thinking about the future, I tried to account for everything, including what you said right there. Si is actually one of the functions I think I understand pretty well, but Ni is still really hard for me to fully and concisely put into words.

I went into this thinking she was an ISTJ, and asked her a lot of the questions I used to type some other ISTJs I knew. I asked her if she trusts her experiences, if she values stability, if she has an internal map of memories she can navigate through to interact with the world, if she prefers a steady environment.. I don't have any reason to think she was lying because she really doesn't know any stereotypes associated with any of the types, but she didn't seem to use Si. At all.

She said she values tradition because it's about bringing the family together or something. She also admitted to not knowing or caring if God actually exists, but she wanted my brother and I to have "moral guidelines." 

I'm only disregarding Si because of the evidence here (and the test I had her take), but I guess I won't rule it out entirely.I can't tell how all of these people saw their results. After I was done it just had me take a survey and then returned me to the home page?Yeah, I mean, there's no easy way to say this, but.. I'd kill it. I'd tie that little bitch up to the back of a truck and drag him into a mine field if it meant I could get some peace and rest in the form of a new Bugatti Veyron. I'd strap on the ol timberlins and go to town on that baby's little mushy underdeveloped skull, I'm talkin really fuckin that thing up barbershop playdoh style.

I would without a doubt put on those cleats from the tattletale strangler episode of spongebob and turn that little fuckin baby into a chunky prego spaghetti sauce paste and then put it into the formula of all the other babies who wanna fuck with me. And then I'd take the chunks and mash them with my feet into a fine wine and make all the pregnant women drink it to make my job easier.

Everybody would wanna take me down or imprison me or some shit but once I was handing out Rolls Royces like hotcakes I'd be praised as some kind of baby-slaughtering hero. I'd get funding from NASA to help me launch babies into space. The news would start a bulletin on a number count of how many babies are being killed by the hour, there would be absolutely no stopping me.

It wouldn't even be seen as a sacrifice because nothing but good would be coming from the impending series of domino effect cataclysmic events that would take place after I made the decision to kill that one baby. It would honestly be nothing short of the greatest decision anyone has ever made.I think it's testing how well you can guess. Some questions seem very Si, like which picture of clouds was taken in winter.I don't know, I'm a fuckin dick. And it's just further proven by how proud I sound while saying that.

I once gave money to a homeless man and then took it back when I realized he was shitty at playing the guitar.i do believe that we weigh the importance of life by intelligence. Why is killing a dog worse than killing a bug? Why is killing a human worse than killing a dog?

One could say that more complex organisms are more deserving to live. Whatever. I'm pretty sure it's just because we're a pretentious species and we've separated ourselves from the animal kingdom entirely, even though it's clearly what we belong to.

There's probably some equation: intelligence + cuteness multiplied by the percent of the organism's mannerisms that resemble a human's.

Human &gt; dog &gt; harambe &gt; dolphin &gt; raccoon &gt; mouse &gt; fish &gt; insectOh no I agree, kill the baby. I was just trying to break down society's viewpoint of which lives are more important than others. I don't agree with any of it mostly just because I don't care. I just like pointing out that it's completely arbitrary.ENTPs are so fucking arrogant; belligerently arrogant, like they're drunk off of their own ego fermenting in their brain, stale from squeezing the same boring juices to use as lube to jack themselves off with.

I actually can't even describe how much I hate being around ENTPs. I don't meet a lot of them but when I do, they're just such.. faggots. I love ESTPs but if you could literally take the aura of an ESTP and then make them the most cheesy, stupid brand of wacky disney sitcom that is somehow oblivious to the fact that it's stupid and not clever at all, and replace the confidence with blind unsubstantiated pretentious auto-fellatio brand arrogance, then the ENTP is your result. And it's absolutely abhorrent. I swear I see your flare change every other week. Is it some kind of running joke? Because that would be hilariousKatniss strikes me as ISTJ, as does Harry Potter.Actually it's been proven that socializing can help keep your brain in shape and prevent alzheimer's.I do believe that ISTJs don't get enough credit when oftentimes they are able to play the most iconic main characters in movies. A lot of sources have Harry Potter as an ISTP but in actuality, when you grasp enough of how Si-Fi manifests itself, you see he fits much more into ISTJ. And I'm sure Katniss is the same.

On a somewhat related note, the character that survives the horror movie is almost always an ISTJ.I'm positive she's an ESTJ.Alright, well to force symmetry here again, Si works off of unconscious Ne. Effectively, in my case, it helps to think of them as two sides of the same coin. The 3D suspended idea of experience. Si is experience in its truest form, holding onto the details as they were, while Ne shoots them around and throws them into a big mixer where they generate things that never happened and likely never will.

I'm bringing this in because in my mind, Se and Ni must also be a similar coin in the sense that they are both sides of the idea of observation. I think it's somewhat of an audacious thing to say that Ni is just Se on steroids where they're subconsciously observing every single little thing faster than any Se user ever could. Ni isn't an advanced version of Se just like Ne isn't an advanced version of Si. But I can also see what you meant in that it takes in large amounts of Se subconsciously and builds them across into a collective conscious stream of the underlying patterns in what's being observed.

Also, I don't mean to bash you, I did really appreciate your input (as you know more about Ni than I do, I'm sure), but a lot of what you were saying sounds like it was tangled with Ti, ie the probability/equation thing. The reason I say this is because I do much of the same thing and I'm positive I don't have Ni. On a near daily basis I feed my equations a set of factors and organize them around to see which way is providing enough symmetry to work with.

Also, I really like what you said about tuning out rather than tuning in. That makes quite a bit of sense. I find that I do the same thing a lot with my Ne, and my vision quite literally becomes blurry. I agree that the words I chose here were perhaps used a little too loosely, but I promise that although I used some "thinky" words, I was trying very hard to make sure that I strayed away from making Ni seem like an organized, straightforward function.

In fact, now I'm reading more of your response here, I'm seeing that there's quite a bit of it revolved around semantics. I'll try and approach each issue here.

The past, I believe, is the incentive behind every single introverted function because one can't actually introvert without the ego (which is, in my observation, completely built on the past). I guess I did emphasize it quite a bit by comparing it to a map, however, and I shouldn't have done that. I moreso meant that these past intuitions build a larger, grander understanding of how to approach current situations. Which I see is kind of what you meant with the whole landscape/having Ni bring these intuitions to your conscious mind via a symbol thing.

I think in the grand scheme here, we were getting at the same thing, but my vernacular was demonstrating a model that wasn't as accurate as what you've provided. And for that, I'm actually very thankful.

edit: Also, now that I think of it, Si is brought to the conscious mind by symbols as well. Just ones that are physically, tangibly in front of them. The main issue with my map analogy, I suppose, was how it is actively navigated in day to day life. Among what we've previously established, of course.Haha every N on here is gonna say they're a 9 intelligence because it's a cop out. "Well, I'm definitely the smartest person I know but I'm no Einstein.. let's put 9 to account for those people who are just a little smarter than me in the realm of actually creating and expanding fields of knowledge."

Intelligence: -1000,
Looks: Steve Buscemi

I am literally Steve Buscemi. AMA.It's still possible to be an ENTP and be as annoyed with them as I am, isn't it? I'm legitimately asking this.I use a lot of Fe just for shooting the shit and having fun with people, and I don't understand big music festivals where you're around a bunch of people but not actually socializing with any of them. If we're talking about Fe going deeper than socializing, then.. naw. I'll help my friends if they're in a rut but I'll make sure that I tell them if they were being an idiot. I also go between caring about people and not caring about anyone's opinion if it sounds stupid.

My Si flashes on a daily basis. I can remember things if I consciously try, like if someone asks me what I thought of 2012 I could give them an answer. But on a daily basis, while my brain is kinda choochin away, random memories do pop up. And 9 times out of 10, it's something I don't want to remember. So I'll wince it away and put on my "focus on science" mentality so I don't worry about it.Well most countries in Western Europe are probably Se-Fi. Any liberal country seems like it pretty much reeks of Fi.Well Rick's demeanor is definitely more ESTP. I've noticed this thing on here and in r/ENTP that ENTPs are supposed to be goofy and masters of puns and everything, but in my case it's highly not representative. I do a lot of Se-type things, a lot of risky things. I don't act like a kooky Ne-dom at all, my brain is hardwired for science.

My point here is that even though he doesn't act like the image of the ENTP that we've all seemed to hash out in this community, his demeanor isn't enough to declare him not an intuitive. You can hear the things said about him, like when unity tells him he's the only single-mind that "sees the big picture." You can hear him say he doesn't trust bureaucrats, you can see how he decided to power his car using a temporal field with a planet slaving away for his energy.

I've heard the argument made that he's an ESTP living in an Ne universe, but if that were the case I don't think he'd fit in so naturally. The things he builds, the way he's so open-minded about the crazy species he sees, the way that he believes everything can be mathematically put into an equation; these are things that make me think he's got Ne powering all of that Ti. His Ti is mostly what bleeds through, but if you look at the things he's done and what he says, they're all Ne pursuits.

Also, I realize that I might have some bias because I relate to Rick so much. I'm definitely acknowledging the fact that that might alter my opinion a bit, but I'm also not guilty of typing every character I see as cool as an ENTP (like some ENTPs on here).

edit:  Also, Rick doesn't drink out of hedonism. He does it because he knows deep down, after everything he's seen, the universe is too vast to care about him, or the billions upon billions of copies of him.So you're just gonna take the one part of my argument that corresponds with yours and ignore everything else? Jeez.Well to me it sounds like the reasons you have for believing you're not an INFP aren't all that valid. I can't tell you from what you have here, so I can't answer your question (and I'm guessing that's why you've received no responses yet), but I can tell you that the things you've mentioned here don't rule out any type really at all.Noice.I can't actually think of a type that hates me more than the ISTJ. They tend to hate people who.. not only don't value the system, but get in the way of it. Slow it down for everyone else.

I was that kid who would forget a pencil to school every single day and my binder was full of crumpled up papers that I never even touched but kept around just in case I got the motivation to care about them one day. I really didn't care to be in class, and I was always arguing with the teachers about the points they were trying to make. And you'd better believe it was the ISTJs that would roll their eyes the most.

That being said, I disliked them for a long time. I really did; especially the older ones with their morals stuck somewhere in 1955. But over time I realized that they're endearing, in a way. They work so hard and I think deep down they're good-hearted people who just want to get ahead in life to help the people they love.

And at least they're not as arrogant as those INTJs.ENTP

* Hippies who are all about free love and state obvious things like "we need free healthcare and free food for everyone" without stating any way to actually make it happen.

* Pretty much just hippies in general, or anyone who is high and mighty about their opinions of how we all need to act to each other, while forgetting that terrible people have and always will exist in the world. Like the whole "teaching boys not to rape" thing. I'm pretty sure every rapist out there knows it's not right to do (at least by society's standards), you're not gonna tell them one day "dude rape is bad" and watch them become surprised and ashamed of themselves. Same with murderers, thieves, or anyone else.

* People who are overly focused on details

* People who say that science is the same thing as religion

* Anyone who has an opinion but has no factual or logical basis behind it

* People who can't seem to stop talking about themselves, or who take any opportunity to make the conversation about them and act like I'm not noticing they're doing it.

* People who compulsively lie about themselves or things that they do to try and seem more cool

* People who don't understand that I'm not arguing with them personally, I'm arguing with what they're saying. And I'm totally willing to accept your argument over mine if you can prove to me that it's more logical.

* People who automatically think some concept or invention of mine won't work and then proceed to give me no input as to why.I'm actually pretty sure he is. I see a bunch of Ne-Te in his speech, and all of it sounds like it's underlying Fi. He values consistency in logic, but not calculable logic like Ti.

He reminds me of IdubbzTV.Alright, well I won't try to change your mind. But I've taken to realizing that a lot of STPs on here have some sort of pocket they put Ne users into, in the sense that they're not very good at dealing with anything pertaining to reality. Including debating, I suppose.

I suppose the area I was coming from is that I had a buddy who said I reminded him a lot of Milo because of "the way I talk." I watched a few of his videos, and I concluded he was an ENFP because we talk similar, yeah, but he seemed to be coming from somewhere other than Ti.

Just something to consider, I guess. I can see ENTJ though. But if he's an S he's probably gotta be an ESFP.

edit: The reason I see Fi is because he's so loyal to the conservative right. He's very loyal to the collective image of the opinions that make up who he is, and he doesn't seem to be someone who could allow himself to change his opinions through a debate.I don't actually think in English most of the time. Or any language. The only time I actually do is when I'm doing math or programming or something. It actually helps a lot for me to talk out loud when I'm trying to figure something out.

My inner monologue for the most part consists of pictures and caricatures of ideas. Like if I'm in a car and my mind drifts off, I find that immediately my brain will go towards asking questions. Like I'll see a pile of dirt and some little idea bubbles are juggling around it, and then I'm presented with a question when I notice the "essence" of the thing is symmetrical to something else. Somehow.

So my mind kind of weaves around with these little ideas and questions and tosses new things in to build with so that I can collectively have checkpoints to connect more things to in the future. Well yeah, you are correct. My point here was not "all Ne users are untroubled and happy" but rather the stigma and the stereotype associated with that carries some sort of weight to it. I also feel inclined to disagree with the notion that Ne stays neutral. If anything Ti is the the *most* neutral function, and Fi welcomes darkness with open arms.

I've taken to noticing that Ne for sure is carried by emotions of the user, and my mind is rallying towards the thought that every function runs off of emotions as well. The curiosity and the picking and pressing of abstract issues is all driven by an internal emotional organization system that is trying to distinguish important information from lesser, irrelevant information.

Ask any Ne user about that time they were excited about something. They probably researched it for days and developed an obsession about it, constantly excited to learn more and more about this thing. I believe it's this emotional drive that Ne (or possibly any of the functions) demonstrates is the pinnacle of the point that I was trying to get at with my post here. That it will go wherever that "lack of dopamine, lack of stimulation" curiosity is taking it.

It seems that INTPs widely seem to disagree with the idea of their imagination taking them to places they don't want to, and a lot of them seem indifferent about their own mortality. Not in the same way that I am, where I talk about my mortality in a wishy-washy casual way but it soon turns into an anger-fueled existential angst when I'm alone. In my mind, this difference is probably centered around the inferior Fe in you guys, and is making it seem more clear to me that Ti is inherently the most neutral function.Well what you're saying here was precisely my point. It takes a certain amount of unprecedented effort to remain in a livable state of mind when your brain is capable of imagining dystopias and horrific conspiracy theories. The most common defense mechanism to this that I've observed seems to be humor or absurdity, which attempts to take the ammunition out of these kinds of thoughts it seems, while they can still remain accessible to look upon as a thought experiment and broaden the general outlook.

For example: My brother and I were talking about the possibility of aliens that have already interacted with our species here on Earth. So naturally, my mind is going into the realm of imagining what it would be like to meet these aliens. What their behavior would look like. Ti was mulling through things like "what are the stages of our society and what stages would these creatures likely have gone through to lead them to the point of interstellar travel" and although I eventually came to the conclusion that they would most likely be friendly or non-hostile, there were still images in my head that were giving me a looming sense of lost hope. I didn't particularly like imagining our species being seen as disposable animals, so my thoughts seemed to go towards the possibility that maybe these aliens would have a sense of humor. And from there the thoughts seemed to stay more light-hearted, and I found myself not caring about whether or not I'd ever get anally probed or whatever kind of weird-ass shit they'd be doing.

And I know we're very inclined towards anxiety and depression. I didn't mean to convey the point that we weren't.Well the function tests are the more accurate ones, typically.I think people just get offended because he reminds everyone of the kid who wouldn't pick them for his team in softball. It's interesting how people put a person's shallow demeanor before their actual judgments and opinions in regards to the political matters themselves. Or, in other words, they like someone to appear more sober than another candidate even though they have shown with their beliefs that their line of thinking contradicts this attitude. 

For example, Hillary wanting to establish a no-fly zone in Syria although everyone disagrees with her, including the USMC general; I don't think this type of pattern of thinking displays any sort of competence. In fact, it's widely accepted that an action like that could lead to nuclear war, as Syria and Russia are in kahoots with each other. I understand that she's certainly not as outrageous about stating her ideas, and her "nuance and self-awareness," as shallow and fake as it is, is somewhat refreshing. It's nice. I'm just saying it's not really real.

I don't like Trump. But I feel if you zoom out the lens enough, it all comes down to Trump's lack of political correctness vs Hillary's treason and violations of US security. It's not a good toss-up. I can definitely see where you're coming from, but if you're going to weigh the pros and cons, don't inflate some and disregard others.Well if it's any consolation, I'm not sure that Ms. Priebe here fully understands that Ne does actually interact with the environment. By her standards, I'm probably an ESTP that thinks I'm an ENTP; although I'm very certain by now that *probably* isn't the case.

The functions are able to manifest themselves in very different ways, and are able to paint diverse pictures amongst themselves. I'm not saying they aren't socially introverted ENPs out there, but I'm saying that your behavior in reference to hashing out your own functions isn't going to get you far enough because the evidence isn't conclusive enough. Evaluate *why* you think you're an Ne-dom and go from there, while ignoring behavioral patterns. For instance, think about the patterns that your mind undergoes when observing the world. Think about inferior Si, and if it sounds accurate (while maintaining a critical eye).I was actually thinking of this subreddit and how every NFP is gonna be totally butthurt about him winning. I really don't care either way, I wanna see this fuckin country burn down with me in it.

It's more exciting that way.Well if anything, they'd seem to me like more of an Fe thing.So I've had these thoughts a lot, as I'm positive I use Ne/Si but I'm also positive I use Ti more than Fe. I considered ESFJ for a long time but I believe my Ti is just too important to me, which in itself is something to think about I suppose. It's interesting to think of the functions as what you're best at, but in a lot of ways, they also manifest themselves as what you see important, and build into a general outlook on life. 

I'd say that you should introspect more about your Ti/Fe axis than the Ne/Si axis. It's taken me a lot of time to actually be able to be aware of the Ne lightbulbs I get a thousand times a day, because I find that when I don't pay attention to what I was just thinking, it fades into obscurity. It's a hard thing to actually see unless you put some time and effort into it. Ti or Fe (I imagine) is a lot easier to see in yourself if they're auxilliary and you should be able to pick apart your brain during your daily routine and find out if your pursuits are actively more Ti or Fe related. It's tricky because aux Fe users tend not to show or share their feelings too often, but you need to hone in on which ones are bouncing around in your head more. 

Do you see logical consistence as being above the feelings of other people, or do you see their feelings as something objective that is more important than the validity of what they're actually saying? I'm not saying what you *do*, or if you go out of your way to display one trait over the other, but internally - where does your mind go?__________________

FaithLast time I had a girlfriend was earlier this year. Did I love her? Yeah, she was cute. But about a month in I was already bored even though I felt like a shitty person for being bored. She always complained about how I'm "afraid to show my emotions." One day she left me, and I was actually really happy about it for a couple of months. 

She came back, then left again a little while later. I was chill again. It wasn't until a couple of months after this that I actually started missing her, but by then it was too late, and I pretty much analyzed it and realized that I probably didn't miss her, I just missed having someone around so I didn't feel lonely. But of course I'd tell myself I was above loneliness and shoot the shit with my friends, and of course try to focus on my projects in the garage and whatever else.That sounds really rough. I know that MBTI isn't a universal discourse for translating the trials and tribulations of life, but it really does sound like your Fe is kind of breaking off of the leash here. I'm not saying that you should be better than feelings, but it really helps to take the ammunition out of the negative ones when you have Ti backing you up.

I feel for ya. I really do. I do think, however, that you need to start viewing these observations you make as objective and refrain from adding connotations to them. The problem with Ne is that if you have nothing to "land on" objectively, then you have nothing to sort out the intuition. You can't dissect it with accuracy, so it just festers, and a lot of the time in some very unpleasant ways.

When you get good enough at it (the objectivity), you can dismiss any byproduct of social stigma (such as embarrassment) as nothing but another arbitrary and primitive outdated system that gets in the way of what you want to do. And then when you get rejected by girls, or if they don't seem interested while you're throwing some banter their way, you can use that fake Fe to give them a look that says "Jesus Christ you are making this awkward" so that the other person always feels like they're doing this whole social interaction thing wrong. It pretty much always works. 

If you ever start to feel embarrassed about anything the next day, you can just remind yourself that those emotions and the emotions of others that are causing you to feel embarrassed are primordial neurotransmitters that are distracting everyone from the inevitable truth that none of this shit really matters anyway. And then you can pretty much do whatever the fuck you want after that.

Also, reading over this, it's probably pretty good to study what are known as "charming" behaviors and just get really good at emulating it, while keeping this mindset intact and treating the whole thing as an objective. Or maybe a fun game, like social chess or something.I know right? I never even knew they had a blue flair.See the "wit" and banter is what I find annoying. I could go swimming in a lake in Chernobyl and then fall asleep in front of an x-ray machine and still get less cancer and radiation poisoning than I get from r/entp. I don't think anyone loves ENTPs more than ENTPs, and that annoys the shit outta me. There are a few cool ones but for the most part, they're just tumors. 

They're all just in a competition to be some caricature of the ENTP that they parade around because they're all disillusioned by their enormous ego that says "Tony Stark? Hell yeah I'm just like him" and then proceed to start a thread about how ENTP is the most introverted extrovert, so as great as they are, don't expect them to actually *act* like the depiction that they hold so dearly. Just expect them to still keep the benefits though, like an unnecessary and pathetic grab at an ego boost.

Go on there right now. Look at this post, posted 3 hours ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5dn2rx/entps_are_like_the_universe_thats_why_we_are_the/

Do you see the sheer, unadulterated arrogance coming from that post? It's poised with such raw naked vulnerability, as if they're biologically dependent on this recognition to provide them with the sustenance they need to survive. Like constantly beckoning for some tit from society to just invariably suck on, but in a wormy, parasitic fashion.

Also, the edginess, cruelty, and trolls are at least funny. You gotta give em that.Well, I'm 18. Anyone could probably see that when they look at my comments because they probably have some flavor of pretentiousness that resembles a young kid who gets off on acting like he's better than everyone else.

Anyway; I believed myself to be an ESTP for a long time, and I've got nothing against them. I have at least 5 or 6 good ESTP friends that I go out and drink and party with, and they're honestly some really fuckin' funny people. Also, in regards to a post I just made, I hate other ENTPs. At least the ones online. So to answer the question of if I think that the sensor variant is less interesting, I'd have to say absolutely not. Not at all. More narrow minded? Eh. We always tend to arrive at the same conclusions, but I suppose you could say we see the world in two irrespective directions.

I actually sometimes get annoyed with intuitives in general because as you may have noticed, there's a lot of stigma surrounding functions like Si and Se, so the people who use Ni and Ne oftentimes adopt somewhat of a "holier-than-thou" attitude. And a lot of the time it comes across as more of a "I'm creative and smart and mystical, but man it sucks being an intuitive because of *input minor inconvenience right here*." You see what they're doing? It's like an unabashed pretentiousness that allows them to keep their individuality and at the same time falsely convey the image of humility. I don't particularly care for it.

On a related note, I can tell you that if you read the intuitive and sensor descriptions side by side to any teenager in our current society, most of them are going to relate more to the intuitive side. Anyone with a brain stem can pick up on the praise around traits like "being weird" and "being deep" or "spiritual" in our current age group. Between meme garbage and all of the psychedelics these kids are taking, you're pretty much going to have a generation that isn't necessarily striving to be intuitive, but striving to have the traits that we associate with intuition in our lovely MBTI fashion.

I'd say that your intuition (ironically) is correct.I always remember my dreams after I wake up, usually with really vivid detail. They never really have a very structured plotline, just something new will happen and it will be a newly established rule that tries to play itself off like it makes sense. And usually I believe it like some kind of fuckin' idiot.

Sometimes they're cheeky hitchhiker's guide style dreams with a narrator and funny sci-fi undertones. Like this one I had about this expedition I went to another dimension with Bo Burnham and Robin Williams, and Stephen Fry was narrating about the various things we encountered. It was kind of a Willy Wonka chocolate factory type thing, and there were these people who lived in tea that we had to shrink down to observe and talk to. Was some weird stuff.

Usually they play out kinda like that, there are almost always creatures or aliens that I end up talking to and meeting up with; sometimes the dreams are pretty dark in that regard. Nightmares happen less often than the weird cheeky ones but when they do happen, they can usually get pretty insidious with dark, sinister undertones. A lot of them are centered around me noticing I'm in a dream, but rather than telling myself I'm dreaming I assume I'm going insane; these ones usually end with me screaming or yelling on the floor with everyone trying to help me out somehow.

Then there's sleep paralysis, happens every so often. Those can end up in time loops where I fight it to get out of bed, and then notice I'm still dreaming so I'm reset back where I was. Those are never fun. Don't have em as much as I used to, but every once in a while I do.

And on one last final note, about 10% of my dreams are just me analyzing ideas in my head. If I'm really into politics at the time, it'll be about politics, or if I'm really into C++, the dream itself will be in C++. Or at least me trying to figure something out in C++. Sometimes they'll be in math. But they usually garner pictures and concepts that are being tossed around, and I can feel it whirring around. I only have these dreams when I leave my lamp on, which I'm guessing is because I keep going in and out of REM sleep.Debating with an ESTP is definitely interesting. Almost entirely the same energy coming from both of us, but I always throw in analogies and say things like "any time you debate about (said topic at the time), you're going to end up addressing (this), which means your creating an environment for (this)" and so on and so forth. They always become frustrated because they feel that I'm straying off-topic when in my mind I'm actually zeroing in on the core of the idea as precisely as I can.I'm opposite of the WaffleSingSong guy. Casual in day to day occurrences and dealing with surface level conversation. Then, when I get heated, I talk very fast. Very common thing for me to feel like I can't talk fast enough to say all of the things I want to say at once, which is even more frustrating over a platform that involves typing.

A lot of it really depends on who I'm talking to, and the attitude of the conversation in general. I guess I'd say most of the time, I do talk fast, but the hyperspeed thing only happens when I'm legitimately baffled by how retarded the adjacent person in a conversation is sounding.Strange things can arouse this certain dark, insidious area of the brain.. not necessarily horrifying, but definitely eerie; a kind of uneasyness that comes from having to deal with the cognitive dissonance of not having an answer to something, like now you have to explore the depths of how far it will go, and you don't know if you'll like what you find - but you just kinda have to do it, because there's that morbidly curious part of you that needs to see.

So when exploring these things and the questions that arise from them, there has to be a button you can press to kind of opt out. In my case, and perhaps the case of the ENTP, the first defense mechanism appears to be humor. If you zoom out the lense far enough, everything around just becomes these abstract ideas, like the familiarity of them is clouding you from being able to see what they really are - similar to the semantic satiation you experience from saying a word over and over.

The humor works because the absurdity of it all can only be experienced so many different ways: you can let it separate you from everything and everyone, or you have to separate yourself from it. This would be via humor, logic, anger, etc.. In the case of the ENTP it seems to go down a linear pathway, eventually leading to something along the lines of a mental breakdown. It's just not necessarily possible, or at least easy, to have your cake and eat it too.I'm not sure if this qualifies, but I've heard mine called a "shit-eating grin" more than anything.I like memes, but I absolutely despise people who turn everything into a meme. You know, the tumblrfags? What absolutely pathetic attention-grabbing pieces of garbage. Filthy Frank gets a pass because he's basically just trolling, which I find hilarious.INFP starry eyes. Blank and lost. Like a black hole.

Also noticed an NTJ stare. They're not even looking at you, they're looking right through you. Weird living with 2 of them. A lot of the time they can actually repeat verbatim what you were saying even though it looked like they were off somewhere else.

Will also testify to u/GeneralSaturn's observation of the STJ brow furrow. They also answer a lot of questions with "it depends" even when you're not looking for a specific answer.

I've also noticed ESTPs and INFJs both have a kind of reserved yet paranoid, narrow look in their eyes when engaging with ambiguous situations. Although I have this too, I'm told.

Oh yeah, and ISFJs always have this look in their eyes where their bottom eyelids are partway up and it feels very warm and endearing. In general their facial expressions are very on board and agreeable.Nihilist. The universe may hold a plethora of mystery within it, but the underlying principle that hides underneath every discovery we make is the primordial fact that everything is made up of something else, and everything that happens is purely mechanical. In essence. 


The universe is just one big computer to me. Things like love, happiness, hope, they're all nice, but they don't actually tell us anything. I think that to scientifically understand our universe, they don't serve much real purpose. Do they serve a purpose in reaching serenity? In learning things about the dynamic of human behavior? Sure. But can you trust your emotional instincts to tell you how a computer works? How quasars were formed? Absolutely not. And frankly, I care more about that than finding any sort of serenity in myself.

That and the universe is really just a big fuckin joke. You zoom out the lense and every time it just screams "this doesn't actually mean anything." My life is comprised of finding new ways to escape the existential dread, as angsty as that sounds.My ENFP friend and I are actually amazing at spotting stereotypes and going off on tangents with them. Like noticing a certain underlying principle to something we're doing or seeing and then imagining a story centered around it, making it as stereotypical and predictable as possible to show how unoriginal and stupid life in general is.

An example would be that one of us would notice any particular person who seems to fit a mold of society, like for instance, a woman with three kids who seems to be trying to juggle all of them at once. We'd expand upon this by giving her a name, coming up with a story of how she expected her life would play out, talking about how this isn't what she expected when she went to law school and now her husband is gone three times a week on "business" trips, ultimately leading to, I don't know, her throwing all of her husband's shit on the lawn like in the movies. 

And then we'd start talking about her husband Bill or whatever, who really didn't want any of this and is looking for some way out because his kids are probably whiney and annoying and his wife isn't nearly as attractive as she was when they got married but now he can't say anything because he's tried before and it always leads to arguments, which he's just too tired to deal with anymore, so he just keeps giving these subtle hints by distancing himself which she picks up on, making her want to eat more because how dare he would make her feel unattractive, blah blah blah...

Sometimes it feels more like Si than Ne because of all the references being made, but I guess it's more about the final result being this messy conglomerate of theatricals and stereotypes that, after some speculation on my part, doesn't seem quite neat enough to be high Si and low Ne.Do you agree more with the Te-INTp or the Ni-INTp description?More of a socionics description, but still very accurate. The Ti one. http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/types/ILE-ENTp/subtypes/

It mentions a lot of things that hit home, like "rather self centered," "speaks rapidly and usually in a categorical tone," "in cases where he has been proven wrong, can find it hard to admit it," "painfully experiences uncertainty in relationships, mistrustful of feelings." The physical description is pretty on point too, as I'm tall and lanky and my gait is rather swinging.

I've noticed most of the ENTPs on here are of the cheeky, pun-loving-fun-loving variety. Are there any around here that resonate with the description I mentioned?Gonna be honest, I do this all the time. Bud more often than buddy though. And yes, some people do find it condescending but I never actually realized that until it became a habit for me. I usually have to explain afterwards that I wasn't meaning to come off like a dick.Yeap, I definitely do the nickname thing. Like if someone's name is William and they introduce themselves like that, I'll eventually digress into "Come on Will! Billy Bob! Billy Jim! I know you wanna take some shots with me right bud!"

Also I've noticed that INFPs hate this while ISFJs are the opposite.God damn this sounds way too English, somehow you guys all ramble the same way when talking about your friend groups.

Anyway, I will say that it's probably unlikely that all of these people are actually the type they tested as. I know you found two different tests and whatever, but something about it all doesn't sound right to me. I'm guessing you all are in college, yeah? Like English college, not American college. What I'm saying is though that something about this all feels extremely Fe, and I'd absolutely expect there to be more Fe users in a group like the one you're describing. And the questions you ask as well as the way you go about presenting them, not to mention the entire core of the post here feels very Fe-Ne.

I'll still answer the questions though.

1. Lots of extroverts/lots of introverts in a group is common

2. Yeah, people generally get along with individuals who have similar function stacks

3. I don't care about who is going to fall out in your group, but I'd say whoever sleeps with Sophie first.

4. Predictions? Sophie will get syphilis from giving a blowie to the fittest football player on the team and then either you or James will get it from her, which will mean that Hank will find out and probably tell the headmaster on you or something. I'm guessing Hank has a thing for Sophie.

5. I don't know. Literally all of you sound like ESFJs, so probably an ESFJ.Woah are you like.. a superhero?Harry is a rare breed of ISTJ, very similar to Katniss from Hunger Games.

Ron seems to be an ESFP, but he could also probably be an ENFP.

Hermione's absolutely an ESTJ.

Dumbledore is an xNFJ.

Snape is an ISTJ.. probably.

Sirius is an ESTP.I once heard a theory that you're secretly attracted to your 7th/8th functions which rings true to me. Relationships with them don't work out, but I find ESFPs to be pretty sexy ngl. If sex were a universally trainable skill, they'd be the best at it.Could even be an ENTP, because a lot of this sounds like me. But still I'd say that you're an ESTP because of your attraction to wealth and business as well as the fact that you don't enjoy science or math, the latter being the biggest difference I see between my ESTP friends and I. You do sound hella fun to drink with though.I agree with you completely, he is absolutely an ISFJ or some sort of very mild-mannered ESFJ. Unfortunately, however, I think there are too many ENTPs here that relate to him and kinda *want* him to be an ENTP.Which seems really unfair because (and this might be a sweeping generalization but) the people who put their types on tinder profiles are most likely SJ's who tested as some sort of N on celebtypes or 16personalities or something.

To me, as I'm thinking about it, you're just one of the honest ones who actually took time to navigate through the haze of intuitive-biased descriptions and actually be humble enough to rise above it. I respect that a lot, but it's unfortunate that all of the people who barely understand typology won't even have the capacity to respect it.I understand this is kind of a fickle subject, as any topic that relies on rough correlations through mbti is. But I will say I absolutely think that some types are more likely to be religious than others, and if you think otherwise then you're just ignoring patterns and trying to give people more credit in being individualistic than they actually really have.

The obvious answer would be that Si types are the most religious. This isn't to say that they aren't free thinkers, but rather they put their trust in things that have made an impact over a long period of time. Si users with Fe will usually trust their beliefs based on general consensus with what's around them, meaning they're likely to adopt the religion that is most prominent in their area. Si users with Fi will usually go through some kind of rebellious phase, but they typically always have some sort of revelation down the line and begin developing their morals around what they always deep down believed to be true, which is the tried-and-true religious system that was likely introduced to them at a young age. They like to build their life around it as a sort of reformation and then expel anything and anyone that doesn't fit into their general outlook.

Ti is the least likely to produce a religious person, and if you meet a religious Ti-user, I promise you that they were raised that way (or maybe, and this is very rare, but they're going through some kind of crisis and are finding Fe resolution in the community of the church). Ti seems to care more about dissecting the truth on their own without resolving to clean-cut simple answers that something like an organized religion would provide. I'd also argue that Ne, given its ability to see things through alternate perspectives and Ti's ability juggle them all and see every perspective as hypothetically possible makes the xNTP the type least likely to subscribe to an organized religion. And in my own person experience and speculation, the INTP is more likely to be agnostic, not wanting to draw conclusions on something as static as "where did we come from" without proper evidence, whereas the ENTP is more likely to be nihilistic and atheist. The difference here most likely lies within the stages that they go through during the reasoning process.Actually, u/Aurarus has arrived to the conclusion that the I/E flipped variant of your auxiliary function is going to be the strongest of your shadow functions, and I'm inclined to agree with him. It makes sense if you think of how functions develop over time, and how your second function in a lot of ways is more tactile than your first one.

When you think about it this way, his results seem to sway much more in the INTP direction.Jeez.I think we have such a nice dynamic though, like opposite sides of the same coin. The only problem is that I'm just not very good at being able to tell if an ISFJ is doing their whole "I'll do it but I don't want to" kinda thing when they agree to do something. It's funny because normally I can kinda tell with anyone, but the ISFJ attitude doesn't seem to waver at all so there's no basis for comparison. Unless you guys are really angry, that's pretty easy to see.

I do love ISFJs though, and I think if you find an ENTP that you can communicate thoroughly with then you might see that it works out pretty nicely; we balance each other out.Holy fuckIf I'm speaking for myself, I'm 99% sure that I'm an Ne-dom and my intuition has no problems saturating itself into a sensory environment. Which would include parties.Human beings are most certainly not complex or wholesome creatures, it's probably just possible that you arrived to that conclusion because you have an ideology of life that allows you to see the best in people. But the truth is, most people are damn predictable. If you know enough about a person, you can pretty much guess what they would do in any given situation, or predict how they're going to react to any phrase you throw at them.

Something about you makes me think that you probably go around life deciphering these deep convoluted intricacies in people all around you. "Oh, this person is upset about so and so? There must be so much to this I don't know, he must be going through something *so* deep and interesting." You remind me of someone who hates categories because you probably believe everyone is special and they deserve more credit than that. Not because you aren't able to plot out special behaviors or worldviews from non-special ones in your own right, but moreso because you can't distinguish what makes someone's outlook on life statistically special and just assume that because a person has their own opinions and a complex life behind them that it must mean they're commendable to get the "I'm an individual, I can't be categorized" award.

Of course it's fuckin obvious that the theory doesn't literally account for all of the elaborateness and diversity that is found in behaviors among the entire human population, but it's also not promising that. A illogical INTP isn't unlike others of their type, the type is in no way saying that this person must be objectively logical. The type itself sets ground rules, and anomalies aren't exempt from them; they're just a manifestation that isn't seen as often. The "why" behind the behavior is the same. That's all the cognitive functions are claiming to do.I know this sounds like a bit of a stretch, but in a lot ways he seems to be an ISTJ with very heavy Fi, which can make them look like a stern, hard-headed INFP with some misguided Ne weirdness.

Interesting. Mine is really similar but it's egotistical in a different way. I get the same feeling when I'm in an environment with people and I can tell that my words are coming out extremely quick and articulate, and where I grasp onto what the other parties are throwing out with enough precision that I can accurately guess what they're going to say before they say it, and already having a counterweight to throw against it.

Maybe mine comes from the same place, but rather my ego wants people to see me as the "well-versed" or "smart" one. Do you ever get those? Because I know from time to time I do make an effort to get the "funny" one as well.ENFP would be an introverted feeler though?Well, in my city there's an enneagram meetup thing once a month downtown. I've been a couple a times (it was my first exposure to any kind of personality-typing paradigm) and it's mostly older people who are trying to find out more about themselves and their families. Ultimately pretty boring because you can't play around with it like you can with cognitive functions.

There was also no social elitism that I could see, but we're also talking about a much older crowd (40-60) than what would be seen on a college campus.My dreams are very different and very scattered, but if we're talking recurring themes.. there is one, but it doesn't happen too often. And so far I've found a couple of people who have noticed this as well.

Have you guys ever been in your dream (and usually somewhere indoors) and suddenly notice that you're alone? Like you may have been alone a while but I'm talking about when you look around and you actually *notice* it. Something happens where I suddenly start to notice this very eerie tone to everything. As if something bad is about to happen, or as if I'm about to go insane, or that I'm about to be toyed with by some supernatural evil force. if any of you have seen Black Mirror, I'd say the feeling could probably be summed up by the "playtest" episode.

I'm not really too sure what it is, but it almost seems like a very instinctual feeling. So far only other Fe users have agreed with me that it's a thing they experience in their dreams.best*It's nice but I can't stay in bed with a girl too long or else I get really bored. My ISFJ girlfriend is definitely more physically affectionate than I am, but in public I do a lot of goofy-type ass slaps and other gay shit. I've always been like that with whoever I'm dating.I'm a firm believer that you can say almost anything without coming across the wrong way, it's mostly just about delivery. Obviously there are lines you can cross, but even then, if you throw a disclaimer out there first (e.g. "I know this might not always be the case," "I know not everyone will agree with me.") then people will usually give you the benefit of the doubt.

With awkward subjects, you have to have this almost hyper-meta awareness of how the situation looks on a grand scale. For example, if someone found some weird porn in your search history, you have to joke about it. You have to be relatable. Most of all you have to convey that you know how it *looks.* You can defend yourself on just about anything as long as you have a logical argument, because most people just won't bother to keep up with it. They concede and then the audience pretty much dismisses them entirely.I've watched a couple of the videos on this channel now, and I do agree that they're all filled with Fe and Ti. They all have a very categorical tone of "this is what this is, let me show you the example and how it ties into system." But let me explain why I think the whole thing is Ne-Fe and not the other way around.

ESFJ is probably the only other type I could really be, so through my self analysis, I've tried to section off the key differences, and I think the biggest one is the difference of Ti. Something about all of these videos seem so logistically analytical, like they're very centered on defining these conclusions.

When I watch a movie or a TV show, I'll oftentimes do the exact same thing that this channel does (I'll sometimes even pause it to get everyone involved), and I notice it starts with the general conclusion. I'll see it, and I'll pick up on a theme. I'll start to feel this underlying repetition going on, like I'm trying to define what the structure is in a broad sense. In a "fill-in-the-blanks" sense. From there, I think "okay, does my intuition match up? Let's look for examples. Let's see if I'm right." I do the same thing when I'm learning about math, or if I'm researching something, or if I'm typing someone. It's always about figuring out what the "theme" is (like if you remember from your post about r/starterpacks. Once I have the theme down I feel that I can go ahead and make up stories, because it's going to fit the same structure. It is, however, pretty instantaneous.)

These videos, as I'm seeing them, have a structure of "let's find the theme" and then "let's take examples and then define how they fit into the theme." I think they use Fe as a way to look outward, to almost "relate" to the characters or person the video is centered around. As a kind of "I understand where this person is coming from because I've been there." High Fe users will approach someone and be interested in anything they're talking about, like if someone says "I'm into baseball" the Fe user will suddenly turn into the side of them that's always kinda liked baseball.

The difference is with Ne in front of the Fe, it becomes more about categorization. These videos remind me of what it feels like when I'm arguing with someone. I'll listen to what they're saying and I have background Ne going everywhere, but the Fe is the first thing to latch on. When someone says something a little light in my head goes "oh yeah, I know what they're getting at" and almost digging up the part of me that once had the same thought process. This, I think, is directly adjacent to the baseball example I used earlier. It isn't until after that that Ti comes in and I get ready to shut down what they're saying.

The videos seem to be alpha quadra for sure, but if they're ESFJ then I must be ESFJ.If casual sex is still allowed then I'd definitely say ambition all the wayHaha nopeAs I watched this, I was definitely tied between inferior Se and dominant Si. But as the narrator said, "In the words of David Lynch, 'I don't know why people expect art to make sense, when they accept the fact that life doesn't make sense.'"

At this point it had me thinking about the recurring theme. I believe that from what I've seen, it only makes sense to surmise that these worlds that Tarkovsky creates were intended to have a poetically stagnant flavor. I don't think he intends for these sensory visuals and sounds to be deciphered, or that they even can be deciphered, except through the lens of Fe. To accept that they are stagnant because it depends on the feelings of who is experiencing them.

As I see it, he puts the sensory details in there to float around and express an entire grandiose picture while still nodding to the fact that if you try to find an answer, you won't. This tells me that Ni is most likely not at play here, as the Ni user would be present, taking these things in and zeroing in on the meaning.

Si-Fe all the way.Haha this sounds like an ESFP to meMentally, I made a table of all 16 types in order from most likely to least likely as far as which one I actually am. I still brush over the list every once in a while, but I found it helps when you first establish which types you definitely are NOT. And then hone in why you aren't those types, dig deeper into it.

Study the function axes a bunch. Realize how it's easier to mistype an ESFJ as an ENTP than an ENTJ as an ENTP. Also, keep going over that list. Take a step back from your thoughts and analyze them, and account for everything. Looking at behavior can be good for reaffirming your suspicions, but don't start with that. Never use behavior as something to build off of, just use it to polish off your results.

You absolutely need to make sure you dissect the functions as what they are at their core rather than just learning traits about them. When you can thoroughly define each one in a few sentences, you're  probably good to apply it to yourself with a decent amount of accuracy. It's all speculation followed by a lengthy process of elimination from there.

Good luck to ya.Fuckin' savage m8This was written by someone with Fi, I can tell by the idealistic caricatures and the specific "lack of soul" that they've put on the ENTP with polr FI.

Or that's my guess, anyway.

But yeah these are all too optimistic to me. I think the person who made this views the types through rose-tinted lenses.Alright, so.. I'm going to try to break this down best I can.

Everyone puts on a certain persona to interact with different groups, or even to interact with different situations; sometimes even to interact with themselves. These personas aren't meant to be taken as gospel when trying to distinguish someone's type. They're unreliable because they tend to differentiate so dramatically.

An emphasis on people isn't substantial evidence, and neither are the other attributes you've listed. I'm absolutely certain I'm NeTi and I spend a LOT of my time thinking about people. I do it all the time, and I see a lot of xNTPs doing it a lot too. And ENTPs especially love people, I just so happen to be one of the ones that's constantly upset by how inconsistent the vast majority of them are.

Ne absolutely obsesses itself with one idea at a time, by the way. It just looks like a bunch of different ideas because they seem different on the outside, but if you pull away the sheets, you'll see they're all pretty much comprised of the same idea. These will all be grouped together until it moves onto the next thing, and the amount of time taken is different depending on the commitment and investment in the idea.

As for predicting, I do it all the time. I'm always predicting. You can probably ask any of the NTPs here and they'll say the same thing.

From what you've said, this person very well may be an INFJ. But they are just as likely, if not more to be an ENTP. Or an ESTP. Or even an ESFJ.Fuckin christ..Huh. This is one of those things that I've experienced so many times but never made the connection to attribute it to a function. 

Also, kind of unrelated but you ever find yourself doing MDMA, these realizations will hit you like a brick. Weirdest feeling.Eh... ESTJs wouldn't even bother with entertaining the question in that much detail. They'd probably just be like "Idk fuckin what if??"Which is interesting, because in turn I become an ESTP when I'm drunk.I live with one of each, and this sounds pretty accurate. You can also see the bottom two functions in both of them as well, the ESTJ having this weird side of them that likes poetry and history with the ENTJ having this almost teeny tiny buddhist spiritual thing.

Also from what I've seen, ESTJs have this front of being loud and barky but then when you catch them at the right time they're so emotional about their family and shit; ENTJs on the other hand are more cool in day to day encounters, and typically really polite. When you catch *them* at the right time, you're still not seeing much. They keep that shit locked tight.It might be because I'm always ranting, but I'd say I'm pretty linguistically proficient. The right words seem to pop into my head as I'm saying them. The organization of the sentences and the the circumnavigation of the idea is never too great, but the words always seem to be fine.I can testify that I have been kicked out of multiple partiesI just got out of jail and I can confirm I met a lot of ESxPs. I'm not sure I met anyone there who wasn't an SP of some kind.

Actually, I think there was an ESTJ or two.1. A shit ton
2. Looks like shit
3. Tell them they look like shit
4. Always late as shitFi is more about justice and taking action (Se) or coming up with ideologies (Ne) and is for certain more justice-centered. There's a pretty common stereotype with the xSFPs in regards to them always being so obsessed with revenge.

Fe, if anything, has no specific moral standards other than the ones society or the culture of the region has put into place and would be way more likely to empathize and sympathize with the oppressor. Especially when paired with Ni.Haha I'm chill with ESTP. ExTP is always my guess, one or the other.Hahaha fuckin' brilliant!

Also, a lot of "I think I see what you're getting at here" followed by an attempt to condense the other person's argument into a sentence."yeah, right. nah, for sure. For suuuuuure man."Also: "How intriguing."There's a certain breed of space dandy/Greg Heffley-esque ESTPs that are pretty nerdy but also somehow still ESTPs.https://mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/

Depends where you look.ISFJs don't get enough credit, I don't think. Si and Fe seem to manifest themselves in these mysterious, serene atmosphere. Like static. Things happening, things making impressions, things standing out for no particular reason among some kind of fog.

It seems like you guys have a lot of trouble conveying all of it, but when I hashed out an idea, it became very interesting to me. It sounds like life to you guys is a coddled pool of experiences that actually aren't supposed to mean anything - it's up to the observer to give meaning to it. Which seems intrinsically true, to me at least.ESTJ: Overly concerned about everything but only show it through anger

ISTJ: Has lots of emotions but only expresses them through trying to provide for people they care about

ESFJ: Is secretly worried that no one cares about them or their issues

ISFJ: See everything but too nice to pick sides

ENFP: Wants to be loved, afraid of being unwanted

INFP: Worried that they're lost and everyone else knows some secret to life that they don't

ENFJ: Thinks they're always doing the best for people but they're just using them to further their secret agenda

INFJ: Afraid of losing all objectivity and being lost somewhere they can't get out of

ENTP: No comment

INTP: Constantly worrying about how they express themselves and will consistently crave validation but won't do anything to get it

ENTJ: Secretly afraid they're a fraud

INTJ: Care too much about the world while pretending they don't

ESTP: Worry about not making a mark or any kind of lasting impression

ISTP: Feelings don't work for them so they avoid them

ESFP: Always try to "make their own path" but when they run into trouble, they realize they're not as independent or strong as they think they are

ISFP: Afraid of being weak but deep down always think they areI've heard a phrase from multiple Fi types where they say they have an alter-ego in their head of the version of themselves that they want to be. Lots of INxJs here online are probably actually IxFPs.

Fe wants to be cool and it'll go for the type that sounds the coolest. There are probably a decent amount of ESFJs on here that claim ENxP.

Si is explained terribly everywhere and people never seem to grasp it as a result, leaving the most 2-dimensional and uninteresting descriptions to steer the ISxJs away from their true identity. I kinda don't even blame them. You gain more respect in Ni-land.

&gt; People who assume they are a type that they are not, why do you do it?

If I am actually an ESTP or an ESFJ, I keep the flair up because I can talk shit about ENTPs without sounding like too much of an asshole.Here is the ENTP smirk as I get ready to merk some loser

http://imgur.com/a/a9FBa

Why though? This isfp conflict thing is a very real part of my life, I'm extremely curious.I don't really see it working, but after reading all of these comments I suppose that might just be me.

Being with someone of your own type sounds like it would be too predictable and wouldn't give you enough variety in the conversation. The perspectives would all generally be the same and there would be no real learning experience.

Also, due to the fact that you would both be so similar, it makes sense to think that eventually the differences would stand out more. They'd probably become the living manifestation of everything you hate about yourself. 

Which, funnily enough, is exactly what I see whenever I see ENTPs on here.Masters degree in internet retardologyFuckin' Neil Degrasshole Tyson again. The ENFJ that turned science into a pretentious mystical sesspool.

Chemically we are connected to the universe, that's cool. Comprised of the same elements. Nice. Our DNA spans generations down the infinite line of code passed down by our ancestors over billions of years of evolution. Also cool.

But there is no meaning to life, and the universe is under no obligation to give us meaning. It just is what it is. We're a catalyst of genes trying to pass on a primordial code that is, in every essence, more important than we the individuals are. Love isn't real, happiness isn't real, this weird bullshit feeling of being "connected to the universe," that ain't real either.

You set yourself up for disappointment when you believe in shit like that.What is your relationship with the present? Are you always engaged with it, or do you see it as being attached to the past and the future? When you zone out, is it because you're mulling something over in your head or because you're daydreaming?

Why do you feel bored so easily? What is the feeling of being bored like to you?Is it a joke that you're an ESFJ now or are you serious?From what I've seen here, you come across as having a lot of Fe and Ne (not necessarily in that order). You definitely have way more Fe than I do, but I guess that could be chalked up to the patriarchy or whatever. Or maybe I'm not very developed as I'm still a young lil shit.

Either way, how much Ti do you see yourself using on the daily?I've noticed SFP types like parties where there isn't a lot of socializing going on. Just loud music and dancing.

ExTPs on the other hand, ime, always go for the house parties where you can chat people up and kid around with em. Places where they can tell their stories or just joke around.

Probably an Fi vs Fe thing, right?Yeah he's ENFP for sure.ENTPs are super guilty of the whole "I like you! You must be the same type as me!" kind of thing.

INFJs are too. They'll talk to any level-headed introverted person with empathy and BAM must be INFJ.INFPChristian Bale's character seemed to be an INTP or something. Something about him being barefoot and listening to a bunch of metal, along with his description of how he's terrible at socializing all sounded like tert Si and inf Fe to me.

Steve Carrel's character was an ENTP, I'm pretty sure.

I agree with the Ryan Gosling one. Very professional ESTP.

And yeah, I could see the Brad Pitt one too.So the inspirational quotes thing seems really xSFP to me. They have this thing where they need a medium to express their inner emotions and opinions and whatever, rather than just outright expressing it themselves. I don't know why though.

Maybe something to do with Se being so advantageous of the moment with Fi only being able to express itself through the guise of Se.I would have to agree that my political beliefs are mainly centered around disassembling and criticizing beliefs that resonate with the Fi crowds. Specifically the xSFP crowds.xNFJs are power grabbing, man. It's a pretty legitimate stereotype.Really quiet, barely says anything. Sometimes has this weird awkward smile. Might plot to slap someone at the end of the night who pissed them off that one time.
Damn ethnics with their feelings ruining this countryYeah.Your teacher sounds ESTPAmerica is super ESFP. The Fi is real in the culture here.Si is more subconscious about it though isn't it? I was always under the impression that Si users have very little to do with which things rub them which way. Even a super judgmental ISTJ will be nitpicky about someone's behavior and hate them, but their reasoning never seems very logically sound.ISFJs are kind of compulsive about helping people, and a lot of it may have to do with Si creating environments that people enter and engage in; Si and Fe would feel inclined to make the environment comfortable for the people who are in this "bubble" of Si. And it's not a very conscious effort, they typically don't have a lot of rationale for helping people, they do it because it feels right. They're attempting to create a harmonious environment, hence why they dislike rude or obscene behavior, arguing, etc. They don't want someone else to become uncomfortable. It's not that you've said something that offends them personally, it's that you said something that might offend someone and prevent them from feeling comfortable within the Si bubble. If the Si bubble is hectic and mean and falling apart, they begin to feel like their entire life is spiraling out of control.

INFJs on the other hand are more concerned with Ni which is going to have a vision of "but where is this all going? What are we working for, guys?" They care about people being harmonious so that we can set aside our differences and work together for some sort of grander scheme. They put a lot of faith into people for this reason, but as they get older, I've found they kinda give up on the dream. Reality hits ya.
"Sensitive souls who like to dream about their perfect future in their head"

Sounds ISFJ to meOkay so, unpopular opinion but Azula certainly had Fe. She was very adept at noticing the social conduct of individuals and picking up on emotions, she seemed to be all over it all the time. And she was for sure an extrovert, too.

I'd peg her as a sociopathic ENFJ, kinda like Hannibal Lecter.His voice is very very INFJ, I could see him possibly being an ISFJ but altogether you can see the Fe in his eyes, and something about his voice has that solemn plodding to it, monotone, friendly, and careful. Very IxFJ.It is odd because *spoiler alert* most of the INFJs on here are IxFPs.

Saying a high Fe user is a loner is like saying a high Te user likes to fuck around and not get anything done.Arthur and Ford for sure had that classic ISFJ-ENTP thing goin on didn't they?I think everyone agrees that introverted types are typically more socially introverted. This thread here is discussing which introverted type is most reclusive, which wouldn't be an Fe type and doesn't make sense to think it would be either.That honestly is a legitimately dumb question.It does come up very rarely in my case, but I don't relate to any of the social anxiety comics or memes on the internet.

Anyway, I think one thing to consider, especially in a subreddit like this, is that some extroverted types aren't socially extroverted, and therefore aren't as adept at dealing with social interactions.

Makes sense to think quite a few of em would have social anxiety.I get that OP is harmless and all, but this post gives off an aura of elitism and condescension. It also just sounds really stupid.ENTJs typically don't talk fast. They say what they need to say, and almost always wait to assure the other person is listening before they get into it.

They're a quiet kind of aggressive, but by no means are they loud or quick with what they say.I suppose I do understand that INFJs can be 4's, but Fe is just so anti-individualistic that I don't see them being the poster child for an enneagram 4.This is some Fi shit right here, you sound like you recoiled into some kind of anti-feeling shell. That's not what Ti is.

Just because you forced yourself to stop having feelings doesn't make you a thinker, that's pretty retarded. This post is retarded.With your purchase comes a free front page appearance via r/cringe!I have an ISTJ friend just like this. One of my favorites of his was a response he gave to his mom.

"Andrew, you're gonna lose that computer if you don't do your homework!"

"I'm not gonna lose it mom, it's right here!"I don't see an INTJ ever making a post like this. What even is this?Hahahaha what the fuck is thisMarkiplier is an ENFP.Fi is a garbage function and I will continue to fuck around just because it pisses off people like you.I tend to think of ISFJs and INFJs being almost identical in the way they go about interacting with people and presenting themselves. You never see an ISFJ with eccentric clothing or dyed hair, and that's entirely because of the Fe. They don't like standing out.

This being said, why would anyone expect INFJs to not follow this rule? Because of Ni? That really doesn't have anything to do with it, Ni is a perceiving function. It doesn't hold or create opinions or "tastes" in things, like clothing or music or hair color.But honestly INFJs are really secretly judgmental too. Fe, man, I tell ya.Auxiliary functions do not derive from the primary function, by which I mean Ni does not "create" Fe in the INFJ. Ni works as a guise through which Fe navigates, applying itself where it naturally fits into the grander Ni map. They synergize and blend together in a lot of ways, but that doesn't mean that Fe is a part of or a result of Ni.

Fe is still its own function, it can be defined and there are still axioms that you can hash out no matter where it's applied. These definitions are what hold the entire system together, and I think for this reason it's important not to get too caught up in the mindset of "oh, well these two types may both have this function im tjis position but it's totally different in each of them."

Also, Pi can't make any judgments about anything. It can fixate itself on certain views and outlooks that may influence one's scope of judgment, but Pi is not going to influence things that are as tangible as what kind of music you like, or how you dress. At least not significantly in comparison to the adjacent Je/Ji functions.Interesting. I can stand xNFPs, they're a bit self-concered sometimes but they're also level-headed when you talk to them for long enough. They ultimately seem to care more about objectivity in their worldview. Which still isn't a lot, but more than xSFPs.

xSFPs are the most useless and inconsistent people you'll ever meet. Ever. They don't care about whether or not their beliefs line up with the patterns we observe in reality. For instance, they'll take something like the uncertainty principle, never do any actual research on it, and then build ridiculous theories from it. Their spirituality is juvenile at best and delusional at worst. Not to mention that their Se always gives them this "I know what I want and no one is getting in my way" teen angsty independence thing.

It's like none of them mature past the age of 14.There ya go. Monogamy is a theoretical idea. You either end up unhappy chasing an ideal, or abandoning it and hurting yourself and the person you love.This is the most un-istp thing I’ve ever read.Oh, is your dad an ESTJ too? As I get older I find myself constantly challenging him in a subconscious way to prove to him that Ne-Ti is superior to his Te-Si when it comes to problem solving.

I jump on every opportunity that he says he doesn't know how to do something and then teach it to myself just to rub it in his face.

You should try it.Had an isfj girlfriend, she said something pretty similar. Internal monologue usually pointing out if she's hungry or sleepy or what she needs to do at a given time. A lot about people around us too.What? How? Like I’ve definitely had ESxJs beat me in the pun or witty comment department before, but when you notice a correlation between two things they usually do that “these are two separate things the hell do ya mean” kind of thing.

Like because of this, I usually have the upper hand in a debate with Ne tertiary types. You can tell they don’t see the whole scope of how ideas relate to each other.

Their Ne is pretty strong though, in a superficial way.So I used to have this habit of getting my friends really into mbti stuff and pretty much making all of them take a cognitive function test; then I'd spend a bunch of time trying to figure out what type they are, and I'd like to think I've gotten pretty decent at it.
A lot of my friends actually aren't introverts, but the ones that are didn't test as INFJs but upon reading about them were heavily set on believing that they were one.
I've noticed this on the internet, too, that there are some people who are clearly not an INFJ but really love the idea of being one. I'm not saying that an INFJ has to fit the cookie-cutter ideal of what they're "supposed to be like," but as with any type, there are certain characteristics that shows they're either utilizing or absent of a certain function. Sometimes it's easy to tell.
So my question here is (and I have a few theories myself), why is it so appealing to be an INFJ?(In response to this picture here, on facebook: https://gyazo.com/6e83b92271884cc2b325b64906de9ed7)

"I don't really think it's that big of a deal. I mean, I don't give a shit if anyone would think any of these things about me. And love fades, it always does, everything changes. 

Someone can feel this way about someone and then 3 years later be annoyed by the way they sneeze, and think that the way toothpaste runs down their chin is annoying because they're scrubbing it off of the sink again for the 2nd time this week. Those things turn into arguments, and those arguments turn into insecurities. Insecurities about whether or not this person loves you anymore, and feelings of resentment come up. 

Any time that you enter a relationship and feel the way described above, you're worshiping that person. You're developing an unhealthy obsession. When those feelings die down, like all feelings do, you will both resent each other because nobody likes feeling like who they are as a person can become so uninteresting and washed down. Nobody likes to look at the past and realize that those things the other person used to say don't sound original anymore; that there's nothing left to you, and nothing left to discover.

That's why this shit is stupid, because scientifically monogamy is a lie and it really doesn't make any sense. If you're feeling down and sad, everyone will hop right on and remind you that "you won't feel this way forever," and they're right. But those same people will turn around and act like the good feelings are exempt from that rule, and that they do last forever. But they really don't.

Emotions are chemical reactions that are induced through experiencing things, and when the same experience caused by the same thing happens over and over again, our brains legitimately don't become as stimulated from that thing anymore. It dies down. Scientifically, that's how depression works.
But I mean, if people wanna keep convincing themselves otherwise, they can go ahead. I'm not against people falling in love, I'm just saying that logically, if they're feeling the way described above, it's gonna fail."

This is a friend of mine who I've been really curious about, and he says shit like this a lot. I think this sounds like Ni-Te? I'm not sure.Was reading an old thread about Ne-Si humor vs Se-Ni humor (or Ni-Se humor, or whatever), and it seemed interesting to me that people seemed to think most modern comedians are for certain some sort of NP.

Ne-Si IS what we think of when we think of comedy, but I find that most of my ESP friends like to listen to comedians like Dane Cook, who are mostly about story telling with funny vocabulary and a few analogies to the kool-aid main or something. I see my ESTP friends for sure do this all the time, sometimes it almost seems like they're more ENTP because of the weird analogies and descriptions they come up with while telling stories (but the deciding factor is that in literally every other aspect of their life I see Se-Ni), so it leaves me wondering how much of our comedy in modern media really is Ne-based.

Like Bo Burnham for sure is a staple of Ne-based comedy, and I find him hilarious. I can show him to my ESP friends and they don't get it, they think it's ridiculous. The same thing for INFP comedian Louis Ck. Or ENTP comedian George Carlin.

I think the point I'm getting at is that I associate any comedian that sticks mostly to storytelling (ex. Dane Cook, Jim Jeffries *both hilarious btw*, *well, the second one anyway*) with Se-Ni because of the stories I hear my ESP friends tell, and I'm wondering if I'm actually wrong for doing so? What do you guys think?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzEw6tBI0lE

Very educational videos and he's funny as hell. I'm just really stumped, because what does it mean if someone does work that resembles an ISTP but programs in C++ and makes tons of Ne jokes? (He does tons of wordplay in his videos and also has done some pretty Ne crafty things, like getting his drill to play the star wars theme song)

I feel like if I can figure this out it will help me with a lot of people I know irl as well.Or at least, doesn't care for the impression you give off. I'm sure the majority of us here don't ENJOY being hated, and I'm not assuming that you are, but help me find some patterns here.It just seems like it would make sense, so many ideas running through your head that you do things absent-mindedly and your Si is too shitty at remembering where you actually put it. Now, of course, I understand everyone loses shit. But think about the one person you know who seems to always lose everything important they own.

Also, as far as being clumsy - I feel like that's just a lack of being able to notice your environment.I'll keep this pretty short because I know nobody gives a fuck about my mom, but it's been really hard for me to type her. Extremely hard. It's becoming a nuisance.

She's most likely an introvert, and I say that because she always looks inside of her own head. You can talk to her and it's like she's listening, but she's not really.. she's looking through you. And then she'll answer your question and then the follow up will be something like "Did you take care of that thing I asked you to do?" And you'll think she wasn't listening but she can repeat verbatum what you said, but it's like her mind was completely off somewhere else.

She's a very business oriented person, she knows a lot about bank instruments and pretty much works in investment banking but hasn't been successful with it in a long time. She used to do real estate before this as well, and made quite a bit of money before she lost it all in 2008 what with the crash of all those CDO's or whatever the Big Short was about.

 She's all about tradition and is a very strong Christian Conservative. Sounds like an ISTJ, right? That's what I thought but today I asked her if she thinks about the past and she said "Oh, not really. Not really ever actually. I'm always thinking about the future." This was a huge kick in the nuts for me. We elaborated on this and she said that she's never really in the present because she doesn't care what's going on.

She's always been very very superficial. Like serial killer superficial. But she always talks about how much my brother and I mean to her, it just never feels all that genuine honestly.

Anyway, help me out here. I'll reward you handsomely. I mean I won't but help me anyway.

*edit: she's also a huge alcoholicIf Si is an internal mapping system of almost "experiences to look upon" then is Ni an internal mapping system of intuitive pathways?

Introverted perceiving functions are like maps, right?

So Se is more of pure sensing than Si. But why? Because Si is introverted, right? It deals more with taking sensory experiences that you've observed and giving yourself an "idea pool" to look upon for observing the world. So what I mean is that they're not organizing this map from their experiences so much as each sensory experience is a drop of water being thrown into a big swimming pool of collective "knowledge to look upon." Like a library. Or a map. So that any time they need to perceive the world, they have a map to look upon to choose ideas from.

You’ll notice that Si users have the tendency to always be aware of how cold it is outside. They’re taking every sensory observation into account, they’re aware of the map of everything surrounding each sense that they're experiencing, and in each observation is a plethora of comparison, all somehow tied in through exactly what they're looking at in that point in time.

Se users don’t notice how cold it is outside (or at least, not as much) because they’re so caught up in what they’re doing, they’re in the moment and using their senses in an unabashed external way. They're not subconsciously putting values onto the things they're observing, just simply engaging with them. Right then and there. Past experiences aren't relevant because the Se user is concerned with being engaged with what they're observing.

So okay. Extroverted intuition must be pure intuition. It's not a map because it doesn't go anywhere, just like how Se isn't a map either. It's completely present. And extroverted intuiton is completely present, too, because it doesn't exist in the past, present or future. It's looking at something and having a million "what if" possibilities in your head, which are completely separate from this timeline.

Introverted functions take everything into consideration relative to everything else, because they’re internally comparing everything. Fe user walks into a room of people and they are immediately picking up on feelings based on everything that is external and able to be interacted with. Fi users walk into the room and are seeing every emotion in relation to other emotional conclusions they have come to, which is why they talk about auras or vibes or whatever. It’s because everything has to add up internally, and every conclusion is a building block in a system they can build, and then use to relate to and engage with other people's feelings.

Therefore, introverted intuition must be the same thing as introverted sensing, but instead of adding drops of water of sensory experiences, it's adding drops of water of intuitive lines of thought. Like a mapping system to look upon for information, and not organized, but just kind of coddled together through time. An Ni user will look at a situation and grasp what it is and what it's about because it resonates to other past realms of intuition, like they're looking at many different pathways that instinctively "feel" the same, all vibrating around it and zeroing in on what that observation really means.It's a pretty universal observation that Ne tends to manifest itself in funny or goofy ways, and every Ne dom on here likes to make sure we all know that. Anyway, I took into trying to break down why Ne does this when it's not a feeling function at all, and Ni seems to be so serious and solemn.

I've come to the conclusion that, from what I can remember, my imagination was overflowing when I was a child. It was bleeding out into every single I was looking at, and all of my daydreams were.. happy. Like I'd imagine a scenario of "what if the dinosaurs met modern day animals" and rather than them realistically slaughtering each other I'd imagine a cartoon in my head of them getting along and having fun. I'm not sure if this is the case with every Ne-dom, but I believe it to be the case for most.

It seems that every time as a child that my imagination would take me to dark places, I didn't see it as relevant, and was therefore able to drop it and continue a happy optimistic view on life. It continued this way for a long time until I was a good deal older, and my imagination would start to drift to morbid, dark places. Places like "does my existence really mean anything" or "are there other universes and does that mean there are tons of versions of me and the people I love suffering" (just like anyone else) but the issue was that my imagination would build off of this, and keep diving into these morbid questions because they *felt* more correct. This imagination that I had was able to conjure up very disgusting and vivid images that would represent something on a grander scale and ultimately lead to me being horrified by my own existence.

My point here is that with the potential that Ne is able to display in the form of holding ideas to a very real standard enables it to be able to go down some very dark and troubling paths. It's likely that if you are a heavy Ne user then you need to keep things lighthearted and funny because the alternative is inexorably destructive to the state of your mind.I'm gonna guess that for the most part, people get along within their type. But I'm thinkin that this could give rise to see which functions are the most subjective; I'm guessing Fi is up there.
I totally agree. I've been pacing my kitchen talking to my mother about what his cognitive functions are and I keep arriving back at INTJ. While watching his new special he reminded me and my mother a couple times of my cousin whose an ESFP, but only in short, silly bursts (Se) like you addressed. He also seems way more condemning of certain things than I am, I dive deep into subjects but arrive at much more gray understandings (Ne), as in this new special he just completely shits on social media, AKA conspiracy theories of sorts (Ni). He also seems to be such an Fi, his moments of emotional venerability, the clown symbolism in the new special and his sensitivity to those he offended with his stuff points to that. Also, he's definitely said he was an introvert so many times and everyone ignores that. ENFPs, I always have crazy chemistry with. ESFJs are always too good at flirting for me to handle. Some IXXJs are fun to make feel uncomfortable.They gathered statistics about population of personality types, which comes along with cognitive functions. It's not possible to have a personality type that does not match the cognitive functions. As you could take a population of men and women and derive pretty accurately how many of those people had boobs or wieners. Absolutely. But if you buy into any population survey about MBTI then my results are just as accurate. The fact is we are just not at a place where we can get hard numbers on MBTI but there are certainly trends that we have picked up.Oh My God, YES! SJs are great, but I swear they multiply by the second.I'm vegan so...My dad tested as an ISTP but just barely an S, and like 48% N. So I was sort of up in the air about whether or not he was an INTP or ISTP, and sort of hoped he was INTP. But we took this test together and it became clear he was ISTP. Maybe it will help you.
http://www.celebritytypes.com/test/intp-or-istp.phpI literally asked my dentist the use of all of his tools and then questioned him on his opinion on why dentists (at some point) have the highest suicide rate of all occupations. He was into it though.Maybe this is an inferior Fe thing... but I can't stand to watch embarrassing scenes in movies. I always look away if it gets too awkward. I feel weird just thinking about it.More Fi I think. But also human thing.
INTJ And INFJ advice would be great too. I'm not saying that Si means hard working. But Si does contribute to an aspect of being hard working which is consistency. GREAT! Then I want advice from people with Si or Ni attached to a judging function. So INFJ, INTJ, ISFJ and ISTJ.I mean develop and embrace. It's a part of my function stack already so embrace instead of avoid. 

I don't necessarily thing that I would be neutralizing my Ne. As my Fe and Ti work in tandem despite being opposite.

I don't really understand the difference of the two Ne's you are presenting. But frankly I just wanted to hear some descriptive positive descriptions of Si so that I could use it to fuel my habit training. Like if an ISFJ said, "When I run every morning, I'm able to breath and feel like I have one time of the day where I am in control and know what I'm doing" IDK then I can think of that when trying to set up a schedule for myself. But INTPs just keep questioning and arguing with my word choice. Damn INTPs!Yeah I hope to not offend you but I am sure you haven't embraced your Fe.I think it's great. At this point, I really only want to go out with another Intuitive. I actually have been dating only guys who put it on their profile.

Maybe that is considered to be me relying too much on it but I couldn't see myself long term with someone who doesn't want to talk about theory and ideas.Honestly I agree with you. I don't see the value in sensors putting it on their accounts. Fewer sensors are interested in the community and intuitive who are would probably use it against you.

But for intuitive, I would recommend it.What?
That seems sort of beneficialISTP dad and INFP mom. I think MBTI is biological. I think you come out the way you come out and you can't be influenced into a type. But i think it's interesting because say a INTP who grew up in an Fe dominate household, will likely have a developed Fe. And that's an interesting idea. I was raised on weekday by my dad along with my ISTP brother. And my Ti is highly developed due to them. Hailee Steinfeld's character in the Edge of SeventeenI definitely think Michelle is a ESFJ but this gif still applies.I don't think anyone can really hate a ISFJ b/c they are so harmless. But in general, the ISFJ I've meet are too dull and highly-sensitive. Also, if I criticize anyone they've suction-cupped to, they will defend them illogically to no end. A lot of them I know have been in co-dependent, often substance-abusing relationships. But overall they are usually nice and good-hearted.enfp - 36.2%

I would say I personally admire introverts self communication. You'd be surprised how little internal discussion goes on in my head. I don't speak for all extroverts or even all ENTPs but as I've dove further into MBTI and cognitive functions, I've identified how much of my being revolves around other people and outside world feedback. I need to talk about my feelings with people. I basically only have a logical perspective when I'm alone (Ti). I think it's brilliant to be able to have such a complex internal dialogue with yourself, as introvert usually can. Also, I've found introverts can focus more easily.How can someone who gets it enough to make this masterpiece also still identify as an XNFP \(as in unsure of extrovert or introvert\)????? \(sorry I was snooping at your past posts in hopes you were one of us ENTPs so I could feel some sense of responsibility for this chart\)I guess you've just got to figure out if you're more teams &amp; dreams or memes &amp; dreams. Good luck!Have an entj friend, can confirm he loves memes.Really?! ENTP - INFJ (looking out for myself first lol)

It's more for my own gain. And I can make a few multi-variable graphs out of it and call it a day.Yeah, good point. I won't assume the test is really that accurate. But it might have interesting trends.Specifically from his new special on Netflix called "Make Happy". My mom and I were between ENTP, INTP, or INFP. Got the initial statistics from https://psychobabble4u.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/how-special-is-your-snowflake/.  But I did some of my own conclusions and figured I would share my findings.

I'm an ENTP and my 4th function is Si and I would really like to embrace it. For the last couple years I've been working to try to maximize my free time to be productive, although I have lots of trouble. I've been getting so much better and I've also learned that I'm never going to be able to schedule my whole day and be happy. But I want to hear what you guys love about repetition, commitment and security. Maybe if I could understand your reasoning behind maintaining a routine besides you get a bunch of stuff done, I could enjoy it more.I'm taking a statistical multi-variable Analysis class and I need at least 8 different variables, quantitative would be best (or that could be on a spectrum, ex: happiness out of 10)

So far, I have:

What's your personality type?

What's your relationship status?

Gender?

Age?[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP)

It's super basic. Please take as many times as you can!  I'm going to use in my statistical analysis class. 

Edit: I'll post results when complete.

Feedback is welcome.  I’ve been seeing downvoting when people are honest about certain aspects of MBTI and I am here to set the record straight.

1) YOU ARE ONE TYPE ---- FOREVER. You are not a monk in the mountains of Naples. No, your years of yoga class or the trauma of your ex-girlfriend did not help you transcend your personality type, you got one for a lifetime kid, so get used to it and learn enough to be sure you have the right one. 

2) Learn about cognitive function! None of this S vs. N or P vs. J thing holds any weight. Although it’s fun to say, “Haha look at all your perfectly sharped pencils, what a J!” It’s not what Jung was trying to tell us about the human condition… so do what Papa Jung wants and learn about the real depth psychology. 

3) If you have Ti in your first two functions, you are not using Fi… ever… okay extremely rarely. Or if you have Se in your first two functions, you are not using Ne. Or if you are Ni, you are not using Si and so on. Unless you are deeply traumatized and stuck in your subconscious mind, then no. Trust me any ENTP/INTP/ISTP/ESTP who are using their Fi are in a seriously effed situation and about to make it way worse. (I learned all this from C.S. Joseph on YouTube so check him out if you are curious)

Being one type is wonderful. You can expand on the gifts you’ve been given. You have talents for moral understanding (Fi) or delegating (Te) or connecting with other (Fe) and so on. And to learn what those are and see how you can help others is powerful. Also, you can work to sharpen your second and third function and learn to accept your fourth function. 

I know no one wants to feel categorized but the test shows the power of collaboration. You don’t need to be everything at once. You just need to be to best at what you do and find other people to be the best at what they are. I assume he's a ISFP, maybe and Ariana is definitely an ESFJ, no doubt. This message was approved by a full-time student and employee.Not to take all the fun out of this but if I were to write a serious post, to truly throw someone off their game, overwhelm their 4th cognitive function. So to an ENTP, do something physically surprising to them forcing them to have to go into their Si. Or to an ESTP, overwhelm them with options for the future and they will need to go into their Ni. INTPs, be extremely emotional around them and they will literally have no idea what to do with themselves. Happy hunting!Type: ENTP

Majors: Journalism and StatisticsMy ESFP ex recently told me that he liked me because I was athletic. I immediately guffawed. But I guess I could be seen as jocky, unless you see me in the middle of playing a sport.
ENTP: Izaya Orihara from Durarara!!I agree, however I do wonder if there's any link with the T/F side too, as my INFP sister and some of my F friends are more picky than me or my T friendsDoes type affect eating habits at all? 
ENTP - pro leave. The EU is undemocratic, and is beginning to show signs of wanting to become a sovereign superstate (legislation of member countries, expanding the EU army). It forced Great Britain to forfeit the ability to secure it's borders. Whether you're pro immigration or not I think most of us can agree that should be up for the people to decide. The economy is not sufficient reasoning to stay. Markets fluctuate all the time and this opens up new opportunities between Great Britain and other Commonwealth nations + the United States. 
Y'know, you can just ignore people roflI shit rainbowsYeah it's pretty unhealthy to be shitting rainbow colored blood.Completely wrong? Se: "using objects around him to create [Iron Man suit]." Ummm... to create a suit you've never ever seen before, using the minimal amount of resources, and to completely and successfully bring that together is Se?

To sacrifice his autonomy and bring about what he believes is a good compromise for the future because of his perceived endangering of society is Se?

This person is literally trying to create Iron Man in a different light just because she wants to believe something different. The fact is Iron Man is ENTP, even his emotions are fueled by logic.Nuh-uh, D.Va is me. I am D.Va.[This is how it looks inside my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhheiPTdZCw)That doesn't existFrom what I've seen, INTPs have the best music taste on reddit. Grats baes.

ENTP, INTP, INTJ, ENFJ.

That's my gut feeling with not enough thought.The INTP might not be actually extroverted, but they do a good job at pretending. Many INTPs I know commit themselves to a lot of different pursuits (Ne baby), and their inferior Fe allows them to express themselves freely with blatant disregard for what people think.

As for the *most* extroverted, I have no clue. As I said, I didn't think too much.I happen to be related to one. If he gets going when I get home tired from work, I go shadow INTJ on his ass.

"Hey have you heard of XXXX? It's so amazing and I love it because ABC"

"But that doesn't really serve a purpose does it"

"Yeah but..."

"No."I don't know those types very well though as most of my closer friends are Ns. Not on purpose because I'm hitler, but I guess it just worked out that way.

I have a couple ISFJ friends too.The ENFP: Charging into things with waaaay too much enthusiasm, leaving behind the people who stand in their path. Seems legit. :PWe're not allowed to say bipolar, but...&gt; Thats because you are an INTP. You really don't do anything :P

As an ENTP, I do a really great job adding and checking things off my "to procrastinate" list.[The answer is always no.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/search?q=is+it+possible&amp;restrict_sr=on)Funnily enough, I gathered that from my past ENFP boss. ;PGlad it wasn't just me.&gt; word salad

Seriously, how many metaphor?[Nope.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4uqnaj/is_it_possible_to_be_mix_of_intp_and_enfj/d5sa9ao)A FiNe SiTe indeed! 

(Yes I realise this is derivative of parent comments but y'all missed an opportunity here)IDK, I think Si is pretty much right. I'm not too good at it, but I'm conscious of when I'm using Si and it seems to work like that.Easier stereotypes, probably.Agreed.&gt; That is Fi.

I disagree, tertiary Fe gets overridden by Ne-Ti *quite* a lot. If the ENTP thinks something to be true and doesn't care that much about a person, or at least what that person thinks, they'll usually just keep going because the truth is more important.

I think OP is Fe because of the anti-feelings in arguments rule. ENFPs tend to integrate feelings with their arguments, kinda like a spice.

That said, you're right about the cause -&gt; effect thing, but TBH Ti is inclined to behave just the same sometimes.

What's *really* throwing me off is the lack of Ne-speak. There's really not enough "maybe", "probably", "kinda", "potentially" in there. (That said, we're choosing between ENTP and ENFP, so that's neither here nor there.)Tertiary Fe, but yes, I'm exactly the same.Nah, that sounds like Si. Nostalgia is a big part of Si.ENTP: Musical, Social, Logic / Math.

It seems to me that all the Musical questions were based on whether you had trained in that area.Depends on the job you're going for...Software Engineer? INTJ (or maybe I/ENTP I guess.) Marketing? ENFP or ENFJ could be good. Something freaking stupid and office-related? Sure, then STJ. Management? ESTJ. Monkey? ISTJ.Inb4 INTJSo, I just tried to do this and realised there was no neutral. Regardless, I went with the VERY scientific method of alternating the weakest agree / disagree and got ISTJ. (I followed this process incorrectly, incidentally.)

Got ESTP doing it a different way.

EDIT: There is a neutral, it's just poorly designed. (You can't tell that neutral is selected very easily)

EDIT2: Just FYI, this test apparently isn't great. I've not been mistyped by a test for a while now (I guess because I accidentally bias toward the right answers) but I just got INTP when answering it honestly.We're not talking about MBTI extraverted / introverted though. 
I come across as ambiverted. I mean, most days I extrovert but then there's times when I just feel so drained with people and lock myself away. I think all extroverts have those times, though.

However, I feel like there's an important sub-division of extroverts that doesn't come up enough. The "forced" vs "non-forced" interactions.

I personally do great with "non-forced" interactions with people I already know and like. I could spend endless amounts of times chatting and doing stuff with friends.

"Forced" interactions, however, where the burden is on you to *generate* points of interest and talk about them (e.g. small talk) are definitely where I don't do well. It drains me to no end.

So, despite the fact I identify as an extrovert, if you put me in a room with a stranger, there'll be a lot of awkward silence (probably), unless we're automatically connected some way through our interests, the way we're dressed, or our social situation. Frankly, I will by default not care about this stranger or feel the need to talk to them, unless I am given some reason to.

My brother, who is a very "fluffy" extrovert (potentially ESTP or ENFJ? I'm not good with figuring out his function order, but I'm pretty sure it's those functions), will *scoff* at the notion that I'm an extrovert, particularly because he thrives in that particular situation, whereas I will wither. I guess that's his definition of "extrovert". I'm thinking probably. My Fe tertiary means I'm like "...I should probably at least say hi to this person. ...Nah, too much anxiety." Se, on the other hand, would be 8th on my function stack. Ain't getting no help from that! (Not sure what Se would do because it's so unfamiliar to me)Homer Simpson, ESFP. Super easy to type, and more iconic than Mr. Peanutbutter (as much as I love Mr. Peanutbutter)You wouldn't be offended by Mr. Peanutbutter? He's arguably more stupid.No. (He's for sure an Se user, 99% sure he's Se dom, and definitely uses Fi)Figure out your primary function, that much is usually *pretty* obvious. Then you only have 2 options! :DPossibly, if you think that's easier!

(After what I've read about the inferior being contrary while immature, such as ENTP going actively against the "tried and true" (Si), it might actually be a good idea)This post and your other downvoted post are good examples of ISTPs being assholes, actually. Just sayin'.Intrapersonal Intelligence but this test is bullshitIDK. I feel like for me, my "self-worth" hinges entirely on the things I do. If somebody invalidates or tells me I'm bad at the things I do, it can mess me up pretty easily. I wouldn't say ENTPs are thick skinned at any rate.Positive. But isn't it commonly understood that ENTPs based on their Ne-Fe are heavily reliant on external validation?I would argue that an ENTP doesn't even have a *concept* (inherently) of self-worth as it relates to Fi. My entire concept of self-worth hinges on Fe, or people's opinion of me, as the idea of an "internal" worth based off nothing external just doesn't make sense.

Essentially, I think "self-worth" isn't actually an objective but subjective. If "everybody hates me and is telling me I'm bad at stuff" (according to a downward-spiraling ENTP), then I'll probably be getting the feeling of "I am worthless", because what have I to offer other than my influence on people? (According to tertiary Fe).

It works completely differently for an INTJ, of course, but I think it's actually a similar feeling.It's not *at all* confusing for ENTPs. "I could use Ne all the time or I could use Te all the t...screw that!"I was so disappointed in myself that I didn't realise until nearly the end. I just wasn't reading it with my "satire" brain because the content was constantly riding the line. N dom and S aux or vice versa is impossible...Leads to not being able to process anything, I would have thought.I don't think social extroversion / introversion has much to do with introversion / extraversion in the MBTI sense, necessarily.HeadacheENTPs with less developed (or even normal) Fe can pretty much be described as introverted. I should know. 

However, OP's description seems to better suit INTP, I think you're right there. There's a certain "disconnectedness" about INTPs that ENTPs don't seem to have.But INTPs are *always* on an animated rant about something!? Why would they be calmI was thinking strong Fe users such as ENFJ definitely had the potential to be in Slytherin (if they were using their Fe for selfish means) or Hufflepuff (if not)IDK, I consider myself pretty Hufflepuff (if I wasn't Ravenclaw by default). I get properly offended when people don't make an effort to get along.I think, whereas MBTI is based on priority of functions, the Hogwarts house system is more based on priority of goals / aspirations / motivation. So it's hard to assign a house to each type.

As an ENTP, for instance, I have certain houses I'm more likely to be in, but I could easy go a different path, as the Hogwarts houses are a lot more interconnected, I think.

For example, in order of priority, I'm Ravenclaw. This is because if I'm set on some logical way of thinking, I'm not going to make any concessions in terms of bravery or people's thinking. If my Slytherin ambition was stronger, that *might* overrule my Ravenclaw somehow.

Next, I'm Hufflepuff. I see great value in harmony and easy-goingness among people, and as I said in another comment, I get upset when other people don't get along.

Slytherin comes next, as I do have great ambition, and am cunning as I am lazy (in typical ENTP fashion). I also see the value in manipulation of people, although somehow I'm mostly ethically opposed to it (whenever it would negatively affect said people. See Hufflepuff).

Finally, Gryffindor. This is my "shadow" house, as I often feel a compelling sense of "I *should* do something about this, it isn't right!". However, I am pretty cowardly. You might say Gryffindor gets overruled by Slytherin a lot.
I really don't think so. I mean just look at her "Everything is glue" video. She even took a MBTI test one of her videos and got ENFP Never would I even THINK about it!ENTP here. I think we are pretty high on the scale. MBTI obviously has a lot of truth to it in my mind.I'm only 19, so I was 18. I type people all the time, and I would say I'm correct about 80% of the time. I'm really good at it. ENTP - &gt; ENTP. Lol.Wow. Yes. That is me.Haha, exactly.ENTP here. It's the same for me. I think it's like that for everyone with Ne and Ni high in their stacks.According to Reddit anyone who has an IQ above 130 is destined to have everything too easy for them so they never try at anything and just get dead end jobs. 

TIL dumb people are motivated.Well...ESTPs are very easy to mindfuck. So you must like a lot of movies.YesIt was a joke. People just say shit like that on here all the time.Favorite one is Ratatouille. I love the animation, characters, and most of all the message behind it. It is so incredibly cleverly made that I just can't help but love it. 

I also like The Incredibles. I'd put that at a close second.I liked Cars a lot, but it's not my favorite.My favorite is Ratatouille. I'm ENTP haha. I don't think he is playing a part honestly. I think what we are seeing is actually him.ENTPs? I don't think so. INTP, INFP and INFJ are way more popular imo. I think it depends on the type. I've noticed that a LOT of people mistype as ENFP. That's a terrible example. I don't think I've met a lot of humble and pertinent ENTPs. Idk who you're thinking of.Yea, I'm confused as well.Any type...?I am an ENTP and I have never been quiet and shy. But I have known ENFPs who were like that. I haven't met a ton of ENTPs.I'm an ENTP, and people often thing I'm either sarcastic or bored. The best way to describe it is how Tina Fey talks. We have the same tone in our voices.I thought she was ESTJ.I'm not sure, but my ISTP brother isn't much like ESTPs aside from the fact that he likes to experience things and is an adrenaline junkie. ENTP, Thunderbird.A healthy INFJ is great. An unhealthy one is absolute hell and extremely complicated.I've honestly always thought she was a deranged INFP.Sam is definitely INFP. Dany is INFJ, and her actress is an ENFJ. I think that Arya is ISTP..How is Sam INTP at all? He is literally the stereotypical INFP.Probably ;)An ENTP and ESFP who are BFFs? Damn. I've never gotten along with ESFPs. EwLol ENTPs can let it go. Are we talking grudges? Because I can't hold a grudge at all. I've noticed this as well. This girl I know who I am POSITIVE is ISFJ, somehow got ENFP and was like "Wow that explains me so well!"....but I am positive she is not ENFP.

Maybe it's because ENFPs are kind of a feelers product child. They're a happy medium between feeling and outgoing. It really doesn't. There really are more people who seem to mistype as ENFPs than a lot of the others.ENTP here.

I think my ideal partner would be an ENFJ or ENTJ. For some reason I'm just not that attracted to introverted types in a romantically driven way. 

I would also say ENFP, but the problem is that once we are around each other for too long, we just make each other fucking insane. This happens with every ENFP I'm with. I often have to take short breaks from my ENFP friends even though I get along amazingly with them.INFPs.ENFPs are one of the few types I really just don't like debating with. It makes both of our Ne's go haywire.My friend who has an ESTJ girlfriend doesn't know how to let go of grudges. She loses friends constantly because they say something tiny and she just throws them away without a backward glance. Of course my friend is an INFJ...lol.The INFJ I know always lets go of things to the point that it's unhealthy.That's because life IS a competition man. You either win the game of thrones or you die. There is no middle ground!!!

Also, I am an ENTP, and I really don't think I have ever had the urge to physically fight someone out of anger. The difference is that ESTPs fight with their bodies, and ENTPs fight with their words. I find the latter to be more effective.I'm an ENTP and took the test...I got Neutral Evil. Haha.ENFPs might end because they were obsessive and didn't give space. ENTPs might end because they were assholes and heartless. My guess is ENFP or ENTP....scratch that. You have to be a feeling type. I would say ENFP.I don't really even think of INTJs. Nah, I'm saying the ENTP was an asshole to the other person.Fuck.That's because you're an INFJ and you have morals that you latch on to that no one else can question :DXD!I mean when doing things for others. :PSigh.

What is wrong with us ENTPs...YOUR! 

I feel dumb.No kidding! Same. Haha, just put the first one.ENTP here. I don't troll about religion. That is a maturity thing. I was never joking about it when I was a teenager because it GENUINELY frustrated me and made me mad by how I had been lied to by the Mormon church my entire life. And no, I don't believe in a God. I think that's NPs more than SPs. But, I'll give some input...it's because everything is absurd. Seriously, everything is just so absurd in life it's funny. J's don't understand because they're so serious half the time.Idk. ENFPs laugh a lot at weird shit.It's an extrovert thing. :PI don't agree with Ariel being an ESFP, I still think she is ENFP. Just the way she collects objects and makes up different names for them and imagines abstractedly what they are. Yea but it's not about collecting pretty things for her, it's about imagining what they do and where they come from.INFP or ENFPIf it makes you feel any better, a lot of ISFJs write. J.K Rowling has stated she is INFJ, but a lot of people don't think that's true and that she is actually an ISFJ.Maybe it's better to give actual advice than assume it's a parody? I actually think Rachel is a Thinker, not a Feeler.No idea, I don't get the hype. I know two INFJs, one is VERY bipolar, and the other one is in an abusive relationship and got rid of all of his friends because his girlfriend told him to. Being introverted with that high of a Fe just sounds like a recipe for disaster imo.Wrong, us ENTPs can just FAKE confidence really well :P.ENTP. Filmmaker, writer, and comedian.

I think being a writer would be the best. So much control of your own words...

...but, I enjoy making others laugh more than anything in the entire world, so comedian would just be amazing...unless I bombed.That's your dream job? Damn, it would be nice for accounting to be my dream job.ENTP here, it makes me fucking insane. I feel like I'm having a manic episode or something.I was a floater, but mostly hung out with a group of 4. They were all good at school, did their homework, and I was the black sheep friend. It was nice. Haha. INFP or INFJ?Wtf, people do those things?That sounds like a nice way to live.Very emotional. No ENTP? WELL then.ENTP- I usually just observe everything that is going on around me and analyze it to death. Haha. When I'm driving I kind of just wander into my own mind.Agreed. ENTP here. I almost always think that the majority of people's opinions and wants are more important than one individuals personal feelings and beliefs. In fact I don't really even understand how Fi really works because it seems weird to think from that point of view.ISFPINTPNo way is he ENTP. An ENTP dressing up as The Doctor and even awkwardly holding up the sonic screwdriver? I can't see an EXTX of any kind doing that. This dude is an introvert. Everyone knows INFPs love cats. You're INFP.You contemplated for 10 minutes? Well that puts ENTP, INTP and ENFP out the of equation. I think you're INFJ.ESTP.ENFP?Wow...the Si explanation for ENTP and ENFP is way too true....haha I'm not a fan of my Fe and Si to be honest. I feel like Fe often leaves me with an inability to do things without worrying of what others will think of me, and that Si can sometimes make me stress out about the things that are out of my ability to change because they are in the past.

I love Ne and Ti though :D.

BUT....I do like how Fe causes one of my greatest joys in life to be making others laugh. I really do love nothing more than watching people laugh at something I've said. I'm an ENTP and I love telling people what to do. It's fun :D. I'm also pretty goal oriented.

But yea, you sound like an ENTP to me. That or ESTP maybe. Agreed. I have a really good ISFP friend who is very creative.Why Are INFJs able to use sound logic about something, and think about it thoroughly, but when it really comes down to acting upon that logic, they throw it out the window and use their feelings instead? It makes NO sense to me. I have an INFJ friend who will come to the same logical conclusions as me (ENTP), but suddenly he becomes a pushover and then gets rid of it. Even though IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE EVEN TO HIM!

Example: INFJ friend knows that he is an abusive relationship, and that he should get out LOGICALLY, but suddenly when it comes to it he will literally say things like, "You just don't have a heart." Or "You don't have feelings. She may do all of those things to me, but I don't care." How can you guys NOT care about being pushed around?! It is so bizarre to me. It's almost like you like being bossed around. Five minutes ago he was agreeing with me, five minutes later he is telling me that I just "Don't understand."

The difference between how ENFPs and INFPs ect, would take this situation is when you say things like that to them, they at least realize how dumb it is usually and that they should be doing something different, while an INFJ will literally fight and be stubborn as hell when others try to give them advice...it's like they don't take external opinion into consideration at ALL. If dozens of other people are saying the same thing needs to happen...isn't it obvious there is some truth to it?! Sorry for the rant. INFJs just don't make any sense to me.

Don't get me wrong, INFJs are great to have discussions with...as long as it's not about their morals that make no sense. :)Yea, I don't understand it.That's a cool analogy.From what I've noticed, INFJs think their strengths are their weaknesses and their weaknesses are their strengths hahaha.I like Punk Rock and Jazz too, but generally not Rap. That seems like a sad way to think to be honest.ENTP, my creative process starts with an idea in mind, and then molding it as I go to make it better. I write, draw, paint and take photographsENTP here, I don't talk to hear others speak, I talk to understand because talking with others is much easier.ENTP here, I would definitely. I could never sit well with myself if I didn't. Murder is murder, and I don't tether myself to someone as some moral beacon for them to admit murder to. 

If it was for malicious reasons where the friend felt no remorse- I would turn them in in a heartbeat. 

If it was in self defense and for good reasons, I might still because I really don't think it's right that the family of the one murdered doesn't get closure on what really happened. 

I'm actually kind of astounded at how many people wouldn't turn them in.ENTP here, agreed.That is so weird to me. I'm an ENTP and I could never imagine just...sitting well with helping a friend hide a body, regardless of the situation. Maybe it's the Fe in me, but I could never be at ease knowing that the family of the killed has no idea what happened to their child, brother, sister or cousin or something their entire lives. I wouldn't do it anonymously either.That was a good answer actually :).

I think a lot of Ne doms work this way. Or even sometimes Ni ones. I know an INFJ who is like that and often needs outer pressure to do things.YOU GET A DEADLINE! YOU GET A DEADLINE! AND YOU GET A DEADLINE!

EVERYBODY GETS DEADLINES!I'm an ENTP, I don't mind being ENTP, but I would love being and ENTJ.Haha every ISFP I know drinks a lot...There's no debate. It's just not true :P.ENTP here. I have never found an ESFP I have gotten along with, understood, liked, or that liked me. There's just no connection at all. We are two types of humans experiencing very different worlds.

Which is so weird because I have tons of ISFP friends that I get along with, and ESFP and ISFP are supposed to be mildly similar.Here are the books in my collection:

The Sun Also Rises

How to Win Friends and Influence People

Fahrenheit 451

The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo

The Martian

American Gods

The Shining

Dune

Gone Girl

Sharp Objects

One Second After

One Year After

Sudoku Puzzles

HyperionYea...it's weird. I don't usually get along with ISTJs though. But I do get along with every other ISxx.I'm an ENTP and I basically live in my head so...Wut.I think it's funny how for some people it takes months and years to figure out their type and for me it just took like a test or two haha.My dad is an ISTJ and married my mom who is an ENFP, and then my step-mom who is an INFP.Why would you just assume he is an ESTJ?I'm an ENTP and I can finish long term projects ha.What is your reasoning for King being INTJ..? I just don't see that at all.ENTP here, I would much rather be with people than alone most of the time, but that doesn't mean I don't like being alone once in a while. At my core, I will always be very extroverted.Most INTPs I know are really introverted....any type can talk about something they're interested in.I think this is accurate. Example, I am always hearing about ENTPs going on and on about how they just "Don't know if they're INTP or ENTP :("...or "I don't know if I'm ENFP or INFP!"...wanna know the reason why this happens? Because these four types are known for being indecisive. It's not that they can't figure out which one they are, it's that suddenly when they're home alone for 2 days they start questioning whether or not they're an introvert. J's probably don't have this issue because they know how to decide shit. 

I've NEVER thought I was an introvert, and I'm an ENTP. Yes, I can be alone for a few days- but at the end of the day I love the company of people more than being alone and twiddle my thumbs.Dude. WRITING.

Also, I agree for the most part that GRR Martin is an INFP. But I don't get how saying sorry for it means anything...in fact usually it's Fe doms who say sorry all the time.Not really? I think you just don't know what you're passionate about in life and you're struggling to find it :)LOL... GRR Martin an INTJ???? That's the funniest thing I have heard all day.

Also, JK Rowling is not an INFP. She is INFJ or ISFJ. She has even stated so herself.Because there is just no way in hell GRR Martin is an INTJ. He takes a lifetime to write his stories, he has even stated he has gotten lazy. Just from interviews you can tell he is INFP in the way he talks. I highly suggest watching one, because I doubt you would think he is INTJ.

And how does putting people into different houses make the writer of that book a Fi user? It was just an idea she came up with. Any Fe user could as well.He's a psychopath. That's why it's unhealthy haha.

But I think he's an INTJ. Everything he does is so...planned.No, I really think INTJ. Maybe even a really crazy ISTJ with the way he clings to the Robin Hood story from his past (Si).(Spoilers) The one time him and his mother actually have an intimate moment is when he is sick and his mother reads him Robin Hood. After that, he becomes obsessed with it, takes up archery, becomes an expert, and eventually kills all of those students- just so he can finally take victory over his little war with his mother.No, dude. I've specifically said I don't like twice. Haha are you high? :PI have an ENFP cousin who gets very angry quickly when people question or challenge her. It's kind of like walking on egg shells.INFPs always seem to play the passive aggressive approach in my experience.

Or they'll bring up things that happened AGES ago that everyone forgot about. Same with INTPs.Sorry- off topic- but how is that show?The only type I've NEVER really gotten along with is ESFPs (I am ENTP). Other than that, I have found at least a couple of other types I have gotten along with.Lol are we twins? That's basically how it was for me. If my Si had developed a little earlier, perhaps I would have done better in High School.
Lol dude you're an INFP.Instinct, ENTP.Me: ENTP
Mother: ENFP
Dad: ISTJ
Eldest Sister: ESTJ
Middle Sister: ENFP

Most of my dads family are sensors, and most of my moms family are intuitives. So...yes I think it is mildly genetic. LOL.I'll refer to this comment to explain how stupid comments like this are.Doesn't seem like he is the most stereotypical if people are always arguing which type he actually is.ENTP here. No. It doesn't make me laugh, it makes me angry. ENTP I guess.ENTP, on my side.You do sound pretty crazy....Dude, can you just act mildly normal? Stop acting like a teenage girl on Red Bull.. Most ENTPs I know end up getting in relationships with F's....so.What do you mean?Just because they think they're better than everyone else doesn't mean all the people that are like that in /r/INTJ are STJs. Lol but /r/INTP dwells on the worst part of the INTPs....so... I'm kind of surprised you feel at home there.I just messaged my ENTJ friend and this was the conversation:

Me (ENTP): Would you ever want to be a stay at home parent?

Him (ENTJ): I would rather do anything on the planet than be a stay at home parent.

Me (ENTP): Thats what I thought.

Him (ENTJ): I would feel like a waste of human space being a stay at home parent.I have never once in my life felt an emotional connection to visual art (Unless movies count...then all the fucking time).

ENTP by the way.Agreed. My ENFP mom has come off as very selfish in the past with her Fi.AmusedAs an ENTP, the best type of jokes for me are the one where I can imagine the most weird and abstract thing happening because of the joke. I think it depends on the situation...to put all types who would react differently (not to mention the individual themselves) into one grouping and see which one feels the least "shamed" about something would be a little silly.

I think it just depends...take me (ENTP) for example. What would shame me is feeling unintelligent or being ordered around like a dog...to an ENTJ, maybe feeling shame would be to always being at the bottom of the barrel and not having the will to do what needs to be done to get to the top. Idk.I know an ENTJ who also never feels embarrassed, it's almost disturbing.I'm an ENTP, and it's not that I feel "comfortable", it's that I'm too oblivious to see how awful I am, so I don't care. Haha.Wait,...so you don't like dancing to music you dislike? Lol weird. Who would have thought.I actually don't think that's true at all. ENFPs and ENTPs get along really well because their humors are so similar. 

I wouldn't say "very different"....Meaning?Life is how you look at it. And if you choose to look at it as a miserable pile of shit...that's your choice I guess. They're negative because there is an over the top amount of these types of posts per week. It's not like one person posts that, it's that tons of people post it. Saying "I'm miserable because I'm lonely and can't get stuff done" IS a common post on both INTP and INFP. That IS a negative post.Honestly....? Any INXX type. They always seem to have a lot of issues going on and never seem to be happy with what they have in life. That's just my observation...I really don't think I've met a lot of any of these types who truly seem completely content and healthy with what they have.

I look at my INFP step-mother with absolute pity because she can never be happy with what she has. She will ALWAYS be depressed for the rest of her life because she is looking to the past 24/7 and can never enjoy what will be or what is.

I look at my INFJ friend and my INFJ uncle (Whose bipolar disorder has torn his family apart many times. I KNOW ITS NOT HIS FAULT HE IS MENTALLY ILL.) and see two people who can never take action for themselves because they have unhealthy Fe that makes them "like" being whipped by others and attracted to an unhealthy dominance that just bites them in the ass in the end because they have in inability to follow their own logic. 

I look at my INTP friend and see a guy who is always having an existential crisis and turns to drugs and alcohol for it instead of getting at least SOME sort of help because he is too stubborn and looks at the logical inconsistencies in EVERYTHING imaginable. 

I see my INTJ friend and see a dude who will never realize that people are just...people and that we all make mistakes. He refuses to take accountability for his actions and will always blame others, which also will always bite him in the ass because he wonders why no one likes him or loves him.

Maybe I have just gotten a bad batch. Idk. I mean, I've known a shit ton of both INFP and INTPs, and they all seem about the same on the whole "depressive" scale to me with similar issues as the ones stated above. 

I'm glad I'm extroverted for this reason. I'm not trying to circle-jerk it, but it's nice that my default setting is toward people instead of the inter workings of my own mind 24/7.  If I had to be an introvert though, I'd probably wanna be an ISTP. Seems like a fun time. Haha,...that is much easier said than done. I don't blame her INFP (I know other INFPs, and many of them are very kind), but she has been terrible to me since the day she married my father (Almost 13 years ago). Being around her is like walking on egg shells. Of course I haven't been an "Angel" to her, I've known her since I was 6. Those aren't exactly "Angel" years for a person. Haha. But she takes any chance she possibly can to get offended at everything everyone does. Many people dislike being around her because she makes everything about her emotions. Christmas time can be hell because of how she gets offended at every little thing that every person does. She has always treated me lesser than her children and always made feel inferior as a child. It messed with me a lot when I was a kid because I felt like everything I ever did was wrong.

She doesn't like me, even if we do have Ne because she sees me as an invader of her emotion, morals, and beliefs. She is literally like Catelyn Stark and Jon Snow from Game of Thrones lol. If I make a joke, it's awkward and unfunny, because she doesn't know how to read sarcasm.

Also, my dad is an ISTJ. He is always on her side 100% of the time. Haha. I'm not just saying that, he really is because he's terrified that he will be alone for the rest of his life and go through another divorce. ISTJs aren't exactly known for their democratic approach to things. I would love to be an ESFJ. It seems like such a nice and simple way of living. I think she is ESTJ...Maybe ENTJ....but probably not ENTJ. Haha.

Some people try typing her as a Fe feeler because of her intense love for her children- but the one thing they don't understand is that she only loves her children because they are an extension of herself. She loves Jaime because he is an extension of her. She only loves things when they're part of HER....which is way more of a Fi thing than a Fe would ever be. Cersei is clearly insane.I've known an emotionally unstable ESTJ, and she was manipulative, insane, controlling, and would literally cut people out of her life in one swoop if they wronged her (It sounds funny, but she seriously is one of the craziest people I have ever met). Cersei is a lot like this ESTJ girl I have met (Sounds impossible, but if she were some queen in the dark ages, I would fucking run). 

Maybe that's a bad way of typing Cersei, but she is a lot like that. She manipulates, even though she isn't as good as she thinks she is. She's incredibly controlling, and will hate anyone who gets in the way of her controlling. She cuts people out of her life...by killing them. Idk. I don't see her as a feeling type at all.I don't see Fe in Cersei at all...I don't get it how people do see Fe. I've always thought she was obviously a Fi type.I have never seen her as an ESTP. She is way to obsessed with power and trying to live up to her fathers name. I can't see an ESTP going to the lengths she did to prove that she is a powerful crazy monster.Idk about Jaime. Probably ESTP. Agreed.Unhealthy ESTJs are the worst of unhealthy types. Haha./r/IamverysmartHow the fuck was that stereotyping? I said UNHEALTHY ESTJ. I didn't say NORMAL ESTJs. I said she happened to be an ESTJ, who acts in the same manner as Cersei does, just to a lesser degree. I have even had this girl take the test when we were friends. Just because she is an ESTJ, and I said she is controlling and crazy, doesn't mean I'm trying to pick on ESTJs and stereotype them. If I say I know a crazy and over emotional ENFP, does that automatically mean I'm making a bias about ENFPs? No. It means this person is an over emotional and crazy wreck who just happens to be an ENFP.

Also, ESTJs DO like to control things. What- do you think ISFPs like to be controlling and like to lead? No., most of the time not. Stereotypes are built for a reason, even if they are incredibly distorted. They don't just come out of thin air. But it's not a stereotype, it's an observation based on tons of other ESTJs seen in real life. Just like you could say ENTPs like to joke. It's not a stereotype, it's something that MOST OF THEM DO LIKE TO DO. I'm pretty sure our little INFJ friend doesn't like his INFJ stereotypes and is trying to say how we are somehow using stereotypes to type Cersei even when they're logical reasons because people do the same thing to him/her. Seems like someone has a lot of self esteem issues...which by the way...is an INFJ stereotype. You're living up to it Grminger!Predicting how a person prioritizes thought IS a way of figure out what someone would enjoy. It would be ignorant to say that it doesn't at least give you a small idea of a persons likes and interests.

How would an argument about MBTI functions hurt someone's feelings? Lol. Yea, I don't think she is ENTJ now that I really think about it. The amount of times I have been called sassy (ENTP) is off the charts. I hear it a lot.ENTPs complain about being productive, but never put forth any useful discussion on how to counter it. It's like everyone in /r/ENTP LIKES being lazy and having half finished projects. And when there is advice put forth, people just try to say it's bad advice. Good one.ENTP- Cinematography.Yes. I had an ENFP friend who was CONVINCED that apricot pits could cure cancer. Like, I would bring evidence up and he would just get pissed at me for questioning what he believed. He even stated that he wouldn't get chemo if he got cancer because he truly BELIEVED that apricot pits were the way to go. Fi. There's nothing more complicated and annoying than someone who is always monitoring their feelings and uses them as their own form of logic.Where does this tooth ferry go?That's why it was actually really hard having an ENFP mother growing up. She would always say "I KNOW THIS IS TRUE". And being an impressionable child, I believed some of the silliest things because my mom truly, wholeheartedly, believed that things were real because she FELT they were real.*SIGHHHHHHH*....ENTP,...I am always laughing and joking about stupid shit that only makes sense to me.Maybe an ENTP would be capable of the most evil because we don't really have any end goal. An evil ENTP would just do it to feel the enjoyment of seeing everything and everyone falling apart. An ENTJ or INTJ does it all for this or that reason,...but us ENTPs would only do it because it entertains us. Nothing's more terrifying than knowing that the pain and suffering of another isn't happening for any reason except for the fact that the evil person who is doing it just...CAN do it, so they do.

Least evil? Eh. Probably ISFP. They're too chill to do anything REALLY evil (hypothetically speaking).Agreed. I'm an ENTP, and as surprising as it may seem for my type, I am really cautious about putting myself in dangerous and risky situations. It can be a blessing and a curse.Looks like a shit ton of reading.LOL,...so true. I know an INFJ who is married to the most bat shit crazy woman ever.We are assuming you think it's accurate because you felt the need to post something that is frequently discussed almost every day. Yea, I've never understood that and I'm an ENTP. I've ALWAYS known I am an ENTP since I took the test.What is wrong with you?

You ignore people's advice, you don't even give responses to people who are trying to help you, and then you threaten to kill yourself over it because you chose to ignore the ones who actually tried to give you solid advice, but would comment on the ones who trolled you? That is the most selfish and stupid thing I have ever heard in my entire life. You need serious help. 

Really, get the FUCK off of Reddit if you think the people here are harming you so much. Stop blaming others for your issues and fix your life YOUR SELF. This is YOUR life and it's YOUR responsibility so stop trying to pin when people say things that you perceive as "mean and hurtful" as them trying to harass you. It's the damned Internet, WECOME. 

I tried giving you advice back on that post a few hours ago but you didn't even comment or say "thanks". All that you did was respond to people who were joking about everything you were saying. It's your choice to always be negative and not see some good in your life. If you refuse to see other peoples points of view...lol well I'm sorry but that's your fault. Good luck.You ARE obsessed. Why do you care so much about your MBTI type? You let it take over your life and define you because you're terrified you're not "a cool personality type".Then get off of Reddit. Get some control in your life some other way. All you're doing is complaining. Take ACTION stop talking about things just to get offended and feel sorry for yourself. 

Get a dog, get a boyfriend, go to college, take a walk, go on vacation- do SOMETHING besides sitting in your room under the covers just waiting for the next Reddit response to get offended at. That just sounds miserable.I'm going to be candid with you- most men probably don't hate you, and if they do, it's because you seem like you're always miserable and trying to get offended at the tiniest things. You're very dramatic. 

Again, I really think you need to get help. Try getting a therapist or seeing a doctor. I REALLY think you could benefit from getting help.Well, my mom is an ENFP and my dad is an ISTJ,...after 11 years my mom couldn't deal with his emotional stuntedness any longer. He was much more dedicated to his work, and didn't know how to communicate in a regular way with his wife or his children (lol me!). He saw her as someone who should "do her duty" as a mother and wife instead of the two of them actually having an emotional connection....they divorced when I was five. So. I mean,...I don't think they would work well together...but who knows. That's just my one example. 

My dad does this thing called "genealogy" which is basically studying your ancestors. He's obsessed with it. I watched a Game Of Thrones episode once where someone said something like, "How could anyone so consumed by the idea of their family have any real conception about what their actual family is doing?"....that quote SPOKE to me like none other. 

Now he's married to an INFP and I don't know how they work at all. But they're too old to divorce now, so what can you do? Divorcing at the age of 53 and 56 would just be stupid in their eyes.

My mom thinks he has a mild form of autism....my step-mom does as well. I wouldn't be surprised at all.I think you might be an ESTJ.That's because your an ESFJ. You're supposed to be a stay-at-home mother...remember?Ah, I too scheme on how to fit in an "arts and crafts" table at the church brunches.Don't waste your money. All the research and knowledge you can gain is all over the Internet for free.Don't waste your money. All the research and knowledge you can gain is all over the Internet for free.They definitely are not crap lol.Haha that's funny because when I'm totally in the present and focused, the exact same thing happens to me. That "What the fuck was that....?" Moment.ENTP, for INFJ. What a surprise.Everything. Literally, everything. All at once.Haha welcome to the world of having a Si that isn't high enough to be useful, but not low enough to me ignored.Just because I hang out with a lot of people does not mean I don't care about you or I am just using you as entertainment. If I got out of my way to be with you all the time, it most likely means I truly care about our friendship and that I find you interesting.

I just naturally talk to people as if we have always been friends. It must be the Fe in me, but I truly hate bottling everything up. I'm not trying to toy with you or mess with you (Not GENUINELY).  That's just the way I am. Introverts always seem to be suspicious of automatic friendliness.

The energy you get from being alone, I get from being with others. When others say, "I hate people"...I think that is such a weird things to say. I don't think I really am capable of hating anyone (Maybe I'll say so outwardly but I don't honestly think I do). I honestly think that people as a whole are incredible.

Just because I'm outgoing and loud, does not mean I'm stupid and oblivious. It just means I get energy outwardly.

I'm sorry I would rather be around people than dogs and cats....hahaha.I get exhausted with small talk as well. I don't think any xNxx actually likes small talk. I hate being touched as well and I'm an ENTP lol. The only time I like it is when I am attracted to the person. It just makes me feel uncomfortable because I don't know how to react. ENTPs and ENTJs have this in common. Haha.Isn't being a virgin like...a rite of passage to be an INTJ though?That's how my ENTJ friend is. Haha. He's 8th best in the state we live in.I too, don't know the names for basic colors.

But seriously, we both know that 95% of those colors didn't actually 'pop into your head'. 

Like ISFP- lemon? Really? REALLY? Why wouldn't you just say yellow?!?!? It's almost like you're bragging that you somehow have a large color word bank.

GOD.Huh? You're saying that when you think of the color blue, that you don't automatically name every single shade of it in your head? That's so weird. I instantly think colbalt, ultramarine, azure, ao, glaucous, and majorelle. I'm not even sure what a normal shade of blue would be anymore! Oh you ISTJ you. Livin' up to those stereotypes! 🤗And then, summer comes along and every snowflake and bit of evidence they were ever there turns into nothingness. All trace of those special little snowflakes gone. Forever....and no one left to remember them or their special uniqueness.Wait, I thought we were making an analogy for the death of the human race and the sun consuming the planet and there being nothing left one day so what does one little snowflake have against the inevitable approach of summer????. Lol I'M OFF TRACK.Haha, an INFP has the audacity to call other types bipolar and psychotic. ;)I think types with Ne and Ni as their first function....

...then again, those types ALL care about being different. So I don't know.

INTPs and INFPs are weird as shit maybe them?If I'm an ESTJ than you must be an ISFJ.Hmm. Sad.I actually learn better when I do things myself. It gives me brain space to think more on it without some person jabbering in my ear going, "X = Y!"

That, or discussions. I really like actual discussions with people to learn. As an ENTP, this sounds like TORTURE.Huh?That's why Fe users can influence others easily, because they see how everyone is feeling. It's why ENFJs, ESFJs, and ENTPs often have that "manipulative" stereotype. Lol INFJ? Those guys don't manipulate anyone. I don't know what you're talking about, because if anything it's often INFJs getting manipulated.Why're you so obsessed with slapping Trump all over MBTI subreddits and trying to get people to go crazy about him? No one gives a shit.I just don't understand how she can be INTJ though. She is explained in the book and movie as being able to change her personality like...instantly according to who she is around so she can be "Amazing Amy" and always be perfect. And people always love her because she is so relatable and perfect, when in reality she is just doing that to get what she wants and make people think she's the best. That does not seem like a Fi trait, it seems like a Fe trait. I think she is a really fucked up INFJ. I can't see an INTJ succeeding in that social situation, because let's be frank, an INTJ isn't exactly known for their ability to read others emotional cues and manipulate them.I'm an ENTP does that count.Or: Excuse me? Why do I have to get you a glass of water? How dare you. I always do everything around the house! *Brings up things that the Thinker didn't even know were problems* AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO ASK ME TO GET YOU A DRINK OF WATER? *runs off crying as the Thinker just sits confused and thirsty*Well, my ISTP brother loves spicy food and I fucking hate spicy food.....idk? Maybe Se like spicy food more because they get a rush from the physical reaction.I wouldn't say I hate INFPs. I know a TON of them, and the only thing they seem to have in common that is negative is their ability to be in the pits over despair of silly things...INTPs are kind of like that too though, so.

But yea, I can't stand ISTJs to be honest...that's probably because I am related to one and we can't be around each other for more than an hour or two.Lol there is no way that she in an extrovert, and she is definitely not an ENTJ. No ENTJ would have such a lack self image and identity as she does.Book version is the same as movie version for Gone Girl. It's a pretty faithful adaption.I don't know what you're talking about, I know an ISFP who can hold grudges like none other.She is NOT an extrovert. It explains it in the book and movie that she is a recluse of the highest degree. Ding ding!...they can still be the same type. They're still individuals. There is tons of both types.

Take Bill Burr for example- very obvious that he is some sort of xSTP with the way he presents his humor. 

Then we have Tina Fey, who is more of an ENTP. 


I think that xSTPs just enjoy the stand-up comedy lifestyle more, and Ne-Si doms would probably rather be behind the scenes writing. Idk. There are a lot of Ne-Si stand-up comedians and there are a lot of xSTP comedy writers probably. Again- I don't think you understand how MBTI works. Just because they seem different doesn't mean they aren't the same personality type. Ne-Si doms seem to have it the most.Some of these are beyond stupid. It's claiming that the REASONS for its existence somehow make it false. Just because one of the creators started it because she wanted to "figure her son out" doesn't make the entire thing bogus. How is that even an argument for it to not being true? Half of these aren't even facts, they just use events that happened that lead to MBTI as a way to prove its falsehood. 

It's like saying, "An APPLE fell on Isaac Newtons head. Not a BRANCH or a LEAF. So obviously gravity can only pertain to APPLES and nothing else!!" That's how dumb all of these sound.Am I the only one who doesn't think INFJs are actually all that rare...? I know like five lol. I know five INFJs.I don't know. Maybe? I have a lot of friends.I'm an ENTP and I have 0% issues with speaking to strangers. In fact, I get more energized off of talking to strangers than I do with people I know. It excites me to get to know someone. There's something about this "clean slate" that you have with a complete stranger that just allows you to make jokes, talk, and ask questions without the worry of them getting absolutely sick of you because they have heard what you have to say a thousand times like with someone you already know well.

This is going to sound SUPER pretentious, but the only time it drains me is if my first impression of this person is that they're an idiot. 

- I hate house parties. The people that are usually at those sorts of things aren't typically the types of people I like to be around. 

- SLEEPOVERS ROCK. I love them. Hahaha.Lol what an ignorant thing to say.Wrong.I like Amy Poehler and Tina Fey.INFJs do love us ;)Why?No, it's not really a problem with all of them. I think it has to do more with Fe and Fi. I get along with ENFJs and INFJs really well. I sometimes struggle with ENFP and INFPs simply because they take their emotions so personally (No offense).You should probably fix that! Lol yup. My dad is an ISTJ and my step-mom is an INFP.I was gonna say,...a LOT of people hate me right off the bat. Haha.Well, of course. But this isn't exactly looking for tiny little things- it's kind of a big deal that I'm sure others have noticed. Especially if it's right in front of your face.I mean,...yea. But what does that have to do with anything? Haha.Nice man!

I don't feel weird. I was just wondering the relevance, because I hadn't realized I put "he" in the post.No. You have your same personality for life. Your brain chemistry isn't just going to change somehow. The only way it changes is through traumatic life events.

Haha even the fact that you said you would "Happy say INTJ" makes me doubt you're INTJ. Maybe you're an INFJ?Well, for me, being an extrovert will almost always be my first choice. Nothing makes me happier in this world than being with people and making them laugh. It's the one thing I'm absolutely positive about. 

That being said, I do enjoy quiet activities such as writing, drawing, and watching films. Sometimes I play video games but not that often. I would say I do enjoy being alone, but the fact is, is that I would rather be with people much of the time. It's like saying...do you prefer chocolate cake or vanilla cake? I like both, but would prefer vanilla.Doorslamming for INFJs. It's not that uncommon, almost any type does this if pushed far enough. Why do we automatically associate it with INFJs? Hell, I've had an ESTJ do this to me before (Thank God though. She was fucking crazy). I've doorslammed people before as well.Explain what you think it is first.Agreed. I've always found it easier to type people who are in their 20s-30s. I think the struggle with typing people older than that (For me personally) is because many of them are parents, and they have had to mold themselves in a way that will make them suitable for parenting, which can make their "genuine" personalities look different.Interesting. I never even considered Clementine being an ESFP. Really? I always thought of him as a feeler, not a thinker. Weird.Never. I've always thought I was an ENTP.Lol Iron Man Trilogy? Why? Probably after High School...I didn't give a shit at all when I was in High School. Middle School was even worse.INTPs. But I think the only reason they question their type so much is because they question every little fucking thing that happens to them. "Oh...I'm sort of outgoing today... AM I AN EXTROVERT??" (Proceeds to retake MBTI test, post on /r/INTP, freak out a little...and then realize the next day that they are still INTPs).

And this is coming from an ENTP. I've never questioned whether or not I am an ENTP once I really looked into it. I'm positive I am.I'm an ENTP.

There is an INFJ and ENFJ. I love it. We can just hangout in the living room and talk forever. 

Beforehand, my roommate dynamic was ESTP, ISTP and INTP. I wanted to shoot myself. I just felt awkward when I was with them at all. I didn't like it.

Before that, the dynamic was ESTP, ESTP, INTP, and That one wasn't bad at all.

Before that, ESTP, INTP, and ESFJ. I really enjoyed that one. 


One thing I have learned- ESTPs are always SOOO ESTP it's insane. They are by far the easiest type to spot and know what they are right off the bat.I don't get why people post things like this. You know you're going to be downvoted right? You know no one is going to give serious answers right? So why post it?!You're right, sorry ISFP :)You're just jelly of ENTPs, aren't you?Because it's better than your rambling nonsensical first function Fi emotions. :)That's hilarious.I was really, really awkward as well until I hit about 17. Still awkward, just not as neurotic. I think ENTPs don't really "fill in" their last two functions till they get older. While you're younger, there is so much novelty going on for your childish brain that you don't even think twice about Fe and Si.Took me 5 minutes.I'm an ENTP. There is no other type I relate to other than maybe ENFPs and ENTJs. ...but I know I'm not either of them....were his answers not obvious satire?Haha, why...?Took multiple tests, got on the subreddits, read the description...I'm sure I am ENTP.Good point.I think it's funny how it is always ESTPs who LOVE ESFx types. I hardly ever get along with most of them- especially ESFPs.1) What is your MBTI type? ENTP

2) What is your gender? Male

3) What type(s) do you admire/respect the most? Typically I would say I like ENxJs the best in this category. Almost every single one I have met has been amazing.

4) What type(s) do you love/adore? Usually xNFJs.

5) What type(s) are the most dateable? xNFJs and ENFPs.

6) What type(s) would you be willing/want to marry? xNFJs.

7) What type(s) make wonderful friends? Hmm...that's a hard one. I really like ISxPs because they are just so CHILL. Like seriously, you could say anything. And they are the ultimate secret holders. I like ENTJs because we can talk logic with each other without any barriers. I really like ENFPs because our Ne's go crazyyyyy which each other. I love INFJ and ENFJs because they are such great listeners who don't seem to truly judge. The only types I dislike as friends are ESxx types.

8) What type(s) makes you laugh? My ESTP cousin is funny. But, honestly...I think I'm the funniest person I know 😬....

9) What type(s) are you uncomfortable around or are hard to talk to? ESxPs 110%. Mostly ESFPs. I just...don't even know how to communicate with them. It's nearly impossible. 

10) What type can you not stand/dislike/respect? Again, I cannot comprehend ESxPs. We literally live on different worlds. We are not experiencing the same reality.Just because it's your truth doesn't mean it's the actual truth though...just saying.My ISTP brother is VERY picky. Like he will puke if a texture is weird to him. I don't even think he's picky, I think it's an actual disorder he hasLol interesting I thought it was the other way around.Embarrassing....but Sail Away by Enya
Not really. ENFPs always seem to clash together haha.As an ENTP, a relationship with an ESTP sounds like hell....personally. I don't know about others.Weird! I would scratch that and say ESxPs. I know a lot of ENFPs who are mistaken for introverts.Maybe. I know an INFJ and ESTJ who are together...they are the most unhealthy relationship I have ever seen. 

I think it just depends on how heathy an individual is. Because neither of them were healthy beforehand, and sure as hell aren't now.Avatar: The Last Airbender...duh?Then what's the point of commenting?Huh? Those are my two favorite types...They can be funny at times, while other times they can be extremely annoying...and that's coming from an ENTP.

The only real reason I don't like them is because I feel like they never have any depth to them. They all just seem the same without real unique  personalities. They're like...evolutions product child for procreation though, so...there's that. I mean think about it- completely physical beings, often trying to attract mates with their physicality, not a lot of "in depth" thinking, pretty in the now...they are basically the end goal for the evolutionary mating process. Haha. 

I've never really gotten along with them though...How very ISTP of you to not think or to consider something theoretical because it's not directly in front of your face and you actually have to think in depth about it.I'm an ENTP and I am really good an minimizing my feelings if they are getting in the way. It can be a super power as well as a curse, because sometimes when I'm in a position where I am supposed to feel a certain way, I don't know how to pinpoint the actual emotions without being a mess.That's what I was leaning toward as well.Lol ESTJ? No way. Are you serious? Bill Burr uses SO much Ti. Explain in depth how you think he doesn't use Ti. Comparing him to another "ESTP" doesn't mean shit. They're still different people.

Why did you delete your other comment saying he was ESTJ??That's not a good way at all to tell. My ISTJ father is ALWAYS planning for the future and ALWAYS talking about the past. Same with many other ISTJs I have known. I'm pretty sure it is impossible for him to live in the now.You still haven't explained why you don't think he is an ESTP...all you have said is, "He's not an ESTP because he clearly isn't"....put away comparing him to other ESTPs that you yourself have typed, and go through the functions.I think you're just terrible at typing people.ENTP, Social, Language, Self.You've got a lot more issues than being a stereotypical ENTP if you zoned out during a three minute test...haha.INFJHa, even though the Joker is an ENTP.ENTP, I'm not terrible at chess.I like how good they are at keeping secrets and are just very "go with the flow". I don't like how "in the now" they are because they always repeat last mistakes.Agreed. Had the same issue for years and years with my step-brother. As we got older, we became really good friends. I think the main issue we have is talking hypotheticals with them. They just...don't care at all about the "theory" of things it seems.  Is your ISTP brother also obnoxiously passive when it comes to arguing?That's what I was thinking, ha.That is so adorable!The ESFJs I know do both of those things.Not true, they are broth pattern finding functions, just in different ways....interesting, because I don't feel that way...ESTP sounds nice. I want to know what it's like to truly live in the moment and go by whatever the day brings. I am constantly living in the past, present and future all together.Is that a stereotype? My Fe doesn't allow me to go out looking like trash. Hahaha. I always try to dress nicely.Probably. I am almost always smiling unless it's something emotional going on that involves other people.I would die if I had four other ENTPs in the same household as me. I think ANY type would die if they all had the same types in a family...except maybe ESTPs. They flock together like none other.Can confirm about tertiary.Weird, I'm pretty obsessed with learning about it.I'm aware...? Did I say anywhere in my comment that differed on that?I think it's because NF like it when things can relate to their feelings and help explain to them why and how they are feeling something. I would say INFJ and INFP are most likely to be involved simply because the majority of Reddit is comprised of introverted individuals.I feel bad for the president.I think it's interesting how Amy Poehler is supposedly and ENTP, yet her character in Parks and Rec is totally ESFJ.Fucked up.Interesting. One of my greatest friends is an ENTJ.Haha. I see flaws in everything, and so do they, so I see flaws in everything they see flaws in...that's probably why.Naturally grumpy? I think you mistaken naturally grumpy with being pessimistic. I'm never grumpy, but I am pessimistic, so everything is just a joke to me,...but that doesn't mean I'm in a bad mood.I never get along with ESTPs.Then why do INTPs apparently always mistaken themselves for ENTPs?I would say this is pretty accurate. I will always consider myself extroverted, as I almost always prefer to do things with other people- but sometimes I really do like to be alone.I've never really agreed with this. I think that ENTPs and INTPs just don't know how to pinpoint anything so they constantly question what they are.I'd say INTPs, INFJs, and INTJs are the most introverted introverts.Being with other people almost always brings me out of a rut. If I am down, it's usually because I'm alone for too long and overthinking things.I don't really know about that. Every INFJ I know is a complete hermit. They're shut inside reading the news about kittens being drowned in a river and feelings guilty that they didn't save them lol.I hated the academic aspect, but enjoyed the social part a lot.I would say I think about 70% in words and 30% in pictures. I have a constant monologue going across my brain, but I am also pretty good at mental imagery.You know how Ni users have "Ah-ha!" moments when they really think about something and it's like the best thing ever for them...? I have those like five times in a minute because there is so much chatter going on in my brain.See, I think that's interesting how you say you "don't believe in dumb-luck", but from my point of view, a person would think the exact same thing if something completely different happened to them. Like say you had a road, and then it split. You chose to go down the left road and when you get to the end, you find a hundred dollars! But...let's say you go down the other road and get hit by a bus. You'll still think, "That didn't happen for no reason" regardless of the situation that was presented to you. To me, personally, I honestly do think everything is just blind luck and that happened because you made the right or wrong choice, and there are patterns that go with those choices. Maybe I wouldn't say I believe in blind-luck...but rather I believe that every thing that happens is just a massive pattern that derived from something else because you made a choice. That's not really what I meant, but sure. Haha. I have it about a hundred different little things and sometimes a big thing. You have it as a big thing.Agreed. This is the thing- INTJs have Fi, and you can't really turn that off...what you feel is what you feel. As an ENTP, with Ti and then Fe...a lot of the time I can logically choose to stop feelings something unless it really, really affects another person in a individualistically tragic way. Remember when that journalist got shot on live TV last year? I was seriously a wreck for like a week after I saw that. I just felt so bad and traumatized for the journalist and the camera man. Like seriously, I felt awful. I don't think there are a lot of things I have seen that have screwed me up that badly. A lot of the time when Fe gets to me, it almost feels good to be a little emotional...it wasn't that way when that happened. I felt 100% pure sadness and anger. If an outer source does something terrible to another person, it's a lot harder to control.

If someone tries to personally attack me though, I can retaliate and literally feel nothing without ever looking back. It's because to my core, my Fe cares more about something terrible outside of my power that could harm another person than myself being harmed. I'm a very "for the greater good" sort of person.ESTPs aren't in depth enough to be sensitive. 

Kidding!I'd say so. My ENFP mother, ENFP cousin and INFP step-mother are like ticking time bombs when they're not in a good mood. I feel the most introverted when I'm depressed and alone to be honest. If I run out of Ne, and I am completely alone with Ti and Fe to guide me...fuck, that is not a good combo. I start to argue with my thoughts, and make up scenarios in my head. But, when Ne is activated and I'm alone, I don't mind it at all, but I still prefer to be around people. ENTP with ADD...but that's pretty much a given with the type. Haha."Why go to sleep when you can stay up and do other things?" HahaHey! I remember bitching at you! Welcome back.ENTP. I would say the first thing people notice about me is that I'm funny and sarcastic. I'm not trying to be cocky, that is honestly what I would say someone thinks about me at first....I agree with him actually. If you already question everything you do or say (Being an ENTP), and someone basically confirms what you're thinking in a negative way, it can mess with you. Just because someone gets offended by something doesn't meant they have Fi.Holy shit, I can relate to that first part. It's like we always wanted to say something to each other, but just...couldn't. It was so odd and exhausting.I am very good at lying, it's just a matter of whether or not I care to do it. Lying is exhausting because I like to tell the truth because I'm an upfront person, but I'm good at it if I really want or need to be.That's funny because ESFPs bug me a lot as well, haha. I have two good ESFP friends though, somehow we make it work. I am a type-A ENTP. I would say that it just expresses itself differently than t would in a xxxJ.Well obviously if they all say the same thing, there is some sort of study and basis to it, lol. In every single one, ESTP is the rarest sensor type. That doesn't just mean nothing. You silly little ISFP you.And where is the study or research that validates your claim?Uh, do you know a large scale study works? You don't need the entire population to get a glimpse at what the majority are like.It seems like INTJs have a real temper.ENTP- Failure and death. The thought of dying terrifies me. I like them, my step brother is one and we find the same things funny when they pertain to the real world...but if to hypothetical weird stuff, it's like a robot who cannot compute. ....look it up. That's not true at all. I have many S friends. Two of best friends is an ISFP and ISTP.It's because you keep using exclamation points in almost every sentence.I don't necessarily think that ENTPs are that difficult to comprehend, but rather I think that people have a difficult time portraying them because they're such an "out there" type and really difficult to mimic without looking like a try-hard. When I try to imagine someone acting like an ENTP I just envision an INFP jumping up and down with a spork in their hand saying how random they are. Hahaha.

I think of all the types, ENTPs are by far the most poorly portrayed in movies, books, media, ect. There's just not really any place for them except in chaotic or comical relief roles because people don't really get their "goals" when that's all there is supposed to be in a movie or book. Beginning -&gt; ending. So when they are introduced, they're just fucking nuts. Joker, Jack Sparrow, Tyler Durden, ect. I think that Tyrion Lannister is the only ENTP I have ever seen that has been correctly done. He is so ENTP it hurts. Haha.Ha, really? I don't think I've seen that. I'm not trying to be an ass, but I have seen way more irrational and childish feeling types than thinker types...specifically xNFP types.Batman vs The JokerI don't listen to music while studying because it just jumbles my mind up more than it already is naturally. But, if I were to choose, I would choose classical music.I'm not saying that as an ENTP I can "keep cool" and always be calm and collected in times of stress. I am saying that of the majority of types who I have seen being emotionally unstable, they are typically feeling types. Yes, I have had emotional blunders where I don't even know how to react, but I think that's a natural human reaction. Um, Joker is in no way an INFJ or ENFP. I barely think he even has a type, but if he did it would be ENTP.The most conflict averse person I have met is an ISTP. Literally will not have an actual argument to save his life because he doesn't wanna stir things up. Ha, really? That's interesting. I have no desire at all to be any of the introverted types. Especially ones within INxx. If I had to choose, I would want to be an ENTJ or ESTP.

I've always thought being an INTJ would be sort of miserable...to be honest.Because the Internet is primarily made up of introverted intuitive types, and I guess INTJ seems the least miserable of the four.It gives me anxiety, but that doesn't mean I would do anything about it. Lol. As soon as I stop looking the anxiety goes away and I forget.Hey! I'm the same way. My gmail is clean, but I have a spam email that has over 2,400 unread.I come off as confident, but I'm actually extremely self-conscious about my intelligence. I always feel like I'm actually an idiot and that everyone else is somehow smarter than I am.I have deja vu ALL the time. I think it's a Si thing.87%I think that INFP and INTPs are probably the most likely to be "lost in their own worlds"....just because a T analyzes things does not mean they don't daydream. I am ALWAYS thinking of hypothetical scenarios in my head about being in a "better place"....it is not just a F type to be in the clouds. The only different is theirs is typically about feelings, while mine is more about futuristic events and situations.It's a joke.Lol ENTPs just have sociopathic ideas that we play with in our minds and when debating other people. I doubt most would actually act upon them or take them seriously.

ESTPs and ISTPs though? The "physical" types? I could see that turning out badly I suppose.

Besides...what even defines these types as being sociopathic? People might think it's because of the Ti-Fe, but if anything, I think that someone with Fe-Ti could be even worse of they end up justifying their actions with their feelings- take Hitler(INFJ) for example. A driven sociopath is worse than one who doesn't care.I just took it and got 20...Wow, that was a really, really awfully written comment. Hahaha.

It probably confused OP even more about Ne and Ni.I usually just forget where I park my car at University because I'm so in my own head when walking and being alone that it's basically just auto pilot when I get out of my car and walk to class...I disliked some of the comparisons....pizza vs chocolate? There is literally no correlation or reason to choose between the two, they are in such different categories. It would have made more sense to saying something like "Hard candy or chocolate?" or "Burger or pizza?"....chocolate and pizza is just such a strange thing to ask someone to choose from, haha.Yea, my ESFJ roommate never ever shuts the hell up. And I thought that I was extrovert....lol. My roommate has definitely proved that he is more of one than I am.1. Tyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)
2. Liz Lemon (30 Rock)
3. Jim Halpert (The Office)I don't understand this. I've never EVER met an INTP who is "identical" to an ENTP. I think there are fairly obvious differences between the two much like ENFP and INFP.Ugh,...this is too real to handle...

That is 100% an ENTP.To laugh at it.Communication is often easiest with my ENTJ friend. The worst at communicating is one of my ISFP friends.As a playground that I continuously fall off the monkey bars and get the wind knocked out of me. Rinse, repeat.Hmm...truly a revolutionary thought.Not really. I only go to /r/ENTP and this one. The rest are either too depressing or annoying.I like being with people a lot, but also need some time to myself...I don't know how much specifically, maybe one or two days out of the week.You sound like an ISFP to me. Everything you do reminds me of one of my ISFP friends.Agreed. They seem very similar to me.Yes! I agree with the ENTP and ESFP comparison. They have that same sarcastic humor to them and all around outgoing behavior.I'll never understand this. I get that they are similar, but I don't understand how people can think they are THAT similar. I've never thought I was an INTP. I think there are very obvious differences between the two. I got 11/40. I know strengths and weaknesses, but I am certainly not delusional about them....at least I don't think...shit, that could be a delusion.

I had my ENTJ friend take it and he got 30/40.They are as different as it comes haha.Fisher King or Domination would be the way I would go. I think Domination would be the best because my intelligence would sky rocket and I would be immortal.For individuals who made such sizable impacts in history, it's interesting how the only proof of them existing is in the Qu'aran.   Not really sure about this one...I have always had excellent handwriting, and I'm an ENTP. Haha, I even won a "Handsome Handwriting" award in 1st grade. I don't think it has much to do with type.All stereotypes comes into being for a reason though :).That makes no sense in the context of what you were saying, but okay. Haha.Don't worry about meeting another one in real life, you'll probably hate them. I've only met one other ENTP who I could actually stand.Why does it look like a childrens food menu? Jesus, just make it simple.Reddit and Facebook (It's interesting to see how stupid people truly are) are pretty much the only ones I use. I have an Instagram, but only really get on it to post a photo every few months.All I know is that ESTPs would probably win.I don't recall INFPs having big issues with offending people. Isn't that like...the point of Fi dom?That's exactly how it is for me. Not having others around for an extended amounts of time drains me and makes me depressed. I don't really know if this is true. I know a lot of introverted extroverts who are ENFP and ENTJ....I honestly think it's just intuitive types as a whole.I think I agree with him being an INFJ. He is a complete idealist who wants nothing more than to be with his mother forever. 69% Trinitarian and 31% Quaternarian 

-Casually Trinitarian-That's what I thought as well. There is no way she is an ESFJ though. She must be an ESTJ. I can see where one might think that she is an ESFJ, but if you really watch interviews with her it's clear she is a thinker not a feeler.70%...but the value of the cards certainly changed once in a while. I had one card that had all of the diamond stack on each other, said it would be sunny, got it wrong, then got the same one, said it was cloudy, still got it wrong.You do not sound like an ENTJ...ha.I'm an ENTP and I am very, very good at typing people.Same. I just feel awkward and strange when crying about real things.I have an appreciation for art, I just struggle finding "deeper meanings" in things that don't have any meaning (in my point of view). I love realism. One of my favorite paintings is called Raft of the Medusa. I don't feel like any of these are right. Haha. Elastigirl is definitely not an ISFJ. She is way too stubborn and hardheaded. Does she really seem like Si is her first function? Haha.

With Mr. Incredible, I think it's pretty obvious he is a Si user with the way he lives in the past a lot of the time.


Yes. I've only come across one other ENTP who didn't make me one to blow my brains out (I'm good friends with her now). I've meet two other ENTPs. One told me that he quit High School because "it was too easy for me." He also said "I only quit smoking because of money. Smoking isn't even bad for you."......ugh. The other one referred to himself as a "creative genius with an IQ of 180."...so....yea. 

I like my ENTP friend though because we are very much on the same level. We can be sarcastic with each other and not get offended in the slightest. She's fun.Don't have to be mistyped to have a lame subreddit :).Not really. I actually like the ENTP subreddit more than the others.  Especially when I go to the INFJ subreddit for a moment and the top post is "Don't mistake my kindness for weakness. I am kind to everyone, but when someone is unkind to me, weak is not what you are going to remember about me." I rolled my eyes so hard they almost got stuck in the back of my head.I don't know why you're getting downvoted. It's true. Haha, what the fuck?

I've visited the ENTP subreddit regularly for a long time. The "astrology makes sense" statement is a boldfaced lie. The only thing I've seen is someone who doesn't know much about MBTI coming on and mentioning astrology with every other person shutting them down. I have no idea why you would think it's "50%" or that that is a common occurrence in the ENTP subreddit. I've seen maybe five or six of those posts (all of which are downvoted) in the year that I've been a member of that sub...which is no different than every other MBTI subreddit.There is no obsession. He's just saying it because he saw maybe one or two posts about it. I cannot think of one TP I know who gives astrology any validation. He's probably just saying it because the INTP subreddit gets a bad name and ENTP doesn't.The one post you just linked your argument to literally has what I just said. Hardly any upvotes, and then sarcastic comments. If ENTPs comment on it, it's not because they agree with astrology, it's to poke fun at the person who does. Your original comment made it sound as if the opposite were true. Intelligence: 7

Looks: 7

ENTP....wow, this is the most INTP comment I've ever read.xNTPs.For me it's like a film inside of my head. My brain is pretty much dominated my words, but I still have a pretty good minds eye. There is a "disease" that some people have called aphantasia in which they have no minds eye. For me it's like a film inside of my head. My brain is pretty much dominated by words, but I still have a pretty good minds eye. There is a "disease" that some people have called aphantasia in which they have no minds eye. Have you heard of aphantasia? You might have that.That's a good analogy for facial features in my mind. I can imagine everything else very well aside from faces.That show is still on?That's exactly what I put as well.I always have an internal monologue going on. Always. It's like I live in two different worlds.No, I don't. I don't think it has to do with type. I never cover my mouth while I'm smiling or laughing.No, I sometimes ask people if they've taken it when I get to know them, and then I guess their type. Haha.Haha, yes!Please, tell me more. Stroke my ego till it bursts.ENTP:
-When people take everything with absolution...if it's said by someone that is "higher" up than them in some sort of made up scale, then it's true.

-When people are rude to complete strangers...I absolutely hate it. I have a lot of Fi friends and it's like they don't give a shit about strangers. It annoys the hell out of me.

-People who work out, and then sit on the fucking couch with their sweaty bodies...what is wrong with you? Holy shit.

-People who sneeze into their hands.

-People who aren't willing to take risks.

-When someone doesn't listen to logic, and instead bases everything off of feelings that have no factual basis.

-My ESFJ roommate who thinks I actually give a shit about his incredibly boring day and that I somehow would actually want to sit and listen for an hour about some "amazing" experience he had with a stranger at a bus stop.

-When people have no ambition.

-People who do everything for their own made up morals instead of what's best for society as a whole.

-When a Ni user is stuck up and can never see "the point" to something that is just for fun. I've met a few Ni users like this.

-A huge crowd of people at some sort of rave where there is bass music going on. Fuck. That. If I wanted to have a bad trip on acid, I would do it myself.Aka: xxFJs.Here's the thing...a lot of the time we ENTPs only do that if we feel like it. I can honestly stop caring in an instant if I chose to. I think that ENFPs just have a more...oh, I don't know...authentic feeling? Like, if they are comfortable enough around you, they're "warm" feeling is almost one of dedication because of their Fi.

Here's and example: earlier today I held the door open for a group of people even though I didn't have to and they still would have been fine...I don't know why I did it. If I said that I did it because I "feel" kind doing it...that would be a lie and I would feel fake just saying that. I only did it because I wanted to help them out, not because of some moral dedication toward being kind. It's hard to explain.

My feelings are malleable. If I don't logically think something I'm feeling emotionally is going to help me, my natural instinct is to try and shut it off...there have only been a few times in my life where I have been unable to control that. I'm just really good at adapting to a situation that requires me to be nice to someone or impress them. ENTPs have Fe, ENFPs don't. Fe can also come off as fake sometimes...which is why there is often a prejudice against ExFJs for their seemingly manipulative behavior. But having Ti before Fe helps me make it look like I'm not being fake....which makes it really easy to convince people of something if I want them to because I'm instantly analyzing their facial expressions and tone of voice on what to say next...it works best when they're talking about something theoretical or something that is a blatant bullshit lie.

I think most xxTP types are like this...but I imagine ExTPs would be better at it. I've always felt like I have a very good grasp on what's right and wrong. ExFJ types let their feelings limit them, IxFJ types never seem to know what they want, and IxTP types often seem emotionally retarded. I think Ti-Fe is an excellent mix for times of crisis and adapting.ENTP here.

It's a very mixed bag. I can't stand some ENTP people I have known...either I hate them or love them. I've only liked one a lot. Exactly the same for me...as an ENTP.Yes. Therapy helped me a LOT. Why don't you just try finding a better therapist? Do you honestly think "...and how does that make you feel?" Is something that a good trained professional is going to ask? You just need to look for a new one.I feel like therapy works really well for ENTPs...we love to talk about issues, discuss problems, and dig deeper. I loved when I had a therapist. It was so great to just spew things to someone who would listen and give constructive feedback.Interesting. I like the ENTPs subreddit better than the ENTPs I have met in real life.Yes. I cannot stand summer.Autumn&gt;Spring&gt;Winter&gt;SummerBut! At least I'll be remembered a millennia later :).Yea, but you're an INFJTyrion Lannister is the poster child for ENTPs. Honestly a perfect example.Oh, shit. Didn't read the text. Haha!Would you just stop being an ESTJ for like one second and listen to others logic? Yes! Haha, that's exactly what I was thinking. Everyone is so devastated...(I am, but with other crap in my life right now...I just can't find myself to passionately care as much as I would have a month ago)...I'm honestly really curious to see what happens next. What DOES worry me is my rights as a gay man, and how Mike Pence being the hands of the puppet will affect me and other minorities. 

As someone who has never really delved into the LGBT community (I have a lot of issues with it), this situation is forcing me to really put things into perspective based solely on my sexuality...which is odd.Yes. The point of any opposing forces is to always understand the each view. If we can't do that, then how will we ever progress?As an ENTP with my third function being Fe, I do a lot of these things as well. True. It is funny to see people reactions because people flip out over the dumbest things.I think you're thinking of xSFJs on Facebook. THEY are the shitposters of Facebook.You know how Ni dominate types have big "EUREKA!" moments? I don't know about ENFPs, but as an ENTP with Ne being my dominate function, I have little eureka moments going off in my head like five times a minute. That's how I realize things.

I'm very good at finding solutions very quickly.ENTP, I am now 19. 

When I was a little kid...getting a rise out of people was my forte. Something about annoying people and just making them go crazy about stupid things... I found it hilarious. 

 Now that I'm older I have more tact with it. I've realized that it truly can harm me to do that...so I have calmed down a lot.That I question my intelligence on a daily basis. Even when I know I'm good at something or I know I can do something, there is still that little doubt in the back of my mind at all times.Why am I being downvoted? I said that's how I was a KID. I am so fucking confused.I envy Se sometimes. It must be nice to just...be. But then I also see how a lot of my friends who are Se users never think of the consequences of anything....(mostly xSxP types). They don't think ahead and then end up repeating the same mistakes or doing something incredibly risky with their lives.

Pretty dark example: my ISTP brother was a total adrenaline junkie. He was pretty successful, but did shit just to live in the moment. He is now dead because he didn't know how to think ahead with "whatever happens, happens" being his mantra.


Not trying to shit on Se. I honestly do wish I could just be in the moment sometimes because I'm always in the future and sometimes I'm in the past. It can get annoying that when I'm doing something super fun my first thoughts are "I need to video this so I can relive the moment that I'm not even really living right now in sixty years!!!". Haha.He was my step-brother. We met when we were five and were super close that we were practically blood brothers. We even had the same name (crazy right?). He was only 9 months older than I was. He died a few weeks ago on Halloween morning.lol yea my life rocks right now.

And thank you.You basically just explained my brother. So frustrating isn't it?Jodie Foster is not an INFP...she is an INTJ.So then why're you saying INFP types then?Hmm...Amy Poehler maybe? But I doubt she is an ENTP sometimes. I think she might be ENFx. Tina Fey is pretty cool though. I'm pretty sure she is an xNTP.I think Hazel from The Fault in Our Stars is an INTP.Idk, but I'm an ENTP and I've always gotten Ravenclaw for tests.Saying it's all about Ne-Si is kind of pushing. Almost every bipolar person I have known is INxx...usually INFJ.I'm not completely sure, but every bipolar individual I have met is an INxx...typically INFx.If I had a dollar for every time I heard an INFJ use the word "exhausted"....I would honestly have a good amount of money.ENTP...got the same thing. Haha.I doubt it. ISTPs are pretty common.I've actually known a good amount of male INFPs. The ones I've known are pretty cool, but take their feelings a little too seriously.I remember that study. It seemed that there was a correlation between having Fe and being LGBT.That's why I like hanging out with other Ne dons. They are often on the same "wavelength" as me and it's way easier to socialize with them without feeling like a complete idiot.Lol really? Every time I go to the INTP subreddit I just see depressing posts. I pretty much only stick with ENTP and this subreddit because they are honestly the best ones. I'm really good at predicting people. That's about it. I can read their logic well, but not personal feelings.ESFJs never seem to know how to shut up. My roommate is one...and he will just go on and on and ON about the most mundane things and act like it is the most dramatic and defining moment of his life.

Yes, I understand that you almost kissed this girl. No, I don't care. Please, stop telling me for 45 minutes about what you feel for this girl. Ugh...I'm not trying to not be your friend, stop saying that. Stop! I'm leaving now...no seriously, I'm going in to my room...and I'm going to stay there. Okay, cool...yup you play that guitar and sing about love. Yep! Uh huh....bye...no seriously, I'm leaving. STOP! OH MY GOD. I know, I know, I'm a cruel and terrible person because I didn't walk my friend to their car and they could have been raped in a student housing apartment complex parking lot in broad daylight. No, that wasn't my pee stain on the toilet. No, you don't need to know the exact time for when I'm going to be home later tonight. Okay, well if you care so much about a few dishes in the sink then you can clean them since they aren't mine...nobody else in this apartment gives a shit about "roommate meetings" aside from you...k...okay...yep...I get it, YOU KNOW BEST. BYE!!!!!!!! 

And then I somehow escape into the night...exhausted from the most boring and bossy sounding conversation of my life. Really...? I've known a lot of talkative ENFPs, but also a lot of quiet ones. I've always thought ESFx types were the most talkative.My ENTJ friend is often so blunt that he doesn't realize how rude he is being. He constantly complains about how he can't get girls...and he literally CANNOT comprehend why he doesn't get girls because he thinks he is amazing. It seems that ENTJs are often really oblivious about what others think and it can screw them over in social situations.

It seems that ENTJs often lack in that. They don't seem to be that great with people.Because everything is a joke. Literally. Life is the biggest joke ever told- so why be so serious about it and not have some fun? 

...the reason an ENTP might be this way, is because a lot of people perceive things that really aren't that big of a deal to be a HUGE deal...and to an ENTP this is funny because whatever it is doesn't matter on an objective scale to them. Like in the grand scheme of things...does whatever you're freaking out about REALLY matter? Probably not.

Haha, maybe that's why there are so many shitposters who are ENTPs. Ya'll freak out about the stupidest things and it's entertaining. "R-r-r-REPOST!"...who fucking cares?! It's not like some other people haven seen it anyway.

An unhealthy ENTP can really make this go out of hand if they are in a bad place in life. "I should probably do my work....but...wait...does it REALLY matter if I do it...? Hmm...nah."

Chaos can be fun.
Hey...I didn't ask for this brain :D. It's not my fault nothing matters. Sorry I'm not good at lying to myself, haha.

Also, I don't wonder that...because I know why. Every ENFP I know who gets rid of Ne and tries to run on pure Fi is typically unhappy and is like walking on egg shells when trying to joke with them.Because they aren't trying to suppress their first function. Haha.Don't analyze your feelings, first feel your feelings and then analyze them afterward and realize the mistakes you made! Duh!Subjectively? Sure. Anything can "matter" according to whatever an individual thinks "matters"...because a brain can think whatever it wants, regardless of truth. That's one of the defining characteristics of intelligent consciousness! Objectively? Prove it. Someone doesn't like being an ENTP.. ;)

Anyway, no. Your type doesn't change. Think of it like a computer...specifically a Microsoft laptop. Let's pretend you're a Microsoft laptop. You have a processor, keyboard, screen, etc. You can do a lot! Let's pretend that in your little computerish mind, you see an Apple MacBook...you're like... "shit, I wanna be that." so you do everything in your power to make yourself more like a MacBook (I'm not an expert on computers, so forgive me if I don't know what I'm saying)...you even change your background to that purple floating lights background that Apple always has. You basically replace parts and change so much that you're like...the spitting image of a MacBook. Woahhh.

But then you notice...that no matter how much you change, there are still things a MacBook has that you don't. Things that can't be changed with out like...killing you. There is still that hint of Microsoft in you that will always remain, and will never be able to truly be an efficiently running machine unless you're made that way. 

You realize how unhappy you are trying and trying to be a different type of computer, because the fact is...you're not, and there is no changing it. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is, we are all computers...but everyone is a different brand and type of computer with different internet history and applications and speed. We have the same basic parts with a few different little details thrown in that can make that individual computer BETTER, but not different completely.

So, no. You can't change your type. And trying to doing so will just make you an unhealthy person. Kind of like how ENFPs often try to get rid of their Ne because they're embarrassed by it, and then somehow think their Fi Te is superior logic and end up becoming walking land mines of offensiveness! :) You're not ENTJs! Get over it!

It's like sexuality, you are what you are. What you're saying is the equivalent to an in the closet person saying, "Well,...I find it hard to believe people can't change their sexuality. I could probably be straight and get married." You're only saying that because deep down you want to believe it's true even though it's not :D.

Interesting, my ISTJ dad will be happy to know my sexuality is fluid and that I'm not actually gay and that I was just on the wrong side of the "fluid spectrum" the whole time!

What I'm saying is...if you changed all those things, you are no longer "you". You're a completely different person. Your functions are what make you YOU. In order or you to change types, something traumatic would have to happen...like completely removing your core processor or RAM and switching it with a different one...effectively destroying you and replacing you with something else.

And you understand what I was trying to say, you're just trying to twist it with more in depth computer logic when I was just making a general metaphor to represent a point that you clearly understand.


Okay, it's not the BEST metaphor, but you get the general idea.You're not changing your type with "maturity", you're just adapting to the situation and becoming a more rounded person (in case of your second argument).

Your type can only really change with brain injury. I'm not offended, it's just obvious what point I was trying to get at and obviously you're too set on changing types because it's clear you hate the fact that you can't have "laser focus" or whatever like an ENTJ which is why you constantly post on ADHD begging for affirmation and why you're posting here to be affirmed that types change when they don't. You're offended by the idea of cognitive functions being permanent because you can't stand the thought that you're stuck with what you have and can't become something "better".

Here, I'll make it simpler for you:

Bears.

Polar bear. Grizzly bear.

Different species of bears, but both bears.

Different life experiences. Both still their individual species of bear.

Put Grizzly bear in arctic wasteland.

Grizzly bear probably doesn't function well. Used to a completely different environment, tries to adapt, yet still just isn't a Polar bear no matter how much it imitates a Polar bear in the same situation.

Grizzly bear is STILL a Grizzly bear, no matter what fucking happens. It was born that way, it will die that way. Even if you put it in the same position as a Polar bear. YES, they are both bears, but they cannot completely change themselves to become the other one. What? Are you going to reference me scientific studies on Grizzly bears becoming Polar bears and say how fucked up my metaphor is? You get the fucking idea.

You can ADAPT and COMPENSATE for what you lack in, but you cannot become something completely fucking different and be on the same level of whatever it is you are trying to become.

Does dying your hair red make you a natural redhead? No. Does someone identifying as a fridge make them a fridge? No. 

You were born an ENTP, you will die an ENTP. Sorry to make you feel worse about yourself because you can't stand the thought processes of your mind.I'm acting out? Take a look at yourself.

I said YES, they can in traumatic situations. Aka, brain injury. I said in another comment that people's types don't change outside of that, they just adapt and become more well-rounded. 

And the same argument could be used for you because you're so "set" that types can change. 

It's not grasping for straws if is so blatantly true. Please, tell me that isn't why you posted this entire thread. Tell me confidently that you didn't post this because you don't dislike aspects of being an unhealthy ENTP.Wat.The Middle by Jimmy Eat World

ENTPISFP maybe.I could see that to an extent.I don't think this is true at all. I gesture all the time while I am talking. I don't think it has to do with type.The INTP subreddit is entertaining? I always thought it was depressing. The ENTP one rocks though.I grew up LDS. I left the church when I was 16 though. My mom was livid. Of course, when I say that people are like "Oh? Are you records still in the church?" And I say, "I don't know...probably?" and they say, "Ha! Well technically you're still Mormon then!"....like...please.Are you the one who can't shut up?Probably xxFJ types(Fe doms). Te doms and Ti doms would probably just be conflicted by the dark side all the time...ha I know I would be. Probably wouldn't turn full dark side personally, but would probably be a rogue grey Jedi. Fi doms would probably be all about the force, they would just hate how restricting it is.

Take Ahsoka from Clone Wars for example. ENFP. Still likes the force, just couldn't take the Jedi council. Same with Anakin: also an ENFP, eventually went nuts because of how constricting he found the beliefs...and turned into a psychopathic ISTJ.I think ENTJs and INTJs are more likely, given that they don't have Si dom (aka, I must follow my forefathers).

Haha, xxTP types would just be like, "Fuck you all. I'm going to go hunt shit for bounty money with my Jedi powers."No way in hell is Anakin anything but a feeling type. Haha. That guy is unhealthy feeling types product child.Well, that's just feeling the "force". Whether or not you're a Jedi or Sith, you're still going to feel the force.Um, no. More like ISTJ. That man is way too obsessed with bringing back the old ways to be anything but Si.Is ceasing to care rebelling when it comes to being a teenager? Because that's how I was. I just...did things. I was not purposefully trying to rebel against my parents. I also think Tina Fey is an ENTP. I do not think she is an INTP.Uh, Francis Underwood?We have had ISFP and INTP presidents? Who? How is Darth Vader an INTJ? But he did those things because Sideous told him to. He's a complete worker bee for Sideous...just like most ISTJs are. He doesn't seem to second guess the Sith Lord dude until the very end.They're used through Jedi intuition hahaLol?Such a Ni response.Request to see the other temperamentsI avoid ESFJs ISTP INTJ....? That is honestly one of the last types I would see him as.Well...can you tell me why you think he's an INTJ?...yea still not seeing it. He seems like a clear Ne user. I find it hard to believe as well that an INTJ could do improv very well. Not saying they can't, I just don't see them excelling in it much compared to an xNxP type.

Interesting that you think he's an INTJ though. I would never have even thought of that for him...at all. Haha.Improv IS Steve Carells forte. It's how he started out. He went to Second City in Chicago. I truly do not think he is an INTJ, and I don't really understand where you are even getting it from that that could be his type because I just do not see any of it in him.

And yes, xNxPs do often dominate improv.https://youtu.be/ydypwRMQeKU

https://youtu.be/XCNYPwCRRYw

Here. Just look at these videos and still tell me you think he is an INTJ.Hmm...now I'm thinking you just aren't good at typing people. Haha.Oh you feeling types. :)I wasn't using that as a way of typing him completely, it was just one small example.What is wrong with you...ISTJ? :DDustin an ESTJ? I don't think that's accurate at all. Seems like a clear ENxP to me.How dare youEh...it's true. Nancy is the teenage girl- Mikes sister. Joyce is Wills mom.I could see INFJ.Whathttps://psyphics.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/cognitive-functions.png

Like this, maybe? 

Or this:

https://m.imgur.com/mjPN5Vr?r

I think the Ne representation could have been better for the first one- but it's still cool. It makes it look as if Ne is completely random...but I don't really think of it that way.I'd say I get a persons type correct about 90% of the time.Complete opposite experience for me. Every INFJ I have known gives so many chances it's ridiculous. Person 1- INFP

Person 2- ESTP or ESTJ. Not sure.

Person 3- INFJ

Person 4- INTPIt's common for introverted types to have more mental issues than extroverted types. I'm probably going to get hate for that...but it's true. I don't know about types individually though. Of the bipolar people I have known, most are INFJ or INFP. If that says anything. Precisely!WowI'm an ENTP.

Dad is ISTJ, mom an ENFP, oldest sister is ENTJ (a pretty neurotic one), and my other older sister is an ISFP

I didn't realize my mom was an ENFP for the longest time because she is so serious. Then I realized that a super serious ENFP is often one who tries to hold back their Ne and run on Fi-Te...trust me it's literally the worst thing to witness because it's like walking on egg shells.

I honestly feel like I was born into the wrong family sometimes. I'm nothing like any of my family and it's just bizarre being around them. It's Fi overload.I think Darth Vader is an ISTJ.ENTPs by far.

I think it's because it's hard to put an ENTP into a story with out the entire concept and idea behind the story unraveling and becoming sort of a caricature of what the story is supposed to be. I don't think people really understand how ENTPs think aside from ENTPs themselves, because we are very, very different on the outside than we are on the inside. Not to mention that when people DO try to create ENTP characters, they often become ridiculous and cringy. I can only think of a few fictional ENTPs that actually represent us well:

Tyrion Lannister is probably the most accurate representation of an ENTP I have ever seen in fiction. Everything he does is exactly something I would do. I relate to that characters thought processes a lot. It's really interesting to see how he is just caught up in the middle of all of these incredibly ambitious individuals, and he just rides the waves and adapts to whatever he gets...and he does it because he enjoys the game, not to become some sort of ruler like everyone else wants to be. A quote I relate to a lot: "Everyone's always asking me to believe in things- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting, until I saw where belief got people." 

Jim Halbert from The Office is also pretty good.

Over the top:

Captain Jack Sparrow is an example of a "caricature" of an ENTP. But it's okay, because he's obviously supposed to be ridiculous.

The Joker is an ENTP...but obviously he's not sane. His views of the world are ENTP on steroids with a little dash of insanity.

I corrected it.
...
...




Please don't hurt me.Because of the Fi vs Ti. They outnumber me four to one. xNFPs have this knack to take everything personally if they're unhealthy, and ISTJs shoot down theoretical humor. I know this sounds cheesy...but I just felt like I was the only one who actually questioned things worth questioning growing up. I was thought of as the black sheep because I was more outgoing, outspoken, and not as much about being a top tier student as I was about being with people and reading. Hmm. I think a well rounded character will often exhibit a personality that correlates correctly to MBTI. One who is realistic, and one who repeats the same behavior and doesn't totally go off course with their personality. Sure, a poorly written character could have a "super personality"- but those are typically unpopular characters in the first place because they're unrealistic.

Let's look at...Regina George from Mean Girls. Weird example, I know. Queen bee, easily manipulates people because she pretends to relate to them, a people person, extroverted, cares too much about social status and being on top. Automatically just from that we can pretty much cross out like eight personalities...mostly ones with Fi. 

Bases everything off of feelings. Easily offended. Loves attention. Wants to have people under her thumb because she wants to be popular. Again, we can pretty much cross out another like...four types. This time, probably Ti. 

Then, she's clearly extroverted, so that crosses out IxFJs. It's pretty obvious she is an ExFJ...probably ESFJ. 

Could you ever see Regina George suddenly flipping around and using cold cut logic? Would she ever suddenly decide to be a math geek? No. Because to a certain extent, she is a character with specific motives and a specific personality. She isn't going to become a "super type" and suddenly want to sit around reading books on physics like an xNTx might. That would be SO out of character. 

I know that was a pretty lame example and not really in depth, but still. I think that typically you can narrow down a character to at least one or two different types, especially in a television show where you get more and more of the character as time goes by.Hmm, to an extent I have tried talking to them about it. But I'm way more into MBTI than they would ever care to be. 

And yes, I am in contact with them...I'm just not close to my siblings really.Haha maybe you think ENTPs are everywhere because they stand out so much.Walter White is an INTJ.Hmm, maybe. She is pretty hilarious if you watch her interviews.I could see that as well.I would never put Cersei as an INTJ, haha.

My typing:

Daenerys: INFJ

Jon: ISTJ

Arya: ISFP

Sansa: ENFP (maybe ESFJ...she definitely has Ne)

Tyrion: ENTP

Cersei: ESTJ

Jamie: ESFP

Melisandre: ENFJ

Sam: INFP

Olenna: ENTJ

Margaery: ENFJ

Tywin: ENTJ

Varys: INFJ

Littlefinger: INTJ

Robert: ESTP

Rob: ESTJ

Ned: ISTJ

Cat: ESFJ

Joffrey: ESFP

Jorah: ISTJ

Greyworm: ISTP

Ramsay: ESTP

Roose: ISTJ

A lot of ambitious people on Game of Thrones.What makes you think Cersei, Ramsey, Samwell, or Margaery are what you typed them as? I think Cersei is a very obvious ESxJ, personally. I also think Samwell fits INFP to a T. I honestly don't think there are any INTPs on Game of Thrones, haha.Melisandre seems like an ENFJ to me...and there is no way Dany is anything but an xxFJ. She is incredibly ambitious, and usually is unwavering in her idealistic goals, especially when they involve people around her. I think she has Fe.Interesting...because I find ESFPs the most difficult to get along with of any type, and it just so happens that ENTPs and ESFPs are complete opposites. Haha. It was sort of funny because before I ever found MBTI, there were certain people that I just COULD NOT get along with...two of them I eventually somehow became friends with, had them take the test, and what do you know...both ESFPs. Our friendships are odd.

ENTP: Ne Ti Fe Si

ESFP: Se Fi Te NiI think from an outsiders perspective, Fi can be the most frustrating function to deal with.From an outsiders perspective, it's such a Fi thing to observe a Fi user not realize how others have to deal with your Fi sometimes :).Hmm, I understand now.Haha, Dumbledore an INTP. I think he is an ENFJ.Hmm...

First off, I think ESTPs are MUCH more likely to actually act on their sociopathic tendencies then ENTPs. ESTPs are all about experiences, ENTPs are all about ideas...I feel like an ENTP sociopath would just have super fucked up thoughts, but not actually act on them.

It's probably the Ti Fe combo. When I'm feeling remorse, pity, or sadness, it's because I'm being rational about my feelings in the first place. I don't typically get sad over irrational things...because that just doesn't make sense to me. I don't know if I speak for any other Ti Fe users, but trying to just FEEL something with out analyzing it first can be very difficult. I think in the case of Ti Fe sociopaths, they just ignore their feelings completely since often what they're feeling is supposed to be on a "personal" level...yet we feel on an objective level, so we can get rid of that "personal" outlook and see that person as nothing more than one small ant in a sea of other ants (I'm talking about an unhealthy ExTP here). Basically, what is one small ant compared to an entire colony? Nothing. We rationalize our feelings first on an OBJECTIVE scale, we don't just feel things right off the bat typically and take everything personally.

I for one have noticed that I accidentally do things like this. For some reason I'll feel so empathetic toward strangers and groups of people, and being rude makes me uncomfortable...yet it's like I can instantly switch off my emotions if someone close to me "personally" is trying to wrong me or argue with me. I can't really do that with complete strangers or individuals I don't know. At all. I've noticed Fi users are much better at being rude to strangers...I literally feel terrible when I am.

Example: I was driving down the road with my ISFP friend on my college campus, and there was this girl riding her bike sort of in between the road and sidewalk. It sort of blocked our path, but not really. It wasn't that big of a deal. Suddenly, my ISFP puts her hand over the wheel and honks super annoyingly. The girl looked back super embarrassed and you could tell she felt stupid. I was livid. It just made me so angry and I felt bad because it wasn't that big of a deal. I could have gone around her, yet my ISFP friend felt the need to embarrass a complete fucking stranger. My ISFP friend on the other hand was like "Haha, why the hell was she in the middle of the road? Dumb bitch."...I just felt embarrassed for the chick, because honestly she wasn't even in the road that much. It was dark out and she probably couldn't see. But I was just so angry with my ISFP friend for doing something so dumb to a stranger. Idk if I am explaining this well...I've been up for 24 hours. I give up.I think Amy in Gone Girl is an INFJ. It's said through out the movie that she has like...no friends because she is so secluded until she wants to be "the best" at something.Wow, you insulted BOTH genders in that sentence. Hahaha.I imagine ESTJs as Dwight from The Office.Are you kidding? That dude is such a Si dom it's ridiculous. Should have just used their types instead of their names, haha. They have their place if they don't get in the way of progress. But...often do more harm than good and people will go to great lengths to be perceived as superior based on their own traditions, or judge those who do not agree with them. There are good ones and bad ones, but typically they take a zealot-like form when used on a global scale that attracts fanatics of the traditional belief.I do not agree at all that she was an ESFJ...she seemed more like an ExFP.Damn.I think she was either an ENFP or ESFP. Not positive on which one, though.ENTP here, ESFPs are incredibly difficult to read for me because they are so in tune with the physical world, that they often have no concept of intuitively connecting the dots. If I say something sarcastic- I'm just being rude. If I make a dark humored joke- I'm just being a sadist. They take everything at face value...it's just annoying. It's like I have to watch everything I'm saying and make sure I'm acting correctly so they don't get the wrong impression.

I think xxFP types in general can be exhausting because they seem so self-centered, especially ExFPs at their worst. Agreed. It is truly ridiculous that I sometimes cannot get my ENFP friends to do the SIMPLEST things because they "don't want to". They can be so self-centered. Absolutely no compromise, and it's always about them when they're unhealthy. They also seem to be incapable of using cause and affect reasoning when it comes to logic. I had an ENFP tell me once that he wouldn't get chemotherapy if he got cancer because he read that apricot pits would cure it. Didn't matter what evidence I brought forward, he would NOT budge. An idiotic ENFP is the worst.

My mom is an ENFP and she nearly destroyed mine and my sisters childhoods because she was so fucking selfish. Everything was (is) an attack on her feelings. Guilt trip after guilt trip about how you're attacking HER. No, I'm just using reasoning skills while you're basing everything off of feelings that you SEE as logical.

That being said, I know heathy ENFPs and unhealthy ENFPs. I would also say that my friendship with ENFPs is very, very prevalent. We can get along very well for short amounts of time. I know at least 10 ENFPs.If only xxTPs actually had concepts of what "themselves" are. I just...do what I do. I'm not trying to be anything, not even myself. I'm just trying to do what makes the most sense logically on an objective level.I'm an ENTP and I wouldn't post this...so...I don't know either?No, it's not. The exact opposite for an INFP is an an ISTP

INFP: Fi Ne Si Te

ISTP: Ti Se Ni Fe

An ESTJ would be half an INFPs opposite because they still have the same functions. An ISTP is switched, and also have completely different functions.My ESTP cousin is like that. So, so incredibly energetic and always the one in the middle speaking. It's weird because usually I'm the one who does that...until an ESTP arrives.I honestly think that people that say these things have never done any actual research on it. They just hear "personality test" and automatically put it in the same category as astrology.I really just don't think that's true.

I think people are just obsessed with "being different" that they find it impossible to believe that there are similar thought processes in people...especially when they don't like that individual.There is no way that Anakin is not a feeling type.Who you are: ENTP
Who you wish you were: ENTP
Who you are most attracted to: INTP

Hmm, interesting. I've never really considered myself "attracted" to INTPs. This is why I'm in improv.Really? I don't see ENFPs holding the "smug" look. I definitely see ENTPs (including myself) doing that a lot. Even look at this website:

http://www.celebritytypes.com/entp.php

Half of them are smirking like they know something no one else does.I've noticed that ENTPs are often smirking...like it's default on our faces to do so.That's interesting, because I find Fe is very easy to use for manipulation if I need to. I'm an ENTP, though.Fucking please.

Coming from a type that has their second function as Fe saying this is a joke. Fe is the function that everyone thinks is "fake"- not being an extrovert.Like MEGA SELFISHThat sounds like a Fi thing to do...?In what way are ESTPs and ENTPs Hufflepuffs? 
That's like the last type either of them would be.Gryffindor:

ESFPHuh. Yea, I think I agree with this one, actually.Ha, really? Maybe ENTx types, but I haven't seen INTx types that care much at all.INTPs and ENTPs get angry easily? Interesting...because I have not seen that. Hmm...well I know there's this popular thing around the ENTP subreddit where everyone is like, "DAE not relate to liking people and being extroverted? I just don't like people or socializing!.."...I'm not that way. I like going out and being with others. And I know if there is ONE thing that makes me feel better above all else it is when that sweet moment happens where I am making a group of people laugh, on the top of my "witty comments" game, in a good environment, and honestly...I really just like being the "funny one". Obviously this doesn't happen 24/7 and can get old after a while to friends...but when I know I'm making others laugh, it just feels amazing! I don't know why. So, yea. Making other people laugh and being on a "clever" roll where everything I say just goes smoothly makes me "high".That's until we are in a position where our Ne isn't being used. When I'm running on pure Ti...all I think about is the future.Hmm...ISTJs maybe?I like being an ENTP, but if I had to choose, I would want to be an ENTJ. I have no desire to be an introverted type.No.I have an ESFJ roommate and aunt who are sort of like this. I think what sucks is, is that you guys MEAN well. Like, truly you are just trying to do what is best in your own eyes...but unfortunately that can come off as smothering and passive aggressive to others. Here is an example of a conversation with my roommate and I:

(He walks into living room)

ESFJ: Hey dude, how's it going?

Me(ENTP): Good.

ESFJ: Hey, do you want some cake some of my friends brought over earlier?

Me(ENTP): Sure!

ESFJ: Okay, cool! Hey, also, do you think you could take out the trash? 

If you don't understand, the reason why these sort of conversations piss me off is because it's like he is only being nice to me and trying to talk to me to get to the point where he can ask me to do something for him. It's like I can't talk with him anymore because I'm always suspicious that he is trying to get me to do something. It's so, so hard to be nice (for me) to someone who does this because passive aggressive behavior is one of my biggest pet peeves. It's as if we aren't friends, but rather he is trying to be my parent and tell me how to live my life. 

I know that they mean well, I just think than an unhealthy ESFJ often tries to use people to their own devices, and can seem very superficial and shallow with absolutely no self awareness that they are doing it. When I point it out to him, he acts genuinely confused. It's bizarre. It's almost an insult to my intelligence like they think I'm stupid enough not to notice.

It just astounds me that someone who can have such a good understand of groups and society as a whole can sometimes be completely oblivious to people as individuals. 

My ESFJ aunt is cool though.Interesting. I am good friends with two ESFPs, and definitely do not see this side of them. It may also be because she (one of the ESFPs) is the only xSxx in a group of two ENFPs and an ENTP (me), though...so she looks like the only sane one. An ESFP who plans things weeks ahead at a time? That sounds odd. Haha.Haha, but are you direct in a way that is like, "Do this or that" or are you direct how my roommate is: "Wow, I don't like that shirt you're wearing at all!"?...because if it's the second one, that still comes off as snarky and rude.ENTx, I think. I'll be honest, I could see myself doing that and I'm an ENTP. It would have to be something extreme, though.That's because we are the best.You like money? Lol, SO INFP, OMG.Really? That's odd. Usually ENTPs are super open to that sort of thing.Sounds like an INFJ.[my room](http://imgur.com/a6K9OXh) 

This is my room at the moment. A few of my blinders broke unfortunately.

ENTP, btw.I would say you'll see a roughly equal amount of INxx types on Reddit. Tumblr seems very INFx oriented. I'm not sure about the others. I think you'll have a mix of everyone for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.That language analogy is a fantastic representation of what MBTI should be seen as.Fe users? I'm an ENTP and I am not like this. I don't know any xxTPs who are like this. If anything, it is more of an xxFJ thing- which I have seen many, many times.

I just hate it when people are blatantly rude to complete strangers. That is usually when my Fe comes into play. I have Fi user friends who won't hesitate to shit on strangers and it absolutely drives me up the wall.ENTP here. 

Not answering the door.

I have never once in my life not answered the door. I don't even understand why you wouldn't answer the door if someone went out of their way to come knock on it. They could be a friend. They could have something interesting to say. They could have driven miles and miles to knock on the door. They could be disappointed and let down if you don't answer the door. It's rude not to answer the door. 

Introverts, I just do not understand it. It really confuses me why you would not answer...the fucking door. It makes sense 0% in my mind.

I just DON'T GET IT. I didn't even realize purposefully not answering the door was a thing until coming here and looking at the introverted subreddits. It just seems so rude.

Also, talking on the phone. I have zero problems with it.Or...you could not assume he is a completely different type from one small paragraph?Are you sure you're not an INTJ? I could see it, you seem super in the moment.Damn, that ENFP roast is spot on.Notice how all of what OP said about ENFPs is from an outer stand point? Since ENFPs are so subjective, it's not a surprise you don't think any of this applies to you. You just don't see any of these parts of you because you probably just aren't good at caring what other people see in you- even if it's true :/.

I've seen the traits(some) stated in almost every ENFP I've known, TBH.Yea, INTJ should probably be in the Suicide Tier.ENTP-

I threw a lot of parties but didn't go to that many. Use your brain. Instrumental epic music is my absolute favorite. I especially enjoy the genre when I am writing.Makes it seem as though all INFJs have dramatic social issues if it is that common of an occurrence.

When I see it being talked about it always just seems like the INFJ is trying to be edgy and different because they're willing to "do what must be done" like some hero in a story. It's ridiculous.ISFP and ISFJ should be switched, as well as INFJ and ENFJ- after that I think it'll be cool!Then your statement is irrelevant.Wed: ISFJ

Bed: ENTJ

Dead: ESTPHaha! The first two paragraphs for the INTJ are true for the INxJ in general. They all think they're mysterious figures who are just on a whole different level than anyone else- it's hilarious.I cannot even imagine what that is like to be honest. I almost always have a inner monologue going at all times. It is as though a line of sentences run across a screen in my mind. Unlike others in this comment section, mine sounds like my own voice.

Just curious, does it make it difficult to read proficiently or quickly? The instant I read a word, it appears in my head. Welcome to an xNTPs brain.I have an inner monologue about 90% of the time. It's typically in my own voice, but it's much calmer. If I am depressed or sad, my mind kind of just goes numb and the monologue is much more faint...because how do you rationalize the irrational?...it's hard to explain. Having one makes figuring out difficult predicaments easier though because I have a strong inner monologue attached to a good minds eye.

The only time it seems to subside is when I'm socializing with others- which I enjoy because it's a break from my brains constant analyzing and swapping of thoughts.Just like your future.

&lt;3&lt;3And with one goal in mind: to fill people up with protein.Well, I think it's different than other types. I've noticed most ENTPs almost have a smirk as their default expression. I haven't really noticed that with any others.

http://www.celebritytypes.com/entp.php

I mean, even look at the famous ENTPs in pop culture at the lower half...so many of them have that smirk that says "I know something you don't".Haha yes! The "are you for real?" look when something is so stupidly absurd that it's amusing... I see this on every ENTP (I'm pretty sure I do it as well).My ISTJ dad has written in his journal for the last 30 years on a weekly basis.Katniss- ISTP as it gets. I think it's interesting when people shit on her character because she is dislikable and has "no emotions"...that's literally the point. She has no idea how to cope or react to what people are trying to get her to do.

Peeta- ENFJ or INFJ?

Gale- ESTJ

Haymitch- ESTP

Effie- ESFJ

Snow- INTJ

Finnick- ESFP

Joanna- ESTP or ENTP

Prim- INFJ(?)

Coin- ENTJ

Plutarch- ESTJNot intuitive introverts. I think sensing introverts are harder to understand.I'm the same way. It has created this machine in my mind which constantly analyzes people even more than I did beforehand. It's weird because before I thought that perhaps I was a little crazy because my thoughts were all over the place...now I'm realizing it's just how my mind is. It's also hard not to point out things people do that just make me go "Wow that is so ENFP" or something. It's kind of annoying, but also kind of cool because it has made me very good at reading people and understanding why they do what they do.I'm honestly not quite sure. I've found myself attracted to ESFPs...INFJs...and even an ISFJ. I think I've been attracted to ESFPs and INTPs most of all. I don't know what it is, but if you manage to find a smart ESFP...it's super weird but also attractive as hell. I think the one type I have never really found attraction toward are any xSTJ types or ENTJs. Don't get me wrong, I love talking to ENTJs, but I would never be in a relationship with one...ever.Hmm...that is a good explanation for her to be an ISTJ. I think one of the things that stood out to me for her being an ISTP was how she never seems to know what she is feeling. She even says in the book that she is only sure she loves one person, and that she doesn't know how she feels about anyone or anything else. I have no doubt in my mind that she is an ISTx though. I cannot see her being an intuitive at all, she is very much an introvert, and she is so obviously driven by logic rather than emotions.I really doubt she is an INTJ. I don't really see how that makes sense with her character.Sometimes I feel as though I have to slow down or pace myself whenever I'm with my ESFP friends. They are very "one thing at a time" individuals and I'm not. It can be draining for both of us if we don't have an understanding of each other's personalities, which is why it often takes quite a while for me to become good friends with sensor types.Same. I think edgy "disliking people" is a Fi thing. It makes me cringe when people say that because it's just so weird and bizarre. It's such an incredibly subjective thing to say that doesn't align well with Ti and Fe. I don't relate to this at all. Before I learned about MBTI, I would not have understood that and thought you were ridiculous. But now that I see you are an ISTP, I completely get it :D.Speaking as an ENTP...I don't even know what meme culture would entail. I think Angelus is an ENTJ while Angel in human soul form is ISFP.-2.75 in my left eye and -3.00 in my right eye.I've never gotten anything other than ENTP on every test I have taken.But that doesn't make any sense. To go from an xNFJ to an ISTP would be completely rewiring your brain- it'd be as though your old self was utterly destroyed. What happened in your life that you think could have resulted in a complete cognitive realignment?But just because you tested as 28% INTP and 20% INTJ doesn't mean you are actually partially those types, and that's because being a mixture of two different types is impossible and makes no sense in relation to the cognitive function theory. 

You can only be one type. You can't think with Ti-Ne-Si-Fi and Ni-Te-Fi-Se at the same time. That's not how the human brain works in accordance to MBTI.Agreed. I think it would take some truly fucked up and traumatic events to screw with the wiring in your brain to that degree. And even then, I am also skeptical if you're actually a different personality.Sorry for your loss, but I don't see how that would change your personality. Adapting and maturing isn't the same as rewiring your neurons.I don't think this is a Fi thing as stated above, but rather a Si thing. I think that xNxPs in particular are good at ignoring current situations and then a few days later will look back on them with sudden realization, sort of like "Holy shit, that actually happened". I know this has happened to me quite a bit. I had this reaction about a month after my brother died, or a couple years after I graduated and realized I could have done so much better, etc.I've always thought he was an ISFP.I like purple.A lot of people type Tyson as an xNTJ, but I can't help but think that he is an ESTJ or ISTJ. There just seems to be a clear Si at work in his mind.I read the introduction and then skip around on the subheadings.I don't drink coffee because it makes me too jittery. I enjoy a cup of tea in the morning, though!I don't know if any type sucks at one thing in particular...oh wait, no, that's incorrect- all ENFPs are terrible drivers. Fact.What is love anyway?I've never been in love but I don't believe that for a second, haha.That number memorization gave me anxiety, haha. I sucked at it.

122...I get between 120-125 on every IQ test I take.

How accurate is this IQ test to an actual one?How did you do on the first memory portion?An INFJ door slam is something that people seem to think is exclusive to INFJs and how they deal with getting someone out of their life. It's bullshit, lol. Everyone does the door slam, but people like to think it's an INFJ thing so INFJs look tougher and like less of a pushover than the majority of them actually are.... 

.... :)No, you cannot change types (some people say you can if you have traumatic brain injury, but even then I doubt it). My guess is that you just grew into your real type a little bit more and became more aware of who you really are.Because your personality is a state of mind...like your intelligence. You can be opened up to great and new experiences and knowledge, but you cannot completely unravel your anatomy and become something else. You can dye your hair, but you will still always be a brunette. You can get enchroma glasses if your colorblind, but you are still colorblind. Your perception of the world typically remains the same. It's in your chemical make up. 

You can't tell me that you honestly think an INFJ could somehow say...become an ENTP? Brains just don't work that way. To change from an INFJ to an ENTP would completely change who YOU are.

Often people who think personalities can change are people who just aren't happy with their own.Huh, I don't think I've ever seen personalities change. It must be interesting be in such a situation where you see ENTJs turn to ISFJs and such...maybe you're in a psych ward? /s ESFJ?I don't think an ESFP could read me accurately to save their life. They take everything I say so literally...which doesn't go well with my naturally sarcastic sounding voice (and I don't even mean to sound that way) that ends up offending them.

I have an ESFP friend who just does not understand how my self-deprecating humor works. He thinks I'm an incredibly negative and pessimistic person when in reality I'm not at all.

INFJs and INTPs understand where I'm coming from the majority of the time.I only know your type because I've seen you in our subreddit for the past year or so, haha.You are 100% INTJ, that's for sure.

Jk. Just trying to trip you up. I see ISFJ.A Fe dom would say that.When will people understand this? Types don't change. Just because you took different tests and got different results does not mean your brain did a 180 and somehow rearranged its thought process.Yea, just do that ISFP. It's that easy. I do not think it is possible to change functions or type unless exposed to very traumatic brain injury.It's not about what we know, it's about what's most likely! :DWhat if I discuss all three of those thingsHow can someone not be in awe of the universe? It's insane.Rhythm and melody. I really do not care about the meaning of the lyrics.Yea it's true, we really are the best.


Jk. Also, we only seem confident and emotionally put together. I don't know any xxTPs who would qualify as "emotionally put together" to be honest. I don't even really understand what being emotionally put together would entail. It is more that we can just ignore our emotions and not base decisions on them because to most of us they're illogical and don't make sense. 

And confident? Haha. Right. Ne-Ti doesn't allow me to have such luxuries as to be fully confident in myself. I'm sure as hell good at faking confidence, though.

But, yes, I am actually very good with people. They're just so easy to read (except Fi. What the fuck is even happening there?) and predict.I don't know if I particularly envy any type. I could easily say that I envy ENTJs, but then I remember how incredibly arrogant, domineering, and lacking in social awareness a lot of them are...I could say I want to be an ESFJ, but then I remember how a lot of them have no concept of personal boundaries and often seem manipulative...I could say I want to be an INTJ, INTP, or INFJ...but then I remember how being an introvert sounds awful. I could say I want to change from an ENTP...but why change utter perfection(kidding)?

So do I envy a type? Not really. I kind of just go with what I have. Every single type can have faults and every type can have great advantages to some degree.That's okay with me :D. At least I'm aware of my flaws, *cough* unlike INTJs who *cough* blame *cough* the world for all of *cough* their *cough* problems.Exactly!I'm glad I'm an ENTP so I can read this comment and be amused and laugh at it rather than get offended since it's such a fucking dumb statement.I wouldn't want to be an introvert at all. It just seems like they always have depression and anxiety issues. I'm not trying to be mean, I genuinely think that 80% of the introverts I know have these problems.

Haha, and it's not work if you enjoy people.I'm not basing them on how much they socialize. These are people I'm very familiar with and I'm sure are introverts. "I'm not fond of Trump, I won't lie"

...haha, as if you're somehow going against the grain because he is so popular or something.It's not just personal experience if there are statistics on introverts having more problems with what I said as well. Corrected!Again...I know these people well.ENFJ?INFPHonestly. It's so annoying when you're POSITIVE of someone's type, and then they end up getting something so blatantly wrong on the test and you try to explain why it isn't correct but then they don't listen.

Like...YES! I DO know more than the test, DAMN IT! I've been following and studying MBTI FOR TWO YEARS.ENFPSince your name is Chad I'm assuming you're an ESTP?That's so bizarre to me. I just don't understand how someone can't be interested in history when it literally defines who we were, are, and will be in every aspect of human existence, ha.I think history is very, very cool. I mean...how lucky are we that we have gotten to the point where a person can go to Wikipedia and read the general information of an empire in an hour that existed for thousands of years? How cool is it that for the first time EVER, we have all of this information at our fingertips? I just do not understand how someone cannot be interested in history- it's just too important and complex to find "boring" (personally).

Learning about history is imperative to realizing what mistakes can't be made again and what didn't work before and we can improve upon them. Ha, this must be why I see Se users making the exact same mistakes over and over, ;P. Will you be my sugar daddy?Will you be my sugary daddy?Saying "I'm not interested in humans" is just something people who have social anxiety say to make an excuse for why they're not around others more. :DI'm an ENTP and I'm obnoxiously curious.How is that for your sister and you?But how can you "push forward" if you don't learn from the past? That makes no sense.Sounds like someone's Fi went crazy.

I have an ISFP friend who is exactly like this. I think it's the unhealthy Fi and Ni combination that gives this mentality that practically says, "Nope. I don't wanna hear the other sides to the story! This one thing happened and it hurt my feelings and that's all there is to it!"...I know how you feel to an extent. Fi users (especially xSFPs) can hold grudges to an obnoxious degree without any real reason or need to resolve. I think the best thing to do is give her some time and then message her a month or two from now.

I also think what's funny about this is that she took it offensively enough to go so far as to block you- which must mean that a lot of the flaws you said must've had truth to them, haha...especially if she was able to deduct that it was about herself.What problem were the two of them having originally? He was trying to type her, not rant about her online and spout out her flaws. 

But I agree, I don't understand why OP would post it on a subreddit that they both frequent.Neither would I. But we both have Fe. Fi users are a lot more prone to this dogmatic view on their perspective of "betrayal".I agree. I can't imagine that someone who you have been good friends with for eight years would shut you down completely over something like this unless there has been issues on the past.Will you be my sugar daddy?I think you're forgetting this is probably an unhealthy Fi dom. The flaws may be true, but the person will probably still take them offensively.But that wasn't the intention...he was just stating unbiased points about the person. *sigh*

Harness that Fe, my fellow ENTP.ENFP? INFJINTPI hate the thought that I will never get to see what happens to humanity in the future. Am I aware that death is the complete end? Yes. It seems obvious and the most likely end-game for...everything. But, I don't understand when people say, "Well, you no longer exist! It's so great! Haha! Think about how nice no more pain will be?!" No. Fuck that. I don't want to not exist. The fact that I won't be aware of my nonexistence doesn't mean I am comforted by my imminent death. It is still terrifying...but I'm not going to reach out the religion when I really, really doubt it's true since religion seems 100x crazier than oblivion.

Death is a fact, oblivion is a fact. I don't think there is a point to life- but I'm still going to live it the best I can...


...like surfing Reddit for hours upon hours...

...fuck, I need to go ride my bike.God, that is such an ENTJ thing to say. Not everything is black and white when it comes to friendships. There is more to this than "drop and forget". That website has very different results for distribution than I have ever seen in regards to MBTI.  ENTJs at 4%, ENTPs at 4.5%, INFPs at 2%, and INTPs at 2.5%? I've always seen ENTJ and ENTP as a lot less, and INTP as significantly more. Hmm...I guess. For some reason I just find it hard to believe that INTPs are so significantly rarer than ENTPs. I've always thought ENTPs were the rarer one.Then again, extroverted behavior could just seem more common because introverts have adapted to an extroverted society. More like SENSORITIVE. Hahaha, get it? Hahaha...

...I'll leave."I don't know if that's true."

"You know what I mean?"

"Why?"

"Look at it this way:"

"In the grand scheme of things,"

"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

"Wow!"

"I just feel like..."

"That doesn't make any sense."

"Apparently..."

"That's crazy!"

"Of course."

"This is amazing!"I'm not sure about the awkward part...I know a LOT of awkward ENFPs. I honestly think they're equal on the awkward scale- just in different ways.Are you kidding? When an ENFP tries to get rid of their Ne (which I've noticed they often do because they always seem to be embarrassed by it) and run on Fi-Te...they can go from 0-100 if someone offends them. My mom, step-sister, and cousin are just like this. They have extremely bad tempers. Sometimes it's like walking on eggshells.Oh my FUCK that last part. There is nothing that I am sick of more than high Fi users who come to me asking for help and then completely disregard everything I say even though they agree with it. I don't use this word often, but it makes me feel disrespected and as if my opinion is of no value to our friendship. I've had quite a few friendships harmed by this.Ah, how could I forget that one?Could you would you be my sugar daddy in a box? Would you could you be my sugar daddy with a fox?In between. I am by no means a complete mess, but I can definitely let a few dishes sit in the sink for a day or two, ha. My ENFJ roommate is obnoxiously clean and it drives me insane because he just "expects" everyone else to be.

The one thing that drives me absolutely crazy is when people wear shoes on the carpet of my apartment. It just disgusts me. You sound like a complete ENTP. The majority of this sounds just like me (aside from the gifted part and being a natural at mathematics). You are definitely not ENFP or INFP, haha.

I relate to the "thinking about the past and how great  it was" part so much. I used to do that all the time until I graduated High School.

Come over to /r/ENTP! I don't understand how you think any of what he said gears toward being Fi-Te? It seems pretty clear to me that he is most likely an ENTP.Well, when you say things that way then how in the world does anyone ever get typed then? You cannot tell me that someone would go on about how they value logic above all else and aren't comfortable with emotions and then somehow think "high Fi user". Sure, they COULD be a Fi user, but what is most likely is that they are not. I just cannot imagine that an ENFP would make half their "type me" bullet points about how they are not comfortable with emotions and prize logic above emotions. That doesn't make sense to think "xNFP" after seeing that. 

With your way of thinking, this person could also be an ENFJ since procrastinating is such a "broad" statement. And in that case, why wouldn't they be an INFJ? I mean, INFJs can be lazy...and this person could apparently be a feeler to you...so.That's my mom, middle sister, and dad. My oldest sister is an ENTJ. Suffice to say, my Ti-Fe was stunted to an extent growing up, ha.I only lie when I know the alternative will grant me an obnoxious pep talk from an xxxJ.Ravenclaw. ENTPIs self-hatred a personality type?...

...I kid, I kid. That was harsh.Yes, but it was an ENFP who made the poll. Can't say I'm surprised. *Holds up spork*.Yes, but I can't help but think that if a person who is a thinker constantly feels a blur of emotions daily, then they are unhealthy. It just doesn't seem natural that something like that would occur all the time.But what if food is my external stimulation?

....god, I'm such a fat fuck.ExFJs. I feel like I am missing a piece to a puzzle every time I observe them. It's like I understand their reasonings in theory, but I just don't understand how they think that what they are thinking is the best course to act upon in reality.

Example:

ENFJ roommate: "I just don't want negativity in my life! Everything is great if you just make it great! Everything will be good if you just believe it'll be good!"

ENTP me: "Well, yea. That's true. But sometimes things happen that you can't control."

ENFJ roommate: "Omg you're so pessimistic! Everything will turn out fine! I don't understand why you're such a downer!"

I get WHAT they are thinking and why they would think something in a super, super broad sort of way, I just don't understand how it works in a realistic context. They're so incredibly positive about things that everything that could possibly be perceived as negative is all on one giant scale that all equal the same thing. 

Cigarettes = murder, death, sin!

Swearing = evil, terrible, bad!

Then again, I live in Utah so I pretty much only know Mormon ExFJs....which are the worst type of Mormons aside from ESTJs.

I guess it just seems to me that ExFJs have this very black and white thinking about good and evil. It's either the greatest day of their lives because someone loaned them a pencil, or it's the worst day ever because a crush didn't text them back.How can we know what we want when there are so many options? It's just impossible.At first :DI don't get why you even posted this.Domineering conservative sexists. All I know is every ENFP I've ever known sucks at driving.What an enigma.IxFJs: "I understand what you're saying, and it's true, but I'm going to do something completely different because I have a different idea of what should be true even if it isn't actually true and I know objectively that it isn't...but what matters is that I think it SHOULD be true."

-Every INFJ I have ever known."I feel others needs and feelings...and I also know why what they're feeling is wrong in my own subjective eyes, so I'm going to change them even though they really don't want me to and wish I would just mind my own business...oh well! I'm doing it for humanity!"I just don't understand how someone can have a personal perspective based upon the perspective itself. That doesn't compute with me in the slightest. It's like for Fi everything is just a giant circle that equals what it equals because it equals itself...there just doesn't seem to be a logical basis, so I don't get how it can be relevant or true.Same. I honestly do not think I have ever based something completely on the foundation that I just feel like it must be true(at least not since I was a kid). That seems so, so bizarre to me.Huh? So I can't make observations about types and still like them? What is with the word "hate"? Calm down, Jesus. Stop acting crazy and accusing me of shit. Please cite a source where I EVER said I hate INFPs. Waiting.Nah, meet me at the Orem Mall at 4:00am!I definitely did not think you were serious, haha.I'm always worried I'm about to get bored of something I'm interested in and think I can succeed well in. I don't think people realize that ENTPs can't help losing interest in things half the time. We usually don't do it because we are flighty on purpose, it literally just happens.Thanks...?~Does anyone else ever feel like they just can't slow their brain down?~

Welcome to an ENxP brain.I think improv can help a person become a better speaker and quicker on their feet. I don't know if it could necessarily change your brain. I'm pretty sure I have pure O. I think I've had it badly since I was 17.Fml.ENTP: Joker from The Dark Knight

...or is that an ENTP at their best? I honestly can't decide.It wasn't really revenge...but it was karma. My step-sister ratted me out for smoking weed when I was 16 in Holland (not because she was worried for my well-being, she did it purely to spite me) and then the next day she found out she was pregnant...at 17. It was nice.INFP to the max.

Maybe INFJ...but I doubt it.For some reason I just can't imagine an ISFP being obsessed enough with Lord of the Rings and anime to put them on their Instagram and glorify them...Okay, but does he like these things for the aesthetic and design purpose or story?Lol, then I think you need to brush up on your personality types. :PI only know of one person who has that. She is an ISFJ. It was pretty mind blowing when she explained it to me at first because I had read up on it before and she thought it was completely normal until I explained it was synesthesia.You're implying that people who overthink "want" to overthink...trust me that is not true, lol.ENTP- extremely perfectionistic. It's extremely difficult being a perfectionist when you also realize that there is no such thing as being perfect.... :l Ah, I see. I know for me, being a Ne-Ti dom, thinking in a way that I detach myself and analyze things is somewhat of a default setting. I can't really help it. So I don't even know if "want" is the correct word. It literally just happens automatically. You sound like an ESFP to me.I'm an ENTP and I agree with pretty much everything you said. 

I think religion has run its course. I would say the negatives now far outweigh the positives at this point.XDWell if the ENTJ says so, :P.I swear this subreddit is like a rollercoaster. I stated about a month ago that I don't think personality type can change, and then I got downvoted to hell. Now today it's the other way around.Because to change your type would be to change your default perception of yourself, your logic, your worldview...it just doesn't make sense for all of that to fall apart and put itself back together in a difference fashion without some sort of neurological damage.It was a joke. And just because you can see yourself turning into an INTJ does not mean you can or will.I'd say ISTPPeople change in the sense that they become more well rounded...they don't change that their brains completely scramble themselves without damage. That makes no sense.Something interesting I have noticed when typing people is that after they take the test and we look at the "positives" and "negatives" of each type, they don't really seem to have an actual reaction until the "negative traits" of their type are read. I think it's because we as humans tend to concentrate on our flaws and what can be improved rather than what we do well.This one, I suppose? Honestly, I typically only go to the ENTP subreddit. The other ones are either too depressing or boring to me.Can we just stop this? I'm pretty sure you all just want to think the internet is full of ISxx so you can feel more unique about your own INxx typing. Face it, there are literally millions upon millions of you INFPs on the internet and this website, and it is far more likely that the majority of internet users are INxx rather than ISxx...especially on discussion based platforms like Reddit!

Sorry, I just see this claim all the time and my eyes roll into the back of my head because there is literally no logic or reasoning behind it.Poetic.

And ESTJ? Ha, thanks. I wish. If only I had Te in my stack.Where in the world did I say that NO sensors use the internet? Stop twisting what I said so you can sound more correct. Too lazy to type and refute.

Martha Stewart is an ESTJ by the way, not an ISFJ. :)Haha, YES! I care way more about proving a point than gaining something myself.I sort of just imagine him in a little room with bottles of pee and food wrappers everywhere obsessively putting down usernames on his ENTP hit list, haha.Nope. I'm the only ENTP in my immediate and extended family...at least that I can think of. The majority are ExFP types and xSFJ types, though.

...well, actually. No. I think my 12 year old cousin is probably an ENTP, but it's too early to know for sure.If only I could utilize that to it's full potential!!I don't think this is true. I don't think that many thinkers would strive to be feelers...it wouldn't make "sense". I'm sure there are exceptions though.Agreed. As an ENTP, I don't think I have ever wanted to be a feeler. Nothing against them, I just like being a thinker better.You should. She's actually a really interesting person. Complete business maniac.People just think introverted intuitive types are the most intelligent because they think about everything they say- which does not equate to smarts. You can think as much as you want and still be a moron if you come to the blatantly incorrect conclusion of something.Prepare for downvotes. Everyone on this subreddit seems to think that ENTPs can turn into ESFPs or ISTJs can turn into ENFJs. 

I agree with you though! I just don't think it makes logical sense that cognitive functions can somehow change without neurological damage.Well, we are still typically better with people than other thinkers (aside from ESTPs). :PI just don't understand this way of thinking. I'm not judging you, I just don't get what "I don't like people" really means because it's so incredibly broad. Like, do you just write people off as a whole?Interesting. I feel like I'm the exact opposite.Just wait it out. Pretty soon you'll have enough stuff to talk about from things you've experienced in the past together. That's how it was for my ISFJ friend at least...haha.ENTP- sarcasm. The majority of the time I honest to God do not mean to sound as sarcastic and insincere as people think I am being. It's unintentional about 80% of the time. 

Also, intensity. I often get so engaged in conversations that people say I'm being super "intense"...I'm really just trying to understand and know what you're saying, not judging.

These things aren't usually that big of an issue with my xNxP friends, but for as long as I can remember it has ALWAYS been a problem with potential or current xSxP friends, especially ESxPs. I do not think an ESFP could read me accurately to save their life...yet I still enjoy being around them. It's weird.I don't think my Ne ever really gets exhausted. What is exhausting is when I have to suppress it(which is often l). I would say my Ti does once in a while, but not that often. Usually when I just want to "live in the moment" and do something crazy does my Ti kind of stay on the sidelines. Fe and Si...definitely. Running on pure Fe or pure Si is not healthy for me and I end up expressing them in ways that make me a tad bit insane.Can something be extinct if it never really even existed? Bitch, you're the king.Not an ESTP + ISTP combo.

please.Which can also be a bad thing considering basing everything off of traditions often leaves people with outdated beliefs.I got ENTP from that test...interestingly enough, I am ENTP. Woah.AND THEN AFTERWARD WE'RE GONNA HEAD ON DOWN TO THE TRUMP RALLY!ENTPs and ENFPs alike.I would say no...but if we are defining the actual cause of the depression, then I'm sure N might have different reasons than a S might. I just can't really see an ESTP having depression over existentialism like an INFJ or INTP might.ENTP...super ADHD. I'm not sure if ADHD as we define it actually exists though. I'm very good at typing. If someone is a Ne dom I can usually get it within the first couple of minutes of meeting them.I'm competitive if I'm trying to prove a point.With homemade muffins!!!I know they aren't. I'm just saying.😂😂😂😂😂!!!!!👌😂😂👌👌💋💋ENTP:

Liz Lemon from 30 Rock.

The Joker (I don't agree with his extremist beliefs and how insane he is, I can just see where he is coming from) from The Dark Knight.

Michael Scott from The Office on a bad day. Hahaha.
It's funny that you relate to both Tyrion and Ned yet they're completely different types of people.FINNISH YOUR BREAKFAST. LOL.



Kill me.I relate to this to an extent. But I strongly dislike when people are pedantic when telling stories and try to get every. single. little. detail into it. I just want to say "Get the point!". I typically only want completely accurate information when something is claimed as factual. I don't understand how someone couldn't be caught up on the details of facts. If you can't give me evidence or good reasoning...then I'm most likely going to think it's bullshit.👌🏻👈🏻👌🏻👈🏻👌🏻👈🏻👌🏻😂😂Mother: ENFP

Dad: ISTJ

Oldest sister: ENTJ

Middle sister: INFP

Me(youngest): ENTP


A type who dislikes their job, I guess?Uh, no. For me it's more like, "I like you! You must not be the same type as me!" I've only met one other ENTP who didn't make me want to rip my hair out. I mean, I've only met four, though.Eh. The thing is high Fe users can be pretty biased with what they perceive as "fair" because it all depends on how close they are to a certain individual and what they "feel" should be fair.

Personally, I could see Ti-Fe users being better at seeing what is truly objectively fair. Not just fair because it idealistically should be.ISFPs, ESFPs, INTPs. 

I feel like they would be the most expendable. I don't agree that we should even be having a discussion on which types are expendable, but since we are...there you go.You seem like an ISFP to me.I would say either ESTP or ENTP.I don't think it's a sensor vs intuitive thing. My ISTJ dad talks to himself ALL the time. I'm an ENTP and I don't do it often.

The only reason I don't is because my inner monologue is strong enough that it would be the same as saying it out loud.I'm getting an INTJ or ENTJ vibe from the blonde dude. I think the Asian is an ENFP. The cameraman didn't do much...but I think he is an Ixxx.

This was cool btw. I'm probably going to binge these videos now...Reddit is not an unbiased website :). I would say that's more of an N vs S thing. No, but I do know that a lot of ENTPs and INTPs mix up their types quite often. I never had that issue, though.I'm an ENTP and I got 45 as well.The ideal answers were obvious. I thought it was asking what you yourself would personally do.This isn't even close to an IQ test. This EQ test is subjective to how you feel about certain situations.Interesting! I didn't know you were transgender.Is your friend Donald Trump?Oh trust me, it does.Then I guess you shouldn't be posting a thread asking for opinions and advice? :D*sigh*

Okay, the reason I asked if your friend is Donald Trump is because the mannerism and way your friend texts reminded me of the way Donald Trump speaks. 

The reason I said you shouldn't be asking for opinions and advice is because you claim you don't trust people. Everyone on Reddit is a person. If you are asking individuals on Reddit a question, it must mean that at least one individual could come forth with a comment that you would trust (or else why would you post in the first place?), thus making your claim that you don't trust people untrue.lol u talk funny Mr XD XDBy not approaching it at all.I'm aware. What's your point?Okay, Dennis Reynolds.Restaurant Caesar salad is my go-to when I'm out to eat. The dressing at restaurants is just so much better than the store bought type.I'm a 3w2 ENTP. Most ENTPs are 7w8 or 8w7.Whoops. Meant to say 3w2.I have done this. Most of the time it is because I am put into an awkward situation where my only option is to "fake" empathy so that the other person does not become even worse with what they are feeling. I have also done it a few times to get something I need from someone(especially information)...but I typically don't try to be that manipulative.Eh. I don't really care unless it is something genuinely personal.See, and to me I just cannot comprehend how someone can't comprehend Ti-Fe when it is just objective logic and reasoning. I don't understand Fi-Te at all because it often seems selfish and unreasonable. This is just me, though. 

What do you not understand about Ti-Fe? Give me some examples and maybe I can help you understand.Your opposite isn't an ISTJ...it's an ESTP. Just so you know. :PBut your personality is ISFP, silly.Probably not. I feel like life would just be so easy as an ESFJ type.Atheist ENTPThere are a lot of reasons why religion and gods are a thing. I can tell you if you'd like...?Honestly, I think that growing up in a household with Fi users made me grow into an individual who questions himself way too much. I constantly had to be on guard to make sure I wasn't offending someone or "attacking" someone to the point that being around my ENFP mother and ESTJ sister made me have anxiety because it seemed like I was always, ALWAYS saying the wrong thing. I think that it has followed me into adulthood and that if I had not been around so much Fi(unhealthy Fi) I would not second guess myself as much as I do. I would say Jack is an ESTP and Wendy is an INFJ or ISFJ (She doesn't seem like an extrovert in the slightest to me). I wouldn't bother typing Danny...he's like 8.I've known many secondary Fe users who are like that as well.Yea, I have an INFJ friend who does that.Aang - ENFP
Katara - ENFJ or ESFJ
Sokka - ENTP
Toph - ESTP
Zuko - ISFP
Azula - ENTJ
Mai - ISTP or INTP
Ty Lee - ESFP
Iroh - INFJ
Ozai - INTJ
That's what I've got.Why not shut the fuck up for our boy Yaldabaoth?


Jk. I could maybe see him as an ESFP. That's why most people think anyone is a certain type.Same. I honestly find it hard to believe that INFJs are the rarest type. I just...know so, so many. I know twins and both of them are ENFPsI think so as well. I haven't met many ENTPs, INTJs, or ENTJs. Yea, I would say the same. I know a pretty equal amount of ENFPs compared to INFPs.ENTP - RavenclawIn what way? I only really cry out of anger or frustration. For some reason I cannot stand Will Smith. I think it has something to do with his acting and parenting style.Do you understand metaphors and analogies very well? For some reason my ESFP friend (who is otherwise pretty intelligent) does not get metaphors. For me it's a way of explaining something complex so that it is understood in a simple manner. But every time I try to explain something that way to my ESFP friend, I usually get a response somewhere along the lines of, "That doesn't make any sense" or "Those two things aren't even related"...

So, what about you?Huh. Interesting!ENTP here. I'm the same way.Omfg....

You're making it embarrassing by thinking this way. This type of post would make an INFJ look petty and bad, lol. So...it's all self caused. Honestly, it's sort of pathetic.I'm going to be honest, it's really bizarre that you guys get embarrassed about something like this. It's honestly kind of...pathetic. It shows you lack a lot of confidence and that you care way, way too much about what people think.I have deja vu like twice a week.Interesting. I don't find socializing exhausting at all unless it's in a professional setting.Everyone gets worn out by keeping up a facade, even ExFJs.LOL. I am far from perfect. Stop getting so defensive.I have deja vu like twice a day lolThat's probably because they just gone done working out at the gym while you're still sitting behind a keyboard pissing in bottles and eating tubs of ice cream while crying...

... :DYep. Fml.Pwning noobsMore than I can count.ENFJs and ESFJs are one of the most difficult types for me to tell the difference from in real life....you don't say?Did you even read the entire thing? They're coming to ME for my opinions. I don't get why they're doing this if the end result is just for their own opinions to be true even if I've proved otherwise.

I'm trying to understand this mindset.ISTPs can be real assholes.That sounds so nice.Interesting...I'm an ENTP and I don't think that way at all- especially with the world affairs. From my point of view, world affairs affect everyone to some degree, whether or not you can see it at face value.

I've noticed that xSTPs seem to have this notion that there is less going on in the world than there really is, and that since it's not directly affecting them in that moment, then it doesn't exist. I don't know...I just think that way of thinking is incredibly harmful to pretty much everyone.Hmm...I guess I just don't understand that.Poetic.It's almost insulting how bad ESFPs are at reading me. They often assume things that are just so off base that I start second guessing myself because I'm like, "Wait, is that really what they see?".

The type I'm worst at reading is probably ISTPs. Very difficult for me to predict and get what they're doing half the time. That is the best feeling ever. I don't think I've ever met a funny ISTJ, to be honest.Ugh, I feel like I'm reading a Facebook comment.Watching people like you from afar and laughing.Yes, much like a monkey flinging feces in its cage at a zoo.Male ENTP 5'9. I think clay is either an INTP or INTJ, personally.I'm an ENTP and I've never had telephone paranoia. Not once has it ever made me "nervous" to be on the phone with someone.Fuck.I feel like I used to care a lot more about my fashion choices and all around physical appearance when I was in High School. Since then, I have don't care as much, but I still like to look relatively nice.

But to answer your question, I could see INxx types not really caring so much.

Most likely? Every ExFJ I have ever known is an absolute freak about their appearance. My ENFJ roommate literally knocked on the door while I was showering yesterday and said, "Dude, it's an emergency. Can you please hurry?" I get out, kind of annoyed that I had to end my shower early because he was so desperate, and then I ask why he is in such a rush, and then he says, "I need to clip my nails."

What the fuck.An absolute emergency.Anakin is an ESFP. There is no way he is anything but a feeler.😱😱My ENTJ sister is incredibly sensitive.If he is a thinker, then I'm an ISFJ.Lol. LOL. LOLLLL. Please, elaborate.ESTP I don't do anything that I could see being physically dangerous. It freaks me the hell out when people are completely okay with risking their lives for things that aren't worth it. I like my body in tact and working, thanks.Hmm...you've swayed me."The world makes more sense in the things where I can see and witness and know *for sure*. When I first learned about MBTI/cognitive functions I realise so many things around me clicked instantly. How I can see beyond myself that they're just different, that they didn't just do this because they're stupid or heartless."

That is the most Fi-Te thing I have ever read.He seems like a clear INFP to me, haha.And yet I'm pretty none of the characters in that INTJ meme are actually INTJs.And Gandalf is totally not an INTJ.I don't understand how you can type as all 16 types. I love being intuitive, but I also wish I could just shut my brain off and stop overthinking basic stuff.I don't know if anyone else has this issue, but Ne-Ti seems to cause me to make a lot of assumptions when learning new stuff.A delusional person?ENFJInteresting. I'm an ENTP, too, and I've always found hostile anger to be too much work. See, that's interesting to me because I don't think I would care if someone said that to me (ENTP), but for you it would be extremely offensive. Just goes to show how different types prioritize very different ways of being perceived by others.Wtf? Who said that first one? Jesus.My ISTJ dad has said, "I don't know where all of this came from. No one else in the family acts like this except you. Ever since you were a child, you've asked too many questions and have never taken anything seriously."Eh, I honestly didn't care when he said it since it was when I was older (17 I think?). I stopped caring after I got into my preteens.

It only hurts me when its from people I didn't expect.My Type: ENTP

Past crushes: ENFP, INTP, ISFJ, ISTJ. 

Best friends: ENFJ, ENFP, ISFP, and ISFJ

The one I crushed the hardest on was definitely the ENFP.YES! I don't know why everyone types Tywin as an ENTJ. He is so clearly a Si user. Dude is totally an xSTJ.My mind literally turns to mush when I'm forced to do something I dislike. It's like my brain shuts off. It's quite frustrating...Is this a bunch of mugshots? Most of these people look absolutely fucked.Probably ESFJs. Most of the ones I know have issues with at least a few people. My aunt is an ESFJ and the majority of my Fi user family members always have some sort of conflict with her. It's kind of sad to be honest because she is coming from a completely different mindset and has absolutely no clue what she is doing wrong.Yea. Well, anyway, I got 70/75."I am, of course," lol that Fi shining through.How could that possibly be obvious.Eh. I'd say both feeling functions are obnoxious in their own special fit throwing illogical way.I get stressed out when I become too physical because my mind starts to race against my body.Damnnnnn.
I just did real life people:

ESTP- Donald Trump

ENFP- Hans Zimmer

ENTJ- Gordon Ramsay

ENFJ- Jennifer Lawrence

INFJ- JK Rowling

INTJ- James Cameron



A "mix"? You can't be a mix of two types.I find xSxP types the most difficult. Probably ISTJs. I would think it's funny that someone is overreacting and getting so annoyed that I'm beating them.I honestly do not give a shit about memes...in fact, I don't think many ENTPs do. We just go along with the stereotype because it's so stupid that it's mildly humorous.I actually think JK Rowling is an ISFJ.I think he's an ESFP.Tina FeyINFP.He seems like an ESFJ or ESFP to me.ENTP.

I mean, just watch this: https://youtu.be/qU7N-g_3TDo

It's pretty clear that she isn't an ESFJ...and I don't think Tina Fey is an ISTJ either.Can you explain? I find it super difficult to imagine an ISTJ being a good improviser.

EDIT: ...so when I ask for an explanation I just get downvoted? Okay then.That's what I thought as well. Everyone is always saying how she has such a "warm smile", but it seems to me that it's more of an engaged amusement rather than Fe warmness.INFJs are adaptable?Aren't you the one who has a deep dislike toward all thinking types?Sorry, Fi....wutThis interaction with you is a prime example of why I would dislike Fi if I did.Just did it and got ISFJ.So true. I had an INTP friend in High School who was seriously one of the most delusional people I've ever met. Always assuming, accusing, and steadfast in his "logical" analysis that never saw every angle. It was strange because the majority of the other INTPs I know are quite intelligent...but he was something else.Oh my gosh this was so weird I was just wondering why you are the only reason why you do it that way you do not know how it is actually doing anything to do that it because I don't have to see the way you're talking.Lol what? I don't relate to any of the things he listed for his ESTP arguments and I haven't seen a lot of ENTPs that do. I don't know how you think that's ENTP.I used to think I was good at it as well until I realize I just come off as a mocking sarcastic asshole. I think ExFJs would probably be best.I think she is an INFJ. Sorry to all users of this function, but no Fi user could pull off the social manipulation she pulls literally her entire life, ha. She is definitely an INxJ, and my money is on INFJ. Every motivation she has is based upon her perceptions of what someone should be, what society truly is, what makes others tick, and her own analysis of all of it into her own condensed philosophy of what is "the right way". Amy is a master manipulator of others...like, she is so good at it that you wouldn't even realize she is manipulating. She screams Ni-Fe-Ti (very unhealthy, obviously). It's one of my favorite films. ENTP- I like adderall.Charlie - ENFP

Dennis - ENTJ

Dee - ESFP

Mac - ESFJ

Frank - ESTPThat's a silly argument.GRR Martin seems like a clear INFP.INFJs and ENTPs (when engaged) always seem to have a very intense stare that just seem to bore in to your soul and analyze the shit out of it.How is staring intently while engaged in conversation not a form of facial reaction?

And you know what? I'm just gonna say it: I LIKE KORRA MORE THAN AANG. Way more character development and I just find her character more human and interesting in general. I think of it like this: The Last Airbender has better characters overall, but Legend of Korra has a better protagonist. Nonetheless, I like both of the shows equally. I'm pretty confident in my typings of most characters aside from maybe Sokka, Mai, and Asami.Jon - ISTJ

Olenna - ExTJ (can't decide)

Davos - ISFJ...? No clue tbh

The "as fuck" characters are the ones I'm like 100% sure about, haha.I'm not a bad driver at all. I honestly do not understand how some people are THAT bad at driving. It takes an intense lack of awareness that I don't think is very correlated with types as it is the individual themselves.

But I will say this: I have never known a good ENFP driver. Seriously.Jaimie is not an ESTP. He is such a Fi user it's ridiculous. ESFP. "We don't choose the ones we love"? Yea, I was just debating in my mind what she is. She clearly has Ne and Si, I just couldn't decide in what order. I could definitely see ISFJ.What would you say she is? Genuinely curious.I'd say ISFJI've never gotten anything aside from ENTP and I'm pretty positive it's my type.Wow. I don't agree with like 80% of these typings, haha.Everyone's evil aside from you though, right? 

Also, why did include your hatred for ENTPs?LOL. Ignore you? Maybe you just haven't said anything that is interesting or worth my time aside from the occasional complaints about how terrible ENTPs are to you. I just think it's mildly amusing how you constantly shit on ENTPs and then do passive aggressive insults even when people try to explain things to you.

This is you:

ENTP: (Lengthy explanation about why ENTPs are the way they are)

You: "I just don't like bullies, that's all :)."

You play on these petty little jabs to try and show your "opinion". You don't even try to understand ENTPs because you're so set in your ways and would rather just complain than compromise and come to a real mutual understanding. I don't get why you make posts asking why "Thinkers are so bad" just so you can get in a situation where you have the opportunity to say why you think they're shit. You don't actually care about the answers, you're literally just making the post to complain, lol. You're not trying to help understand and promote personal growth, you're just trying to show ENTPs they're awful just so they KNOW they're awful. Can you explain your Jon, Cersei, and Jaimie typings please? I don't really understand why people think Cersei is anything but ESTJ. I've also always thought Jaimie was an ESFP with some pretty prominent Fi.And INTJ would win the win the war, the ENTP would prove the point that would change things forever. Far from it? I mean sure, not every ENTP likes to debate. But saying "far from it" makes it sound like it shouldn't even be a title given to an ENTP. The majority of ENTPs I know (including myself) and have seen on forums do like to debate. "Far from it" is not true, ha.I don't think you know how MBTI or brains work.Personally, I think it's a lot less ignorant to think that human nature can be categorized than to think people are so unique that we all don't follow a basic set of patterns on the surface of our individual selves. INFXs are the opposite of manly.:OYour existence within an English country is English class everyday. If you don't use it at least partially right it makes it look like you're an idiot since you've been surrounded by it since birth. A question mark is a big thing to forget, my friend. Do they not have question marks in Finland?You found it! Now where did that uppercase letter go at the beginning of your sentence? You were so close :/.How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real? They're talking about you, /u/SotionNo wonder so many NTs are single.Oh, so she's an ESFP.INFP? ;)I use it every day. It is my news source, my way of communicating with people online, and also a great way to learn and see others opinions on subjects. It is easily the website I use the most. Four years. I got it when I was a Sophomore in High School and I've been addicted ever since...And yet you're being irrationally judgmental and superficial right now as well. Hmm...He's talking about your post.Well...that was dramatic.You're giving me exactly what I was hoping for. Your overly dramatic rant, you reading too much into what I said, your silly little emoji, you clearly being offended, your downvotes, you condescendingly calling me sweety....it's just too great. You're clearly butt hurt and I love it because there's absolutely no reason, haha.What an intelligent comeback. How many of Vase Faces videos have you watched? She seems very INFJ to me.How many of Vase Faces videos have you watched? She seems very INFJ to me.I'm guessing you don't type people correctly all that often.Chimpanzees. I look at them and I just feel this distinct sense of disgust. The way they are so eerily human-like and that they practically have the brains of a three year old and yet the body strength of bodybuilder. I don't know, it's just like seeing a bunch of handicapped athletes shitting on themselves and screaming and killing each other with their fists. They just gross me out.What about Wallace and Gromit? I love that show, haha.Impossible!!!ENFP That's why I just hang out with one of my ENFP friends to rejuvenate my ego. They'll laugh at anything I say.I find it hard not to make big decisions based upon what everybody wants and instead of just want I want- unless it completely goes against rational logic. If I truly think that my way is more rational and makes more sense I see it from a "Look, I know you people hate me but I KNOW that the end results of this will be far more worth it than what you have come up with". 

If a group of people feel like they have rights that I am not appealing to, I will definitely look at it from a "Okay, how do THEY see it? What can I do to fix this situation that satisfies all or most of the people here?" If I need to satisfy the "emotional" needs for these people and sacrifice my own, odds are it'll happen if I think it is the most rational route. I am very much about the greater good rather than my own personal perspective if it does nothing but harm everyone else.I once saw someone refer to him as a self-aware virus, hahaha.Of course. All humans hold beliefs that aren't rational.She did a video a while ago on her podcast with MBTI and got INFP but I don't see that at all. IMO she is ENFP as hell.Their beliefs usually are though. :)If you watch some of her vlog videos on her boyfriends channel I feel like it'll make it more clear that she is an ENFP.Definitely not an xNxP since your fish tank is clean. Eh, INFJ? Idk.The real question is why do INFPs and INFJs exist?PotatoNot surprised...at all.That’s not how cognitive functions work.But he asked what type you were. Why are you basing what type you are off of what people say about you? Your response to my comment doesn’t make any sense in the context of what he asked, lol.Oh oops. Lol my bad. Sorry.I relate to almost none of this.I think the ENTP villains are the ones whose soul purpose is to prove a point that will make others change their minds and be impacted by the villains opinions. That’s why they are entertaining villains- because often times whatever point they are trying to prove is relatable to some degree.  ENTPs don’t have some personal goal of “ruling the world”...we just want to show people why they’re wrong about how they think things are.

So yea. For me the only reason I’d ever be a villain is if I wanted to get a point across that I felt the world needed to know in order to progress.Really? I’ve known quite a few ESFPs who were real assholes, haha.I agree. I don’t agree with this at all. Margaery seems like an ENFJ to me and Cersei seems like an ESTJ.Umm...yea that is not what I meant. I THINK that Margaery is an ENFJ and that Cersei is an ESTJ. Did I ever say I like Margaery...? Don’t go assumin’Why do you keep downvoting everyone who disagrees with you?How can one not enjoy trolling if it’s not doing anyone genuine harm? Lol what? ENTPs don’t do physical violence- they just think about it.I’ve read a lot about her case and also watched her documentary- she seems a lot like an ENFP.Haha, yea there is no way he is an ISTJ.H3H3 seems like an ENTP to me. 1) ENTP
2) ENTP
3) ENTP
4) ENTP
5) ENTPIm an ENTP. The only type I’d be interested in being is an ENTJ. I don’t have a desire to be a feeling type or an introvert, so.Yup, agreed. Once things go too far my Fe makes me the fun police...in an unhealthy way that ends with me insulting people because of what I perceive to be “stupidity”.Oprah - ENFJ 

Ellen - ENFP

Conan - ESFP

Colbert - INFP

Jimmy Fallon - ENFP

Jon Stewart - ENTP

Joan Rivers - ENTJ

If the meteor is unstoppable the only answer is to move the Earth.


Hehhhh. Clever ENTP idea strikes again!!! Eh, our shitty theories and ideas are probably what gave you the ability to do any of the things you think you’re doing anyway. Ideas come first, then action. From what you’re posting right now I really doubt you come up with any significant ideas...so someone has to!Hahahaha ISTJ? MY MATCH? AHAHAHAH.Yup. That’s how it is with a few of my ESFP friends- constant confusion about things that I can’t comprehend being confused by. Not in the sense that they’re stupid, but just that they really do need things straight forward and I don’t.I will never understand an ESFPs thought process.I would say the same. I’ve never known an INFJ who is actually mentally stable and doesn’t have some form of anxiety, and I’ve known a good amount of INFJs....but your mind is you. That is how YOU are defined. The concept of “you” is constructed around that...otherwise I’m not sure what it is you think “you” are. 
All I know is that I can’t imagine an xNTP liking or lasting long in a military setting. I mean. I know I would personally hate it.Sri Lanka is honestly a shit hole. I’m not sure why people think it’s some beautiful tropical location, ha.I think I remember seeing somewhere that Hans Zimmer is an ENFP.God, I hate reading the comment sections when MBTI is mentioned. There are just so many uneducated individuals who trash talk cognitive functions, MBTI, etc. and write it off as horoscope/astrology bullshit.

Am I the only one who thinks MBTI is the most legitimate way of understanding someone’s personality...like...ever? It just seems so obvious to me that there is truth to the theory that when people start shit talking it I just sit back sort of baffled. Do I get why they’re trashing talking in this particular situation? Yes, but in general these sorts of people have no clue what they’re actually saying. Once you really understand cognitive functions, I do not see how you could think it’s bullshit- I really don’t. The fact that there are so many “psychologists” who also write it off makes me question their field in general, tbh, because anyone with average comprehension could understand that this theory is the real deal and the best look into personalities we are probably ever going to get.Don’t recall indicating that in what you’ve just referenced, but okay.I’m sure they’re doing fine. I don’t agree with this. I feel like ENxPs often do things that others would get addicted to purely for curiosities sake, but have the wisdom to know when things are going too far. I would say ESxPs are much more prone to addiction. I’m actually surprised you would put ENxPs on the top tier for potential addicts above ESxPs...who literally live for “experiences”.Gretchen, stop trying to make amn’t happen. It’s NOT going to happen.Being an outsider makes me uncomfortable and depressed, tbh. When I can’t engage with the people I’m with in conversation, I start to shut down real quick and get stuck in my head.One time an old INFP friend who always has a shaved head asked me if I liked his haircut. I responded with “You got a haircut?” (It really looked no different) and he looked at me as though I had ran over his family with a steamroller and cooked their remains into chili that I then donated to a soup kitchen where his dead family could be eaten by homeless people. We don’t know for sure whether or not you’re born this way or it’s environmental. Personally, I think it’s completely innate and that you’re born the type you are- I don’t think your environment has anything to do with MBTI personality, only how it grows and matures. I don’t think you understand Ne very well. You don’t need physical external input for Ne to work- it’s not a sensing function, it’s intuition. And I think there is framework to Ne, it’s just much more broad than Ni. What the fuck are you saying?INTJs crave social status, but they’re extremely bad at obtaining it...haha, just like ENTPs would be bad at obtaining a normal, comfortable life.A GREENTEXT FOR EVERY TYPE“Multiple intelligences” is just something people say when all they know how to do is draw cartoon characters.James- INTP

Alyssa- An angry ESFP, lol.For me it’s easy to do something I find “moral” if it impacts people as a whole or if I think it’s harmful to society. I care a lot about that sort of stuff. What’s difficult for me is to see people as very select individuals unless they mean a lot to me. So I have morals- I just struggle to have steadfast morals on a individualistic level.I lie if I find the truth to be long winded and dramatic enough to cause issues. I don’t typically lie about big stuff though.I mean it’s not really fun if they’re all incorrect though. You posted this as a way of humoring others- but it doesn’t really humor anyone in the way you want it to if they’re so wrong.Lol how?Prove it.I love cringe if it’s not legitimate pain. For example, I don’t find Funniest Home Videos funny at all. Watching people get hurt doesn’t make me laugh, it just makes me worry for the other person and have gross feelings. What is funny about a person head butting a floor or something? Some people just love that shit- it just makes my Fe sirens go nuts.Well I think it’s a different type of cringe.Really? In general I have found ENTJs and ENFPs to be the most introverted extroverts.Not surprised. ESTJs are almost always tricky for me as well.Probably both for ESTPs. However, I can’t imagine an ENTP being particularly physical with violence. We prefer to use our words. I imagine most ENTPs would find physical aggressiveness to be pointless- I know would. I just don’t understand what it achieves unless it’s truly needed in times of danger.You can’t have “touches” of a certain type. That’s not how MBTI or cognitive functions work. You’re one type. Saying you can have “touches” of another types completely defeats the purpose of cognitive functions. Just because you are aggressive doesn’t meant you’re not an ENTP.No, no, no. The ENFP would say “moar” not “more”. Dude, you’re weird.Or maybe we know we’re awkward but we enjoy watching you squirm uncomfortably! Idk if I agree with that. Every ESTP I’ve known seems to be very, very opinionated.Lol what? All I see is the opposite of this. The majority of NTs on here seem quite aware that STs have the upper hand in actually succeeding because they don’t live inside of their heads. Hmm...valid.Oh please.What is the point of this question? You are reallllyyyy simplifying the thought process of someone who has Ne-Ti-Fe-Si. Your explanation for why an ENTP would do drugs is more of an ESTP. There is a lot of thinking that goes into the decisions ENTPs make, not just “Lol why not”. I can give a thousand different reasons “Lol why not”- it’s almost insulting how much you simplified my types thought process, lol.Motivation and thought process are intertwined.ENTP here, I don’t relate to this. It starts to drive me crazy after about five or six tabs.Oh fucking please, as if an ESTP has any right to lecture ENTPs as a whole on how they never “take accountability for their actions”. I hate when people say shit like this...but you sound very ESTJ, not ENTP. ENTP here, and ESFPs can just drive me up the wall.I’m surprised no one here has said ESTPs.Hmm...

I wanna say ISFPs.

ISFPs respect their feelings before they succumb to the image that is expected of them, hence why so many ISFPs tend to have the most genuine, amazing music out there. I mean think of it: Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga...some of the most notable stars who have CHANGED the industry itself have been ISFPs. 

I think ENTPs, ESFPs, and ENFPs would be pretty entertaining too.Ah, and this is what makes you a Te user :)Open-ended like you trying to shut down the basis of this entire sub? 🤔Why are you responding to something six months old? Move on old man.Sounds like you might be dramatizing it a bit. Sometimes one can know, other times one cannot know a thing which is perfectly seen and still unknown. ENTP RavenclawUgh idk. There are so many things that I can think of. Ha, ain’t that the truth.Hahaha what the fuck#MakingAssumptionsJust your usual ISTPIdk if it’s a “detecting people’s bullshit” thing since I’m an ENTP, but I’ve always found it pretty obvious when an INFJ is trying to manipulate.I think most ENTPs in general are very, very insecure and are just decent at hiding it. Some of you might go “Oh yea lols well that’s obvious XD”. You probably don’t even know the half of it. Like...Ne-Ti can send you into an absolutely crippling spiral of overthinking.I like interesting stuffYea, this has been my experience as an ENTP.Is she an xNTP though...?Eh, I don’t know about exclusively INTPs, but I could see the majority of them being IxxPsRobert Downey Junior seems like more of an ENTP.“Me! Me! ME! ME ME ME!!!!”

— ESFPsINTPs? I know tons of INTPs and would never consider them “jerks” simply because of how quiet and aloof they are.I think Aang is an ESFP.Don’t forget ESFJs, haha.ESTPs just pretenddddd to be narcissists- a lot like ENTPs. ExTPs aren’t ACTUALLY as confident as they appear.Phyllis? Yup. I’ve been into MBTI for almost 2 1/2 years and it’s still like this.INTPs as most likely to succeed? LOL.ISFx?Many ENFPs I’ve known have been utterly horrible drivers.Oh you ISFJs...so literal it almost hurts.I would say Marie is an ESFJ. She seems way, way too involved in how people around her act and all of their personal lives. Agree with everything else, though.These actually all seem pretty on point aside from just a few- I would say Marie is an ESFJ, not an ISFJ. Nothing about her says introvert. Nothing at all. And I would say Todd is also an ESFJ. For Skylar I would say ENFJ.ENTP- Not getting offended by things that most people would get offended by, but still getting offended by things that no one would really understand why I find them hurtful- usually these things are intellectually based. You can call me dumb, ugly, idiotic and shit all day- but once my intellectual intentions are misread and people are driven to a conclusion that I didn’t mean to give, for some reason I find it offensive because I pride myself in being able to find answers and explain things simply. I know it’s stupid, but it happens sometimes. Just curious, why did you call them Gen. Y instead of Millennial? I’ve noticed that ExFPs in general seem to get along with their xSTJ parents a lot better later in life. As an ENTP, getting along with my ISTJ father seems absolutely impossible, haha.Ha, to your comment on how all you wanted was a reasonable explanation- I think a lot of people don’t get that for ENTPs, if you can really just explain why or how you came to a conclusion for something, EVEN if it’s not correct in our eyes, we will respect you way more because at least we know why you think what you are thinking. Classic Te answer. This comment just reeks of “I’m over the age of 50”. Interesting. I’m the exact opposite. I love explaining things/ideas to people and trying to keep them to myself all the time sounds painful.There is no way in hell that you are 25- and if so, then maybe English just isn’t your first language? I just don’t know many...if any 25 year olds who have that mentality or type like that- that sort of nonsensical, but enthusiastic incoherence with a dash of illogical certainty that most Baby Boomers have when speaking over the internet.Okay...valid.I don’t relate to Ni or Fi in the slightest.Interesting, I would have thought Ne would be easy for someone to understand even if they didn’t have it. Maybe that’s just because I’m a Ne dom though.xxFJs would likely die very early on, hahaha. My bet would be on xxTPs as the best for that sort of scenario. An ENTP and ESTP together would do quite well, I think.Well, I know two Mormon ISFJs who are getting married in November...and all I can think is that they are going to have the most mediocre sex on the planet. Because I’m a nosey pervert ENTP- I am Category 1. I used to spend hours reading about history on Wikipedia, haha.I literally said “Hahaha, the BOSS?” out loud when I saw the ENTPs.I often see this question in the individual subreddits of each type, but not really on /r/MBTI. I think it would be interesting to see how each of you as a type deal will procrastinating and not getting things done. Looking for more serious-like answers, not stuff like, "Lol. I don't."

I watched an interview with the two of them a few days ago, and was wondering what you guys think their personalities might be?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v_PBqSPNTfg

Here is the video.

I think GRR Martin is an INFP, and I can't tell whether Stephen King is INTP or INFP.

I know there will be someone saying Stephen King is an INTJ, but I really doubt that. He writes his stories as they go along and hardly ever plans them out. I was just looking through each types individual subreddit, and I noticed that the introverts seems to be very negative about...well...life.

INTP: I can't get anything done because I'm too busy on Reddit... :(

INFP: Look at this painting I drew of something...it made me really sad.

INTJ: Does anyone else hate living because all humans are morons?

Things like that. What do you think it is about introverts that make them just more...negative? I'm not trying to generalize and judge, it's just something I've noticed consistently. It's why I really struggle to grasp the whole, "ENTPs are so much like INTPs!" And "ENFPs are just like INFPs" statement that for some reason goes around all the time.I've been thinking about this one for a while, and here are my guesses:

Walt: INTJ

Skyler: INFP

Jesse: ESFP

Hank: ESTJ

Marie: ESFJ

Flynn: ESFP

Saul: ESTP

Gus: INFJ

Mike: ISTP

Todd: ESTP

Lydia: ISFJ


I can't decide between ESTP, ENTP, or ISTP. Thoughts?My take:

Mike: ENFP
Dustin: ENTP
Lucas: ESTJ
Will: INFP
Eleven: ISFP
Nancy: ISFJ
Jonathan: INTP
Steve: ESTP
Joyce: INFJ
Hopper: ISTP
Brenner: ENTJ
Mikes mom: ESTJI'm an ENTP, and I've noticed that when I'm having anxiety or going through a tough time, one of the best things is being with my ESFP and ISFP friends. For some reason when I'm with my other ENTP and ENFP friends, it just seems to make my mind more jumbled than it already is (only if I'm having anxiety, otherwise it doesn't at all) because of our Ne's feeding off of each other. I think it's because they're much more grounded in reality and not as much in their heads as I am that it helps me be that way too.

Anyone else notice this?I've noticed that for the last two or three weeks, there has been less quality posts, less posts in general, and a lot of garbage. Has anyone else noticed this?I hardly ever see any singers that I would think of an ENTP, INTP, ESTP, or ENTP...why do you think that is? I can think of maybe five ENTP singers: Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend, Celine Dion, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden (duh), Weird Al (DUH), and maybe Imogen Heap. 

I can’t think of a single ISTP singer though.This is gonna be a long one, so bare with me. 

I was looking through this thread a few hours ago-

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9ujxkp/dont_like_infjs/

-and the one thing I noticed (just like with all threads critiquing INFJs), is that people try to write the INFJs in the OPs story as “mistyped”. Many will say that the individuals in OPs story must be INFPs because *INFPs* are the ones who have an inflated sense of self, because *INFPs* are always the stubborn, unwavering ones. And as I looked at the comments, many of the individuals who said this are of course...INFJs themselves, while the majority of other individuals agreed with OP.

Now this begs the question: why do INFJs seem to be so misunderstood compared to even the INFP? Why do they often think they’re a certain way but no one else “gets it”? Why do INFJs claim to know themselves and their beliefs so well, but are always on this never ending journey of self-discovery?

So let’s be blunt- completely blunt about who the INFJ is and how they think. And I know there will be tons of INFJs saying how I’m just an “angry” individual or that I “have this weird dislike” for INFJs- but that’s not the case. I’m simply sick of how INFJs seem to be misunderstood even by themselves.

First things first, let’s look at Ni and lets use a spaceship traveling through the vastness of space as our setting because who the hell doesn’t like space and lasers or whatever. Space is the mind, intuition is the direction that the mind goes. The spaceship is lost and trying to figure out how to find the nearest hospitable planet. This is the way that the Ni-Dom Spaceships think about the situation:

Ni-ship: It is *aware* of how vast space is. It *knows* that space is massive, that there is a lot of it out there and that without having knowledge on it that things can get confusing and lost. This is the *definition* of intimidating for the Ni-ship. However, it’s first and foremost purpose is being a Ni-ship, not a Fe-Ship, not a Ti-ship. It is a Ni-ship, so not only is it aware of the vastness of space and not only does the Ni-ship want to find a hospitable planet- it obsesses about avoiding the confusion, chaos, and uncertainty of space. It wants to bring order to an infinite existence so that it can bring peace to *itself*- but this is absolutely impossible. You can’t control space. But the Ni-ship doesn’t care. It ignores the uncertainty and the chaos, traveling from one hopeful place to the next, constantly thinking that their shot in the dark to what they think will be a beautiful, tranquil existence may be satisfied...but the more they see, the more that they are let down by the chaos of what they have discovered. But *no! The Ni-ship knows that somewhere, no matter how far away, no matter how deep, that they will find perfection...so they keep going, ignoring the blunt, honest truth that perfection simply doesn’t exist. 

Now you may be thinking “Okay, but this goes for INTJs as well”. Being a Ni-ship? Yes, however an INTJs Ni-ship is powered by practical logic (Te), something that is much, much easier to understand and less convoluted like the INFJs second function which is Fe. Ni is just the surface of the Ni-ship. Within it, there are passengers (Fe). However, this Ni-ship isn’t a democracy. Like the vastness of space and all of its chaos, a Ni-ship simply acknowledges the fact that democracy exists and that it is polite to listen to what people have to say- but that sure as hell doesn’t mean the Ni-ship is suddenly gonna veer off course- especially when the Ni-ship is *so sure* it’s about to find the key to the perfect hospitable planet. If their shot in the dark direction allows it, they will hear what the people have to say- but otherwise, shut the fuck up because the Ni-ship “knows” it isn’t just finding the perfect environment for itself, but also the crew of the ship- and *not* just the crew, but also for all of mankind. 

This is why INFJs and are simply put...egotistical as *fuck.* It’s why all INFJs think they have self-awareness, but don’t realize that their version of self-awareness quite frankly...doesn’t work in the real world nor will it ever. Unlike a Fi user who has a very distinct and obvious sense of “self”, the only part of an INFJ that actually has some sort of “self” is the perfection that they endlessly strive for and that they *wholeheartedly* believe is within them and the others around them- that is, as long as they let the INFJ take control. *Yes,* to all of those INFJs out there smugly reading this as your Ni tells you that I’m wrong and your Fe tells you that I “can think whatever I want”, I’m completely and 100% aware that this is just “my opinion” about you guys and that while your happy for me for coming up with it, that it’s also incorrect because in the whole vastness of existence and time, you were pointed in a direction which told you that my opinion was “imperfect”, and because my opinion negatively impacts your hopes for humanity, and also since your self-awareness revolves around your view of that perfection then I *must* be wrong...and *yes* I’m aware that since I, like you, have the potential to be a perfect being then I must have already known that my opinion was wrong and that naturally since I’m so incredibly wrong that I probably feel bad about myself and silly for attacking literal *perfection* even though you don’t care that I’m doing it but that’s okay because everyone can believe what they want and etc. etc. etc.- which is also where Ti comes into play. :)

Ti for an INFJ is basically an annoying walking info-robot on the Ni-ship that is constantly giving suggestions and saying “why” everything is the way it is. And while sometimes heavily resented by for its lack of compliance with the the overarching goal and critique of it is always in the back of the “perfection” driven Ni-ship. But this info-robot isn’t nearly as powerful as the *perfection*, lol no no no. And as powerful the crew or humanity *itself*? Lmao NO. It simply gives the how, and while it is always there, it may be listened to or it may be abused. 

Then we have Se...the absolute bane of everything the Ni-ship “””knows””” itself and everything to ideally be. It states how things *are*. But remember, this is after going through Ni-Fe-Ti, so it isn’t just saying how things are, it is the backbone of how things should be (Ni), how what should be will fix humanity (Fe), and how to get there (Ti). Se is reality, and Se stops perfection because reality is never perfect- but *fuck that!* screams the controls of the Ni-ship, they will *make* it perfect- even if it’s a toxic gas giant that will kill everyone else- but the INFJ will be very polite while doing it so don’t worry bb.

INFJs are not a conventional objective(as an ENTP those two words hurt to type out) type, they simply believe they are because their perfection obsessed mind says objectiveness is in the right direction toward perfection for humanity, which is the “ultimate” goal and the only real sense of identity an INFJ can consciously bring into the real world- this is why you’ll constantly see INFJs talk about self-hatred. Deep down (Ti-Se), they know perfection doesn’t actually exist, but they are literally always being told by their first function that perfection is the only way to be truly happy for humanity or themselves. This is also why INFJs constantly seem negative about society- they truly believe that the chaos and lack of focus don’t just make it confusing, but makes it corrupt and even *evil* because it does not and will never live up to the expectations as an INFJ. 

So no, not every fucking critique of an INFJ on here is an example of a mistype nor is it just a “misunderstanding”. It’s because your functions literally do not allow for you to actually see yourselves from the perspective of another individual and see it as valid unless it gets in your way. It’s because your only sense of identity is literally “perfection” and anything that attacks that is nothing but a wrench in the gears.

So yea. That’s my write up. Adderall crash incoming so like idk what else to say k bye.


LITERALLY physically bullied in High School for my MBTI beliefs. PHYSICALLY. BULLLIED!.!!.


...no, I have never been made fun of for liking it.Lol, your poor ESFP sister.I think he’s an ESTP.Markiplier is not an ENTP, ha. He is ENFx.He is not an ISTJ or ENTP...and ISTJs are also not the funniest type. ENFP or ENFJSo, so true. It’s astounding how ESxPs (particularly ESFPs) can just not think of what they’re saying or doing sometimes.Yup. It’s interesting because I’m an ENTP and I usually get along well with ESTPs- but ESFPs require a lot of work. There is never an “instant vibe” between us.I bet that turned you on since you’re an ISTJ, right?I think a lot of it has to do with intuitive types making up the majority of these subreddits and also probably the majority of them also being raised by SJs. It’s not that these stereotypes are true all the time, but they are likely a lot more true for NPs who are anything but understood by SJs and vise versa. Idk about any one else here, but I definitely did not have a good relationship with my ISTJ father and a lot of the stereotypes were true for him and the majority of other ISTJ parents I saw- all of this is from the POV of an NP though, who are the most likely to have those stereotypes come to fruition since we are so different from SJs.Donald Trump is as intuitive as a rock.Surprisingly, I think all of the Kardashian sisters are xxTxs.

Kim - ISTJ

Kourtney - ISTP

Khloé - ENTP

Kylie - ISFx

Kendall - ESFP

Rob - INFP

Kris - ESFJ

Bruce - ESFP

Scott - ESTP

That’s what I would type them all as. I just don’t see a lot of “feeler” action going on from the main three sisters- especially Kourtney. UGH why do I know this...Maybe. I just don’t get a Fi vibe from Khloé. She seems to use Fe. Yea I’m positive she is an ISxJ though. I saw her typed as an ESFP once and I was just like lol no.This is basically the Mein Kampf of MBTI.Honestly it almost seems like IxFJs in general like being verbally abused, lmao.ENTP here. I think tough love needs to be defined because an xSxJ showing me “tough love” is the last thing I want. Idk, I guess it just seems like they are attracted to it because it’s just feeding their Ni/Si about how they need to “save” and “change” their partner so that he/she fits their ideal image that they have made in their head. I don’t think they consciously “like” it- but it sure it sure as hell seems to keep them invested and motivated in that person.  It’s as if when someone who they love tells them they’re a piece of a shit, they’re like “It’s true...but I don’t truly think you as a person would ever say that or think that! So I’m gonna stay with you and keep doing what you say and keep giving you positive reinforcement and keep letting you abuse me so that you will eventually realize that you’re a great person deep down who would never say something like that and then you’ll come to realize who you truly are!!!!”...and it never happens and before they know they have wasted 10 years of their life on a person who treated them like garbage- but it’s ok, because they’re still devoted since their ideal version of that person will often still exist.I could agree with that. That’s what you all say :)INFJs and INFPs are nothing alike so I don’t get why you’re grouping them together lol.I always cringe when I hear xxFPs say things like “I hate people”.  It’s just such an out of touch, narcissistic thing to say in my mind. The thing is, Fi is complex but not in a “rational” sort of way that would allow Ti users to fully understand it. It can often be well...nonsensical complexity. Learn cognitive functions.Okay, but ISFPs don’t have Ne at all...so your statement doesn’t make much sense.Maybe. I feel like if someone is well-rounded enough then they are also better at self analysis. I don’t know about others, but it’s difficult for me to stay in a negative mindset when my default state (Ne) is about seeing all of these incredible and huge possibilities just around the corner. ExxPs kind of thrive off of the external world and all it has to offer- so it’s a little difficult to make me depressed. ExxPs aren’t like the other types who stay in “practical” situations because they need to no matter what- if they feel mentally or physically compromised, they will fly away with out a second thought to find the next thing.Really...? The majority of INxJs that I know are always having some sort of mental crisis. He also concluded that Kanye is an ENTP, lmao. Sorry, Joseph but I think you’re just bad at typing.ENFP maybe but not ENTP.Think of it like a massive spider web that is constantly expanding and has no end point or beginning point. It’s just a huge span of connections. It’s always expanding, always trying to find a way to get bigger, making new webs, and tearing down old ones- and it’s doing this rapidly, not slowly. Existence itself is a web for an ENxP. One thing leads to the next, and then that thing leads to the next, and then that and that. For an ENxP almost everything just “makes sense” because everything connects in some way. Ne doesn’t “skip” over things and come to a random conclusion like people think they do when seeing a Ne dom. The connections are just so fast and so obvious to the Ne user themselves that it looks like they jumped from A to C with out looking at B. 

ENTPs can likely almost *always* give you a rundown of their thoughts. If something they said seems random and weird to you, ask them to explain their thought process from point A to B to C and they can likely do it. ENFPs on the other hand don’t prioritize the logic behind their ideas, instead looking at their feelings about them (Fi). If you ask an ENFP to explain their thought process, they probably won’t be as good at it. This is why Ne doms often feel misunderstood. We live in a world where all of the connections just *make sense*, but oftentimes no one else can see it unless they take the time to ask...which nobody has time to do, lol.

I’m an ENTP and I don’t see anything “random” about my thoughts. Ne finds the info and Ti explains to me why/how. It isn’t random to me. I think ENFPs are often ashamed of their Ne because they actually do think their thoughts are logically “random” and it can make them feel socially ostracized and weird, sometimes making them resentful of society because it doesn’t understand their Fi. ENTPs don’t really care about that as much because we *do* think we have an explanation and can tell you why. However, if ENTPs are in a large group of people and the majority don’t understand their “”obvious”” logic and connections, they can feel exhausted or as if they are surrounded by incompetent people- which is one of biggest faults of an ENTP since there will always be people who don’t understand. 

If you were in the mind of a Ne dom for a few days, you’d completely understand why they get tired of people more quickly than other extroverted types, lol. They are constantly being misunderstood by a society that they think have all the solutions to, but are constantly let down as they have more Ne epiphanies that smack them in the face and make them realize how hopeless it is to get everyone to see those endless connections and possibilities. 

If ENTPs found a way to get over their critique of individuals and their hopes/expectations of society and ENFPs found a way to get over their critique of society and their hopes/expectations of individuals they would both be much happier, haha. I think it’s the key to flourishing as those types. I think the best way to describe Fi (from how I understand it) is “gut reaction”. Imagine your Ti completely gone- no more analyzing the possibilities you see, no more “why? how?” running through your mind at lightning speed. However, imagine you still SEE the connections with Ne, but instead of weighing whether or not something makes sense systematically (A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D) to understand its *reasoning* more and more and more, you listen to your initial, blunt, human reaction and your emotional response and use all of those connections to affirm it. You *see* that A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D exist, but you don’t want to know more about it, you want to make sure it lines up with your gut reaction. If it does- hello let’s keep going! Let’s explore ALL OF THESE POSSIBILITIES that are making me feel so wonderful! If it doesn’t- bye. 

However, since Ne is “endless connections”, ENFPs often don’t give an impression of being too hung up on the negative aspects of something because they can still see all of the aspect of how something is good. They’re striving to make sure Ne makes their gut reaction “positive” instead of negative...so if someone calls them a “bitch” they might find a ton reasons why that statement wasn’t “that big of a deal”...simply so they don’t get emotionally harmed. Yes, it offended them, but Ne is gonna be like “Well...I have my gut reaction...everyone else has their gut reaction...and there are a lot of reasons why they could have said that. I’m not sure *why* they would have said that, but my gut reaction says I’m not a bitch, so I don’t really care to understand why their gut reaction says I am a bitch. Plus, they might just be having a lot of personal issues, and my gut reaction is telling me they probably didn’t mean it...but even so...it still made me feel bad. But that’s okay, because I can leave this situation any time I want(Ne), and *I* know *me*. Maybe I am a bitch- and it makes me feel sad that someone would think of me that way. But guess what? I have a thousand different connections that tell me that I’m *not* one. So there.” See how passive that mindset is? They’re so passive because their feelings are so up in the air and are always in the realm of possibility for feeling something new- something better.

Fi is the rock of an ENFP- however, they don’t mind pushing the rock itself around a bit so they “feel” good about all of the possibilities they’re seeing. They don’t mind pushing it around a bit- as long as it’s them doing it- but they sure as hell don’t want anything attack it. Ti is the rock for ENTPs- however, we practically *dare* people to try and hit or dent the rock. ENFP has a passive rock that doesn’t want to be hurt, so as they slide through the endless mud (Ne), they are trying to avoid aspect of it that would make them uncomfortable. This is why ENFPs are passive.

Fi is logical and Ti is logical. Fi is raw and *real*. How is it not logical to be pissed off if someone calls you a bitch if you see a million reasons affirming your gut reaction(Fi) that calling you a bitch was rude? But remember, Fi is an ENFPs *second* function, so although it offends them, they’ll let it slide because of Ne- unless it keeps going and *going*- then they’ll flee into the night, haha. An ENFP will likely be more passive about it because like an ENTP, they are always trying to see if whether or not their Ti/Fi is even justifiable in the first place, and their are so many connections that they may never truly know- but they are *always* striving to know. Which is why they’re both so critical of themselves. 

Ne-Fi is why ENFPs have such a fucking weird sense of art and fashion. “Look at all of these awesome things that are so beautiful and crazy and make me feel all of these crazy cool things because of how fun and wacky they are! I feel a million different things for this purple cat sweater and GOD DAMN IT I’m okay with that!!!! If you don’t like it, that’s okay!- I mean I probably won’t hang out with you as much because you dislike “me” for me, but if we casually fuck once in a while then things are A-okay 😩👌🏻👈🏻 because I promise I’m not gonna get emotionally attached when you don’t like the true “”meeee”. Oh? What? You like me now? SHIT. This wasn’t supposed to happen! I’m my own person and I’m going to take my purple sweater that YOU HATE SO MUCH and move to Jamaica!!...AND IM GOING TO FEEL BAD WHILE DOING IT! So take that!”. ENTPs are more like “God damn it there’s like a million reasons why I think these dark brown shoes and brown pants go good together...but there’s also a million reasons why they don’t. I would look so dumb...hey, hey, HEY- wait a FUCKING second. Browns bears wear all brown too and they’re beautiful and do not look dumb- BEAUTIFUL AND NOT DUMB. So brown bears can wear all brown but if I do I look stupid? No. No FUCK THAT. Things are gonna change around here. ALL BROWN ALL THE TIME and the WORLD IS GONNA KNOW IT. Everyone at this sewing circle that I’m going to can literally GO FUCK THEMSELVES because if a majestic, beautiful brown bear can look good in all brown SO CAN I GOD DAMN IT.” and then as they’re sitting back at home after the party they think “Holy shit I looked so fucking dumb. Who the hell cares about what brown bears wear?”


That’s my take anyway.That would be fun.More like xNFP. An ENTP would literally break a blood vessel in their brain if they found themselves trying to legitimately argue that, hahaha.More like I am just talking “in general”.Why is this always the response when someone critiques INFJs? *Always*. It’s literally just an excuse for INFJs to look at your comment and be like “Yup, I don’t do that. Must be a mistype”, so they ignore what people are saying about them. Maybe...maybe he’s *not* mistyping. Maybe these INFJs that OP are talking about are really like that. Because I’ve met quite a few INFJs, and they certainly often have a god complex going on up in that brain of theirs.Or maybe it is an INFJ. I don’t really understand how being a Ni dom would even allow you to be truly objective. Your objective thinking is almost always based upon what *should* be objective in your own mind, not the other way around. By definition, Ni isn’t objective in the slightest. I think INFJs always *think* they’re being objective when literally the only person who thinks that is usually themselves. It’s why their ego is the size of the universe and why they’re so “misunderstood”.But what you just said is *literally* how I explained your functions...so I’m not sure what you’re getting at.

Edit: aside from the first one.I’m not being hard on myself...? Haha, what?I don’t understand how that’s me being hard on myself.Huh, yea I get it. I definitely wasn’t being hard on myself though. Don’t worry.Haha, thanks.It’s almost as if you’re in an MBTI based subreddit! *Gasp*.How exactly done one split focus into “two parts”? That doesn’t really make sense by the way cognitive functions work. You don’t “split a  function”- they either go inward or they go outward. Simple as that.Tbh I was on Adderall lmao.LmaoI sort of did one for ENFPs a week or two ago. You can read the comment chain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9t99bz/what_does_ne_mean_by_picking_up_on_patterns/e8uos0b/?context=3Thanks, Boo. I try...

...sometimes.Some call me a terroristttt, I considerrr myself a teacherrr.Fuck, you’ve convinced me. All of my research, discussions, and understanding of cognitive functions has just been thrown out the window because your superior opinion factually reigns over my interest and understand of MBTI. Damn it!If you can actually come up with an argument that is logically consistent, then maybe I’ll listen. Instead of basically saying I’m a fanatical nutjob, why don’t you take the time to actually say something with some merit? You siting the “Wiki pseudoscience page” as the reason for why you probably think I’m an idiot isn’t really that convincing. I don’t hate you, but you *are* pretty correct with the last part.This is what I also thought, lol.Wow I wish I knew these things about myself More like every xxTP ever.“Debate”?Because Fi is more sure of itself, haha. I’m an ENTP and that sounds like hell. The only extroverted types who get a kick out of doing what you’re saying would be- in my experience- ESxJs.But...why? I guess I just don’t do it because I know that the majority of cashiers groan inside when someone tries to chat them up and have a conversation. I mean I almost always have a very small “chat” with cashiers just to let them know that I know they’re...people, but just standing there and talking to them? No way. 95% of people I know who have been in costumer service would hate that.Oh, well then yea I do that too sometimes. Eh, but ESxPs usually know when to stop. From what I’ve seen ESxJs don’t know or realize people don’t care what they’re “chatting” about.Lol what? ENTPs and ENFPs are pretty different. Don’t let the Ne dom side of it fool you.ENTJ or ESTP. Sometimes I think being an xxFx would be nice...but all in all, I would rather be a thinker than a feeler. It would be nice to be an xxxJ so when someone says something like that about me instead of thinking “Huh? Trust me, we are not with out a shit ton of flaws” I could be like “Hmm...makes sense. I *am* the best aren’t I?”I’m an ENTP and I don’t believe this for a second- in fact, no xNTx here probably does. Everyone always has motives and reasons behind why they do what they do even if they themselves don’t realize it. Human beings are complex...but they’re not so complex that they can actually achieve “randomness” of thought that allows their actions to be “Lolz just becuz!”. I don’t think randomness even exists tbh. Everything happens because one thing led to another. 

This is post relates to an xNFx mindset, not an intuitive mindset...

...also an xNTx isn’t going to think they’re conclusions are “deep and dark”, haha. We don’t have the mindset that we’re mystical beings or something like feelers do sometimes, lmao.That’s not what I meant.But I don’t believe that, haha. I think it’s an xNFx thing in general. ENFPs don’t analyze situations like an xNTx would, they go based off of the gut reactions that Fi brings forth. I like how your argument is that ENFPs are more successful than two types who are already lower on the list. Basically, ENFPs just succeed a little more than INFPs/ENTPs don’t succeed, hahaha.Probably because they are the most biologically and “real life” useless to be quite honest. What good is a mind that is basically just constantly collapsing on itself and thinking that whatever comes from the rubble is destined to be the answer to the universe...all based on nothing but a hunch?

It’s peculiar that the two rarest types are both polar opposites on that scale- the least ideal to be(INFJ) and then the other is the most ideal to be(ENTJ). ENTJs often just “get” and understand life and how to get the most out of it on a personal level and then INFJs are constantly trying to comprehend what life even is and constantly trying to understand themselves/others and find their own identities. It’s like one is set up to fail 95% of the time on a personal level and the other is set up to succeed 95% of the time on a personal level. It’s almost as if evolution said “Kk, we cant have too many people who will succeed ALL the time on a personal level and always understand life because then things will be too easy...so just put a few of them. But if we are gonna have that...we should probably make it equal and also make a type that will never succeed on a personal level and always be unsatisfied.”I’m not saying their biological uselessness is particularly *bad*, but rather it’s just not “ideal” in the real world. I just don’t get how any of their functions are practically or personally useful in the real world *or* in their own minds. If you’d like to tell me how they are, then by all means do so. Because I can certainly elaborate more on why I don’t think they are. If we are strictly going off of the order of functions...I do not see how Ni-Fe-Ti-Se is the “optimal” order of how a person thinks. Plus, why is it okay to constantly say which type “has it best” with their functions, but if we say which *doesn’t* then it’s some terrible crime? 

I don’t have a hard-on for ENTJs. Just based off of their functions and the order they are in...it would make sense that they have a very useful stack in the real world. I don’t see why that’s a “hard-on” when it’s just the truth, lol.Here’s the thing though...what you’re saying- if we are taking what *your* theory is as truth, kind of supports me saying that INFJs are biologically useless. Isn’t the fundamental “purpose” of living things to procreate and multiply? Like that’s what living things *do*. It’s their instinct. So if INFJs don’t do that, but we are still going off of what you’re saying, then natural selection is simply weeding out their useless personality since they are more likely not want kids. So, what we are *really* seeing is INFJs in the final phases of their eventual extinction because they are less likely to have the desire to multiply and have children. :)Because we understand INFJs the best so we see through their bullshit the best :D. Hey, you asked.Ah, right. That’s my goal! You *figured* me out! No it wouldn’t lolWutBut your comment is about you...and you’re a Ne dom. I don’t even get what the money aspect of this post has to do with it.I think it’s important to note that when we “care”, it’s not in a Fi based way. It’s often in a principal/ethical way that revolves around what society or people think and say, and even then, it’s not our top priority because it’s our third function. For example, if some one said... “you’re a dumb ugly idiotic bitch”, it would be sort of shocking, but I wouldn’t get offended simply because those words are inherently offensive sounding, I would first have to go through Ne-Ti-Fe to see if that is logically sound...which is a lot of sifting. Initially my Ne-Ti would make me weigh the odds and likelihood of what they are saying. And it doesn’t just weigh the sentence itself- it weighs the person who said it, who they are, what they’ve done in the past(Si), their overall “personality” and if it’s like them to say something like that, etc. it looks for the context. This kind of allows me to reason with myself a million reasons why what they’re saying doesn’t matter and is untrue. However, due to the nature of Ne and Fe, in the back of my mind- DEEP in the back of my mind I will likely be thinking “Well...is what they said true...? What if it is...?” These thoughts would amplify if another person said the same thing. If a bunch of people told me I was an asshole, my logical conclusion would be that there has to be some truth to that and that I should probably fix myself. However, this is probably easier for ESTPs to realize and take as truth since they don’t have the bombardment of connections that is Ne.

So basically, ExTPs can often give a “I don’t give a fuck attitude” because we are pretty much wired to analyze the logical “reactions” of a social situation and weigh the odds of whether or not we should be externally unaffected by something. One of an ExTPs biggest fears is being a complete social outcast because we realize the logical usefulness of being good and being social and it’s stimulating for us to analyze people. 

I guess it’s not that we completely “don’t give a fuck”, it’s that’s we just don’t give a fuck way more than we do give a fuck, and ExTPs are likely highly aware that they can be whatever they need to be socially in that moment. 

This may be different for ESTPs, idk. But this is how it is for me as an ENTP. ENTJ or ESTP would be nice. Probably ESTP of those two though.Really? I’ve always found there to be quite a clear difference between ENTP and ESTPs even at first glance. Ne/Se may both be exploratory functions, but they are used in the real world much differently from each other.

I think ENTPs and ESTPs see society and people in very similar ways (Ti-Fe), but I don’t think we react to the similarities in the same ways.ENTP here...and probably right now or the last forty or fifty years. I don’t think I would have been very tolerated in ancient times. 

I think a lot of xSxJs hate “right now” because of its chaotic nature. I think they probably flourished best right up until the beginning of the 1960s, and then for ExxPs the counterculture of that time made room for us, haha.I would also like to experience the bubonic plague ravaging the world at least once in my life.Only an ENFP could be so optimistic about diarrhea and boils.What???  Don’t you know? The 2010s are supposed to be the literal worst decade *ever*. I can’t even call someone a dumb nigger with out being marked as “racist”. God I miss the good old days!!As an ENTP, I guess it’s just difficult for me not to believe this because no matter how hard I work I never feel like I’ve truly done all I can...and yet the “little” bit of work I have done often outshines others work(in my mind anyway). So if I actually worked to my full extent, which idk if that’s even possible because I see too many connections, then I think I would be on top. When I’m truly determined, I feel like I find solutions to my problem 99% of the time. That’s why ENTPs procrastinate- because we truly think we can do anything last minute and still pull it off- and usually do in our minds.Disagree. I don’t see why ENTPs would struggle with it. We are pretty good at analyzing things from an objective POV. Agree with this. I’m an ENTP and while I don’t do it often, sometimes I have hidden intentions when communicating with people if I am trying to reach a goal. Usually? No. Sometimes? Definitely yes. Well, I think OP was just talking “in general”...but I guess I think it would be more common for ENTPs than OP is insinuating that it’s incorrect to me to make it seem like a special aspect of the type. I’m an ENTP

I think I meet ENFPs and INFJs so often because we just sort of tend to “gravitate” toward each other. I am friends with so many ENFPs. However, it got a little tricky to list any after INFP because I really just don’t run into many of the types after that even though I would very much like to. I get along really well with INTPs, ESTPs, and ENTJs so it’s a shame I don’t meet more. I don’t even think I know any INTJs.
Why do you think that’s true? ISFJs are clearly more common than say...INTJs. Interesting...Interesting. I feel like they’re everywhere.But these are all like...flaws that each of these types have to deal with on a daily basis and are constantly battling them. Why would we want to accept them? Why wouldn’t we strive to fix instead of just let these flaws “be”? Also, why would you want to *define* each of these types by their biggest flaws?

Maybe it’s because I’m an xxTx but I don’t see how this is helpful or a good thing, ha.Idk, it’s probably because the internet is a safe haven for intuitives- especially introverted ones. 

I don’t think 99% of people on here *hate* sensors, they just misunderstand them...just like you probably misunderstand intuitive types sometimes. ENTJs don’t have Ne, so I’m not sure what you’re asking.This is simply not true. How in the world is this subreddit and the other forums “‘mostly sensors”? There is nothing to indicate the accuracy of that comment, but a lot to indicate it’s inaccuracy. It’s pretty obvious that intuitives outweigh sensors by a good margin on here- just like introverts outweigh extroverts on the Internet in general.Yea I don’t understand this comment either. It’s pretty obvious that there are more intuitives here. He’s talking out of his ass.I think that phrases like “face value” and “bigger picture” aren’t the best things to say because they seem like negative traits. 

It’s not that ESTP just takes things at face value, it’s that they are more interested in the rational, physical world around them than in what is “intangible” or hypothetically “possible”. This is *not* a bad thing. It is simply the way their mind prioritizes things. Just because they do this, it doesn’t mean they’re stupid, what it simply means is that their priority isn’t to show off what can’t be seen like “hypotheticals”, it’s to show what they are tangibly, truly capable of in the *real* world. 

For ENTPs, they want to show their capable of *thinking* of rational possibilities. This doesn’t mean they are smarter...at all. INFJs strive for perfection, but the physical world(Se), tells them that their goal for perfection is fruitless because the world is chaotic by nature. They are fun friends to have discussions with, but I think being in a relationship with one would be extremely frustrating for an ENTP. They can be very out of touch with reality, which I find to be off putting because it’s not in a silly/weird way or spacey sort of way like an INTP...it’s usually in a legitimately concerning way that is riddled with contradictions and glaringly irrational beliefs. If you get into any sort of debate or argument with your INFJ girlfriend/boyfriend that deals with facts, their methods of discussing “factual statements” are the type that would make an ENTP want to scream.

Their “mystical” side or whatever is cute and funny until things get real and then it’s the opposite of that. It’s exhausting, confusing, and frankly will make you feel worthless because you  realize that no matter what you do they will never truly see you as an individual person- just something they want to perfect and mold, even if that means ignoring reality and your own preferences for what you personally want.Lol classic. Any negative experiences with an INFJ is always because they’re a mistype. And then I look at your post history and you have a post titled “Do ISFJs have a single good quality?” Lmao, don’t be a hypocrite.Oh for sure. That’s why I said I like being friends with them- but I don’t think I could ever be in a romantic relationship with one (if we decided all of our relationships on MBTI ;) ;) ).But that isn’t true. Where are you getting that he stayed out of the limelight? He was very popular during his time and was very social. I’m an ENTP and I draw plenty of detailed drawings as well. I could even show them to you. You don’t have to have “Se” to be good at detailed art.This comment is so full of massive stereotypes and generalizations that it almost hurts my head.Nowhere is it even said that Da Vinci was an introvert, but you can find plenty of evidence of people saying how charming, outgoing, and social he was. I don’t understand where people get the “reclusive genius” side of this man. He wasn’t like that at all.In what way are introverts not more prone to reclusiveness? According to OP he can’t be an ENTP because he was too detailed at drawing, lol.Then what stands out to you that would lead you to believe that Leonardo Da Vinci is an introvert?Because we are opportunist survivors.Something tells me you know exactly 3 ENTPs.In what way are these ENTPs unstable? Huh? I was legitimately curious, lmao.ESFPs in the midst of a princess syndrome stress freak out are the worst.I would say ENFPs are the most liked and ESFJs are often the most disliked- at least on the internet.I have a few:

ESTPs- I’m not sure where this “angry fuckboi” stereotype comes from. Every ESTP I have known is nice and pretty chill and just does whatever. They’re hardly ever intentionally trying to hurt people or be mean. If anything it’s ESTJs that I see like that. 

INFJs- being non/argumentative, sensitive, and getting offended easily. From what I’ve seen, INFJs are not afraid to argue in the slightest. Or being warm and caring. The INFJs I’ve known seem to be pretty cold. Caring? Sure. But “warm”? Lol no. No idea where that stuff comes from.

I’d say xxFPs in general want to stay friends.Well I mean that goes for every human in existence, lol.I think it’s because us ENTPs never feel like we legitimately know enough of anything. I’m never satisfied with what I’ve learned. I always want more knowledge.That’s nice because every ISTJ I have known is super boring.That’s really easy to say when you don’t have Ti-Fe. So because you don’t get where they’re coming from then that means they’re trying to be assholes? Ah, Fi.ProbsOk well it’s also Ti in general I guess lol.ENTP here. Probably ESTPs. We both have the same sense of “self”, but we have a different way of applying that sense of self (Ne/Se). Almost as useless as this comment.They are? What’s the point of telling you the off putting aspect? INFJs just skew criticism the other way because it goes against what they’ve built their identities around(perfection). I don’t get why INFJs go on these threads asking for people’s opinions about their type when they aren’t even capable of taking other people’s criticism into account and just deflect it anyway, lol. It’s just utterly pointless.

(I guess that actually answers the off putting aspect of your type)

I would say the most alluring aspect of INFJs is how contradictory they are in almost every aspect in life. Like it’s actually fascinating how someone can live in a completely different world while just floating through this one. Yes, but the difference is that INFJs seek it out anyway and make others believe that they’re “open” to it when they’re the opposite of open to anything that goes against Ni-Fe- aka, real life. It’s like they seek out criticism simply so they can be told by their Ni-Fe that it’s all untrue unless it’s positive.Bojack- ENTP

Princess Carolyn- ENTJ

Mr. Peanutbutter- ESFJ

Todd- INFP(?)

Diane- INFJ

Sarah Lynn- ESFP


I definitely don’t think Princess Carolyn is anything but a Te dom.Really? I think Princess Carolynn is an ENTJ.Well, for me, my “existential crisis” mode doesn’t really fall out of the realms of “rational” existence of possibilities and inevitabilities. For example, a Ni dom- especially an INFJ- will likely be stuck in an existential rut because they are constantly in search of purpose, meaning, and a sense of self. They realize the scope of just how big existence is, but I don’t think they’re caught up with how pointless they think it is like an xNTP can be, but rather, they are caught up in how they can find the perfection that they truly believe *does* exist within the universe. They might think things are pointless from their personal point of view or where mankind is at right now, but they likely don’t believe that it doesn’t exist at all. 

For me, I don’t struggle with the universe/existence because I am constantly trying to find my sense of self or because everything is so big and it’s overwhelming, I struggle with it because I constantly connect everything like a web and it leaves me realizing I literally do not matter and probably never will- like at all. This can be a superpower and also my worst enemy. I have a crisis knowing I will never get to experience the future, that one day my mind will shut off forever, knowing that literally nothing means anything in the grand scheme of things, or that a billion years from now humanity will be long gone and forgotten. These aren’t things that I “”feel”” because I am angry or negative like they probably would for a feeler if they had these thoughts- these are things I think because it simply makes more sense than the alternative. Finding religion or feeling love isn’t going to stop these things from happening, these aren’t things I can solve or run away from or “feel” my way out of believing. These are simply things that make the most sense within my mind. Sometimes those things can really fuck with me, not because it’s they’re a hard pill to swallow, but because it’s hard to ignore them and just get on with life when you don’t think there’s a point anyway. 
Personally, I relate to NTs and even ESTPs more than I relate to ENFPs in terms of our sense of “self”. ENFPs and ENTPs only relate because of the connections they initially see within Ne, we do not analyze or focus on the same thing when we try to mold those possibilities. ENFPs are great, but they always feel more like one of those friends you can get lost in the external world with, but once you try to truly understand the others thoughts, it’s nothing but conflict and confusion. I’m never on the same “personal” page as an ENFP. Even if we agree on something, their way of coming to their conclusion often makes no sense to me.

ENFPs and ENTPs are like twins that were separated at birth- there is definitely a connection, but all in all only really the same on a very superficial level.Milo seems like more of an ENxP to me.“No mus bee mIStype”Let me guess...you’re an INFJ. I would agree with this. I’m an ENTP and I can be pretty idealistic (Mostly about things like human transcendence or technology or whatever).Yes but we are usually correct.Really? I’ve met so many ENFPs. Definitely one of the more common types I come across.I don’t really find myself “arguing” with ENTJs ever. Typically it’s just a really good discussion. ....
.......
...........ha.I’ve always found that his views are logical on paper but aren’t realistic in the real world.I could see this for INTPs but as an ENTP I don’t personally relate to that.Mark Zuckerberg is not an INTP. CS Joseph also typed Kanye as an ENTP which is a joke.I’m an ENTP and I prefer games with really good plots/stories- preferably science-fiction. When I was a little kid I played a lot of “open-world” games like Runescape, Minecraft, and Roblox mostly for the social aspect. 

I don’t really care about competitive games or anything like that. Games with no real substance are just...eh. I find them a bit tedious and boring and will pretty much only enjoy them with friends. I just don’t really play games to win- I like exploring. Super Smash Bros is pretty fun tho. 

Some games I really like: Mass Effect, Portal, Bioshock, Dead Space, Halo, Soma, etc. Stuff like that tickles my fancy, lmao. Dead Space blew my fucking mind. 

I don’t really play video games that much because I’m kind of picky and I also just feel like I’m wasting my time when I could be out doing something instead. If I’m gonna commit myself to staring at a screen for hours on end the game better be good.I have this theory that people like to shit on thinking types (especially NTs) about having all of these superiority complexes, more likely to be psychopaths, etc. because they don’t realize that we are simply more aware of the “facts” about ourselves rather than the “feelings” about ourselves. I honestly think feelers sometimes don’t have the fact based self awareness about something like having a superiority complex because it would “feel” like a negative. 

Some of the most superiority complex riddled people I’ve known are FJs. But of course, they would never actually think that they have a superiority complex because to them they’re just “helping people”. Not me. I was the CEO of a billion dollar company by the time I was 10.No I’m George Michael from Wham!Hitler couldn’t have been an INFJ silly OP. He impacted the *real* world way too much and didn’t get scared at the idea of leaving his house. Silly, silly you!This is a thing I’ve noticed in sensors in general aside from xSTPs. I don’t think it’s possible unless your mind is actually fucked with like getting in a horrible accident or having a mental illness.Disagree. They are both judgmental in different ways.I’m glad you used the middle “identity” aspect of types to relate them to each other. ENTPs and ESTPs are definitely similar to each other that way.English and History. &gt;I like ISTJs because they never say anything to you unless they have a reason to.

Haha, oh Dad. I’m sure I’ll make you proud *one* day! Classic! Hahaha.There’s two sides to a coin, bucko Self nominating Light seems like a clear ENTJ and L seems like a clear INTP imo. The dream “The average ISTP when you ask them a question that can’t be solved by getting pointlessly angry and physical”I honestly think it’s just because we are the most aware of these traits within ourselves. I’ve seen plenty of FJs defend their shitty actions because they think they’re doing things for the greater good, and I’ve seen plenty of FPs do shitty things and not own up to the fact that what they did was shitty because they were being their “true self”./u/The_White_Baron I’m sure your mom and dad didn’t realize that until after you were born though :)Ohhhh.Is there room for one more? Why is Sarah Silverman an idiot? I genuinely don’t know.You’re probably just so used to INFJs deflecting that you automatically assumed he was trying to defend his type. :)Are you sure you’re not the idiot for calling someone an idiot over something like that?I didn’t say you were an idiot simply for calling her an idiot, I said you’re an idiot for using that superficial and nit picky example for why you think she’s an idiot.Insane most of the time. I’m more shocked by dreams that are like real life more than I am by say...a dream of me flying over the Northern Lights with a winged polar bear or some shit.My social anxiety usually heightens with xxFPs tbh. With other types I’m usually fine.That’s because 99% of INFJs have a god-complex lol. Please check again and this time send picsNo, I’m an ENTP. I think it’s your Fi and not really knowing how to act around it half the time.Every time someone has a valid critique for INFJs, the majority of them just say whoever the critic had that experience with must’ve just been a mistyped INFP.You all say shit like this but your actions typically paint a different picture.I mean if you find fire and death as your existence happy then ya sure.For ENTPs I would switch Gryffindor with Slytherin. Although I would consider myself Ravenclaw in a Hogwarts scenario, my second choice would likely be Slytherin.   The picture OP posted.17Because Ne and Se are “possibility” functions. I can get pretty down, but my default state is seeing the better side to things and figuring out how to escape bad situations- this goes for pretty much every ExxP I think. The best way to make an ExxP a shell of their former self is to tie them down and limit their “free thinking” opportunities like idk...learning, traveling, socializing, etc. Ne/Se crave outer stimulation in the *outer* world. I may be an intuitive, but I can only keep my nose plastered to a video game or book for so long before I get mentally exhausted and need to go out and do something.It’s interesting how someone who seems to know so much about cognitive functions can be so off base sometimes. He typed Kanye as an ENTP. Lol, right.The most impatient person I know is an INTP. A constant, nonstop analysis of the world around me. If I’m alone then the Ti sort of takes hold but that can make me super existential and after a while can send me into a bad place. However, my internal monologue is usually like this with someone I don’t feel very comfortable with or feel like I can’t talk to easily:

Let’s say I’m with an idk... ISFP friend and we are...looking at the blood moon in the sky. 

Internal monologue: “Huh interesting. I wonder what makes it red. Is it the sun? Why haven’t I ever looked this up before? It almost reminds me a little bit of Avatar: The Last Airbender in Season 1. Fuck, what a good show. I wonder what so-and-so thinks about this.”

Me out loud: “Do you know why the moon is red right now?”

Friend: “It happens when the entire moon enters Earths shadow.”

Internal monologue: “Interesting. I wonder how they learned that. Maybe they read it off of Wikipedia or a forum? It makes logical sense on the surface, but I’m guessing there’s more to it then that. I think I’ll look it up when I get home. Maybe I should ask them where they got that information. Would they think I’m questioning what they’ve said though? Eh, maybe. Odds are they will but I really want to know.” (And suddenly the quote “Never tell me the odds” from Star Wars pops up in my head) “Lol. That was a weird thought. Star Wars is pretty interesting. I don’t really like what they’ve done with the franchise....in fact I’ve always thought they don’t really push the limits with those movies...hmm...ya know what? I honestly don’t even care about Star Wars. That doesn’t mean I can’t have an opinion it though. I wonder what friend has to say about it?”

Me out loud: “Dude have you seen the new Stars Wars movies? Complete bullshit am I right?”

Friend: “Huh? What are you talking about? That was random.”

Internal monologue: “FUCK. Now you look like a an idiot. “COMPLETE BULLSHIT”? That was such a dramatic and hasty statement. Fuck fuck fuck. And why did I only mention the sequels?? I don’t like the franchise as a whole, not just the sequels! I mean the cartoon is pretty cool though. Now I look like I care way more than I do. You know what? Nah, fuck that. You’re clever, you’re smart, you can DO THIS. Explain your thoughts, say them in a nonchalant manner, keep things light, don’t make them think your thoughts are random because they aren’t NOT. They MAKE sense. Everything connects. I’ll just explain how I got there and they’ll completely understand...maybe. There’s the possibility they won’t, and honestly they probably won’t. But if I explain it anyway then they will at least get a general idea. I don’t *really* care but I do care a small amount.”

Me out loud: (Explanation)

Friend: “Oh ok I understand. Interesting.”

Internal monologue: “He doesn’t really understand. Nothing he has ever said or done in the past has indicated that he would get why I just said what I did. It doesn’t make sense. Odds are he doesn’t actually care and he’s just trying to ease the awkwardness that I accidentally created by making such a socially outlandish and out of place statement about Star Wars...ugh, okay, I’m just gonna turn this conversation somewhere else....but do it nonchalantly. If you do it nonchalantly then they won’t think you’re taking yourself too seriously.  Because you *don’t* care that much, and looking like you do would be a lie. The MOON. That’s what we are looking at. THE MOON. FOCUS, GOD DAMN IT FOCUS.”

Me out loud: “Wow, the moon really does looks incredible.”

Friend: “I know right?”

Me out loud: “....”

Friend: “You know they say the blood moon has holistic properties that can help your body heal faster. Interesting.”

Me out loud: “The healthcare in this country is a fucking joke. Hahaha, imagine if we found out the blood moon actually did all of that and everyone started investing in blood moon rays or something? We would probably have weird blood moon rituals and stuff, hahaha. That would be hilarious. I hope you’re right.”

Friend: “Wut”

This is all in the span of like a minute.
I think every type aside from maybe FJs tbh.Why does there have to be a point?Rogue One was alright. However, I’m just not a fan of the movies as a whole. I’ve always felt like they were sort of superficial considering it’s in this vast and huge universe with tons of different planets, aliens, and technology....and they just keep it contained to this one tiny little aspect of that universe. The cartoon is really good though. ISFJ- “Oh ya? Well guess what I did today? I chewed New Tridents Icy Chill gum...IN THE SNOW.”Classic ESTPs!Si can eat my ass.I don’t understand how you’d ever mistaken an ENFJ for an ENTJ or vice versa. ExFJs and ExTJs are completely different imo.All that being said, I do know more shitty INFJs than not shitty INFJs, tbh.Jokes on you! INFJs don’t have a core! They are in a constant search for self-discovery, fellowship, and understanding- only to be let down every single time as they tumble through the void that is their mind! :DYes but are they untrue?Classic ISTP!I think ESxPs are often the types who “peeked in High School” because they can *sometimes* lack imagination in the real world and often get stuck in a 9-5 rut life style, closed up with the same group of people day in and day out, and physically bored-  that is simply not what they’re made for. I don’t think any ExxP is made for that tbh, but we can often get stuck in it anyway because that’s “what you do”. I just think ESxPs get stuck in it easier than ENxPs and are more reserved about quitting it.

For ESxPs to be happy, I think they really have be pushing themselves and doing new and exciting things all the time. I’ve noticed ESFPs are especially prone to just going along with a 9-5 or housewife route because again, “that’s just what you do”- and they usually fucking hate it but won’t admit it or don’t even seem to realize it.

I agree with what you’ve said and believe ESxPs need to be living free, day by day, and going with the flow in order to actually be happy. I’d put Bruce Dickinson and Matt Bellamy in the ENTP category as well.He sounds like an FJ when they try to explain themselves, lol.Really? I think he’s an ESFP.Says every extroverted type ever.That could also be because xNTPs see through INFJs bullshit. :)I’m kidding! Jeez!...

...oh waitIt’s interesting because I feel the exact same way about xxFPs. It’s fun at first because of Ne, but eventually it’s like “Okay, I feel like I’m losing my mind now”.Every day of my life, lol.ENxJs*It’s the collapse of the sub. That’s all. You’re witnessing the end. One day you’ll be able to say “I was there”.You don’t? That’s weird.NO ONLY SI USERS EXPERIENCE MEMORY! *Clearly* you’re actually an INTP.

/sYa’ll constantly say this but from what I’ve seen the ENTP subreddit has less memes than any other MBTI subreddit. The only annoying aspect of ENFPs that I can think of is the nonstop flakiness. People say ENTPs can be flaky...but imo ENFPs are 100% worse. They’re really good at making people think they dislikes them and don’t really care about them, tbh.I only meme when everyone else memes. MwahahahaWell...clearly. What do you think Well I mean just look at this postWhy do we keep using this stupid “demon” term?Says who? Sounds like dumb shit to me.Lol, better get some MBTI exorcisms on the sub thenI love stuff like this. ENTP.How the fuck was I supposed to know it was a song?Ohhhh, duh.ENTP here. Not a huge fan of psychedelics anymore except for maybe once or twice every few years when the “novelty” of it is renewed. Once I go into Ti analyzation mode I feel like I’m losing my god damn mind because its like trying to connect dots in an endless, infinite void.

I like Adderall. Blue, ENTP. Sort of me, sort of not. After reading through the colors I’d say I’m orange.Lmao if ENTPs are silly random people what exactly do you see in ENFPs?Lol, every ExxP cares about social convention. We just pretend we don’t.Right, which is why you ESFPs always parade around trying to get attention and desperately try to maintain a “easygoing, light hearted, funny guy/girl who is down to get CrAzzzZY” persona. 

Everyone cares to some degree about social convention in order to satisfy their desires and fit in. xxFPs just aren’t aware they’re doing it.Very intuitive of you ESTP!

/sENTP posts like this always make me cringe...This is something most thinkers would find annoying, ha.That movie ruined me for a solid week.I do the exact same thing. Do you mean abstract art? Because I’m an ENTP and I can’t stand the majority of abstract art. That’s just me, though. I like realism.Why do you INFJs always deflect criticism? This post is very much an INFJ thing, lol. This is an FJ thing in general.That’s not how cognitive functions works. You don’t change into a new personality, you simply grow into the one you have and become more well rounded.I’m an ENTP and “caring about myself” isn’t really something I would consciously relate to because it feels narcissistic to say that. It’s just not a sentence I would ever say in my mind. I just...am myself, lol.I don’t think this is true. I don’t understand how the mind would suddenly view the world in a completely different way and “turn” into something else. I think you need to do more research on cognitive functions.Lol, sorry if I offended you....but your view was just as rigid as mine. Who are you to make such a steadfast statement? I was only meeting you with the same rigidness....I never said that.That’s such a cool trait hahahaI don’t think I’ve ever seen a single image on this subreddit that summarizes ENTPs accurately.Ha! That’s awesome. I’m actually mentoring under a creative director right now.ESFJ or ESTP. God, what an ISTJ response.ENTP here. I like psychedelics when they’re in the “Ne” stage- aka, when I just focus on the cool novelty of them. If the newness/adventurousness goes away and I am in pure Ti analyzing mode...I feel like I’m losing my mind. It’s like my brain is trying to find a “rational” solution to an infinite puzzle (psychedelics) that has absolutely no rational solution to it. It gets super overwhelming. 

I prefer drugs that “enhance” my default self like Adderall, coke, coffee, etc.ENTP here-

Of all the things I have done, coke has been my favorite. We can’t help if people want to join in on the circle jerk, my friend.Fuck, that was dark...

...somebody save me!I don’t really feel this way with other NTs. I consider the majority of my friendships with other intuitive thinkers to be pretty genuine.Sounds like something an ISTJ would say.I have honestly never seen an ISTJ deal with interpersonal relationship issues in a productive/healthy way. They almost always seem to be self destructive in that regard and pretend they “don’t care” about the other persons opinions/words by simply throwing them away even though they clearly do care.

ISTJs are fantastic until you force them to confront something on an emotional and personal level, then it’s like they turn into little irrational children. See to me if a friend said I was “batshit crazy and annoying and narcissist” as a way of explaining my personality, I would automatically think “Huh. This person really doesn’t know me like I thought they did if that’s who they see me as.”

I’m definitely not a narcissist and I would never think of myself as “batshit insane” except in a superficial joking way, lol. I mean I am definitely annoying haha.Amen. I had an ISFJ roommate and all she would ever do was talk about what so-and-so did today or how she can’t believe this and this happened, etc. And she could do it for *hours*. She would talk about things that I wouldn’t even think to care about remembering.Incorrect.I don’t buy the “people randomly dislike you” bullshit. When I was younger I was so confused about why people disliked me, hated me, etc. and you know what I realized? It’s because I was annoying as fuck.

If a bunch of people dislike you then it’s time for self reflection about how you come across to others. People don’t just dislike you for no reason.Because the ENTP subreddit mods are currently in Nazi prison guard mode.Ha, really? I’m an ENTP and I also do this constantly. I wouldn’t have guessed him to be an INFP solely off of what he just said.Daydreaming just sort of happens by default for me. It’s not a conscious decision. I can’t imagine just...not daydreaming and not being in my head. Just “being” actually sounds sort of frightening to me.Lol no, I don’t have that.Because xNTPs- especially INTPs- don’t really care if something *sounds* nice or positive. It’s sad to you but it’s likely just a straight up humorous fact to them. They aren’t seeing these “sad” jokes through a moralistic/idealistic lens like you might be.

xNTPs don’t see emotions/beliefs like other types do. If they think a state of their existence is currently inferior, they might simply think it’s well...inferior- nothing more, nothing less. It is simply a “fact” of their logic and state of being. There is no use in getting worked up and freaking out over a “logical fact” in their mind.

Think of the thought process this way: “I procrastinate a lot. I need to stop procrastinating, damn it.” This is just a fact of who I am right now. If I said “I don’t really procrastinate” out loud, this would make me uncomfortable because it’s simply untrue. I do procrastinate, so why lie? Can it change? Yes. Can I work toward bettering my procrastination issues? Yes. But right now I do it a lot, and telling myself a bunch of positive warm fuzzy beliefs would just be untrue and illogical because simply believing something helps absolutely nothing. To think that I can somehow change all of that simply because of warm fuzzy beliefs is a self-absorbed, idealistic, and egotistical mindset that I simply do not possess. Who the fuck am I to blindly “believe” something like that when everything is telling me something different?

Make sense?Do I? Interesting. Didn’t know that.You need to be more detailed with your post. Some ESFJs I know get more done in a day than I do in a week, ha.INFx types in general tbhYou’re right, I probably would press that button...literally just to see what comes after.Of course the one commenter who says INFPs are more dramatic than INFJs is an INFJ. You guys seriously just can’t own up to your flaws, lol. It’s hilariously sad.ENTP here.

I think it’s interesting when people say ENTPs are random, unfocused, etc. For me almost every single thing I do and strive for is a lot more calculated and purposeful than others seem to realize.

My mind goes “Okay if I do A it will equal B which will most likely get us to C. How do we get to Z? Okay, for we have to get to D and then get over E but *remember* that J is gonna be difficult to get to so we need to find the solution to H and K first” etc.

However ENTPs can make it seem so natural and almost accidental that people think we just get to that point randomly, when in reality there’s a shit ton of thinking and calculating involved. I don’t know, I’ve never, ever considered myself a “random” person like others seems l think.“So does he really think I’m ugly?! 😡”Say that again?Ah, yes. FeTi.
I like the hearth&amp;home aspect of IFJs (And to a lesser extent EFJs). It complements my restlessness very well.  But actually don't do that. This is what people mean when they say that MBTI can get in the way. Forget all the typology stuff when dealing with interpersonal problems. Just ask him/her what's up. Forget all the typology and treat the person like an individual. When it comes to interpersonal issues, we're all more similar than different.As far as I can remember:

ESTJ: Tuck your shirt in and tell them they're perfect. 

ISTJ: He just talked like a robot as a he propositioned for sex. 

NTPs: Just find their underwear and remind them to bathe. Just take care of them. 

SFJs: Act like a baby that needs to be taken care of. 

INFP: Just listen to their bullshit. 

ENFP: They don't believe in destiny so tell them you can never be together and they'll do all the work. 

ENTJ: Just treat them like a big baby. 

ISFP and ISTP: Surround them so they can't run away. 

ESTP: Tell them you need a superhero

INFJ: Call them a slut. Tell them you're going to bodyslam them. 

ENFJ: Play some games. They'll say they hate drama; they love drama.

Can't remember INTJ or ESFP.INTP is the only type that could spend 2 years with that much doubt. Wow, someone's projectingWow, someone's an armchair psychologistBlaise Pascal, Thomas Aquinas, and  Tertullian are all I can think of, in terms of historical NTs


ESFJ because he reminds me of Pope FrancisI don't really care so I might just be defending my position against my better judgment: 

Fe is always trying to bring things into a  harmonious system. Maybe his unification of the crown and the faith is a reflection of that. &gt; Good at manipulating moods 

Yeah he nails that with Tommen and Margary. (Mar doesn't fall for it though because she's Fe dom too) I think this is an ETP thing. I absolutely hate this. Examples of ENTP-INFJ relationships based on CelebrityTypes:

Wolfgang Pauli - C. G. Jung (Pen pals)

Maria Moltzer - C. G. Jung (Dated. "Strong intellectual bong")

Rose McGowan - Marilyn Manson (Dated)

Salma Hayek - Edward Norton (Dated) 

Werner Heisenberg - Niels Bohr (Bohr seemed to be like a father figure to Heisenberg)

Socrates - Plato (Socrates spoke and Plato took notes and then later Plato began using Socrates as a character for the use of his own (Plato's) ideas. 

Bertrand Russel - Ludwig Wittgenstein (Russel thought he was going to mentor Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein turned out to be very independent)

Daniel Dennett - Sam Harris (Had a bit of a scuffle over free will) 

EDIT: They've got very different ways of coming at a problem. Those differences can be fascinating, creating more discussion.  Or they can be dividing.CT has him listed as INFJ. The function definitions are too narrow and mechanistic. The relationship calculator is too *a priori* to describe anything in reality.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpjOqSuKgUIBryan Garner claims that extro- came about to match up with the intro- in introversion.Oh hey, I made a video about precisely this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvy0Ybm8-9c

Cliffnotes if you can't deal with my presentation:

ENTJs focus on objective try to rid themselves and others of subjective influence. E.g. Aristotle's ethics which are very impersonal, Penn Jillette's firm belief in a universe that's still there even when we look away.

INTJs uphold the personal, man as the center of morality. More generally, they give themselves over to whatever they believe in. E.g. Nietzche's ubermensch morality, christopher hitchens's fierce polemics.

ENTJs are more interested in collecting facts than INTJs. E.g. Aristotle's interest in biology, while Heraclitus withdraws into his own mind. 

INTJs have a tendency to skip over the facts. Newton treats the center of a spherical object as its mass long before he could demonstrate that it was true. He just intuitively *knew*

boredfactual is all right for SensingPeople who are interested in typology tend to be High on Openness. People high on Openness tend to be N types, so there's just more of us for one thing. It creates a kind of echo chamber.Lol why are you being downvoted? I think you're right that Pe types are generally more open than Pi types. But I've never seen a study that's demonstrated that correlation, while I have seen ones that demonstrate a correlation between Openness and Intuition. Yep. There's not always fire where there's smoke. ENFJ. Somehow they listen to you with their whole bodies. SFJs always put me at ease, so they're easy to talk to  I thought that article was the weakest of anything CT has done. (Apart from their Burger King v. McDonald's analysis.) It basically claimed that similarity is what you want but didn't really go into why. Look up Michael Pierce on YouTube. That will give you an unsilly perspective.Trying to connect to my emotions. Not really.The cut from the same cloth is a celebritytypes idea from 2012. Did not start with pierce. No disrespect to Pierce, but I think it's important to know whose ideas are whose. Yep. It's the only test that consistently gives me ENTP. CT just typed him as INFJ. Take that as you will. I was thinking INTJ. He's very forceful and has a lot of interest in the individual. It's actually really useful advice. As you learn more, you realize how difficult it is to type anyone. The amount of analysis needed to type someone will become so large that you'll eventually stop doing it ubiquitously because it's so demanding. I've only just started these so all I've got so far is:

Rincewind: INTP

Twoflower: INFP
Took16 personalities test, got enfp, was convinced I was introverted, retook it, got entp. While not what I wanted, after reading the description I was convinced of it. I took it probably about two times more, getting enfp, but I am sure of being entp at this point.The Ne is strong in this one.I also wanna know how to show my type. Help plz 😖To the good old daaaaaa-aaaaaaayzEntp-Musical intelligenceMy reaction at first was that this doesn't happen to me, I wouldn't care. Then I remembered this story:When I was in sixth grade I scoffed at an idea for an essay paper about the role of women (or something similar) in ancient Mesopotamia because I figured that it was going to be hard to dig up information on a society that (I assumed) probably oppressed women (i.e. not much information 'cause they didn't care).

A girl whispered to her friend (not very quietly) that I was sexist. It stuck with me to this day, partly because I was labeled for that, but mostly because when I look back at it, other than my self biased explanation for it, that totally looked like a sexist bigots reaction. And there's no way for me to prove that I wasn't.

As for a reason why we appear to be that way? I think ExTPs having tertiary Fe leads to them not being very developed in the emotions of others (and how to avoid saying something hurtful), while still caring, especially when they're younger (as I was) when their Fe is less developed. I disagree that ExTPs take the most offense to it, I think that that trait would go to IxTPS, because they have inferior Fe, but since they are introverted I suspect they wouldn't be exposed to it as much as an ExTP because Extraverts have more opportunities to fuck up with their Fe in a way to hurt someones feelings
That thing for ENFPs that you mentioned happens alot with a cousin of mine who is an INTP, althought they are also tangents of some physics thing that peaked his interest.Legit happened to me too. When I first heard of MBTI I was like "Yup, I'm an introvert." then I took the 16personalities.com test and got ENFP. Took it again, convinced I was introverted. Got ENTP, read it a bit, liked it. Still took it again, got ENFP. After that I decided the test was unreliable and so I looked into the functions more and more and took other tests and I am most definitely ENTP. ENTPs in particular seem to have a rough time accepting that they are Extraverts. I have a cousin who i think might be ENTP and she at first thought she was introverted. Still not sure if she's ENTP or not but its the most likely from what I've seen.16personalities is a pretty bad website for testing. I like their descriptions but testig wise they labeled me ENFP 2/3 times, labeled my ESFJ mom an ENFP, and labeled two of my friends ENFPs where im almost sure their not.Dad: ESFP
Mom: ESFJ
Me: ENTP
Half-Brother: Not sure, maybe INxx?
Other family members that I'm close to on moms side: Cover basically every type except INTJ, INFJ, and ISFPShort answer: No you cannot, everyone has both Intuitive and Sensor functions, but one will be more so than another. 

Long answer: Tests are often helpful for sending you in the right direction, but I feel like the best way is just to read through the functions urself.
Saying that your IxFJ means that you have aux Fe. I think it might be better to start from scratch tho as stereotypes often get put on the j/p and the e/i when theyre only to refer to what order ur functions are in. Link to a guide for self typing here: 

https://reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4qfn5v/how_to_type_yourself_using_cognitive_functions/Usually I prefer to type them with functions myself. I hear celebritytypes is Okay, mostly just get feedback on how bad 16personalities is. They seem to use dichotomies too much rather than functions.Sounds like Fe. My understanding is while Fe does want to conform, they still have their own views. How that applies to this scenario is that you might be looking to others to justify your views when an Fi user (from what I understand) wouldn't feel the need for this. Just 'cause you don't change your mind based on what other people say doesn't mean ur not Fe. Thats more of a sign of poorly developed Fe, which an Fe dom hopefully wouldn't have

Tl;Dr sounds like Fe dom to me, Fe seeks the approval of others, but doesn't always change its views for them.I've read that off the description for 16personalities for them, not sure i agree with it tho. At least at my high school, most of my teammates are estp/esfps from what i've seen. ENTP- the kid who the math teachers always tells that one day not doing your hw isnt gonna work for you.The way that I take myers briggs
I believe in the individual function stack for each type, and everything else are just stereotypes that are very likely to not likely at all. Stereotypes often carry a negative connotation irl but in mbti i prefer to focus on the positive ones and just understand that these stereotypes DO NOT NECESSARILY apply to this XXXX. That is all, wish you luck on your journey with psychology!Aight some things in the post are somewhat vague, but I can agree with alot of the stuff that you wrote, as an ENTP. Our Ne allows us to see all sides of an argument (which makes us stronger debaters as our Ti looks for flaws in most arguments), also makes us hate details. The "bigger picture" thing is a pretty big stereotype of intuition. Our tertiary Fe makes us want to fit in and be nice to people etc., but if we're in a bad mood we're not taking any bullshit. Our Fe also makes it so that we want to talk to people and thus have many surface level friends but no1 that we connect with on a deep level.
While the things you said (repeating this) are somewhat vague, they do resemble that of an ENTP's functions. In fact, theres another post by an ENTP I read a long time ago about ENTP's being like the ultimate oxymoron or something. I'll link it once I find it.

EDIT- FOUND IT - https://reddit.com/r/entp/comments/33dg8l/entps_are_oxymorons/High school or college?
Entp, heavily agree with this but I'm only in high school so couldn't really brag if I wanted too
Everyone tells me that one day I'mma get stuck and not know how to study and I'mma just be screwed so I figured I'd check this post out 😂High Schooler here, not sure if it counts.
Don't study at all (classic ENTP). Figure I should probably learn how just in case college is too hard to do what I've been doing. Anyone with ideas for an ENTP with little to no focus leave solutions in the replies below! :D

A little context: I'm a junior right now, have had 3 AP classes in the past two years, but my focus is really bad, and as a result have not finished any of the three AP tests. I've passed all of them, but I think I can do better if I just finish them. Even if I get a 504 plan for ADD collegeboard is said to be really strict on extra time so I probably wouldn't get any. Last year I took APUSH (Many said it was the hardest AP class in my school, I think it was overhyped). We had 2 chapter outlines due a week, for most a chapter would be 2-5 hours, for me it might take 5-12 hours. Obviously this was not good, but I passed every quizz with ease, sooo? One of the quizzes I didn't even read the chapter, just listened to the lecture and got 80%

Tl;dr I usually either do or do not do my homework for classes and come out fine, but in case I ever need to, leave study tips for an ENTP who has never studied.Long quotes too pls??Not sure if I'm a regular buuuuuuuuuut....

Go for it.I think it would be like
First one is Ne dom
Second one is Ti dom
Third one is Si dom
Fourth one is Te dom
Fifth one is Se dom
Sixth one is Fe dom or Ni dom
Seventh one is Fi domI don't understand how any of this should disqualify you as an ntp? As an ENTP, I agree with most of these things (except 5, math has never been hard for me). 

Also, most mbti things seem like stereotypes to me, which can be used and are important (as they fill the vast majority of info on diff types), but are not end all be all. The most sure things in MBTI to me is how different types interpret information, and the rest are just the most likely result from that types "method".Oh Okay well in that case I'll go over each thing more in depth

1) sounds like auxiliary Ti, and I can somewhat agree with this. However, if it's a topic I'm not interested in/ have heard of it before, I have a hard time focusing on it. In arguments its nice to help me fine tune my own and dissect someone else is. 

2) Like you said, this is basically what Ne is like. It's mostly known for it's creativity, I've heard it's also used in finding and identifying patterns. Meanwhile, the creativity aspect allows my arguments and counterarguments to be somewhat out of the box. My Ne and Ti combined lead me to often remain cool and objective about an argument.

3) Socially awkward=bad at Fe (me as f)
But still wants to fit in=Also Fe (Also me as f)

Disqualifiers~
1) Ne could help you pick up on the patterns in body language subconsciously and understand (i think?) what mood someone was in. It could also (and more likely?) be Developed Fe

2)Yes, There is no wrong answer, only bad arguments. Ne + Ti in the works. As far as the cockiness goes, you should be open minded enough to accept that you might not predict every possibility every time

3) Again, probably Ne noticing patterns of what triggers that specific person or Fe in understanding how to create (and therefore disrupt) social harmony.

4) Tertiary Fe does that to someone. We like Fe alot but can never seem to grasp it so we want it more.

5) Mentioned earlier, if I'm not interested/bored by something it's gonna take alot to get me to pay attention
I can relate to this. Awkward ENTP, I like to hang out with people but I wish I was better at going from that friends in class stage to close friends stageFor me it manifests in me caring what other people might interpret something I say or do. Like if I say something and then am like "fml what if they think I meant __?" 

Or maybe you mean when I just say fuck everything and listen to my spotify playlist and think about shit?Damn, you need to show us some of your writing when sober then!I don't know this feeling but I need it and I need it now! 
Me now: *stubbornly waits for feelings*Idea generating process? Might wanna pickup an ENTP asap 👌🏽[Image](http://i.imgur.com/RdFJIzy.jpg)

Latino ENTP, 16 years old Si- I think Si would learn with instructions better
Se - would learn better with demonstration or by doing it

For me, the best way to learn is to understand why I need to do each step. Once I learn why, usually It gets pretty easy.
I talk to most people I know about it. Only person whos actuslly interested is 1 ENTJ friend...

Everyone else thinks im annoying as I slowly try to persuade them that its interesring... 😖Latino ENTP - I don't really care, I mean whats the worst he can do, deport me? ;)How can I achieve true, permanent, happiness?Yeah, was kinda expecting that, still would be worth a shot thoughEntp. Choir, football, 4 ap classes. Netflix binger. Usually just me doing dumbshit1. IXFP(?) Perspnally don't have too much in depth experience with Fi but it kinda sounds surface level with how they'd react to those sorts of situations. Also leaning towards INFP because of them reminding you of ENTP Friend.

2.  My first reaction was ESFJ, however it's throwing me off that I can relate to alot of this as an ENTP, with shared functions with both of them. Empathy can be seen as Fe or Fi, however i think Fi is usually more sympathy than empathy. Remembering seemingly miniscule details requires them giving that detail importance, which is Fi. Creativity is usually thought of as Ne, so one point towards ENFP, same with ice cooler, classic ENXP move. Lecture scenario shows (to me, at least) short attention span that Ne has.
Now, both ENFP and ESFJ have Ne and Si, but since you mentioned more events related to Ne(?) Than Si, that leads me to guess ENFP.
3. Although psychological issues potentially throws things off, I personally think I can relate to alot of her actions although my situation is somewhat off.  Sarcasm and pretend apathy kinda seems Ne + Ti, although any type enjoys using them, I always get a Ne vibe. Creative problem solving? Also seems Ne+Ti. Apartment cleanliness? ENTPs are usually known to be quite messy but I sometimes have a random urge to clean EVERYTHAAAANG which could potentially be binging Si. 

**Tl;dr**
1. INFP
2. ENFP
3. ENTP
Although I used "evidence", this is just my interpretation of your interpretation of their actions, and one of us can be wrong. So take this all with a grain of caution and good luck in your assessing them further.We need to test it.
What if you answer the questions and we guess your type?ENTP - Had a phase where I tried to use sej top (pre-lv30) alot, then I was obsessed with teemo (such is the bronze life) but other than that this is spot on for me, I mostly play supp thoYeah sometimes my humor gets out of hand and even I'd admit it was fucking terrible joke, but I can see how another intuitive would enjoy the type of conversations that Ne types find interesting.Well, I don't really know much about ISFPs, or have many conflicts with them, but I think it's safe to assume most of them would hate me. I'd sort out a few of the ones that don't hate me/have many conflicts with me, and then surround myself with them to run other things. I mean sure, I'd be limiting my options of most efficient/best people for the job, but they can communicate with those who are extremely good at their job for me, and I can just make overlord decisions. I think the world would most likely be filled with artists that I wouldn't necessarily like or understand, but if that's my situation i'd try to make the best of it, and hope that I can see the positives of their type more than the negatives (again, maybe I can, I don't know much about this type even though they're a big portion of the population)Quotes to me sounds Ni or Fi. However, I think someone with that as their dom function might also add or think about something on their own to add to it. While you don't know whether these people might actually be "deep" or just "hipster", I kinda get the vibe that they are trying to seem deep and cool and mysterious, which sounds like Fi or (more likely?) Ni that's lower on the function stack. What I meant was, Ni or Fi that is less developed so tertiary or maybe inferior? Such as XSXPs trying to get in touch with their Ni?Ah, yes, the hidden league. Forgive me brethren.

P.S. what hidden league thingy, and what rules?The main way that I can see an Fe dom being perceived as "fake" is having sympathy or empathy in two people on opposite sides at the same time. While obviously you can be being sincere to two people on both sides, they probably perceive it as your lying to one of them, being "fake" to save face or keep up relationships. Even if you do this, keep in mind that other people don't understand that as a motive and prefer to "stick to their beliefs".

As for how to not have people think that, idk really, if it were me I'd just ask them why and then try to explain what my motivations are better, try to be upfront about why I'm confused and make sure to let them know why I think that being empathatic or sympathetic to other people does not mean to be Phony, it's just trying to understand their side of things.I believe you, but not with 1 behavior alone. Im guessing you look at a bunch of their behavior and sum up your opinion, but I couldn't say that I have a friend who lies and expect an answer of mbti type from you without other information.Yeah, the main reason for this post is trying to keep the conversation going until you find a common interest, so I definitely relate 😅Basically me with an underclassman entp at my school 😂😂😂I dislike smalltalk too, but how do you skip small talk if you hardly know the persons interests? Like if I'm already close friends with the person i get to the meat of the convo, but idk if theyre gonna be like "wtf why are you talking to me, how did this come about?"I could see that working out as aux Fe is for conflict resolution. Quick question while we're here. Does Te take this same conflict as disturbing efficiency as a factor in their decisions? Something I've wondered about myself recently, even tho we have Ti vs Te I figured I'd ask.So, are you an INFJ? If so, what would be a good way to start a convo, intended to find common interests/etc., I have an INFP friend in school and I definitely see the first half on nearly a daily basis. I'll definitely try to focus in on that more, thanks!

Haven't tried the last part, I'm always sketchy on the last part. I never know if the other person is gonna be cool with it or like "wtf are you doing, too much feelz", or like awkward timing because I'm really bad at knowing when to do things. Basically, any tips on deepening convos?Wait, what's your point? 😉  
Like, be concise and get to the point when talking? Or ask them what their point is in convos?Thats good to know. I always get nervous when I'm talking to people and they don't seem to be interested. Don't wanna waste their time cause their too nice to tell me to stop. Any tips on telling when an INFJ actually isn't interested in convo/just needs to be alone? Ah, I see. Ill make sure to make my intentions clear.Oh, mb should've clarified, the too much feelz part was more for other mbti types. What i was trying to ask was reading when to open up, but I guess thats kind of hard to explain anyways 😅*leaves mid sentence* No, but I see this in a lot of my irl intp friends too, they might be interested even if I cant tell before talking to them.Will make sure to hit on any deceptive blind men i meet from this day forward.Probably the coworker who wants to know you outside of work, or starting a conversation at a party.Lmao your answers don't suck. It was a interesting read. Gives me a look into the infj mindset (I've never really talked to an infj irl) 
, In that particular scenario, it sounded like you had a good time? Like if you had the chance to do that specific event all over again, knowing that you'd end up having a good convo, would you do it? To me, those scenarios are a part of the reason I'd go to parties, for the chance that something like that might happen. Did it still feel draining even though you were having a good time, or do you feel drained after the convo more?Well, from what I understand Fe users put an emphasis on conflict resolution where Te doms on efficiency and such. My thought process is even though I really like arguing with people, i often will hold back (Tert Fe?) Because I reason to myself that it'll disturb the efficiency.  
Like, after a debate, maybe you win, but you also could create conflict with the other person, making any collaboration less likely.  
Say, for example, you're working on a group project. Someone says an idea that you could get behind, you like it 80%, but you think you have a better idea, that you like 100%. Obviously you voice your idea. But the other person doesnt like it.   
But my question is, as a Te user you could see arguing for your idea as less efficient, because it'll create conflict in the group, distracting from ANY goal? Or I could see them (Te users) arguing that through the argument they'd establish their role as a leader in the group, allowing them to keep control and make sure things are done properly?  
Now that I wrote this all out I can see Te users going with the second one more but since I already wrote it all out, I'll leave it for you to read 😂😂.House of Cards, (Main Char).  
The Originals (A spinoff show of the vampire diaries, which you could check out as well. Klaus (ENTJ) is not the main character in Vampire diaries, but he is in The Originals).  
Suits (tho you already watched it)    
Dark Matter (Two, I think was her name? One of the main characters, idr her name because It's been a while.)Yeah its pretty cheesy for most of the first episodes. Imo, it got better but i don't really mind it in the first place so maybe I just stopped paying attention to it. Klaus gets introduced in season 2, and I think the fake romance kinda goes down a bit there?   
But yes, you can watch The Originals without Vampire diaries. There may be a lot of context behind some of the characters (who fucked who over before, etc.,) but for the most part I'm sure you'll catch up pretty fast.I see XSTPs being more of a secret ops type of soldier though. I see most good soldiers as more XSTJs, willing to carry out orders, doesn't mind (even prefers) structure.Bullshit=structure? (As a Pe dom this is the main reason I could see myself not liking being in the military, being forcefed rules could be frustrating but a good experience for me?)Yeah, I just meant that I could see ESTPs being extremely good at it, as it requires more attention to surroundings and other things that I think an ESTPs functions would cover more evenly. Its (from what I understand) a job that requires flexibility yet still observant.So, I agree with everything except for the not enjoying starting debates part (I do kinda agree tho).  
So I'll generally avoid starting debates with people Idk too well cuz I don't want ppl to think me debating is a personal attack on them, and ruin a potential Friendship. However, sometimes I'll get in these hyper-Ne modes where I just want to argue about anything, and I might nitpick at small things (so by saying this, did you mean this? Even though I kmow they didn't and I guess thats cringey af but...). Also, I love arguing with someone when they try to state their opinion as fact, or ridicule people with a diff opinion. Maybe its a power trip of bringing arrogance (my biggest pet peeve, although if its in a comedic intent I love it.) Back down to Earth.-People who go out of their way to talk shit about other people (If it comes up and ur like "meh sometimes I don't like when they do this" then im chill with it)  
-Mother. Fucking. Hypocrites. (Ironically, I'm hypocritical for hating hypocrites). Clarification on my use of the word hypocrite, cuz I learned it like this even though it's not the right word and Idk what is the right word: when person A criticizes person B for something that person A does just as much, or more than person B. Usually told to person C in a criticizing manner. I kmow this could be considered a Tu Quoque logical fallacy (i.e. for me to say that someone is in the wrong for doing this) but it still annoys me to no end.
-I know you already said this, but I want to second people who see things black and white, stating their opinion as if other people are just too dumb to understand that its the right way to think about things, and not willing to listen to why there could be another way of seeing things.  
-People who think they're better than others. As if another human being is not worth speaking to solely because of an attribute they fail to possess (I understand if you're busy and can't talk to someone, or you don't want to talk to someone hitting on you because they're not attractive).So most of the list is incredibly Pe dom. At first I was thinking ESTP, but it could be ENTP as well. Both are interested in different experiences, but entrepreneur is the most stereotypically ENTP thing ever (not that thats a bad thing). I would say that compulsive liar and psychopaths could be any type though, just maybe for different reasons, so they dont have much to do with mbti.  
I'm gonna go with my gut feeling of EXTP.1. Fuck the stereotypes.  
2. If I know anything about being an Ne dom, patience is not our strong suit.  I'm only patient cuz of tert FeFe makes you want social harmony. Patience is sometimes required for this, especially when you know someones in a terrible mood and logic might not be the best solution. You/we've had to develop it because it's a tert function, meaning we value it but are not naturally really good at it.Most of the time, you're right. But stereotypes are not defining and some people might treat them like they are.   
Thats all I meant when I said thatIm saying that a common thing with mbti is because people say "oh you can't be XXXX because you do this action and XXXX'S never do that" when in reality that's just a stereotype and every type is capable of doing most things. I'm saying they are stereotypes, not definitive things. So it's not necessarily the stereotypes that I was complaining about, but the assumption that what really are only stereotypes must be attributes that a certain type can or cannot show/do.Like which functions? I think all the perceiving functions give creativity (Ne, Ni, Se, Si), just in diff ways, and then the judging functions might give some kind of focus on what that creativity is used on.  
  
So, Ni and Si might be creative in their own world, because they don't need access to external things to use their creativity (and since Si is not usually thought of as a creative function, I found this https://mbtidatabase.tumblr.com/post/120611758181/si-doms-are-creative).  

Ne and Se respond to in the moment things with quick responses, which in its own way is creativity. Oftentimes this will be in creativity to alter or mess with our immediate environment.   
  
Te and Ti creativity is usually more due to a perceiving function, but what they have to offer is usually concentrated on certain goals. For Te, if they set their mind on a goal and there is a spot missing, they'll solve by brute force or a more creative outlet. Ti will usually be creative in trying to create a new system.  
  
Fe and Fi are also more due to a perceiving function, and Fe would use creativity (from the perceiving functions) to fix issues that might fuck with the social harmony (im sorry if this is super stereotypical but seating arrangements for an event? Person A can't sit next to person B, C, or D...), And Fi would focus their creativity more on creating something to represent something that is important to them.  
  
Tl;dr this is probably what you wanted to hear: usually Fi doms and Ne doms are considered very into creative things, so the most creative type would probably be ENFP or INFP. That being said, all types are pretty creative, so yeah. Do with that what you will and all that shiz.As long as it's not Margaret you'll be fine. Don't trust Margaret.Well doesn't Fi value authenticity? Like I can use mbti to be able to read ppls intent better and whether or not their genuine with their actions, therefore mbti helps read authenticity in ppl? Idk I got a lotta ESFP friends and they're usually just not to into it man but you can try it. I feel like it's not even that they don't like it, they just don't listen long enough because it doesn't sound fun or exciting.  
And if you bring it up a lot she's probably going to dislike it more and more because it'll feel like your trynna force her to listen to it.Here's the thing about the leadership part: I feel like if Leadership being taken is done in any kind of challenging or rude way I feel like the ESTP and ENTJ would react the same? Do you agree or do you think you could walk through the differences?Well cause of the part where you said if you lose control it's not the end of the world but if he does he gets hella agitated?  
I was saying in most scenarios where your losing control or something, it's usually (not proven but I'm going with it)  in a somewhat competitive form. I was saying if there was some kind of confrontation involved, would the ENTJ and ESTP smack down the same or would they both get mad but still be sorta different?One mistake that I think I made a lot and you could be making, is maybe we're telling them the parts about mbti that we enjoy first? We should tell them the parts we think/know they'd enjoy first but what parts would that be? What would be the most attractive aspect about mbti to each type.Fi kinda likes to be admired tho. Like kinda low-key flatter them a lil, not in an obvious way but just genuinely compliment some of the ways they add their own flair to things (if you say something you don't mean and they realize it could turn out worse), knowing that they are appreciated could go a long way towards them listening to you?Tl;dr at beginning cuz reasons: I like mbti alot. You like mbti alot. Why can't other people like mbti alot? I don't think it's always just that they wont like it or see its uses: I think its how I present it.

So, thoughts on best way to present this clusterfuck of information to newbies? I've talked to a LOT of people about it, and the only ones who've been interested are either family, or one ENTJ friend at my school who already heard it.

I've thought maybe about tryna appeal to their dom function (I have an idea for type for most people I know), but I feel like I need to learn more about functions to find what appeals to what types.

I've thought about trying to explain it in purely the dichotomy form because thats the way I first learned it, and its much more simple... but I feel like I would later tell them that thats all wrong and theyd be like "wait... what?"I've always been interested in philosophy, then when I learned of mbti last year I was curious how philosophers of different mbti types differed. I never looked into it, and now wondering this (the titles question), I figure I probably won't look into it, but I figure I'd pose the question.

Tl;dr Best school of thought to sum up each mbti type below, maybe a quick 1 or 2 sentence description/summary as well would be appreciated, thanks!Curious on your thoughts on how to start and continue conversations with each mbti type, whether irl, through social media, etc. Of course this can't be a be all end all exhaustive list, we're just brainstorming 😅Considering functions and values, what would be the most lucrative part of it? This post is based off a comment in another threadSometimes the way they phrase goals and general conversations can give you a lot of hints.  
It is easier said than done, but a lot of it is just practice. When you do find one's mbti type, really hone in on the mannerisms in their convos for future typings.So the way I like to think of tert functions is as your nondominant hand where your first is your dominant hand. As an ENTP, I like to use Fe but I'm pretty clumsy with it and if we try to use our third function all day we will get pretty tired of it and mess up a lot of stuff. Regardless, because we like to use it we can end up in a tert loop in which you just rely on your first and third functions, which doesn't really help because your second function is clutch in helping your first function get what it wants, and your third function... Well... Isn't. Eventually you find ways of developing your third function though and when you do it's a great time, but focusing on that alone and just ignoring ur second makes alot of problems.R/woosh ?A good friend of mine in hs who's an ENTJ told me one time he asked someone if they were ready for the test and they started crying, he didn't know what to do so he ran away
INTP chaotic neutral as wellINTJI've been rather antisocial, like you they piss me off, I avoid answering my emails because 'leave me alone' for the most part of my life. I'll have random periods of time (like 3 summers ago) where its like "yay party, drugs, people." but for the most part I'm analytical and live on the internet, spending my time "flattening out my thoughts" ,delving into new topics, trying to come up with a new idea, and sharing interesting parts with my few select friends, occasionally drinking and smoking weed with my roommates.

Making a career for myself is my main goal right now, however since I'm so young (21) it seems that perhaps partying and fucking around would be more in my interest.

Edit: oh ya, I also have like an unlimited amount of emotional and mental problems, so ya gotta deal with that.... O_OI've asked this question to people before and I get different answers everytime. , they think I'm weird, they think im crazy, they think im smart, they think im attractive, they think im confident, they think im arrogant, they think im funny, they thing im an average joe. One answer from a person I know I'd accept the most is they defined me as just "chaos" I like that one lmao.

I even asked my closest friends the ones that know me the best and they say "You're just.... FueledUp, there isn't any other way to describe you."

Whatever the fuck that means.

really no fucking clue, manThey are awesome, I like saying random as fuck shit to them and see how they react.Heartbreaking, when my friend wasn't as interested in some philosophical concept as I was while we were drunk, (ya i dont really get heartbroken..)

Heartwarming, When my old friend said he had good memories of me in the past
I see. So just do it essentially? To explain what you are saying, you need to understand the functions of both types:

INTP
Ti
Ne
Si
Fe

INTJ
Ni
Te
Fi
Se

To explain your first part about INTJ's being more materialistic, is due to their Ni and Te. They are practical, in comparison to INTP, Due to Te making them do something because it has a practical application. Ni is about mastering one big idea, while Ne is more about multiple ideas. While both types can be scatter-brained, INTP's tend to be more scatter-brained and unorganized due to Ti-Ne, which is all about analyzing multiple ideas at once. This is why the INTP might not focus as well when it comes to one topic. Ne is also all about creating smaller ideas while Ni is one big idea. INTP have a desire to understand everything, which is backed up by Ti, while INTJ are much more goal-oriented, and will not venture into things that distract them, unlike the INTP. INTP like to branch out due to Ti-Ne, and this is why they are considered lazy by many, as they don't focus on the primary objective, unlike Te-Types. Also Fi and Fe differentiate the two types. INTJ's have a larger Ego due to Fi, and this in some ways, makes them arrogant and less likely to accept others ideas, while the INTP's Ne will want more ideas. INTP's inferior Fe is what makes them socially incompetent by most people's standards, while the INTJ uses Te as a means of communicating. INTP spend more time in their head, due to I, which is less about talking unlike Te, and more about thinking analytically in their heads. This is why most consider INTP's to be the most introverted type. INTJ's are more materialistic due to Te, because they view it to be practical, unlike the Imaginary ideas INTP's make.

But don't take this for granted for every INTJ and INTP you meet, they aren't 100% their type anyways.

To put it simply, INTJ's Fi, Ni, and Te causes them to focus on Practical, Goal-oriented, and Achievable ideas, while the INTP's Ti and Ne makes them focus on ideas for the sake of it, and therefore branch out into "impractical" ideas.

Ni and Te are easily the best at Chess.

Ni is about creating the Plan, while Te is the idea if executing it.

That is basically what Chess is about. Strategic Thinking

INTJ are the most ideal due to being more patient than ENTJ's.

But first you'd have to learn the rules to understand how to make a good plan.

Te is probably a must when it comes to playing Chess however, as that is important for the objective nature of Chess. Ti is more about analysis and Ne is more random and unpredictable. But Ni is far better for Chess when it comes to winning, as a Plan is better than no Plan.


  He's most likely discussing Scientific Intelligence. And that's how I'm approaching it as well.I meant like Characters

But Interesting pointI find no types the original deus ex characters howeverBob Page is an ENTJ . The God-Wannabe idea is more of a Te-dom Trope.

Paul Denton is INFJ. His Fe is obvious by his interest to prevent One-World Government.

Tracer Tong is xNTx: I'd lean on INTJ due to his tech-genius and way of spying on JC. But his idea to destroy Networks sounds more ENTP , along with his inventions. 

Morgan Everett is INTJ

DeBeers is INTJ: Inferior Se should be pretty obvious 

Alex Jacobson is an INTP, read his description and you'll see why I put I over E

Walton Simons is ESTJ

Gunther Hermann: ESTx, leaning towards ESTP due to his interest of fighting

Anna Navarra: ISTP
Maybe. That Fe can change everything thoughThat's more his Ti-Ni, wanting answers, if that is what you mean by his "Te"Hugh Darrow is a complex typing however

His actions are either Fe or Fi motivated.

The game seems to suggest he did it out of Envy, and he talks about how it's important to have a moral compass. Seems more Fi to me.

The entire idea of Mechanical Augmentations and how he got the idea, sounds more like No, because it's a bigger idea. Also his research with the Illuminati and his plot, tells me Ni.

He talks about the idea of having the will to do something, which suggests Te. 

His Se is shown, by him being envious that he can't have the infinite power of mechanical augmentation(I had to).

INTJ seems most reasonable. Any thoughts?


Gary Savage is also hard to type. He seems like an INTP though. His Inferior Fe would explain his earlier lack of concern for when he worked with MJ12. Also he seems more Ti-Ne, than Te, as he doesn't seem to be as much about leading, as he does figuring out the technology.Jensen is no EN, that's for sure.

He lacks the enthusiasm , caused by inferior Fe and lack of Ne. He's basically Batman with augs(Minus the INTJ Title). He may be an ISTJ, but the fact he is more improvised, tells me ISTP.  But back to the topic at hand.

What is the type of the MKD Characters?

One of the issues with MKD is the lack of new characters. Well there are some, but not many.

Rucker: ENFJ: He's archetypal ENFJ, no need to explain him

Marchenko: ESTJ:  He's Te dom and has Si, along with Fi, which is what makes extremist.

Miller: Hard to type, But ESxJ

Alex: ENFP?

Fletcher: ENTP?

Brown: ENTJ?

You can extend from hereI just watched the Youtube Movie.

Managed to figure out any other characters?Inferior Ne. An EN would not be in his situation. Adam was a security guard, something an EN is not going to end up as.Bale is more ISTJ. He's way of doing things seems more oriented around Enforcing the Law. He'a called the Dark Knight after-all. His Si is his code of Honor that he was taught, not learned.  Affleck is ISTJ with OCD Problems. He keeps having thought-patterns of Superman doing bad things. He assumed this based on just one encounter with him. That's OCD.I don't think so. Just look at how he and Joker interact(ENTP).  Joker knows Batman follows rules, and wants him to break them. Batman thinks Joker is crazy and criminal. This is how an ISTJ views Criminals. I'm not saying INTJ's don't, but it's more of an ISTJ trope due to Si. Besides, Bruce had no idea what do at first, he was upset and tried to kill Joe, and then face Falcone to tell him there's justice, and then he became a Criminal for sometime in Asia. That's not a plan like he had in the Comics. The only reason he becomes Batman is because Ra's finds him and teaches. If he were an INTJ, he would have found Ra's instead, due to having a vision of Batman(Ni). See the difference?https://zombiesruineverything.com/2014/02/18/mbti-the-dark-knights-istj-versus-the-comics-intj/Why so?Because they are considered by many to be the most desired typeIxFJENTP?Endermen sounds more like ISTJ. They are the troops of the DragonI suppose that INTP's would do thatI see. ENTP are all about ideasMaybe we should a 5th letter : Augmented/HumanINFJA?Se Inferior for youThere'a always the collective mind ideaYou could just make your brain connect to the Internet and gain large amount of information. Neural NetworkWhy not make a Dimension for storing information that is unaffected by external influences?I see, but how is Trinity an INTJ?

And is Smith therefore in a Te-Ne rut?But think about it

A: They are introverted and don't really speak
B: They are ruthless and don't really care for emotions. They scold incompetent agents.
C: they don't question job
D: they are direct and routine Those scripts are from a past source, similar to SiSame could be said for an ISTP or ISFP, besides she seems to fast-paced to be an INTJ(at least to me). Her Ni seems more Tertiary to me, and the maintaining relationships despite problems seems more inferior Fe to meI can see that, but can't the program itself update and adapt, and since the agents are part of the program, them too?

Si is all about updating to the environment, and while they may be programs, they are still products of the environment. That's what Si is aboutTechnically, everyone in the Matrix has a pre-defined purpose. Neo is suppose to be what he is, so is everyone else. Plus if you add in the entire Real World is another layer of the Matrix idea, then everyone is a certain purpose for sure. 

The idea of assigned purpose is much more Si than Ni.I think you over-estimate Neo's importance within the Matrix Universe. The entire idea in the later part of the Matrix is that everyone within it has a purpose, he's no "christ" Figure. Arguably, he's only "significant" because Morpheus thought so. The only reason he realized something wasn't right about the Matrix was because of his intuition, and remember, he's not the only one who escaped, so he isn't special in that respect. The people, despite being programmed, still maintain some personality. The purpose of the movie to let the viewer know that everything might be a simulation, not that Neo was something special. Besides, Neo is still a product of the Matrix, so he's bound to have a personality of some sort, and INTP fits best of all the types. I guess if you want to think about it differently, Thomas Anderson is an INTP, while Neo is just his purpose.If you think about it, nothing matters. Rules only exist because we made them. Like your fears and panics, it's only a product rather than a reality. But the Architect implies that the machines can learn, as he says they are become more efficient each timeThere's nothing wrong with nuking an entire country therefore, if you remove rulesBut everyone is assigned a purpose that naturally do no matter what But a predestined purpose is more related to the environment it's created in. I'm not saying this is true, but I think an Ni-user would not believe in the idea of predestination as much as an Si-User because Ni wants to create a purpose that is separate from the Predestined one while Si will accept the Predestined purpose.  Exactly my point.

Also Wisecrack mentions that Neo is no different from anyone else, as he just has a different purposeReally?

Their real purpose already exists, therefore they could just fulfill that one.

Also I don't think we completely understand NiI just don't get the INTJ Vibe from her. Take Batman, a INTJ who does arts. He has a leader-like position, he's strategic, and makes plans. I haven't seen Trinity do that. Because Batman plans and Trinity doesn't, I don't think your argument works. I'm not saying INTJ's have to plan, but the trope exists for a reason.Yes but even then,  she's more Si than Ni. It's kind of obvious that you shouldn't go face agents, everyone says it. She's just enforcing that fact. Therefore ISTJ sounds more reasonable.I see your point, but the Matrix is more than an "action" movie. It's suppose to invoke an idea. The action is cool don't get me wrong, but I watch it much more for the Philosophy. I'd find it strange to make the character that blank when he's suppose to be a Christ Figure. Also, as Smith gains more emotion, Neo becomes more emotionless, so he isn't completely devoid. I see your point, but the movie itself is designed to show the difference between what is the truth, and what is a lie. Why would Oracle tell Neo to "know thyself"? Neo clearly can relate to many people in the quest to know one's self, and I'd argue that to be a trait. There's other examples, but you get the idea.



Also as for the typing process, none of this is set in stone, it's up for debate. 

I get you don't like your type being ruined, but this is hardly the place to fixate on that
But she may be future-oriented, but you'd be stereotyping if you argued that was only N-types. If any other cared to, they could also plan for their future or orient towards it. Also I'd say she's more Fe due to her being more defensive of her crew-mates, and because I think she values being in a group.

http://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-X35VNB2X

Thanks for taking the SurveyMiller is not ENTJ. His position and interests fit the Te-Si better. He takes orders and he is an underdog to Manderley, an ISTJ. Also he never showed Ni, especially with his organization.

Talos could be INFP, but he still strikes me as a ENFJ. He'a a Leader after-all, and you could argue he has inferior Ti in his arguments as well. 

Pletcher is no INTJ. He has more Ne than Te. He talks in a more Ne-backed Approach. He's kind of like Geordi from Star Trek TNG(who is not an INTJ for sure). As for the type he is, I'd say ENxP.

I see your point. Defensiveness is definitely a Fi Trait more than Fe. I think that since INFP and ENFJ both leading with feeing and have inferior thinking, there are similarities.

How about Nathaniel Brown?

I'd think ENTJ, since the only reason he was against the Human Restoration Act was because he'd lose Money, indicating a Te-Ni way of thinking.

Delara is strange, INFJ/ISFJ gone bad would be my best guess. She uses Fe manipulation more than Te.

Marchenko is an ESTJ. He is a Radical Leader(Te) with a past he can't let go of(Si-Fi). He also takes orders from the Illuminati(Si) and is unaware of Brown's True intentions(Si), and he has a vision of a free world for augmented(Ne).

Janus is an INTJ. That means if the theory is correct, Volkard is an INTJ. 

He certainly reminds me of Gunther, a ESTP, but he seems more serious and commanding, indicating Te over Se-TiAll the gamesWhich type is each Minecraft Mob?Post belowWhat do you think?Neo: INTP turned INFJ(in other two movies)
Morpheus: ENFJ
Cypher: ESTP
Oracle: INFJ
Trinity: ISTP


Agent Smith:
This is an interesting one, but let's see.

Takes Charge of team: Te
Dislikes the Matrix: Fi
Rouge/Independent: Ni
Is more ruthless: Se

INTJ or ENTJ?
Preference towards INTJ

Why?

When he talks to Morpheus in the first movie about humans being a Virus(Ni pattern), and wanting to escape the Matrix(Fi), he seemed to be in a Ni-Fi loop. His agents(ISTJ's) scolded him for not performing his duties(Te).

One could say he is also in a Te-Se rut in the other movie, but he justifies it, saying he wants to "destroy the system" because he thinks it's bad, which therefore implies it's in his head rather than his outer world.

What do you guys think?Hi, running a survey to see if there's a correlation between MBTI and Planets:

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2ZQ92MK
Ritalin is a hell of a drug.I have a cousin-in-law who's ESFP and we get along just fine. Other than that, I prefer them in short bursts.TEEPEES, THEYRE ON TO US!!!!I'd give her XSXP, and if going by four letter dictotomies, I'd assume I over E. However, I don't know wether that Ji manifests itself as Ti or Fi. It's definitely the former in the books, so I'll go with the hunch and say **ISTP** for the show as well, but open to other interpretations.

PS, Anyone wanna type the actor, Maisie Williams? I've heard everything from EXFP to ESFJ and even ENTP. I'm hoping someone who knows her well enough can do so.So basically EXTX.

TEAM TYPE-A-ALPHA MALE SQUAD.It does help.

*A lot.*Ultimately, the MBTI is a theory and nothing else concretely, so trying to prove anything with a form of logic is going to still render it a theory. I'm not really shitting on you here, I'm just laying out the situation for all of us.

But anyway, of course the cognitive functions are flawed to some degree, there's no amount of actual science to ground it's truth, so any abnormalities has to be explained pseudo-scientifically, regardless if it's true or not.

That being said, it's of my opinion that the common way of stacking functions make sense as opposing functions are inversal, it's like adding 1 and -1 to get X=1 where X is personality. There is nothing there unless something filters it to make it happen.

Also, the tests are shit for the most part, unless your using it as a basis to start looking for your own type, which is followed by introspection and beginning to understand the theory.

That's my two cents though, but as long as your not saying that the earth isn't round or gravity doesn't exist, we're all good here.Nah.

Relationships and MBTI can come together as explaining how the other person works, to some degree, but that's it. Just because I'm an ENTP doesn't mean I can't have a relationship, romantic or otherwise, with an ISFJ, or my functional opposite, ESFP.

I actually find both very pleasant company.And ENTP could be the clowning, habitual shit-slingers of the world that is man's cousin: chimps!I kinda self-implied that they are the 2nd most intelligent animals known to humankind.

Shit-slinging was a double entendre for mudslinging, because of our (apparent) sassiness.800m sprint, 8x4 relay, Pole Vault and sometimes I did the 400m sprint and 4x4 relay as a replacement. Ended up getting 2nd in my region behind another teammate in the 800m sprint and we got 1st in the region for 8x4 in my senior year.

We then proceeded to completely flop at state.

Still fun though.Too much groupthink in today's society. It's bounded by fear and self-deprication and its disguised as being apart of or being "proud" of being a part of a sociocultural group. People are afraid to be themselves as individuals because most people seem to hate looking at the mirror in their head, so they find comfort in things that are "bigger than they are."

But thanks to greater interconnectivity, the whole world is slowly moving their cards away from their chest and showing everyone what they are. Ironic, since this modern age is one of the most peaceful and non-tense eras of human history.

TL;DR: The world and 4-chan are slowly becoming less indistinguishable, and it's scary as fuck.

I would say I'm this as an ENTP, but I think this applies to all XXTP types the most, EXTPs even more so.I'll look into it!ENTP - Am going for dual major in Journalism (main major) and Political Science ("assistive" major.)

First year of college starts in less than a month for me. Super exited, and I figured that the two degrees (mainly Journalism) are rather compatible towards me (disregarding MBTI.) Informational, flexible, and you get to explore a lot. Fun!Moderate Progressive-Libertarian, ENTP.

Let's put it like this: I am not a cultural conservative by any stretch of the imagination.I can't really eat a majority of veggies without gagging, but other than that I really am not that picky when it comes to eating. 

I'm really a person that more or less will eat just so I can get one of my three meals in for the day than I am to actually "enjoy" eating for comfort or etc. I can imagine iNtuitives being more like this than Sensors, but I can't say for certain.

If I did eat a lot more for comfort or taste, I'm pretty sure I would eat Popeyes 24/7.Something that I would like to point out is that emotions can come from a perceiving axis (so iNtuition/Sensing) as well as the judging axis (Thinking/Feeling.) Even though I have Fe as my tertiary and Si as my inferior, I think the latter tends to bring out more emotion in me than the Fe./r/shittymbti paging in here.

ESTJs are the most literally thick-skinned. ENTP's only equal in measure because they are hardly even listening to you over the bomb ass party inside their head.Simple: Take a couple online tests, look at the results, and then just start getting into it more and more by reading up content and talking to people. Once you understand the theory at a concrete level, contemplating the abstractions become easy.

Anyone who is trying to say "LEARN THE FUNCTIONS FIRST" are really forgetting the fact that functions are rather abstract, and people are not going to ease into them very easily. Let them understand and fall in love with the basics first before even introducing cognitive functions, or your going to leave them brain-numb to the whole theory.

I wouldn't teach someone political theory by explaining the differences of how Market Socialism and Georgism distribute resources, instead I'd show them how their nations main political parties reflect different basic ideologies, such as liberalism, conservatism, socialism etc, and then branch off from there.I wasn't even really aware of this, to be honest.

Honestly, I don't really consider myself arrogant as much as I am just content with my life and I like to have a little fun with myself. Kinda like a reverse form of "taking the piss" out of myself if you will. I can assume that's what a lot of ENTPs like to do as well.

Also, thick-skin and confidence kinda go hand-in-hand, don't they?
Is "INTJ" just some forced-apon Orwellian PIN code you have so that it can deindividualize you in whatever totalitarian hellhole that you live in?You could just play some Paradox grand strategy games during your free-time. I'm sure that would suffice your appetite, dominating the weak, engineering a nation to efficiency and success, marrying your granddaughter after killing her mother because the mom was going to take the throne for herself and cause a civil war, the whole deal.Maybe you just want to be an old librarian and haven't realized until now?

Get it during a deal, next time would probably be the Steam Christmas Sale but you never know. Paradox have a shit-ton of DLC for their games (but it's actually pretty good quality most of the time) so the price stacks up.

Crusader Kings is a bit more friendly with the learning curve than say Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron, but it's still a climb. Play around with it and you'll catch on to the base mechanics in 1/2 weeks.[There is also Stellaris, which takes place in space.](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris)

It has a lot of 4x (aka, Civilization) elements like equal starts and building from the bottom up as well as some paradox grand strategy elements like advanced economy and ideology mechanics. I would say if you think CK2 might be daunting, I'd recommend giving Stellaris a try.Am I the only one who didn't score on the green/left-libertarian quadrant?

Anywhom, I think I was about a -7 on the libertarian scale, but only around a +1 on the economics scale, so purple/right-libertarian. Also, am ENTP

I'll retake it sometime later to update you all.I've should've reworded the drugs thing. I don't like drugs/alcohol because it messes with your thoughts. I like being sober because I know that what I'm experiencing is true. That, and I hate the idea of being dependent on something. Finally, it just never works economically from what I've seen from other people. The phrase I used, "noble," was a word that I used from the top of my head and I suppose I just unconsciously went with it.

I understand that Fi tends to work as a "moral compass," and the more traditional emotional aspects tend to come a bit more from Fe than Fi. I'm not disagreeing with you, but it's probably helpful to know my information on the MBTI theory.&gt; You definitely give a very ISxP vibe in the way you explore your intuition.

Could you add more to this?&gt; BTW doing a sport is a very good idea for you since it's going to calm down that Se.

Is that where that meditativeness comes from? Huh. I've never seen MBTI being used like that (even though it does apparently happen,) but if I was fired just because of what a pseudoscientific test told me, I don't think I'll have nice words to say about whoever authorized it.ISTP

* People that make things more than what they really are.
* People that make something completely out of nothing.
* People that try too hard to be something they're not.
* People who are unapologetically biased and profound.
* People who are inconsistent without reason.
* People who won't leave others alone with no good reason.
* People who eat pizza with a knife and fork. Seriously, if you do that, **go fuck yourself.**&gt; blot 

You mean...like...*dry it off?*...

http://giphy.com/gifs/optical-illusions-asap-science-aZ3LDBs1ExsE8My gif still stands.Holy hell, I used to identify as XNTP but this solidified my typing. Thanks!ISTP

Narcissistic, duh. He's also a bit of a man-child, has no cool head whatsoever. Not really made to be a politician if you look at him from that angle.

However, he's a good businessman, and that has shown in the election. His merchandising, use of rhetoric, and his use of social media has REALLY helped him get his message across. I don't think he is racist as much as he know what sells, and racism is selling like hot cakes right now. However, that doesn't mean he is a good person. However, I do think that he is sexist, at least more so than the average population.

Ultimately, with the lack of support in Congress and his obvious obliviousness of how government works (he wants to "run it like a business" when government has too many checks and balances to make that possible) he'll end up being a lame duck, with probably a shadow government consisting of Trump's confidants/cabinet and them ending up picking up his pieces and forming him as a de-facto figurehead.

I'm not voting for the guy. The only reason I'm voting for Johnson is because I want the Libertarians to get 5% of the vote and get that 20$M in federal funding so they can break the ice of the two-party duopoly and moderate the Democrats and Republicans, which I think how the two parties have set up an echo chamber to radicalize themselves more and more is the main reason why we are in this election in the first place.I've been recently been looking up Diogenes, and the dude was fucking hilarious. If they had the "Thug Life" meme back in Ancient Greece, I'm sure the Dog would've been used for at least half of them.&gt; We'd be overwhelmed with NTPs.

Instead of being overran with political correctness, we would be overran with technical correctness.

Fine with me.Logic and Pattern Recongition are seen as buzzwords for Ti and Ne respectively. Not being dismissive, but it could explain somethings.I can't believe people still discriminate over a pseudoscientific theory that tries to fixate the most liquid thing that we know in the universe.

That's like some Nazi shit right there.Double barrel glock?"He's not timid and emotionally unhealthy, therefore can't be INFP."

Out of the three INFPs I know, only one can be described this way. The other two are pretty mentally strong from what I've seen.From what I can think of:

XNTP - Mage

XSXP - Rogue

ENFP - Paladin

ESXP - Bard

ESFJ - Knight

ISTX - Monk

ESTP - Fighter

ISFJ - Healer

INFJ - Cleric

It's what I got :p.I was an atheist straight out of the womb.

Beat that, bitch.Damn, you really must have no god then. Heartless bastard.I was typed as ENTP. never INTJ. I wonder if the inverse cognitive functions with them have some sort of correlation?Let's understand Jung, the dude who's work the MBTI is based off.

Jung was a very strong proponent of "nature" in nature vs nurture debate. If you're not familiar, nature vs nurture is all about whether we are born with our personalities (nature) or if our personalities are developed by environmental factors (nurture.)

So, basically, the theory states that you have **one** solid personality type from birth until death, even though it could manifest itself in different ways, your core self still stays, perhaps unless you go through severe mental trauma.

Regarding the test, take all the tests with a big hefty pinch of salt. Why? These reasons.

* They test based on the four letter dichotomies when your core personality is based on the 8 cognitive functions. [Here is more information about them.](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/)

* The wording of the questions can produce a bias, as with all subjective answers.

* Furthermore, it can also depend on how you personally feel, as your tested type will fluctuate depending on your feelings.

On to ISTP vs ISTJ, the ISTP's functions are Ti-Se-Ni-Fe, with Ti being the most dominant and Fe being the least. With ISTJ, it's Si-Te-Fi-Ne. As you can see, the two types have completely different functions even though they're one dichotomy apart. Read up on the functions (mainly Ti-Se and Si-Te) and tell me how you relate to them.Stealing that line.Sport has very little to do with type and more with technical ability gained through constant training. So, technically Js would most likely find sports more natural because they are more likely to get through the grind. XSXJs because they'll just get attuned to it after awhile and XNXJs because they see how it'll eventually pay off. However, if you want to talk about raw talent, that's just born regardless of type.

The most athletic person I know is an ENTP, which usually isn't considered an athletic type, but bloody fucking hell the guy is a freak. 

I'm an ISTP, and I'm generally rather athletic, but I'm not going around doing parkour like I'm a hobo who just got out of the ninjitsu dojo like the stereotype puts us as. But^that^would^be^cool...

nah&gt; Is this an Se or Fe thing?

I can possibly see it as either a Se-Fi combo working together or Fe-Si.

Se-Fi could be this as you can bluntly see how they look at first, and then you take a minute and think "Oh, when I look like that/do this, I feel like this..." and you take it from there.

Fe-Si would be mindful of taking care of people, and Si would pick up on the cues via memory and impressions.

So, I'd pick ESFX, maybe even healthy and developed ESTX too. As an ISTP, I either have no fucking clue what's going on (because I'm probably too occupied with something else) or I know *way too much* for my own good.Seriously, I can walk right behind someone for a complete hour and they don't even know I'm there until I say something. I don't even try most of the time either, it just kinda happens.IXXP. It's very telling of the whole "Ji mental steadiness" thing. I mean, I could very well see myself say this too.Jung and his work, whom the whole MBTI is based on, was a strong proponent of nature in the nature/nurture debate. In other words, he thought that people are born the way that they are  instead of being changed by there environment vis à vis tabula rasa.

So, the MBTI, based on Jungian psychology, states that you have **one** type from birth that exists within you **until you die, no exceptions.** It can manifest in different ways from how the environments you come across effect you, but it's still static. The only possible way that your MBTI type could change that I can think of is severe mental trauma.My XSFJ mom is always pointing to some vague direction when asking me to get something and it leading to me dropping I.Q. points harder than my will to live when I get on a drop tower.My dad is ESFP.

It's a pretty fun experience.I talk fast when I'm in casual mode, but when I'm trying to get something across I tend to talk carefully and deliberate. It just depends on the mood I'm in.How?Are you referring to the 16Personalities system? If so, there is a post somewhere here posted just recently that shows that 16Personalities isn't really MBTI, but just a simplified version of it with Big5 elements, mainly the Assertive/Turbulent axis.

[u/DOOMSPECTRE post about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/5f50kd/psa_16personalitiescom_is_not_mbti/)I wouldn't think that quickness of speech and MBTI type would be related if I'm to be honest, and any finding would probably be coincidental. That being said, this is just from my head so I can't prove or unprove it, and if you find anything, please inform me!Sleep and eating.

Whatever you want to do to me, I usually brush it off. But, if you *dare* attempt to scare me in my sleep/mess up my morning or eat/ruin something that you know I had dibs on eating, you're going to feel the wrath of *fucking god.* Showers are also included.

Oh, you've already posted that. Except the shower part.

I mean, it's all true.I see Trump as EStP (lower case t because I'm a bit unsure of it.) Hillary seems to use Te, beyond that I have no clue, she's rather ambiverted and I have no damn clue on N/S for her.

I voted for Johnson (even though the guy is too much of a klutz to be prez) because I'm in KY (solid red) and I wanted a third party to get 5%. Would of loved to vote for Weld though. If it was a battleground state, I would of grudgingly voted for Clinton.It's called Lingustic Relativity, and it's even been shown that bilingual people can slightly change personality when they speak their languages. For some reason, ESLs tend to say that they are "angrier" when they speak English vs their native language.**A. Age, gender, and nationality**

18, Male, American/British

**B. What kinds of things do you remember easily? What kinds of things do you usually forget?**

-Easy-

* How to do something
* Random details about people/things
* Events
* Oral information

 -Hard-

* Names
* Immediate info
* Names
* Dates
* Names
* Names
* Names

**C. What kind of people do you feel most comfortable around? What kind of people make you feel awkward or uncomfortable? What kind of people annoy you the most?**

-Comfortable-

* Relaxed
* Constant
* Expressive
* Casual
* Happy
* Laissez-faire
* Independent

-Uncomfortable-

* Intense
* Blank
* Brown-noser
* Pushy
* Stick-up-their-ass
* Moody
* Inconsistent

**D. How do you usually handle interpersonal conflict or confrontation? How do you wish you handled it - what would you change about your usual approach if you wanted to improve?**

I usually end up curious and start to ask questions, I'm not the type to hate confrontation, but I hate starting it because it seems like too much work for little results. If I can't reason my way out of it, I either just try to ignore it, or if push comes to shove force my way out of it. 

**E. What is your demeanor like?**

* I'm emotive, but I wouldn't call myself "expressive." I'm a fast walker.
* I prefer to listen, but I can be long-winded when necessary.
* I'm usually on the quiet side, but I can get **LOUD** if I get surprised or emotional.
* Mostly connected with the environment, but I can be a space cadet if I'm really thinking about something.
* Definitely rational. I'm not seen as openly emotional.
* This is funny, kinda a synthesis of both. I really don't know how to explain it, but I tend to go back and forth really quickly.
* If I'm speaking casually, I speak like lightning. If I am trying to get something across, I speak deliberative and carefully.
* It happens, but it's not often.
* I rarely get "jump up and down excited" but it's more often to get excited in my head. Externally, there isn't much change.
* Boredom is very frequent, If I don't have something stimulating my brain I zone out. 
* I tend to like playing around with things if there is something I can get my hands on I tend to play around with it. 
* Very hard, I get super comfortable, especially when I'm in bed.
* Very antsy. If I want to do something, I don't want to wait for it. I want to do it, and I want to do it right now!
* I call that a weekend.

**F. What kinds of things do you seem to notice more than most people? What do you more often seem to miss?**

-Most-

* I tend to notice..."tropes, archetypes" with people. I can understand that people replicate patterns and I can judge how someone is based on those patterns with pretty good accuracy.
* I tend to know the general impression of what someone thinks of me. For example, if a girl/guy has a crush on me, I can tell pretty easily.

-Least-
* Peoples reasons can be confusing sometimes, people can be obviously contradicting and it just confounds me to see it happen.

**G. Think about your energy, interest level, and skill doing various activities. What energizes you, relaxes you, stresses you out? What do you do well, okay, or poorly? What can you do all day, for a while, only in short bursts, or barely at all? Which of these seem like a waste of time, not just for you but in general?**

-Energizes-

* Music
* Intriguing conversation
* Food
* Heat
* Figuring out something
* Working towards something

-Denergizes-

* Doing something that doesn't add up to anything.
* Being idle
* Repetition/Grinds
* Being forced into something
* Drab conversation

I'll add some more later, right now I'm tired typing all this. Anyways, very interesting concept, r/peppermint-kiss!I got ENTP, which is the type I (at least) thought I was. I'm always thinking between the two :PSame here.

57% Realistic

76% Observant

66% IntrovertedWhat if I know the definitions/differences but I cannot differentiate them within myself? As I see how I can equally see them in me?I'm one who thinks this is completely independent of one's type, but on a personal note, all three ENFPs I've known have been insane gold diggers. Let me iterate: Its probably just a coincidence.What's your native/other language(s?)Huh, I've always heard from Spanish speakers that they're angrier/bolder when they speak English, that's really interesting that a Portuguese speaker says that it had a (slightly) different effect on them.

I have Russian relatives, and when they speak English they think that they are constantly being too intricate and fluffy with their words (because Russian is very direct and simple in causal speech compared to English.)The world is obviously SJ oriented, with a little give-way for SPs. So, I'd assume NPs would find it rough, especially INXP because extroversion tends to help a little bit with at least mimicking society.

As an ISTP, I'm just kinda like ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  if I were to look at myself with society. However, I don't think I'm completely understood either. I got diagnosed with ASD after my mom recommended that I did, and from my experience with those who really are, I know that it's complete BS.I know three INFPs. Only one is mopey and depressed. The other two are bubbly puppies, and one of them has a hidden boss ass bitch streak.

Some depressed people can be all over the place, so look for consistency in one's actions. If they act with characteristics of INFPs more so than not then they're probably INFP. If they don't, probably not INFP.

I wouldn't worry about it at the end of the day, though. People seem to forget that the MBTI is pseudoscience, even if it is insightful.1. ISTP

2. 7w6

3. I just found 16P online, and then I started researching it, and then it just goes on from there.

4. Mom: XSFJ, Dad: ESFP. It's...interesting.

5. I guess the closest person to being my "best" friend is ENTP. Our relationship basically consists of this: 

* ENTP: Hey, Waffle! I wanna do  *insert crazy shit* and you're coming along!

* Me: Aight. 

Hilarity ensues.

6. Theoretically, I'd say ESTJ. However, girls who have (majorly) crushed on me were ENFP, ESFP and INFP. I actually liked the ENFP too, but we were too aloof to figure it out until after the fact :/

7. I'm "brighter" both in disposition and in intelligence.
Roger Roger.
Played soccer, turned around arms flailing, accidentally clotheslined someone in the mouth and got yellowed. Judging by the amount they were bleeding, I must have braked off a tooth or something.

And I played rugby union for a year and never done anything so violent, especially since I tried to wreck people on purpose :/Not like Dolphins.

The rest of the animal kingdom damn well better be glad that we are on top. Dolphins are the Dark Eldar of animals.Well, at least you made a statement with it. Crap like that is just irritating to observe. 

To be honest, I don't think I felt guilty for what I did, it was more of an "aww geez" kinda moment, but I don't feel bad about it. I mean, I'm sure he's fine and I didn't mean to pop him like that. Since yours was intentional, I can assume the guilt comes from your anger getting the better of you.ENFJ. Same primary function, 3/4 dichotomies, and they use Se.I actually got a good story for one. I'll do it.I thought it read for the surprising characteristic of ENTPs was that they didn't like black people. I was really confused, as I know a black ENTP and I wondered if he is secretly some self-hating emo disguising himself as some smooth talking jock, and the other ENTP I know is a girl dating a black guy, and I was thinking that she's into some weird hate sex or something.

The latter part is probably somewhat true.&gt; Ramsey Bolton

FTFY.

I think I'd agree with most on the list, except I see Joffrey as more of an unhealthy EXTJ, and Littlefinger comes off as more introverted while Cersei comes off more extroverted. Dany seems Fi as well as Arya, despite the latter's "hard" disposition (which frankly comes from Fi IMO.)

Joffrey - EXTJ (He's too unhealthy to have properly set Ni or Si IMO.)

Littlefinger - INTJ

Cersei - ENTJ

Dany - INFP

Arya - ISFP

Oh yeah, let me add another one: Melisandre, INFJ.I'm sure there is a correlation, mainly going by what r/owlsymbolism mentioned, but I think maturity is definitely the 1# factor.

That being said, I know one ENFJ for a long time and I could definitely see us eventually being together. 

* We think of each other positively.
* We were both the smart ones in the classroom when we shared one.
* Both of us tend to be funny and we enjoy our sense of humor.
* We share quite a few interests.
* She's attracted to stoic types and I tend to be attracted to sweethearts.
* We're both physically attractive and easily sexually aroused.
* She's Native American and my lineage is surely from Vikings raping Anglo-Saxons in northern England so our pure bloodlines are just itching to destroy themselves.
* She's got perky tits.

List goes on.

If you mean friendship, I'm best friends with an ENTP. I mean, he's the Inventor and I'm the Mechanic/Craftsman so we gotta have a positive relationship. Basically, conversation starts like this:

"Hey Waffle! I wanna do *insert stupidfunny shit here* and your coming along!

"Aight."

Hilarity ensues.

We also talk about intellectual topics when not doing stupidfunny shit.I just see Mel as being more reserved but ambitious and so is more superficially outgoing, but you could possibly be right. A fictional character can't take the test, so I see both interpretations as pretty legit.

&gt; unwavering in her idealistic goals

That's Fi to me. Fi-types can also be people oriented, albeit in a different fashion than Fe-types. She *is* ambitious, but she can't really build a plan to structure herself towards those goals, and thus she fails to see the consequences of her actions until they happen. I'll probably explain more later, right now I'm on a phone and I don't feel like typing it all out. 😐Not to be mean and I agree with what u/caughtmeonce is saying, but you must be living under a rock. Jersey Shore is considered by many as among the lowest of the low culture TV you can find. I personally don't have much against the exact premise of the show, but I tend to not like reality shows in general. Just not my taste.I said I agreed with what u/caughtmeonce is saying. You have all the right to ask about the show and the character's types. 

What I am saying is that the hate that Jersey Shore gets is *very* popular, especially on the internet. It's very surprising that you didn't expect such backlash. &gt; You're all of a sudden assuming I live under a rock because of ONE tv show preference. Like all of that is really ridiculous

"Living under a rock" is a hyperbolic metaphor. It does not mean that you literally live under a rock or that you don't get out much. It just means that it's very surprising you don't know something. Not because of your preference of the show, but because you didn't expect the lack of support that you'd get.

[The lack of popular support of the show has it's own Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_and_criticism_of_Jersey_Shore) [And (very popular) South Park episode.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_a_Jersey_Thing) Unlike you, this isn't coming from a personal stance. I'm just showing you that in general, people don't like the show. That is all.That's your right, and I even support you in that, even if I don't watch it personally. [Look at the cognitive functions, more specifically Ti, Ne, Si, Fe in order. That's the function stack of the INTP.](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/)

Then, have a read at [this](http://personalitycafe.com/whats-my-personality-type/505602-short-effective-scenario-questionnaire-2-0-self-type.html) questionnaire and answer the questions here.

Don't trust tests, especially yes/no tests and **especially** ones that test your over the four letter dichotomies over the cognitive functions. Trust the theory instead, and remember, it's all pseudoscience, so don't take any processed results to gospel, and whatever you wish to type yourself as, well, don't try to fit a square peg in a circle.
Mine is too. I mean, it certainly sounds interesting, and I'll probably take a quick gander in it, but sheesh, that's chunkier than a research paper. **Literally.**
No, that's DnD alignment. Completely different because it deals with straight ethics. This deals (I'm pretty sure) with how you execute said morality/the fashion of your morality.From what I understand of it:

Law: Humanity must limit themselves because if we don't we'll fuck ourselves. We as a collective will produce better results and straighten humanity to a right path.

Neutral: In-de-middle.

Chaos: Embrace of willpower, emotions, humanity shouldn't have to apologize for what it really is and that'll make us as individuals stronger.

Is this about right?This is interesting, I would've been a strong advocate for Chaos when I was younger. I was a young Nietzschean anarcho-commie, who really didn't like the idea of us being constrained by social norms.

Now, I'd say I'm pretty much Neutral, *teetering* towards Chaos. I'm an atheistic liberal (in the international sense) [Anti-Nihilist](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist) who tends to be skeptical of ideology for ideology's sake. How you do it doesn't matter, as long as some action is taken to produce the result, *however,* still have some degree of sensibility about the whole thing. I think this was said about Neutral-minded characters rather explicitly in the link you stated above. The problem is, like most things, people are seeing the mask and equating the face with the mask.

They see the binary answer-based tests and the dichotomy-based results that are attuned to corporations. They don't see the theory that most of the online MBTI community follows, that trusts more in Jungian Cognitive Functions than the dichotomy. That being said, that hate is technically correct, for the dichotomy-based test *really is* the MBTI. 

The online community really has this cone-shaped iceberg of a systematic theory/logic of personality, where the tip is on the surface and more MBTI related, while the wide bottom is more JCF related. We also, ultimately, don't take this system as gospel. Haters don't see any of that.

Also, it feels good to be edgy and gang-kick a puppy to death.

This also happens with this with my favorite sport, Aussie Rules Football. I show my fellow Americans it and there all like "DATZ RUGBEE" when they haven't even watched a rugby game, let alone know all the rules of the game, or even know that there are two different codes of rugby, which AFL isn't one of them.Don't worry, I said AFL in the last bit. Aussie Rules is the technical name of the sport itself, without the AFL (league/organization.)

But yeah, its just a part of life in the end. This moment is one I could live with, even if a bit irritating.I know three INFPs, all of whom are pretty different, and only one was confirmed as such by herself.

That one is a bubbly puppy, who even though I get confused with, she's fun company. She also has this inner "boss ass bitch" streak that's scary as hell to observe. I mean, I might get irritated with someone, but can honestly say that I am **almost never** *angry* with someone. She can be a lot more frequent than I.

The other two I don't know as well, but well enough to type them. The guy of the group is about the same minus the whole inner-tiger thing, he's though-and-though docile. Another girl who I suspect is INFP is an unhealthy example. Whiney and undiplomatic.

2/3, not too bad!ENTP as well as ISTP are your best bets. However, since you're probably used to only fluffy tests like 16P (it's a big no-no) you probably want to start from step one. Don't worry, it isn't hard to learn.

[You can have a look at the cognitive functions here, which are the "building blocks" of the types.](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/) For INTPs, they lead with Ti and Ne, look at those first.

I wouldn't trust most tests, but one that seems to be *OK* (but not necessarily good) is [John's Personality Test,](http://jupiter-34.appspot.com/) which tends to be pretty accurate, usually only 1, maybe 2 dichotomies/letters off. Only use this as a jumping board from step one, not as a final means. [This](http://personalitycafe.com/whats-my-personality-type/505602-short-effective-scenario-questionnaire-2-0-self-type.html) questionnaire is also pretty helpful with understanding your type better. Ask it on here or on PerC (the website it's on) and it will give some insight.

Stay around here a little bit, as questions when needed, and probably around a week you'll have a pretty good understanding of what your type is. Trust the theory more than anything. However, realize that this *is* pseudoscience, so it isn't fixated by any empirical data.

Good luck!Neat username.

Anywhom, let's get to it. I'll be using the [Cognitive Functions](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/) to describe your answers, which are the building blocks of the types.

Question 2: Uses a lot of Se (extroverted Sensing) as you described the scenery for what it is, vs an impression that you might have had (Si, introverted sensing.)

Question 3: This shows some preference for feeling, particularly Fi, as your describing your reaction rather than the situation. 

Question 4: Shows off a preference for perceiving, as your open about going to the party via opportunities.

Question 5/6: Shows feeling/Fi.

Question 7: **Fi as hell.** 

Question 8: Fi. At this point, IMO your definitely XXFP from what you've shown me. Really read up on Fi and tell me about how you think of it.

Question 9: Shows a perceiving preference, maybe Ne because your jumping from possibility to possibility?

Question 10: I'm not getting too much from this, superficially I would say Se, but honestly this could describe anyone.

Question 11: More Fi, and also with it's paired function of Te.

If I had to guess any exact type, I'd say ISFP. IMO, your definitely XXFP. Let me ask you a few more questions.

1. Do you consider yourself a true introvert, or an extrovert that hasn't had success in being so? I think that I and E can be the hardest to understand for one's self, so that's why I ask this.

2. Read up on Se and Ne, which one describes you best? I didn't get a whole lot of perspective on this aspect.

3. Finally, as a means of starting from somewhere on a more concrete level, try to take [John's Personality Test](http://jupiter-34.appspot.com/) and tell me what you get. I wouldn't trust tests, but they do help with choosing where to start.&gt; Se dominants usually are sure of themselves and who they are and not as into personal growth or "finding themselves" at such an early stage of personality development.

I can relate to this, for the most part, so perhaps you're on to something. Like me and you noted, their Pe is hard to probe from this. (By the way, you have repeated "and," might wanna fix that.)

You find it "crap?" I usually get XSTP from it, every now and then XNTP. From what I've heard from others, it's among the most accurate tests out there while also being rather accessible.1. For the most part, yes. Read what u/dontfreakout_ has to say about you being more extroverted, and tell them or me about what you think about it.

2. Take your time, [Watch this video, his voice is really monotone, but he nails it, like usual. Watch his videos *in general,* they're fantastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brv467Ew-IQ)

3. Like I said, definitely Fi in there somewhere. Read up all the XXFPs and filter them out until you got the one that seems most like you.First off, not trying to demean you in any way, but spacing that paragraph would go a long way for people to read it.

Well, regardless of type, here's how I see it: The guy is either...

1. Childish.
2. ASPD.

He actually might, in his own definition, love you. Not to say that it isn't more "objectively" deep love, but he could in some fashion. That being said, you still need to kick him out of your life if he continues. He *is* using you, and I don't know the situation fully between you and him, only your side, but it's obviously currently unhealthy either way, and this needs to be concluded soon.

I'd say what you need to do is simply be frank but explain yourself and back up everything you say. He might not like what you're saying, but he's not going to be in a position to argue about it. He'll either accept it or not, and from there I think you know what to do. It's probably a good idea to not smother him either, give him some space to explain himself if he wants to (or even can.)

Remember, the MBTI is a pseudoscientific theory, just because Ti is your last function is no means that you can't be logical just like it's for me to be sympathetic and warm. Also, I can't "probe" into his mind just because we're both apparently ISTPs. People can differ greatly from type.No problem, and good luck!Uh...*maybe?* He might know you're on to something (or probably not) and get defensive. If you can do it smoothly, and you can cover your tracks that you've already known, then your moral position over him would be much higher. If you do get caught while you're trying this, well, the opposite, because then not only did you snooped (albeit accidentally, he won't know and accept that, though) but you lied about you not knowing prior. You're still in the right either way, but with the last bit, it'll make it harder on you to get out of it clean.

So, overall, let me answer this with a question: How gullible is he?

I don't know about other ISTPs, but I've been told I look tired all the time. Not ever angry, tired. Don't really know what to think of that.

😪If I'm happy, I have this very intense, bright, silent expression on my face, which is usually followed by me chasing that happiness without a peep.[Have ENTP best friend, his face is basically this.](https://cdn.meme.am/cache/images/folder494/19494.jpg)[Relevant.](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/710/133/07d.jpg)Why not *both*...**at the same time?**Don't think too deep into it, for one. It's pseudoscience so there is nothing empirical to base it on. Not to say it isn't insightful or useful, it's just not defined by any boundaries connected to reality. That might be a reason your confused because every description you'll hear of the cognitive functions is probably laden with some subjective bias. Some, of course, are more subjective than others.

Right, moving on.

They are the "building blocks" of the 16 types, which those types are ordered differently by their stack. For example, ISTP is Ti-Se-Ni-Fe. An introverted function is first, so that's where the I comes in. Se is next, which is a sensing function, so IXXX turns to ISXX. Ti-Se is a part of Ji-Pe, which perceives extrovertedly while judges internally, so it gets ISXP. Let's look at the first function again, Ti. It's a thinking function, so it all comes together to make ISTP.

For gross but somewhat accurate simplification,

Ti looks for why.

Te looks for how.

Fe is communal based.

Fi is individual based.

Se is raw.

Si is filtered.

Ne is generating 100 ideas in 10 second intervals.

Ni is expanding 10 ideas in 100 minute intervals.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uKaFveOhXY) video does a great job at explaining JCF.I've used the word empirical in the context that the observation is objective, as in no personal bias has been used, or where bias can be proven wrong because of observation of the world as-is. When people use empirical, they typically mean it in this format.

MBTI is empirical in the (technically correct) definition that you gave, but it is bounded by some degree of subjectivity because there isn't anything in the objective world to prove the explanations of observations.&gt; House.

From what I remember of the show, he started out more XNTJ but ended up being more of an XNTP by the end of it. In Jungian terms, it's hard to tell whether he's introverted or extroverted IMO.More like Times New Roman.

COMIC SANS FTW!

Verdana is nice too.&gt; ISTP

&gt; Zero Car Knowledge

HERESY

/s

Agreed.I know an ENFJ. She isn't some super-warm heart-on-her-sleeve mom, but you'll definitely know her opinion of you just by her body language.I could see it as such, but I'd just was telling my example of an (self-typed) ENFJ that I know.&amp;gt; ENTJ

Have known one for a long time. She has her moments, but overall she's among the most honorable and fair minded people I've met. In my experience, love ENTJs.

INFPs I know less about, but I do know three who are. One is a bubbly puppy with a inner boss ass bitch streak, another one is just a bubbly puppy, and the *last one is the stereotypical depressed "MUH VALUEZ" type.

* She might be more of a ISFP, but I can't tell for sure.Go on a huge passive-aggressive tirade when I'm forced to hang the toilet paper under.

"Oh sure, lets make the toilet paper when it's HARDER TO REACH. Yeah, sure, let it tear before you get your preferred amount. JUST PERFECTLY FUCKING FINE."Mine neither.If you have any good friends, what would you guess their MBTI types to be?Am ISTP male, do not get the girls (or guys.)

Why? 75% not interested, 25% social skills not the best. If I tried, I don't think I'd be more successful than anyone else. 

That is, until I'd unleash the ultimate ISTP power: Fixing their car. Bitches love getting their car fixed....I'll just think of "rape" and "bitch" as figurative terms for beating someone to a pulp and a weak person in general and I'll say O.K.Oh! Well then, that's fine then. I think to specify a bit on the first reason why I'm not in a relationship is becuase I don't want to play the games that come with one. So yeah, this fits.0_0

To be honest, I was rather indifferent to whatever agenda they might of had, but huh...not the worst I've seen, but definitely pretty damn weird. Thanks for the heads up.&gt; linkin-park

*shudders*I have an ENTP best friend, it could be described like this. Another way is like this:

ENTP: "Hey Waffle! I'm going to do some stupidfunnyshit! Wanna come along?"

Me, nothing else better to do: "Aight."

Hilarity ensures.&gt; Light pink or light yellow.

Huh...no wonder why I like pink lemonade...&gt; Also the fact that they're confident but not overconfident

You should meet my ENTP best friend in that case. Guy thought he could run a marathon "like it's nothing" with hardly any training beforehand.

Let's just say me, him and our circle was glad that there was a half-marathon option.[Found a good example.](http://thoughtcatalog.com/nicole-mullen/2015/05/every-myers-briggs-types-favorite-sexual-position/)&gt; bad hair day

How could you even?So...you *wouldn't* like anulingus instead?...Huh...good job. Not even really *that* bad compared to others. Nice work.I'll be honest, I thought it got hilarious around that point.This is the only correct answer to this.Of course I do.

Ti-Ni loop/WTF Years is pretty exhausting though, so I just boot override my brain and go out and do something. Makes for some interesting, if off the wall thoughts.For me at least, I'd say I'm a deontologist, that if deontology is about upholding certain moral laws, then caring (not necessarily abiding) about consequence is a more important one of those laws.

However, if we were to get out of the Deon/Conseq axis, I can imagine SPs in general liking the idea of Virtue Theory because it handles ethics in an essentially "just do it" approach, and I can say I can be like that a lot.A little more of the former, but in normative ethics (what we're talking about) the latter can apply to both ethical systems.

Deontology, in it's purest form, is essentially saying that you must follow a moral code and stand by it no matter what. For example, if you believe lying is something bad, then **you cannot and should not lie, No. Matter. What.** because in your code lying is inherently bad.

Consequentialism, in it's purest form, would state that lying, or ***anything*** else, is totally acceptable as long as a net positive is made in the process. 

Essentially, Deontologists would worry about the cause, and state that the cause must always be good, while Consequentialists would state that the effect must always be good, and for Deons/Conseqs with effect/cause, it's totally permissible what happens/what you do.This was also me in a nutshell.&gt; Do you like being naked?

:D...Well, TIL...For me, it's like I'm talking to myself in my mind.Horoscopes outta nowhere.In hindsight, yeah it's pretty XSTP. I was actually thinking more of a EXTP due to the larger-than-life attitude, but all the details makes it more XSTP.

[I like to listen to this when I read it. Makes it more entertaining.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFhM1XZsh6o)kCompletely agree with you with MisterWives. First time I heard Reflections, I immediately thought "ENFP. If that is not ENFP in a song, I do not know what is." Even their aesthetic screams it.[It's called the Indie Girl voice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SU0gFPMwP8&amp;feature=youtu.be)I'd argue Denver as well.Don't know about the rest, but from reading the Manifesto and Kapital, Marx's explanations gave me XNTJ vibes. Don't really know about E or I though.&gt; Although, most ISTP's probably cba to stand there and yell lol, prob say something like "pointless" and go home lol.

This. Unless it's something that really has to be done, I'm not one to cause conflict. If it comes down to it, I'm more of the "controlled and intense" type of talker instead of flip-shit rage.
I'm not them, but I can imagine ISFPs being more direct and less-is-more sort of answers. INFPs can be more expansive in their answers (but personally I'd call it redundant.)

I'd attest to you being ISFP from that.Jesus Christ if I was that handy. I can barely make packaged ramen, let alone becoming close to building a fusion reactor.ISTP.

I would say I'm a solid [New Democrat.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats) Centrist/Center-left. Socially progressive, love free trade and capitalism, not ideologically opposed to big government, but tend to look towards an effective small-government approach when possible. Somewhere between a dove and a hawk. I lurk on r/neoliberal but I wouldn't call myself a full member.

Dad is an English American, huge Labour and Corbyn supporter, and liked Sanders in the primary. Mom is a Republican but is somewhat apolitical.

I'd honestly think I got my views regardless of my type, as would anyone else (political attitudes might be different though,) and I don't think parents attributed to much either.MBTI/Jungian Typology is based upon the work of Carl Jung, who was a huge proponent of "nature" in the "nature/nuture" debate. In other words, he strongly believed people were born the way they are instead of being conditioned by environmental factors.

So theoretically, you have always had **one** type and that **one** type only, you still are that **one** type today, and will **always** be that **one** type until you die. It is up to self-reflection to figure out what **one** type you are.

Realistically? You'll probably settle into your type after puberty is well over. Changing from there? Fuck if I know.

So, as you are 21, maybe you are an INFP? Stick around on the sub more, ask questions, and you'll figure it out eventually.🙌 Hear hear!My best friend is ENTP.

I am ISTP.

I am pretty fit.

My best friend, however, is an athletic monster.

But to answer your question, to many people: Se = FYSIKAL AKTIVITIEZ&gt; Stereotypical Irish man.

&gt; From u/Akaros_Prime: Stereotypical Frenchman

&gt; From u/Shantirel: Stereotypical Polish man.

From this: Stereotypical European Man.Maybe they are hiding something?*Alive* bodies that they love a lot, *right?*

...*right??*Damn. That got too intense for *both* sides.&gt; The demand for heavily processed food increases.

Don't get me wrong, I love me some Salisbury steak or canned ravioli, but I'd go insane after awhile. Let the ISTPs hunt and farm while the INTP's work to build some sort of replicator a la Star Trek.

Bet replicated Salisbury steak tastes dope.&gt; I'm just gonna go straight ahead and say that redditMBTI has a habbit of crapping on other types AND themselves (maybe especially NTs) and getting a victim complex about it wasn't going to help.

At least we're not PerC.Don't even watch the show and I lol'd.&gt; "Everything is bitches, cars, money."

Accurate.I like that this is sung in some late 80's/early 90's white boy rap ala Beastie Boys/Faith No More/RHCP because it always seems ENTP to me for no rational reason in my mind.
I wouldn't say you are a contributor. You asked a legit question, but it got brigaded by debates that were not only off-topic but too personal for comfort.

But for your question...maybe Sweeney Todd? One could also argue Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, but he seems ISFP IMO.I was thinking about Anakin, who is the opposite of "not very emotional" and "heavily structured." Maybe the severe trauma from turning to the dark side and transforming into Vader flipped him from ISFP to ISTJ? Or maybe he just severely repressed himself as Vader?&gt; Does that mean they are feelers? Or does that mean they are thinkers?

It means they are pretentious, regardless of what type they are. I mean, ugh...Post-Modernist thought purposely rejects logic so they can say "everything goes!" and isn't constructive in the least. 21st Century Nihilists. Ew.

Žižek is quite the fascinating train-wreck though. I would type him as some sort of zany XNXP since the Ne in him is definite. Couldn't tell you beyond that.
I didn't mean train wreck in his thoughts, I meant in his mannerisms. There was a VICE documentary about him, and when he met the interviewer, the first literal thing he said was "I hate life." Furthermore, he rambles on about random philosophical topics for like, 15 minutes straight, before saying "Oh, please excuse me, would you like some...uh, fucking fruit juice or something?"

I think I'm using train wreck in a lighter sense. He's just *really* zany.I know I'm late, but I'd give ISTP to Finland. Sisu, huge DIY and racing culture, Kimi Raikkonen, Simo Hayha, introverted, etc.ISTP. Agnostic Athiest, grew up with a Methodist father and Baptist mother in southern Kentucky.

It just doesn't connect with me. Most of it seems like it's inflating things more than what they really are, and at worst times it can create mania and zealotry, which is downright revolting to me IMO. If I was religious, I'd say I'd take a shot at being a Catholic or Buddhist monk. It'd be refreshing compared to the Protestantism here in Kentucky.

That being said, I find nothing wrong with religion by itself on a day to day basis, it's just not for me.If you don't mind, can you explain further on the NT/Islam connection?I agree with this. The Fe-Ne here is hilarious to watch. I'd unironically love being roomies with him.Uh...I am a ISTP and identify as a [New Democrat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats) and [Wilsonian.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsonianism)

I've seen a lot of XSTPs being libertarianish.INTP &gt; ENTP &gt; ISTP.

A lot of this is coming from a mix of maturing, change in lifestyle and understanding how MBTI/Jungian functions work for me.

Also by not relying on tests.Damn this stuff is literally thicker than some research papers, but it's so great nonetheless.ISTP.

In a broad stroke, I mostly listen to pop. electronica, punk and metal. To paint a bit thinner...

Pop: It's a bit everywhere, like how pop can be.

Electronica: Triphop, Future Funk/V A P O R W A V E , and some EDM, as well as Ambient stuff.

Punk: Some hardcore, some skater, recently getting into Crust Punk, which is a crossover genre with metal (particularly thrash and black metal.)

Metal: Doom/Stoner always works (I'm straight edge though) and alternative metal *can* put out good stuff. Power Metal is either a *big* hit or a *big* miss.Breaking things apart in this meaning is more figurative but applied in a literal manner. While hard sciences might be more typical and natural for XSTPs to get into, the same process can be applied to soft sciences too.

For example, I'm in college for a dual major of Journalism and Political Science, and I have an interest in linguistics, geography and history too. What I tend to do is mentally group certain aspects of something in my head, and compare and contrast those aspects one by one to build a holistic framework of understanding, in which I can apply that framework to make it work when needed. That's what it means when ISTP's "break things apart."

Stress is independent of type IMO, especially if you get overloaded with something. Everyone has their breaking point.

I would say I'm confrontational, but I would also say I know how to be soft with it, which is something Ti types tend to be pretty good with. I'm not the type to wittingly hurt feelings if I know I can avoid it, mainly because doing so only amplifies the problem from my perspective, instead for sympathy-dominate reasons like F-types can be.We gotta warrior with all the appropriate technology, y'know?I get XNFPs for some reason.

Idunno.I find XSTJs appealing, and to some degree XXFJs too. Honestly it depends on the person, obviously.

Non-Romantically, ENTPs have been great for me.Would you describe yourself as more cerebral and internally focused or more focused and externally focused?&gt;  free market capitalism

That means a lot of things to a lot of people.I'd give Finland the ISTP seal of approval. DIY culture, lovers of Metal, Racing and Extreme Sports, lots of alcohol, misanthropic introverts, high suicide rates.

Seems like a lot of ISTPs there. Neat sounding place. &gt; Normally celebrity deaths do not affect me like this; this one has shook me and may actually put me to tears.

I can relate. Maybe not tears, but I wouldn't expect Bennington or Cornell to be gone if you told me they would be in 2017's New Years. Shocked by both.To answer the question: Honestly, the only way that I can think of that would majorly rewire the way you think, regardless of personality type, is severe mental trauma. Other than that, who you are is *somewhat* fixated.

In regards to your path, you can do whatever you want regardless of your type. It might come off differently to other people, but otherwise, anyone can do almost everything if they set their mind to it and are not drastically limited either physically, socio-culturally or otherwise.Kinda. I can be sociable and I have a few relationships, but I would say my "default" mode of thought is being alone, and I'm usually fine with that, but I also have my moments when I just want to get out of the house.So, similar to me?&gt; technocratic 

That's probably why. Technocratices are technically authoritarian governments.But this is based exactly on policies. The isms are just labels they give you after you are done with your policy settings.

It's currently in Alpha, so don't expect it to be perfect.

I believe that is how much of that sector is funded by the government.How'd you get it "Patriarchal?"In that case, "Patriarchal Progressivism" seems a bit off IMO.Don't mean to be rude, but posts don't bump when someone comments on them. They stay relevant purely by upvotes.

YOU FELT THINGS?!?!?I'm an ISTP and double majoring in Journalism and Political Science.

I guess I'm just a closeted ENFJ. Who knew!?I'd agree with most, except I'd probably make Simon/Miniminter IXFP and Josh/Zerkka ISTJ. Josh doesn't really seem like he is Fe oriented, and Simon has said multiple times he's pretty much a loner outside of Sidemen. Most of these are gut typings though, I completely agree with Bez/Ethan.

Toby/TBJZL seems IXXP, other than that I really can't tell either.

EDIT: Now I think of it, Vik might be EXFJ. He seems to be the most...socialized?...of The Sidemen. Maybe that's a clue to a more dominant Fe.Detroit - ISTP

Louisville - ENFX

Washington - XNTJ

Nashville - ESTPI'd say Nashville is ESTP.Personally, I think you are taking the MBTI/Jungian Functions a bit too close to heart. That's just giving some background.

But, of course, there can be. There are healthy and unhealthy types of all kinds. I almost had a relationship with an ENFP girl (but we were too shy to confirm our feelings for each other, and we have gone separate ways...ish) and, at least from what I've gotten to know about her, is a very rounded individual. She can have something of a scattered, paranoid control-freaky nature that you've described in her bad days, but not to the level that she would "fuck up" people.Well, the ish is pretty important. We still kinda have feelings for each other, but we haven't been able to make a solid confirmation of it due to lack of communication, as well as both of us,  being busy. I'm sure if we had time together, things would probably sprout. :)What if he offered butt stuff?*eye twitches*ayy lmaoFor love of symmetry where would ISTJ fall in this equation?Generally this, but I would also say I try a more explanatory nature about why it's wrong than full on dismissal. If they've proven they are completely ignorant, I won't waste my energy on someone who doesn't want to change.ISTP: Sneak around, horde some stuff while making an elaborate trap/plan to either GTFO or thwart the killer. If going to die, B L A Z E  O F  G L O R Y.r/shittyMBTIDo you need a hug?I can tell.

As an ISTP, I'm pretty much a total psychopath, and thus I don't give out hugs all that much. I'm sure an ESFP could help you with that however.I don't really like dangerous situations either, and I'm an ISTP.

Not saying you are one, but IMO ISTPs and INTPs are pretty similar, and I'd think both superficially relate to stereotypical INTP descriptions pretty well. The differences come in other ways than "cars vs computers."

You seem to have a very superficial understanding of all the MBTI/Jungian Function stuff. Not a bad thing, but you really need to get your mind out of the gutter with the dichotomies, as they're not very explanatory.

A lot of stuff online is available for you to get introduced to the ideas. Then you can start discussing them wherever to get a more nuanced grasp of the system.&gt; EDIT: My ISTP friend was the exact opposite of some elements being described here. He was all business at work, maybe the hardest worker of us all. Cold, polite, etc. Then he'd go to heavy metal concerts and mosh and scream and turn over tables. ISTPs are deeply emotional people.

Yeah, lot of that describes me too. I like to play, but I get hyperfocused on work and it can get hard to loosen up. I also like snuggles.That definition tho.Anyone want some Flintstone Gummies? All I got.If I have to say anything because I tend to love ENTPs, I would say that some can be vain in a way that they expect you to idolize over them. Like, I don't care how much you lift or how you got accepted into a cool program with only 70 people in it, more power to you. Now, if you haven't got anything else to say, please leave me be.


And yes there is personal experience coming from that.***FUCK YOU!***OK I UNDERSTAND ITReverse capitalization. Neat.Not downvoting but in my case I’d say I’m pretty metrosexual. Maybe I don’t shave consistently, but other than that, clean.I think ISTP's, in a general sense, are minimalistic. That said, this might be an example of just not caring about how they look, just because of a lack of social understanding that *they look bad.* Probably a projection thing too. I get uncomfortable if I don't look decent around people if I am not at home/dorm. Doing so seems implicitly rude in my case.Pretty sure it's a mutual symbiosis.With all the negativity recently, let's have some positivity.

I vote that it’s the best.You are Italian, so...Germans?This is all understood by not taking it seriously.Do you want free karma? Because this is how you get free karma.

Here, have some free karma.Not equally equitable. Libertarians stand for a fundamental distrust of government in of itself because it is a "necessary evil." They have complete disregard of the concept of positive liberty in favor of filling in those problems with what would be perceived as scarcity of positive liberty with the abundance of negative liberty, thus wishing to create a night watchman state.

Classical Liberals are mainly just people who hold a liberal worldview that likes negative liberty more so than positive liberty but still upholds both to some degree and do not inherently believe any government is a "necessary evil."

It's a bit like saying general rock and metal are the same things. Similarities, connections, but ultimately different.I'm indifferent to Third Wave Feminism. It seems to be more of a movement based on perception and redefining rather than actively trying to better women within society a la First Wave Feminism. Maybe I am wrong, but that is just how I see it, and to me, a lot of points that are brought up along TWF lines are only nil. Not good, not bad, not meaningful, just nil. I think it is better than Second Wave Feminism as TWF is more inclusionary while SWF had many exclusionary traits.

I do not agree with the overarching concept of Antifa other than a dislike of Fascism. How they go about it can vary from person to person, group to group, cell to cell, but in general such intensely partisan/emotional activism is just a big turn off.

I would consider myself a Democrat, mainly agreeing most with that of [New Democrats.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrat_Coalition) Cultural liberalism, market economies, and globalization, in general, has helped the world so much as of yet. The poorest in liberal democracies haven't been richer, more people live in free societies more than any other point in history, and despite increasing global instability as of right now, comparatively is among the most peaceful times since the end of the Cold War, probably only second from the 90's to 2000 (with the Yugoslav Wars being an outlier, but I would argue that was a delayed relic of the Cold War.) If by "New Liberalism" you mean "Neoliberalism," then I am perhaps your enemy in that front.They are just descriptive words, not definitional. So, one can argue that description is from perception, and that everyone perceives things differently, it’s obvious that people will describe things different by their different perceptions. I don’t know anyone who would assert their opinions of such as fact unless they are unhealthily projecting themselves out to the internet.

I don’t think this covers what the functions are all about. They could call stuff whatever for multiple reasons. I say stop taking their comments seriously and you do you.I appreciate this post.

Other than that, I wouldn’t really know if there is an exact formal theory. Just seems like a social-oriented economy. Maybe something similar to [Syndicalist-ic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism) thought?I thought the same of Fascism and

4. If Google can't find anything, it probably doesn't exist, or it's not something that you need to worry.
5. Profit.

And for the aux/third thing, well, I tend to look at things as they are, I guess. I tend to let stuff talk for themselves instead of having my perceptions get in the way of things.

*no*Yeah, but a lot of those careers can take a massive toil on you. Lots of utility jobs have constant injuries. Cooks, businesspeople and medical staff can be flat-out exhausted from all the hours they have to make to get some kind of profit. People say that getting such degrees is this be-all perfect plan when it is much more complicated than that. Getting a lot of money with little debt is great but it doesn’t help when it’s hard to harvest the fruit before it’s too late.

Personally, I’m glad I’m going to 4-year as I’ll be doing less work for more pay, and I’ll be a whole lot more marketable in my field with more connections vs Jo(e) Schmo who just have their GED or associate with less connections. I also have enough scholarships in college to basically be *paid* to go to university, because I did well enough in HS and keep doing well in Uni.First off, that accent is Canadian is fuck. Wow, I didn't even know that people spoke so stereotypical. 

In that first video, he's also really focused and into his teaching, and he isn't even all that heady, but he is fast as hell when speaking compared to the volume of information he is giving out. If I was in that room and I was trying to take notes, even on a computer, I wouldn't have time to process what he is teaching. I'd rather have a slow, monotonous teacher as at least I would be able to process what they were saying while also putting that info down where I could study it later.

In terms of what he was teaching, I didn't really jive with it. Intelligence is rather correlated with skill, and how much you want to measure it, you just can't. Baseline, it's all relative, all apart of social construction. Describing intelligence isn't really all that different from defining it. I.Q isn't that much different. The only thing that concretely correlates with success is actually doing successful actions, which requires some mixture of intelligence/skill and willpower.


True, it’s all relative. I’m just saying that community isn’t the perfect plan people say it is, and there are positives to university despite the risks of debt. Scholarships are not hard to come by if you work hard and take the time to find them, and that can reduce debt immensely. With community, it’s even better. Couple of them alone could get you a full ride.

lol /s-^kinda^but^not^reallyIn my experiences, ENTPs do like *interacting* with people. They might not want friends par se, but they love talking and discussing things to people.

The mid-pop/low-pop subs seem legitimate from what I see of them, but then again, that is not a lot.Just from going off here, which is just a face value assumption and not a full-on analysis, I see INTP. When you were trying to define what exactly is a confrontation, and then you were pulling off different scenarios to basically play devil’s advocate with yourself, it seemed very Ti/Ne.

I also saw Inf-Fe in where you were trying to be polite but you had no idea how to do it and it made you uncomfortable, which is something I have done in the past as Inf-Fe myself.

Took me a few hours, admittedly.[Here ya go.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Yurt)It’s pretty damn comfy, unlike a teepee or wigwam. Keeps you warm.Best Boy?

Dorn is a more superficial typing, but what I could gather, it makes sense.

I could definitely see Horus ENFJ too. Neutral answerFirst off, if you really are an XNTJ, you are never going to get rid of Ni so don’t think you will. It has a strength on its own and you need to harness it for your own best. It’s fine, you will be fine, don’t worry about it.

If you want to try to experiment with something, how about going for a light jog? No ulterior reasoning, just let the actions make the experience which will be the reasoning in of itself. Then, just keep jogging. Let your mind loose. Stop caring about your whole conundrum and, as Bruce Lee said, “be like water.”

I like walking and listening to music, and the most things on my mind are either what is in front of me, or the music itself, either me playing it, or creating a scenario in my head set to the music, etc. Everything else is gone in my life until I arrive back home.It seems to me when everyone asks about the meaning of life on here, it’s almost always us ISTPs that end up taking the most upvoted comment. Maybe those WTF Years do existential wonders for us? 😂I enjoy them. I somewhat recently went to MCAC a while ago, and I actually really loved the paintings despite me not understanding the “artistry” in paintings beforehand. They did a temporary exhibit on Soviet art and propaganda at the time and I just got lost in the a e s t h e t i c s for about a fourth of the time.

Plus science museums were always dope.I was more like a soft momma’s boy when I was really young. The more I stayed in school, I got more emotionally beat and calloused up until around junior/senior HS year. After that, I’ve recovered to what I think is a very good balance. I’ve gotten *more* soft-hearted like I used to be when I was younger, and honestly it feels great!I bet Indonesians can make a cozy air freshener though. All those spices. ☺️*what if i told you emotions are a form of rational thinking?*

***cue x-files***It’s a sexist joke on Reddit and in 1h you still have positive karma, I’d call that a success.*sss...ahh* well, better luck next time.ISTP.

I keep it simple, but I make sure to look clean and tidy. I wouldn’t say I have a certain “style,” however.

One thing though: Quality over quantity. Always.&gt; ridiculous looking collared short sleeved polos

Maybe I should of added comfortable too. Those polos are very...stiff...don’t like them. Simple, flexible, tight-fitting black or white T does perfect.&gt; but not to fix it, lol.

Wha...wha...what’s the point!?!?

/s
...Well, I guess, *technically,* it is a star.I’d say INTJ animal would be more like an octopus or spider. Independent, willful, self-regimented animals which are capable of a lot of extreme things. Cats are too lazy, social, and undisciplined to be INTJ, despite cats being kinda lonery themselves. Maybe cats are more like ISFP for domestics and ISTP for big cats. Lions can be EXTJ because they’re weird.ENTJ - Harris's Hawk (hawks that hunt in packs)

INTJ - Spider

ESFP - Dolphin

ISFP - Domestic Cat

ESTP - Wolf

ISTP - *Panthera* minus lions

ENFJ - Dog

INFJ - Mouse/Rat

INTP - Owl

ENTP - Parrot

ISFJ - Chinchilla

ESFJ - Rabbit

ISTJ - Hummingbird

ESTJ - *Hymenoptera* 

INFP - Harbor Seal (solitary seals)

ENFP - *Mustelidae*

Bonus: Humans - ESFJ, Lions - EXTJ

EDIT: Switched ENFP to Mustelids, ISTJ to Hummingbird.No problem!Again I swear I mean it in a good way! Pigs are amazing animals! But I really think it fits.That’s another good one. Mustelids in general really.&gt; he has that I DONT CARE ABOUT PEOPLE but secretly I do thing going on.

stfu kys&gt; I don’t have any ISTP friends. 

Me neither. In fact, I don’t know if I’ve known anyone well that was another ISTP. Makes me think we’re more rare than 3-5%.Probably INFP as that’s my functional opposite and because holy fuck would it be a trip.A responsible person folds their socks.

A responsible ISFJ would fold their and your socks.ENTP daughter.

I don’t know why but I’d think it’ll be a hilarious combo.get outI won’t be thinking about anything at all and this happens.I do now.

I have a feeling everyone loves me and yet I have no idea why. Like I help someone with one little thing and they’re all like OMGHEYWANNAGETSOMETHINGTOGETHERBESTFRIENDFOREVER and in bewilderment I comply.I just ate an 8-scoop 3-banana split in a little less than 15 mins, I don’t know if you want to be me right now.Why the fuck is this on here?

Either way good bot.I just do it for discussion and memes. You all get into it a bit too much. Maybe that’s why there’s such good discussion though. And memes.Just to clarify, both “thinking” and “feeling” are rational behaviors. To me at least, “judging” and “rationalizing” are synonyms in MBTI."Responsibility is cool, but there's more things in life,

Like getting ya dick, rode all fucking night."

ISTPI can imagine being like Edon Shakaar from DS9. 

Join a resistance cell firstly for personal reasons, become so skilled at being a resistance fighter/terrorist they end up becoming a leader. When the resistance wins, they’ll reluctantly become the new Leader of the Free World and hate it until we hook up with a former comrade and get into the swing of things then it becomes O.K but still stressful. Personally, Napoleon is a clear-cut historical ENTJ. Gregarious and socially successful, always thinking ten steps ahead, always looking for a higher title, took things personally, thinks they can blow through every problem (and freak when they realize they can’t.) An ISTP probably wouldn’t crown themselves “emperor” just so they can say they’re an emperor (there was a little more to it but that’s the gist of why he did it.)Are you saying as an ISTP would be more able to realize Napoleon crowing himself emperor was no better than the Bourbon kings, which is reflective of XNTJ/XSFP mentality? 

I guess the former at least has some objective merit. Despite me not actually believing much of his ideas, I can’t help but sympathize with Max Stirner and his “nothing is true, everything is permitted” kind of worldview from a detached level, and I think a lot of STP’s would have the tendency to do the same, which could form into calling bullshit over some title that only mean something because people think it does.ISTP: Summer

The fuck is wrong with everyone in this post?I mean, I feel at least the mainline Bourbons had some sense of "legitimacy" given they are a cadet branch of Capet and so they had an air of unpretentiousness to them. Like, power simply fell into their lap by the rules of succession and were like "Oh...ok" and ran with it. In a sense the opposite of the upstart Bonapartes.

And I don't know much about the Spanish Bourbons, other than they are in power right now.See the no ranking is because OP hasn’t seen an ESTP. Obvious answer, right?

...right?So, basically, what's your type, and what's your connection with sports?

I'm an ENTP, and I tend to be fairweather about most sports in the world. The only three sports I probably consistently like are [Aussie Rules Football,](https://youtu.be/XMZYZcoAcU0) Soccer and most forms of Rugby (especially [Rugby Sevens!](https://youtu.be/--7ZqKkbpDg))

Anything else just seems too slow (*cough* *cough* Gridiron Football *cough* Bat-and-Ball sports *cough*) or not really much of a "spectacle" to begin with (*cough* Golf *cough*)

Oh, and I've ran track and cross country and played soccer as a midfielder in HS. Fun times!Hey everyone! Title pretty much explains everything, [so here is the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M23K79VbW3I)

Never been typed via video, I assume this adds a better dimension to view my personality. However, I don't think that I was as thorough as I've could of been with type. So, perhaps tomorrow, I could add a typed version to coincide with the video.

One thing that I didn't add is the changes since the transition from high school to college. I was a slacker in high school for the most part, and I didn't really care all too much about doing anything in or outside of school (I finished my mandatory-to-pass Physics class in high school with an extremely low D = 60.04%. I probably shouldn't be proud of that.) Now, I'm tending to be very motivated with everything in and outside of school.

Also, to know some background, originally typed as an INTP when I was 14. Around 16-17, typed as ENTP. Tests that use both a letter-dichotomy method and a cognitive function method tends to average me around an intuitive, but I have gotten pretty much everything else letter wise. Cognitive function tests also tend to have me with high use of both intuitive and thinking functions.

Thanks in advance![Here is Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/572ij3/havent_been_typed_by_someone_else_in_a_long_time/)

This is a typed version of a different test that is coinciding with the test in the video in part 1.

SCENARIO 1

FOCUS ON YOUR FEELING PROCESS HERE

Your significant other just ended your 2 year relationship quite suddenly and with no apparent explanation. Up until this point you had both been talking about marriage and last week you even went to look at rings together. Now he/she won't even return your phone calls or texts. After talking with his/her family you find out that he/she has just been diagnosed with terminal stage 4 cancer.

- Describe how this scenario would make you feel as well as what sort of influences and motivations lie behind those feelings. Why do you feel the way you do?

I really wouldn't know how to feel, really. Some sort of solemness I would suppose? I think I would also feel some sort of relief from the confirmation of why he/she hasn't been communicating with me, even though its of very unfortunate circumstances.

- In this scenario what would you honestly say the primary focus of your feelings would be? The only thing I could do with them is help my SO out the best way I can and be there for them, and try to have the best time we can while they are still here. It's all I can do.


SCENARIO 2

FOCUS ON YOUR FEELING PROCESS HERE

You are in college and this semester both you and your roommate end up in the same class together. You and your roommate get along fairly well and the living situation works but you aren't particularly close. You both typically do your own thing and are rather indifferent to each other. As the semester progresses you excel and become one of the top students in the class whereas your roommate is struggling significantly to grasp the material. The professor assigns a fairly challenging take home test that is a significant portion of your grade. He/she makes it clear that while it is open book, students are to work alone. Later your roommate comes to you begging for help after struggling with the test most of the weekend. You have already completed the assignment and he/she isn't asking to copy your answers, just to help tutor and mentor them as they struggle to complete the test, so there is no way your professor would ever know. However, this is the first time your room-mate has asked you for help this semester. He/she makes it clear that how they do on this test could mean the difference between passing and failing this class.

- How do you respond to your roommate’s request and why?

I would go ahead and help them out, does it really make a difference as long as they know the material by the end of it?

- What sort of things in this scenario stand out to you as far as having a strong influence on your decision making and why?

I would feel a basic sympathy for them, and I also tend to disagree with the policy that the professor laid out about doing the work alone. It most likely won't make a bit of difference in the real world in that regard.

- Describe the flow of your decision making process.

Most likely, I would think about what they said it in my head for a couple seconds before going ahead and just helping them out shortly after they asked. My reasons on why I should help him out and disagreeing with the professor would have already been formulated prior to the request, so saying there would of been a "flow of decision making" doesn't really fit.


SCENARIO 3

FOCUS ON YOUR LOGIC AND THINKING PROCESS HERE

Your boss calls you into his/her office in order to assign you to a new project. He/she gives you a choice between two.

Project 1 is a rather broad, expansive project covering multiple areas of company operations. It has the potential to have a very significant impact on company operations but it would require a collective effort and an extensive amount of group work where you would be logically thinking through the project together with the group of individuals your boss has also assigned to it.

Project 2 has a much more specific and narrow focus and would require a significant amount of in depth individual analysis to work through the problem. You would be working alone and the completion of the project may or may not have much impact on company operations. However, after complete the process and problem you were working on will be streamlined and fundamentally understood.

- Which project appeals to you the most, as it relates to the way you prefer to logically process information? Why?

I would like Project 2 much more, as I already have a natural tendency to deep dive into things, so it would feel like less work in the long run than Project 1.

- What sort of things in this scenario, across either project, stood out to you as having a strong influence on your decision? Why?

I like it because since I am working alone, I don't have to run on anyone else's schedule or pace, so no one else can slow me down or stress me out. Teamwork can be very irritating with me.

SCENARIO 4

FOCUS ON YOUR LOGIC AND THINKING PROCESS HERE

Your college professor has assigned you to a group project with 3 other individuals. All 3 of these individuals have a good strong work ethic and desire to contribute to the overall success of this project. You are at the first meeting of your group and the other members are tossing around valuable ideas as to the nature and direction of this project.

- Describe your behavior in this situation as you process and think about the ideas they are presenting.

I would most likely be quieter than most, as I would be taking and putting together all the information that they would be tossing around. I would, of course, talk occasionally when things come together in my head. If I could, I would start doing some sort of prototypical work as they talk and I think.

- Describe what major influences drive this behavior.

I would think before talking because I do not want to blurt out something if I did not think that whatever was in my head would not be productive towards the discussion. I would also start doing the prototypical work as I would like to have a good framework of the implementation of the ideas before I start going further.

SCENARIO 5

FOCUS ON THE SOURCES YOU DRAW NON-PHYSICAL ENERGY FROM HERE

It has been a very long week and you feel mentally and emotionally drained, but good news! It is Saturday and you have nothing significant that needs to be done. You FINALLY have some free time to yourself to recharge your batteries and do whatever you want.

- Describe what sort of activities would help you to recharge. What would you enjoy doing after a long week and why?

I usually be alone and playing around with some things, usually either a video game or a physical activity. I would also look things up and study. Generally, it would be anything that would help apply and focus my ponderous mind.

- What sort of things do you feel you draw non-physical energy from doing?

Isn't this just a rewording of the previous statement? If someone can correct me, please do.


SCENARIO 6

FOCUS ON THINKING VS FEELING HERE

You have a meeting with your college career counselor to discuss potential careers that interest you. He/she offers you a list of the following careers and asks you to pick your TOP 3. He/she asks you to take money out of the equation. Imagine all of these careers received equal compensation. Focus instead on where you would truly feel most happy and fulfilled.

Artist, Scientist, Actor, Engineer, Musician, Lawyer, Counselor, Entrepreneur, Teacher, Manager, Psychologist, Computer Programmer / Analyst, Clergy, Child Care, Medical Doctor

- What were your top 3 choices and what aspects of these careers appeal to you?

Entrepreneur, Musician, Engineer.

Entrepreneur: I like the idea of being self-employed, as I would be independent and I also can be flexible with my own schedule. Making money also doesn't hurt.

Musician: I've always romanticized with being an instrumentalist of some kind, but I could never really pick up anything to really try anything out. Music is something that appeals to me because I just tend to like picking apart the sounds from the music, and appreciating the technical aspects of what I listen to.

Engineer would be nice, as in many ways I already do that in a very casual way. If there is something broken, say with an object or something in my computer, my immediate response is to try to tinker and fix it the best way I can, usually it leads to me learning learning new things and ultimately fixing the product.

- Was it difficult or easy to pick only 3 and why?

I automatically picked Entrepreneur and Musician, just because I like both of them. Engineer came a bit later after thinking about what I do in my life that would appeal towards it.

- Prioritize the aspects of your career choices that influenced your decision, what things mattered most to you, where do you imagine finding the most fulfillment and why?

Independence, flexibility and allowance of creativity are my biggest desires. I would say I would like being an Musician or an Engineer more than a Entrepreneur, but the former two are rather tied, as I like both of them rather equally.


SCENARIO 7

Click on the image below and pay close attention to the things that jump out to you, objects, thoughts, feelings, impressions, ideas etc. What do you see?

Short Effective Scenario Questionnaire 2.0 (Self-Type)-paintedcanyon1fb.jpg

- Describe the main things that stand out to you in this picture.

It looks very relaxing to be there, IMO. The contrasts between the shadows and the sunlight give it an almost angelic aura to it. The green over the red is very nice as well.

- Why do you think/feel you focused on those things?

I guess because I like beauty XD. I've always been a fan of some good Earthporn, so this is no different.

- Describe the strength with which this photo did or did not appeal to you and why?

I think I've already did that, so we're good here.

Thoughts? Thanks in advance!Hello everyone.

I was typed as ISTP a month ago, and before then I was thought to be an ENTP. I'm just curious on how r/mbti sees the differences in the two, because when it comes to the personality archetypes I'm pretty much a synthesis of both. 

Appreciated!I remember it being somewhat prevalent on Reddit, and it being downright *awful* on PerC. However, both of these sites (but I hardly get on PerC anymore) seems like they've became more sensor friendly. Anyone wanna confirm this? 

Thanks in advance!Hello everyone,

Just a thought that I would share, is that it seems like not only through seeing it with personal experience but also with thinking about the cognitive functions, that Perceivers, or Pe/Ji types, are more likely to fall under [deontological](https://www.britannica.com/topic/deontological-ethics) ways of thinking, while Judgers, or Je/Pi types, are more likely to fall under [consequentialist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/consequentialism) ways of thinking.

To look into this further, Ji (Ti &amp; Fi) is about subjective statements about rationality, and Je (Te &amp; Fe) is about objective statements of rationality. This leads to perceivers rationalizing things internally while judgers rationalize externally.

Obviously, deontology and consequentialism at their extremes become slippery, but that doesn't mean individuals don't lean one way or the other.

What do you all think? Comments?How does it look like to you?

As an ISTP, I think I can actually be more sympathetic compared to other people, as I have a tendency to think and analyze situations. For example, my mother (ISFJ) gets on my brother (XXTJ I'd assume.) for not cleaning his room and generally being lazy, but she hardly takes into account that he works 12+ hours a day for 6 days a week, and has a child to take care of, and he's usually tired when he is home. I wouldn't know how to help in a emotional/supportive level, but I can diagnose the problem well enough.

Would anyone agree with this? Would other functions be at play here?Just tell where it started, and how it developed from there.

Thanks in advance.Hi everyone,

Just want to be accessed for the first time in a year, and hopefully get to discuss and learn about MBTI more though it. Let us get started!

**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**

I would not think so. If it counts, I was diagnosed with being "on the fringe" of the autistic spectrum, but I honestly do not believe it. I am male, 18 (bout to be 19,) and pretty content/happy at the moment.

**Please describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?**

I would say I am a relaxed, but confident person. Rather intelligent for my age. Present-focused. I tend to be realistic around others but more imaginative by myself. I think of myself as helpful, friendly, but not into the whole "getting closer emotionally" aspect of friendship as it can be uncomfortable at times.  I can be a bit short-sighted with people and blunt so that I can look insensitive at times. At my absolute worse, I can be purposefully iconoclastic and assertive with people, but this is *very* rare.

**What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?**

I like myself as is, honestly. I think I can be a bit more organized with things, and easier to be impassioned with certain things, but I'm good beyond that.

What would I *not* like to be? Most that I am not personality-wise, I would assume.

**Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?**

I think most who do not know me too well might describe me as shy or soft, but I would not say I am either, and I think that comes from me being quiet and not really liking conflict. Again, I'm a rather confident person, I just like my alone time. With regards to the softness/non-conflict, I'm not a pacifist, I just have a high bar of when something is worth fighting for, mainly because as mentioned, I do not get attached to a lot of things.

**What in life do you find to be of importance? Why? If you are unsure you can always take the Value Test and post the results here. Do note that it helps if you narrow it down to 20 or ideally 10 values as suggested at stage 2**

Yeah, I couldn't really narrow it down to 25, and I'm not going to waste that much time on it. I would say in general, from not in any order: Freedom, Independence (not quite the same thing as Freedom IMO,) Creativity, Enjoyment, Pragmatism, Realism, Self-Control, Precision, Honor.

**How do you react to new situations in your life? Can you describe an event in your life where you were in an unknown situation? How did you deal with it?**

Be quiet, observe what is going on, pick up on it, and drop in from there. 

**Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why? Real life experiences are welcome.**

I tend to be offish, wanting to do my own thing, and everything "becomes a blur." I'm not the type to stress out over much unless I am around people who do, and that pressure starts to stress me out when they drag me into it. 

**Please describe yourself when you are in an enjoyable situation. How do you act and why? Real life experiences are welcome.**

I get very relaxed and friendly, I tend to have a dry sense of humor, and it comes out better when I enjoy myself. More open to other people.

**Describe your relationship to socialisation. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?**

I would say that I am more constantly effective one-on-one, but my most enjoyable experiecnes in my life were from hanging with a group of people. Indifferent to the idea of socialization in of itself, it depends on the context.

**Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?**

*SESAIEHTEE*

A little bit of the same. I honestly think most people mean well, but people are too short-sighted to realize it when it is crucial and get riled up over things that are not worth the energy.

**Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?**

I have no opinion of authority in of itself, but I will respect an authority when it respects me, and vice versa. I also want to be left to my own devices, so I can say that me and authority do not interact all to much either way.

**Describe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?**

One person's chaos is another person's order and vise versa. It all depends on what kind of person I am at the moment.

**What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?**

I think not being able to take care of myself would suck, as in not being able to provide for myself, even though I'm rather spartan for my needs. Not being able to do what I want is also a bummer, couldn't stand to live in an authoritarian country.

**What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?** 

Do not know just yet, I am only 18 and is currently acquiring a double major for Journalism and PolSci, and I might look to do something in that field. However, I am also looking to explorer professional wrestling (The WWE kind, not the Olympic kind) so I am still open at the moment. Absolutely would love to travel though.

**a) What activities energize you most? b) What activities drain you most? Why?**

a) Music can energize me. I was listening to some crust punk today, could not help but jump around the house! It can take awhile, but physical activity can also bump me up. Imagination helps too.

b) Doing something that does not have a point. Being around people for too long (I *hate* clubs/dances,) C-SPAN pre-Trump Administration.

I think that is all. I might do another questionnaire via video since I tend to be more comfortable and natural talking, but for now, this will do.

Thanks, everyone!Quite simply, put your MBTI type, and then take [this political simulator/test](http://filteries.com/politics) where you design the politics of your ideal country and screenshot your results.

[My results.](http://i.imgur.com/MYdoin1.png)[removed]Encourage other types to open up the same dialogue about themselves.[removed]Hello everyone,

The reason I bring this up, initially, was due to looking at type frequencies initially posted. I am a little skeptical about them, but in general, it seems like SJ's gravitate towards the upper end, then SPs, then the NFs and finally NTs. With the latter two, XNTPs and XNFPs especially become more common than their judging counterparts.

I question the validity of the frequencies in total, but I have been doing a personal project where I have been typing people based on an open-ended questionnaire. With it, I have seen far more people type as XSXJ and XNXP than the opposites. It's making me wonder if others see something similar in their lives, and if so why do you think this might be

Thanks in advance![removed][Link to video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWPyTfk5_Xo)

This will probably be at least a +eight video series over an unspecified time, and it will also more than likely transform into something more. I will first talk about each letter in ISTP, then each cognitive functions, and then finally common ISTP stereotypes.

I merely wanted to post this first video to gain an interested audience, and also to get some feedback on how they liked the video, from both a technical standpoint and a qualitative one.

Thanks in advance everyone, and enjoy!I’ve been watching DS9 and am about to watch Discovery when I’m done. Figured to hear what people have to say about characters all over the Trek universe. I’ll just do DS9 because that’s the freshest in my head.

B Sisko: XNFJ (I’m a little unsure of him.)

Kira: ...ESFJ? (I’m really unsure of her, great character though.)

O’Brien: ISTJ (I can see arguments for ISTP though.)

Dax: Curzon seemed ESTP, Jazida seems like a more mature Curzon, so ESTP too?


J Sisko: ISFP (I think this is my most solid typing.)

Bashir: ENFJ (wtf is with all these betas on this station)

Odo: ISTJ stereotype

Quark: ESTJ

Rom: ISFJ

Nog: I can see arguments for EXTJ and EXFJ.

Garak; ENTP stereotype

Dukat: ENFJ (I have my reasons...)

Bareil: INTP?

Wynn: ISFJ, the unhealthy version, not like Rom.

Leeta: EXFP

**WOOORRRFFF:**ISXJ

This is all I can think of at the moment. I’m starting Season 5 so don’t try and spoil too much 😉


I’m just curious and bored, I don’t have any strong reasonings, but here are my educated guesses:

Big E: ENTJ, I think The Last Church really showed Inf-Fi, otherwise, I’d actually put him more like ENXJ.

Rowboat: ESTJ

Corax: INTP?

Magnus: INTP

Horus: ENTJ?

Rogal Dorn: ISTJ

Sanguinius: EXFP

Vulkan: Fe-dom?

Perturabo: ISTP

Jaghatai Khan: ISTP

Lion El’Jonson: INTJ

Leman Russ: ESTP?

Angron: ***RRRRRAAAAAAHHHHHHH***

-

And the rest I have no idea about. Not really many feelers on the list, which is interesting. Do anyone else have better ideas?I don’t care if this was a roast tartigrades are metal af.Disregarding all models of relationships/MBTI, I kinda have a crush on a confirmed ESFJ at the moment so...yeah.

She’s very structured, institutionally successful, and can easily preform warmth in her interactions. I find myself lacking in some of these characteristics and I think I could provide balance to that (she’s also kinda neurotic and finds it hard to be detached, which I personally can’t relate.)

Plus she’s cute.Ayy good choices.I can’t imagine people not liking cookie dough icecream.Meditate for 15-20 minutes. Lie down, close your eyes, and breath slowly and deeply, focusing completely on your breaths. 

When done, your brain will be more attuned keeping your mind on focusing on activities you’re doing instead of random thoughts. Maybe go for a walk or a jog after and let your mind go blank.So is a little twink clown hot to you?

Because while I disagree, I do get it. I really do.DEMOLISHING us with FACTS and LOGIC over here.Tumblr is like that friend that’s really weird and you’d never have them in your wedding yet you always have a rememberable, interesting conversation with them.Oh, I was just making a moment to meme against his pretentiousness. I’m good. Thanks for the concern though.I thought it was Greek.

On an honest note, could be. You’re supposed to be attracted to people who have similar functions to yours, but that’s according to socionics which I personally find a bit iffy.STANDING AT THE CONCESSION

/sJungian Typology is based on the works of the eponymous Carl Jung. Jung was a staunch believer in nature in the “nature vs nurture” debate and thought humans develop their personality in the womb, not their life experiences.

So, classically, no. You have one type and you stick with it throughout. I think it’s probably possible for you to switch with heavy mental trauma, where your brain changes itself to adapt, but otherwise I tend to agree with Jung in MBTI terms *although* experience has *a lot* to do with how your personality is manifested.Holy shit, the way you described your room...

I don't think that's a serious concern. 

I'd be more worried about someone judging me because of my type in a workplace situation - Oh look at that EP. They'll be useless in actually getting anything done and will just want to gossip all the time.What are you doing wrong that you have to study 13 hours a day? That leaves you with no time to do anything else.

How have you not burned out?What it means to be an Fi-dom Nobel Prize winner.

Congrats to him.So what's your 8-13 hours of study a day like?

Are there breaks worked into that? When do you find time to exercise?

If you hit your target 13 hours a day of study how much sleep are you getting?

To me that's an insane amount of study. Literally two orders of magnitude (at least) more than I did.I like ISTP too. Could be more active though.I'd rather have a great reputation in a small town than a good reputation in a city.

In a small town literally anyone you screw over, personally or in business will get talking to other people. And if your town isn't too far away from others, then it's easy enough to get whatever your job is in from the other towns.

Having a good reputation in a city on the other hand is "yeah this guy's good. But we should see if we can get X top tier company"Praise our lord and saviour cognitive functions! 

For once they understand this we shall never have to worry about if we are F or T, P or J. (some) Bonds are ESTPs, so is Sterling Archer, thus ESTPs make the best spies.Nah I know where I am on the curve. 10. #IAMVERYSMARTI did work at uni with stat analysis of data, so if you have a large enough sample I might be able to make some pretty pictures. That is if you don't have anyone lined up already/with more knowledge.How many can you get? Haha

But seriously probably 10, 20+ from some of the S types would be great (given how quiet the subs are), and I can only imagine that there are already plenty of NTs and NFs who have responded.

I started running and had to unlearn that habit (while running at least) since it was loading my ankle, knee and hip wrong.I just walk quietly everywhere. It causes me to accidentally sneak up on people. Are there functions you're trying to decide between? Just asking for descriptions/experiences of all functions might not be the most efficient way to get your typeHa classic ESTP overrating themselves. 

*sips drink and hopes no one notices me doing the same*Where can I meet ENTJs who like anal?That description sounds pretty ESXP though.I think Ti/Te are two that have lots of ways to measurably improve them through the education systems in most western countries, not to mention the techniques/books that are available to help people "learn".

Fe/Fi are more difficult to develop through methodical training (keep in mind I'm not saying practice/experience) since you end up with frankly awful results like pick up artists and things like that.I'm super offended ENTP is so low on the list. /sYeah that's why I'm offended and not arguing!1.

But it shits me so much if they bring it up in a couple of weeks/months with the same shitty arguments that the lost with last time.)What's the basis for assigning male/femaleness to the functions? Is it the pop distribution? I'd really like to read about the basis of your F/T distinction Yeah mbti can be pretty flaky at times. 

I like to use it here since you can find groups of people who identify with certain traits (or want to... thanks intj).

Thanks for your answer.It actually explains a lot about how I've perceived IQ tests over the years.I'd like to add a couple like 

* have you heard...?

* I read something one time

* this one time

* how about...?If you figure this out can you let me know? I'd also like to know if I'm estp.I think the Ne for me has a lot to do with my experiences growing up, probably as a coping mechanism for all the negative possibilities that Ne generates, I've been weighted or biased against them, so that generally the only things that stick are likely negative scenarios (as any healthy person would think about) and the positive/optimistic results/possibilities. 

Which has overall given me a generally happy appearance. So for starters stay very wary that someone typing you through text isn't in the best position to type you accurately. 

As for which type you are, yeah that can be all over the place. And the ennegram? Good luck with that, it just describes temperament, so depending on how in depth you went in your other descriptions will tell how close/far that diagnosis is.

What's 4 types like? I'm a 7w6 myself and I'm an anxious runner."Not concerned with the outcome" pretty much sums up how I process information through Ti. I would love to know how many times my mind has checked out once I thought I understood something then missed something important.Actually he made some really interesting promises that seem like great ideas until you investigate the wider implications of them.

I guess you can conclude for me my reasoning is good and I'm lucky.Maybe all N/Fe? I found that pretty relatable too.But how can you plan for what the EXTPs are going to do when even they don't know until they do it?Are the clouds like concepts which have all kinds of attached meanings and implications and then the clouds can kind of lock together when an idea is related to another one?I agree, I'd have guessed that it's an Fi stack that would say something like this. 

Apparently it's inf Fe so guess I'm wrong.

That attitude you've described with your friend seems strange to me since it judges value on intent not action, does it cause conflict with other people if they are judged by their actions rather than their intents? Or does your friend manage to separate the two?Just looking at your scores and not considering anything else (populations of different types etc), you're probably ENFP or INFP, with your higher scores in Fi and Si, with almost equal T. Also you N and F are higher than S and T. Going to tag on here, VOE-C debater. 

Shocking. Though I'm not sure I'm reading it correctly, I was just skimming. That's an interesting stack. 

Probably INFP or INTP.

Which function do you relate more to, Fi or Fe from a description perspective rather than use? Similarly with Te/Ti? 

E: Might also be those but extroverted. Are you an extrovert op? Right then I'd guess you're an INFP. 

With a small, but not negligible possibility you're an ISFP, given the horrific bias towards N on the tests.
 Ti and Te are both logic. They're just expressed slightly differently. 

I'm also of the opinion that logical thinking is much easier to train than changing where your values are from. Hence my value of your Fi over Ti.

Similarly I'm in the 4 function camp rather than socionics, with its crazy 8.

You're sounding more like an INFP with your response. I disagree with your theory that Es need people to be on their side. 

I agree that how you describe it is how ENTPs would react to that situation.ENTP, I'd like to second this but also where I get to explore (like the person's favourite book, or something formative from them) or experience something with the person. 5/7 very meta.I'm inclined to think Tyler Durden is an ENTP purely because it's really neat as a flipped ISFJ, which of course only holds if you think he's an ISFJ in the first place. 

Jack is ESTP for sure though. And Sterling Archer if you're adding to the list. &gt;Ti/Fe users focus on what the underlying principles of the system are; it's not satisfied with merely knowing how the system works and how it can be implemented but rather seeks to understand why it operates in that particular way. 

See with this I don't understand how someone can use a system effectively (or at all) if they don't understand the underlying principles. Magic boxes give me the shits.

Yeah that's what the test said as well. 

My friend is really learn by example/doing things once though, once something is shown to him once he'll be able to repeat it surprisingly well straight away, as if he's been doing it for ages.

And he's a jungian extrovert, so that's what made me question the test results.Cats are pure Fi though.I'm not meme trash. I'm meme recycling.&gt;I'd say everything matters. The best way to prove this is to take away an ingredient and too see how it effects the product.

If everything matters then nothing matters,

&gt;For example try making a cake without flour.  You'd end up with burnt butter eggs and sugar. *The butter matters*

Don't you end up with sugary scrambled eggs?

&gt;Try to create a family with one person. *The other person matters.*

Define family, one person could easily be a functional atomic family unit. 

&gt;Imagine an atom without protons.  *The protons matter.*

Well obviously protons are matter. Pretty sure neutrons and electrons are pretty cool chilling by themselves in the universe. Something different but I'm sure they'd make it work.

&gt;Things definitely DO "matter" 

Things don't matter.

So like other people here have said it's a coping mechanism. And it's logically consistent too.

1. A person is physically incapable of caring about literally everything. 

2. Will being serious at that instant change/fix what's wrong?

If yes, then your ENTP is immature, if no, then they're coping.

It's more complicated than that because you can introduce things like satire, but there's the basic premise. Sure. What's that got to do with this?Well I agree with that, way to change the goalposts by swapping the definitions. Is this supported by data or is it anecdotal? It could be a traditional gender roles kind of thing.Nice snookering.So here's the subreddit numbers as of a few hours ago. On reddit they are the minority because they're out in the world, actually doing things.

https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/5gtiz7/mbti_subreddits_data/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=linkFor what it's worth (more data for you I guess) I feel like I develop relationships (friends and more) with introverts more easily than with extroverts, but I think the variance in E interactions is higher (higher highs, lower lows).There's probably a correlation though. From an energy and emotional perspective there would be less pressure for an introvert to stop being shy than for an extrovert. I think this means we win.I don't think it would be related to the introverted part of the value function. I think it would be perfectly reasonable for someone operating Fe based values to be determined, ambitious etc, just their reasons might be different. E.g. providing for their family as a driver for determination and ambition.

You could also argue that the most logical thing to do in most situations is maximize the use of your resources, opportunities and thus ambition and determination are Tx based attitudes. I'd be interested if there wasn't loads of evidence that it's produced easily falsified predictions, been proved to be little more than guesswork authorised by mainstream media (traditionally print), even if it is an amusing little joke that goes with the puzzles and comics in newspapers, it's apparently taken seriously by people. Which is insane.So you guys all have ONE favourite song? But what about all the other amazing songs or the songs you really like in particular situations? 

Also not that random a question. 

ENTP, Hunting for witches - Bloc Party, has been a favourite of mine for years. I picked that for me because it's been one of my top songs for years now, I don't think I've listened to it in 3 months. There's just so much good stuff out there...Depends on what you're using it for. If you're using it to predict what people will do, you're going to have a bad time, since psychology is currently awful with point predictions. 

If you're using this to group people into parties that have similar values and approaches to life, then there's significant value since it's either tested or selected, not just assigned randomly by when your parents decided to get busy.If your type is similar to one of the signs it's coincidence since the signs are deliberately vague as to make them universally applicable OR specific enough that they're going to provide many counter scenarios. You'd think one of them would've seen it. 

That was lazy of me. I'll see myself out.That's a dinosaur. Checkmate theists.I resent the comment that ENTPs can't finish anything. We can as  Is it still 0000 0000?And occasional obsessiveness to prove a point with a talent for semantics. I thought strong gesturing was a cultural thing. How about "mate"? 

Is there a chance you've run into a local habit? I'm legally obliged to call people "mate" or if they're on the wrong side of the ditch, "Bro"Why does inf. Si factor into this?So what you're saying is that everyone else is incompetent at being loyal?You'd probably be able to type the hulk in later series where he's developed more of a  personality. Though how much of that is Bruce maybe someone with more knowledge of the stories could correct me.What are you trying to achieve? 

If you're going to propose that all 8 functions are used then how well do you use the 3rd? How well the 7th? If all 8 are utilized without preference why stack them in an order? 

If only the first 4 are used meaningfully then why bother with the next 4? 

As for the dividing I think it was done in a book one time by one author and it stuck. (Sorry can't remember the name of it).Are 3s commonly NTPs? I know e types are not a limiting thing but they do tend to clump.Which part of a warm southern country? And if they also have their starsign next to it they're not getting swiped right.Chandler Bing for a more "real life" ENTP.

Then you've got the debatable ones like Tyler Durden, Sterling Archer and House. (Yes I know there's strong evidence for them being other types, but there's also evidence for them not. So my point stands)Yep. 

TD is an ISFJ delusion, which makes it really neat for him to be an ENTP. Really the linchpin of his Se is "hit me" which you can ignore or not.

Archer is drunk all the time, combined with his wandering interests and the way he comes up with his ideas plus his total obliviousness. His situational awareness really isn't that good, he's been training for years to pay attention to things he'd normally not. It's up for debate.I'd like to have kids and I don't mind the time, cost, lifestyle change that is related to all that.

At the same time the idea of having kids terrifies me. The though that you can do everything you can for them and you'll still fail them as a parent scares me like little else. 

I recently read a thing about creepy things kids say to their parents so I'm firmly in the "no kids" camp at the moment, but will swing back when the creep wears off.

ENTP m mid 20s btw. What if your partner is also indifferent?  Only one bot? There were two here before Christmas. 

E: Ooh wrong sub.

Anyway yeah I was thinking I might fold to my partner's preference but who knowsGo outside and have fun. You'll be neck deep in Se doms/Aux before you know it.5/7 would recommend test to friends. Not sure if it helps you decide but I'd not get annoyed but actually intrigued as to how the person came to that conclusion about me.

Ne/Fe here so maybe since it's never happened such I've noticed maybe I am just what everyone sees.When I slow down and think about specific words, sentences or frameworks for ideas then it's the same voice as if I was sub-vocalising.

Typically I'll be using my inner voice if I'm reading something on reddit or news or something like that. It helps me process the information accurately. 

If I'm reading a narrative then it won't so often have the words as I will just be straight up imagining the things that I'm reading, as perfect accuracy and response isn't needed. 

Entp.Ok... let's find the comment that I made about this rubbish the last time this came up...

I've been meaning to go through the astrology posts on the MBTI subs and then compile the results to prove there's no link. But if OP could do that for me that would save me A LOT of time and effort.

This comes up about every week and each time there's no link shown.

I'm interested as to why you think there's a link between human behaviour and the stars/planets? What evidence do you have? 

Also there aren't any studies that prove astrology is anything scientific. Otherwise it would be welcomed into science, cause that's how science works.So you're saying that human psyche directly effects the positions of the planets/stars?By telling us at the beginning you're biasing us against providing a second opinion! 

Such an estp move. So both the planets and the stars, and human minds are being changed by a third factor that we can't detect, in such a complicated way that there's never been any proven link that actually predicts anything between the planets and the stars (things that are described very accurately and predictably through physics) and the human psyche? Though I'm a guy, hypothetically I'd probably like the donor to be screened for genetic diseases or predisposition towards types of cancer etc.

Then following that I'd like a background similar to mine, which I admit is purely an ego thing.

After that I'd probably want an NTP.Nah. I don't like the risks with women gestating children, let alone for a process to force a guy to do it.

It's pretty tough to see me agreeing to do something like that when I'm questioning if I'd even want children in the first place. But they're definitely going to be nurtured into an ENTP.So really it's time dependant and has nothing to do with the planets.what synchronicity? That's interesting, but at the same time it's not predictive. It would be nice to see that website presented coherently and with more data than just the last 80 years.

I wasn't paying much attention to the specifics since my knowledge of history isn't that precise, but what is the next prediction for (did I read at the end it was due around the end of last year?)

Without the specific knowledge of events and dates I can't provide counters to the ideas, but it raises some questions like:

* How big is a collective? I.e. does it take something the size of Israel or larger before the influence starts?

* What are the "collectivist tendencies" (i think that's what it was called) that are proposed/supported when the planets are in particular positions? 

* It mentioned Pluto, what about the other planetoids (or whatever they're called now) in the system? Surely if Pluto is involved the others would be too. And if they're not, why not?

* Are there really no counter examples to disprove these claims? I feel like this is being very selective with its evidence and making it seem like there's a link where there isn't. Again I'm not too knowledgeable on a year by year basis since I hadn't been born at the time.Well that pretty much ends my questions, since I have some reading to do. Thanks for actually providing some explanation and evidence, which is more than I usually get in these conversations. Se because they do before they think.

Ne because it comes out in a burst and doesn't get filtered

Si because in the past the bandage being pulled off quicker was less painful

Ni because it's occurred to them and they need you to know.

Ti because the flaw is illogical. 

Te because they need you to know how you're wrong so you can fix it.

Fi because it conflicts with your values and that's not acceptable. 

Fe because the values don't match and you need to resolve which of you are wrong.Though at the same time the groups most likely to have random skills that turn out to be super useful are the TPs, so maybe their survivability is higher than you'd initially expect.Well it's not our fault if we do know everything. 

Though I'd totally die by misidentifying a plant or mushroom or amphibian and telling everyone that it's not toxic, and not following the proper steps to determine if it is or not. It's kind of a harmony through conflict. By ripping apart the things that are wrong/illogical you're left with reality or logic or whatever and thus should have a harmony base line to work towards.I'm super disappointed this wasn't the setup for a joke.

An INFJ, INTJ and an INFP walk into a bar.How: It's like the opposite of meditation. 

In meditation you're trying to finish a thought and then not start a new one, with daydreaming you pick one thought and you keep building onto it.

Do I get lost: it's practically my day job.

Are they unrealistic: Well depends on what you think of as unrealistic.  


(Also your unrealistic is a lot more realistic than my unrealistic. Like you're seeing your crush - per your example, at a physical place that exists in reality right? I'm seeing my crush riding like a dragon or something and being like "get on if you want to live". Yes my crush may be Arnie in this example but that's not important.)This came up on ENTP a few times and the most mentioned ones were quality time and acts of service or words of affirmation. But at the same time there was a mix of the other languages. 

So the result of that is a resounding maybe. There's some smoke but no evidence of a fire yet. 

But I do love me some quality time and have no understanding of gifts. Well technically the bodies all orbit each other, just because of the difference in sizes the orbit point is within one of the bodies.I'm going to echo the other ENTPs here and tell you to work on your depression foremost before worrying about your career. 

I can't tell you how to get stars in your eyes but what helped me most in my low (apathetic) times was exercise and socialising.

I've since realised that my worst time was when I'd cut myself off from all my friends to finish my thesis, and I almost gave up on my degree even though I was about 3 weeks from finishing it (after 4.5 years of courses).

So go to college, get involved in everything you can even if you don't think you can do it, you'll find time and develop your skills at the same time. 

Also would I have worked harder in college? Yeah. For sure. But I'd also have not wasted as much time so I could go harder on weekends and parties.I read it as the opposite, which is why I commented.

It seemed like it was presented as a dichotomy where the middle responses would be seen as rediculous.Pay off your non-increasing debt?There are plenty of people who had never been bullied who were bullies. You have to be in a position of power in some way to bully someone. You're unqualified.How so? 

Emotionally, physically, socially, hierarchically, I'm sure there's more.

If you don't have power over someone in some way how would you bully them?Lies, social power. Gaslight, I guess is relationship/emotional power.

You need power to do anything, ever. This isn't different. No they don't have the power to bully me, because they don't have any power over me.Anything they can do with real effects on me would amount to a once off, which makes it harassment not bullying.

Great argument though.&gt;Who told you you have too big of an ego for being an ENTP? 

Is this possible? I'm pretty sure all the ENTPs I know run on concentrated ego.

I am done with being an ENTP then.  
  
Now I am an ENTJ...GET OFF REDDIT AND GET BACK TO WORK YOU PEOPLE!!!Yeah me too...Oh wellDefinately.Humans are human, and part of being human is  making assumptions based on a random pattern or slight feeling that could have occurred by chance...if one does not take the time to assess this occurrence in a logical manner. I agree completely that it is foolish to base any decision larger than what coffee to buy off of mere "feelings".  It would be so nice if people could not voluntarily give into, and even glorify their irrationality.  
  
By the way, what type are you? Just curious.And I don't like fruit on frozen yogurt....Those annoy me too! If you can't read my flair, I am an ENTP and from the people I know in the non-Reddit world, all those seem to be general NT pet peeves.Well, this is always quite the challenge for me. If they outright deny their ignorance, I usually try to debate with them... for most of these types, it doesn't work but I tend to argue instinctually before remembering that.

For those who just ignore it, I (not-so-nicely) remind them a couple of times, before I get so fed up that I ask what their deal is.  If they don't have a good answer or fix it, then I spend as little time as possible interacting with them from that point on.Me three
*People who lose things*

I feel you pointing at me and my ENTPeopleI agree. People need to be prepared to listen to other arguments and defend their perspective.

Us ENTPs must annoy the crap out of you"People who eat pizza with a knife and fork. Seriously, if you do that, go fuck yourself"

I hate that. And how about people who meticulously blot their pizza with the napkin before eating it?Smart answerThis was going to be my list, but you wrote it out for me better than I could have. Thank you for taking care of that! Yup.I know multiple people who take a napkin and, yes, dry off their pizza. They say that they are taking off the oil to "reduce calories". Because pizza is diet food without it.A lot of SXJs seem to do it for whatever reason. Let me know if you figure this out before I do.True.But indirectly, doesn't lying, stealing, and the like hurt others also? So it really comes down to that one basic moral absolute of working for the good of your fellow humans.I also think that a couple of examples would be nice. True, or what possibly could happen because of it.Same to all of youDoot dootWhy should you be so serious?I noticed that ENTP is at the end of the child squad, which makes me wonder what it is bordering with.How about you clone yourself and do both?Hello! It seems like people of the same MBTI type tend to be annoyed by similar groups of people. What kinds of people/ways that people act annoy you and what is your MBTI type? Maybe there will be a pattern here...let's find out![removed]I can't believe how many people actually responded to "Types of People that Annoy You By Type" (if you want to look at it, it is this thing: https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/59qrl0/types_of_people_that_annoy_you_by_type/)


There seemed to be many patterns here as far as who was annoyed by whom, which makes me wonder the opposite question. What types of people make everything better for you? And what is your MBTI?
