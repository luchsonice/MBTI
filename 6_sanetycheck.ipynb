I don't think the body types are real \"types\" like personality types are, more clusters or tendencies (because it seems that you can be kind of on the border between types for instance), but maybe in the future I can make heat maps or something to display the intersection and also that there's not a perfect correlation.\n",

      "-------------------\n",
      "Oh I understand. It‚Äôs not something that comes naturally but something I work on and find ways around. Honestly writing everything down has helped me so much. E.g. Buying a new car. 1). I would make sure I have given myself sufficient time to decide. 2) I would make a notes list on my phone of all the pros and cons (Some may come to me in that moment, some may pop up randomly throughout a week or month) 3) I would number them from most to least important TO ME. That should help me come to a decision. Understanding you have inferior Ti doesn‚Äôt mean you need learn to be amazing at it, just better than before. Personally I think being logical all comes down to your own principles of validity. Which you work on by going through these steps with different scenarios. Eventually you‚Äôre able to see connections and do them at the top of your head.\n",

      "-------------------\n",
      "Your point is that adults can‚Äôt get an reading of their true type because they‚Äôve been shaped by past life events, but you‚Äôre forgetting teens can‚Äôt get a handle on their true type because their brain and personality development hasn‚Äôt solidified, the test reading is going to be a snapshot in time rather than a reliable predictor going forward, teenagers are also more likely to succumb to more idealized sense of self based on what is popular at the time... I.e. a need to be cool/accepted. Older adults who have already passed this stage of life experience that to a lesser degree. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, adults are shaped by life events... that‚Äôs part of life. No one can avoid it, anymore than a teen can say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about fitting in or popularity at all... not even a little bit‚Äù\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Cool, I see your point. But from my experience exploring MBTI with those in their 30s and even up to people in their 60s, there is a sense of self-awareness that their go-to preference is because of their line of work and not how they would answer if in their free time. You can easily get past this just by asking ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù As in ‚ÄúWhy do you prefer quiet activities?‚Äù And they can easily differentiate between an inner preference ‚ÄúI like solitude‚Äù vs. external influence ‚ÄúMy workplace is so loud, my ears just need a break... but I like to spend time at home writing my friends‚Äù \n",
      "\n",
      "When interviewing teens it‚Äôs often harder for them to really articulate the motivation behind why their preference is in place. Many times when you press for an answer and ask ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù The answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know... it just is‚Äù but later as you prove you realize it‚Äôs because of social influences not internal ones. Older adults are so much easier to type correctly. You don‚Äôt have to dig for info and the motivations are much more clear.\n",

With my intj ex, we could introvert together, we could still be in the same room and just let each other be. The istp can't introvert if I'm even in the same house. She needs complete alone time, with no other humans in her vicinity. I respect that, but then it seems like it's 'out of sight out of mind for her.' I just don't exist at all, while she's in her introvert-mode. After a week or so I call her, because if I didn't I think she could go on for weeks maybe even months. \n",

We do actually have some things in common and we have fun together and we can have very deep conversations where we just connect. Something I also missed in my past relationship... but then it's like she just switches. Shuts down and shuts me out, like I've exhausted her Fe or something. Which I might have, but this hot and cold is kinda confusing for me. When she's hot everything is really good and I feel everything I give is returned ten-fold. when she's cold... It's like I just get whooshed out of existence. Compared to her my intj ex was a fuzzy little love-bear... and that says a lot, but I also didn't connect the same way mentally with any other girl, but emotionally is important too, and yes it goes both ways, lately I just feel like I've been clapping with one hand.\n",

I feel like someone watched how enfjs work n like made some connection between nice and love.  I nice give love.  No, women like me for my demeanor, looks, and personality.  Definitely not because I'm nice.\n",

      "But do you feel as if the trait of niceness has been corrupted by those who wish to use it for manipulative means?  I often think of this problem as I'm aware of the manipulative \"nice\" guy vs. the good guy.  So I am careful with being nice, because I do not want it misinterpreted.\n",

Because ENFJs are bad in their own way we just sweep up the pieces well lol. I don't know, its such an interesting concept.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Well, it's actually really hard for me to read her feelings. She's said \"She likes me.\" that's about it, she's not very good with words, she straight up told me that if I need her to say something sweet or kind to me, I should tell her when I need to hear it. lol, I don't think she got that the whole point was me wanting to hear her say that stuff without me asking for it. She is better at showing affection though. She's very affectionate physically and she does a lot of small things for me, which is (by her own words)  also how she shows that she cares about someone. \n",
      "\n",
      "We allready talked about the introvert thing in the beginning. That's actually one of the first things she brought up, because it was something that came between her and her ex. At that time it didn't seem like it would be a problem, because she basically just needs some alone time... I didn't think it would be a problem for me, I'm still not sure if it really is. It's more the \"ghosting\" that is. I did text her yesterday and tell her that even though I respect her need for alone time and understand, I'd still like to and need to know that she's still on this earth. She texted back and said she understood and apologized. This morning she sent me a text that said. \"I'm alive.\" ...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't know. I can't read her and I'm not used to that. I'm usually pretty good at reading people.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "I've noticed this pattern with the SFs in my life! I don't mind it. As long as I get some kind of empathy, I'll be open to hearing advice, even if I know it's not perfect for my situation--it's coming from a good place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haha yeah I think the ST approach can be a bit jarring. I had a roomie who was ISTJ once and her approach was like, \"Oh yeah, you're in X situation because you made Y bad decision. You need to do Z.\" Brusque, but she wasn't wrong! She also stated really clear boundaries about living together, which I appreciated. Like she let me know I could use her knives, but that she was always going to make smoothies at 6 am and I'd just have to deal. I valued her being upfront, whereas I'm probably more like, \"My house is your house!\" but I'm quietly holding onto 10 things that annoy me before I'll say anything lol.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "I want proof lol \n",
      "No I am joking, I haven't gotten along with ESFJ's except one who felt like an ENFJ. But I'm sure there's definitely more mature people in the same type. Unfortunately I was banned from the ESFJ sub üòÇ\n",
      "I had some questions and wanted to get closer to the type. I also commented when some unstable ones had really manipulative behaviors. That wasn't appreciated. üôÑ\n",

      "ALL ESFJs I know are SUPER popular because they are often the only person who every one can talk to without any stress and without thinking they will say things behind their backs, and they know EVERYONE in the city, its honestly amazing how you good guys got on this part, but many complain that they dont have time to themselves, which I guess is a pretty common ocurrence for esfjs, they are all very nice people and I can see why theyre super popular lol.\n",
      "-------------------\n",
      "Exactly! I can usually tell how interested a person is in talking, and if they don‚Äôt feel like it I usually just let them be.\n",

      "I gave your history a brief scan over.  On the surface, you seem to use a lot of Fe &amp; Si.  Very ESFJ-like.  You struggle with Fi, but you seem to still try to utilize it often.   I could be totally wrong here, because I‚Äôm just shooting at a hunch, but you might have a habit of avoiding your own feelings, in lieu of making others happy.    It might make it easier to avoid negative feelings in the moment, but it can make a person feel dependent on pleasing others to feel happy about themself.   A lot of ESFJs take a ‚Äúmaking you happy makes me happy‚Äù approach to Fi, and expect the same idealogy from the people around them.   Avoid this.  It‚Äôs great that you care about making sure everyone‚Äôs happy, but remember that people will be happiest if you‚Äôre making sure you‚Äôre happy too.  If I can offer you a piece of advice; don‚Äôt be afraid to walk away from someone who tries to take advantage of that trait.  \n",

      "All In all, ESFJ seems like the right fit for you\n",

      "If it helps, I eventually realized that it was possible to really like certain traits, mindsets, or approaches to things despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt organically possess them. I figured out that it‚Äôs okay to just admire other people/types without feeling like I have to be those things, too.\n",
