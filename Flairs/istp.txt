lolI'm kinda like this. I've never decorated ever. The point of doing so never occurred to me until I went to this friends place... and I haven't felt like that in anyone's home. It was pleasant.Do u think it's like the way you think? Or how u come across to other people... like the way your room feels is how you feel to other peopleI enjoyed the responses lolU said it better than me. Lol yeah... i think how we create our living spaces says a lot about us. Like creating the vibe we feel inside of us on the outside of us kinda thing I also put the things I often use near where I sit. No pictures or posters for me. Just a printed poem to cover 2 holes on my wall.Yup minimalist is what I usually go for as well. I like to feel as though I have space. A lot of space. And the parts I havent minimalized lol is kept out of sight. Why Fe... I thought all this time he had Fi... but I had my suspicions that he might be ESTP before I made him take the test. Cause he's so athletic and just so comfortable with his environment. Likes to explore new places... eats, new ways to do work outs. Stuff like that. He says he always checks with himself. Like you okay today... How are you feeling... you made it through another day. I thought that part was Fi... Yeah I think so too nowWhat would make the distinction clearerHe could be enfj............ i looked at videos on youtube and he's like those enfj guys! I looked at estp videos and he doesnt have that hardness or that detached vibe. I mean, George Clooney is great at human interaction and all but I can't feel much warmth from him. He's polite warm. My bf is kind of soft like a teddy bear. He can get intense but he's very cuddly and warm when relaxed. He tries to be a macho type of guy but it's not in him. Smiles way too much and too friendly and cares way too much about what other people think. Lol He mentioned to me when he was young he wanted to be a marriage counselor. Lol and he feels guilty not giving certain people attention when he feels they need or want it. And reading the atmosphere in a room. Thats all Fe, right... Only reason I thought he was P cause he's so disorganized and impulsive lol But exfj is very likely for him.Being a sensor is awesomeSome kind of dramatic typePractice makes perfect. You're bad at something... work on it. Easy peasy.

Notes though. As an ISTP you work with your strengths. You're better when you condense the information. Just keep it simple. Point out only the most important stuff. That's it. I find in real conversations(or explaining stuff)... it's actually better to give summaries instead of overloading the other person with so much information.

Example:
"This phone is good"
"It has this feature"
"So good"
"Wanna try it?"
Demonstrate
Then explain functions while demonstrating
"See it can do this and that!"
"AMAYYYZING right?"

Something like that.Do ESTPLol looking forward to it B-)YesChild: high energy, liked to be around adults but they didnt like me cause i had too much energy plus i was annoying, was artistic and built stuff, climbed on things, enjoyed performing in front of adults and friends, didn't like studying, always outside exploring or playing

Tween: got into a lot of fights, participated in sports, fought with everyone, physical and verbal

Teen: learned motorcycle and boys, always rejected cause weirdo, but some guys were interested cause im nice looking until they find out what a weirdo i was lol (was abused so social skills and self-esteem both shot, down the crapper), always outside exploring towns, loved going to the beach, still got into a lot of fights, broke rules at home so family hated me, tomboyish phase

Adult: learned to navigate social environments and be feminine, can now get guys i considered beyond my league, kind of popular and well-liked at work, still get into fights but more psychological now like co-worker trying to mess with me can shut that down immediately. More focused, enjoys studying learning about the world around me. Likes being around busy, action-filled places 😊FunCurfew... skipped classes/study sessions... broke things... used stuff without permission... mess with the electronics at home... one time i vandalized the walls and strung like colored paper thingies on a chandelier before my grandma's hyperreligious, ultra conservative guests arrived to like conduct some kind of religious stuff at our house... would get people my age or those i considered underdogs to be against older family members lol i got into a lot of fights with my cousins, nieces, uncles aunts... because i wouldn't do what i'm told, kept challenging authority

On another note I read your type me post... I think you may be esfpValidationISTJWhy are you not me?Rugby *girl*Any time anyone posts a chart, I look at their Te. LmaoESTP|Healthcare|Dream job=Head honcho of some healthcare facility. Calling the shots. So I'm eyeing any position that's at the top.I mean, how did you decide you're Ti instead of Se dominant? I used to think I was ISTP until I read up more about the functions and did my own researchHi... I'm an estp 7w8 too. How do you deal with boredom? Like no one to challenge you or nothing to really do. Yeah that statement may be false or unrealistic but it feels like that sometimes for me.Lol yesYeah I had a classmate once... who would like add so many unnecessary details when she tried to explain stuff. And I would just zone out. Was funny cause when she did that once and there was another classmate listening. At the end of it, he understood what she was trying to say. And I was just like... uhh you got that from that? Cool. My brain shut down 3 secs into the conversation. I was impressed my other classmate was actually able to summarize what she said.Lol those are exactly my thoughts! I used to be so scared of like doing nothing or not working toward anything... because I feel like I would just decay. I've also asked myself the same question. What if I achieved my dreams? I'd have to keep coming up with new ones. Lol that is scary weird that you just said that. Yeah right now I'm currently building muskols so that takes my mind off things. It's when I'm alone at night that gets me. Like when the day is about to end... I feel like I'm missing out on something or didn't do enough that day. Definitely will check out those books! Thanks for the responseNot op. Am agnostic. I want to care about politics... I, sadly, don't as much as I should. But I'm all for giving people their freedom to live the way they choose as long as they ain't hurting nobody.FrfrDat Fi logicI love interacting with people. But there are times when I just don't want to deal with them.Stop telling them our secrets lolESTP. NoneThank you! This is perfSo what are your living spaces like?

I'm ISTP and just realized I don't really decorate much. And my home isn't homey at all. There's stuff in places that are not where they normally should be. And I prioritize usefulness and strategic positioning instead of the aesthetics. Then I compare it to a friends' place... and it was so warm and nice there. He's ENFP or ESFP.I made him take the test and he got ENFP but cant be sure.

* He is really into fitness. He is coordinated and stuff but he's more in his head. When I watch him train, cause he's an athlete, he doesn't really seem to understand the body mechanics or how to correct his posture or form naturally. But he has heightened senses... I'm not sure if it's from training... like one time he woke up from a car ride because he felt we were driving under water and that scared him. And he was right, we were on a bridge that time. Or he always talks about people's vibes... or the vibe of this city. And he listens to his instincts. One time I lied to him, and he knew... he couldn't have known it at all. But he said he felt I wasn't in the place where I'm supposed to be. He's been right about a lot of his hunches. So I don't know what's up with that.
* Very impulsive. Like if he thinks something... he's going to do it. He wants to buy something... he'll buy it. One time a kid was crying and he just ran toward him to comfort him. No thinking. 
* About looks. He wouldn't cut his locks unless it looked 'ugly'. Likes to buy branded clothing.
* He likes giving people advice about life... and says a lot of abstract stuff. Like you gotta play the game or whatever. Make peace in this world of war. Stuff like that.
* At the same time, he is weirded out by people who like to express themselves in kind of unique ways. He can be closeminded sometimes.
* Eventhough I'm the introvert I have more sustained energy than him. Like when we train... he's more bursts of energy... and I'm sustained... can go for hours on end with breaks. While he gets tired and won't want to keep going after a period of time.
* He gets anxious around too many people. But he's very friendly. He says hi to everyone he meets for the first time. Not afraid or hesitant to talk to anyone.
* Doesn't plan much. He's more likely to just let something happen first then go from there. But he likes to analyze situations. Especially people's positions. Their agenda. And how they are going to be as he gets to know them.
* Claims he has empathy. Maybe he has... one time we were at the mall and there was a celebrity there. He was more worried about the guy being bored signing autographs. He wanted to entertain him or make the celebrity person feel better. I was actually kind of impressed by it.
* He's goofy. Has no trouble getting people to like him.
* Not organized at all.
* Really quick at reading between the lines. Like when I'm being passive aggressive. He picks up on it quick and confronts me.
* VERY affectionate. Likes to touch and be touched. Says endearments and shows emotions a lot. Gets grumpy when I don't say I love you back. Picks up my moods easily.


So... is he ENFP or ESFP?
I'm not sure I understand your goal here. Would you mind re-writing it in a few sentences?One of my friends, an ENFP, has disassociative personality disorder and this sounds fairly similar to what she experiences. Check that out if you want.Lol. Makes sense. I got into it because there was so much to learn. I'm all about improving my thought process. But the author does seem like he has a bit of a stick up his ass. However, he does have a lot of useful knowledge. So it's a bit of a win-lose. The storytelling is fantastic, though. Higher quality than a lot of books.If you're willing to get past the ego, it's a worthwhile read. I didn't notice it until you pointed it out to me, since I have a fairly big ego myself. It's mostly just a fun story. Interesting plot twists and whatnot.Reminds me of Ron Swanson (probably ISTJ) from Parks and Recreation. "The less I know about other people's lives, the better."

"I once had a friend I worked with for three years. I never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still don't talk sometimes."

He's a bit more of a militant introvert, if such a thing exists.

Fair enough. He doesn't seem very Se, though. He says often that he loves to do the same things with the same people, or all alone. I don't really get the whole "sensory variety" feel when I see him. I get that he's a TV character and they aren't created for stereotypes, so maybe we ought to disregard the normal rules and say he's a J/P hybrid.Great points, but they don't really matter if we don't get the word out. You said you're an author, is there some kind of public platform you can post this on?Lol. That would make me an IxFJ. Probably an ISFJ. Thanks for your input, I'll consider it.That doesn't make sense to me. I've always been much better at dealing with other people's emotions than my own, though I'm still not great at it. I do prefer Ti, and I recognize that Ti and Fe can't be running at the same time since they're mutually exclusive, but it seems like I'm going to be better at all of the functions in my stack than I am with their I/E opposite (Ti over Te, Si over Se). Fi remains the function I absolutely hate - it just makes no sense to me. I try to logic my feelings and everything falls apart.The "follow my heart" attitude has always irked me. How do you know you aren't gonna screw up magnificently? You can't trust your feelings to make decisions for you unless it's a purely emotional situation, and then I'd still prefer logic. 

Also, thanks for clearing my head. Preference and ability is something people seem to get confused, myself included. I'm now very sure that I'm an INTP, both because of this thread and some real-life sources who I *really* should have asked beforehand. I did the exact thing - research and analyzing - fairly recently, actually, and it's netted me some surprising results. So, looks like I wasn't being weird after all. Thanks, man. I appreciate it.I still don't have a great idea of either of those. I've read that Ni gathers data unconsciously and synthesizes it into a point, and Si extrapolates/connects patterns based on factual data it's encountered and stored. Is that right? Neutral goodMy theory is that Fe needs to express emotion much more than Fi does, but will avoid doing so in order to keep the "good vibes" going. So the irritations build up until the Fe-users can't take it anymore and have to express themselves.Of course not, have you ever met an ESTP?INTP - RedSure, but it sounds like it's tempered by Si. My impression of Ne-doms or auxes (mostly doms) is more that they keep thinking of possibilities even if they believe they have the right one. But I could be wrong. I'd go with Si&gt;Ne.My dad's a pilot and an ISTJ.Why? This just seems like it's trying to make a 70% only club. That seems redundant when so much of us are already sensors. This just makes the divide between us and Intuitives stronger.Yeah, that's a statistic I've seen quoted around here. 

Also, I recognize the name Iskandar. Where's you get the username from?I thought I recognized it from a fantasy novel I read a while ago. I guess I was wrong.Hell no. I'm not reading all of that.Can confirm, am STPI totally agree. Nancy also seems drawn to mysticism and hears her son "calling out to her." Another person - not an SFJ - may have dismissed it as a hallucination or rationalized it away. This behavior fits in the idea of falling into the lower two functions when stressed, though she doesn't seem to use her Ti.Do you mind translating the acronyms? I know I'm an RCUEI, vaguely, but I'm not sure how this translates, or even if they're the same scales.

Edit: never mind. Failed to read the whole thing.Me too. Hope my friends don't come to that realization.

Also, I think I may have trouble forming friendships quickly. It takes me a long time to get used to people.Congrats on the self-reflection. It's not an easy thing.1. Telekinesis. It's the most versatile. Flying, moving underwater, punching holes in walls, etc... It's almost limitless.
2. Ha. Nope.
3. 7. Don't want to draw too much attention to myself.
4. 5. 
5. 9. I'd tell maybe two people.
6. Sure. Normal street clothes. Or maybe a tough jacket and jeans so I don't get lacerated on accident.Haven't had to deal with one yet, but I imagine I'd just work out until I felt better and then move on.Valor, ISTP. Chose it because my brother (INFP) did. We can't capture gyms if we aren't on the same team.Watched it. All I felt was anger. That guy was an asshole, but the woman was intentionally provoking him. She could have just gotten out and used her phone/asked someone else where she was.Look at you. You're so smart and mature for not playing a fun social game. Way to not go with the flow. ////sHop from Stranger Things for ISTPDon't worry about that. A lot of the introverted functions can sound like each other. If you're sure that you're Ti, you probably are. It's hard to miss being a Ti-dom.

I'd go INTP, myself. But remember that everything is on a continuum. INTP just means that Ne is at least slightly stronger. I feel like an INTP/ISTP hybrid most days, though lately Se seems like it's been stronger. So you could be either one. It's best not to read into this stuff.I love the sarcasm in "istp - cool"Naturalistic intelligenceINTPMe: ISTP, maybe

Dad: ISTJ or INTJ

Mom: ESFJ

Brother: INFP

Sister: ESFP or ENFP (8 years old)INTJ. Whatever type, I like her style.Can't say it better.Us.Jesus Christ. Talk about an ego. Are you feeling secure on your high horse, MrEntj?Attractive viewpoint, but ultimately it just appeals to your ego. Behold, I am a mighty TP, I know what's *really* going on. Bow down to me, sheep.That's what I've been doing lately. It's a fantastic experience. Great how the traditional models of function development can really turn upside-down once you actually work on beating them, rather than letting growth go naturally.Seems like developed Te. Being social and networking = favors and increased practical benefits. Also, it keeps you mentally healthy. If you can't find it in your heart to socialize for socializing's sake, socialize so you have a good crop of evil minions when you take over the world.Too serious. Not enough shitty jokes. 0/10I've seen people sometimes say that inferior Fe causes people to overcompensate, especially people who are self-aware of their weakness. I'd definitely agree - this is me.INTP?Rationality, Sensitivity, PlayfulnessType?I wish there was more practical information or information I can apply to myself. More thinking about types and how they develop through life and how they function. Not complaining about the system itself or pointless arguing over which function does what.My feelings of love are more often tied to sensations. When I'm texting my girlfriend, I don't feel much. I mainly only text her for her. But when I'm around her, I love talking to her, being close, messing around both verbally and physically, and just having a good time with someone I care about. Also, I'm very smell-oriented. Often the way she smells can give me the biggest emotional charge, though I couldn't tell you why.It probably starts as a kind of valued information (say, abstract or sensory) and then evolves into a habit. So when a sensory-oriented person tries to comprehend an abstract idea, they're using their less-used mental pathways, which means they're not as skilled in that regard.Yep. Which means that OP's tertiary is his girlfriend's dominant, and vice versa. Possibly a bit less clashing, function- and behavior-wise.I'm the same way, though I guess you could say I have a lot of stamina for physical contact. And I feel like I should say that I don't hate talking to my girlfriend, but the conversations do lack quality. I can't be satisfied talking to her like that - it's like she isn't even there. Sometimes I wonder if she feels my presence "through the phone."The split between extraverted and introverted functions is where the person directs their energy and how. So, someone using an extraverted function focuses their mental energy on the outside world. Someone using Extraverted Thinking focuses on facts and empirical data, impersonal topics that can be found in the real world. Often they have a plan of action and are very achievement-oriented. An Extraverted Feeler cares deeply for the feelings of others and works hard to make them comfortable, and handles social conventions like breathing. An Introverted Feeler is more focused on their own emotions. They enjoy exploring their feelings through reading, art, other media, and self-reflection. An Introverted Thinker strives for internal logical consistency and uses logic to connect ideas together, building a subjective system by which to navigate the outside world.
The perception functions are harder to explain in depth, but luckily you can understand them pretty easily if you combine the meanings of the two words (e.g. Sensing + Extraverted or Intuition + Introverted). Also, I've seen some great explanations on this sub if you look around.24/36. That's surprising. I thought I'd get a higher score, but I drew blanks for a lot of the eyes I saw. If I could have seen mouths or bodies, too, I would have been better.They're pretty coolI'm detecting you have a history with an ISTP. Why are you lumping together the whole type with someone you hate? You must know that objectively can't be true.Yes. I live in Phoenix, Arizona. The air outside is lethal for 9 months a year.Probably a feeler, probably a sensor. I'd go ESFPThis is just my personal impression, but ESFPs show much more emotion while taking (duh). ESTPs smile when they're talking to someone most of the time, but they don't talk directly about their emotions - the smiling is just a show of goodwill. An ESFP is going to talk much more about their emotions, what's bothering them, and how situations make them feel. Also, the two ESFPs I know both love drama. They seem to create it wherever they go. ESTPs love getting a rise out of people and telling insensitive jokes, but when it comes to personal drama, they hate it - even though they may participate out of pride if it involves them. 

Bottom line, you'll *know* if someone is an ESFP rather than an ESTP. ESFPs are much more caring, expressive, etc. With ESTPs, it may be harder to see the analytical side, but when they start pushing boundaries, you'll be able to tell.

Hope this helps. I only know from personal experience - 1 ESTP and 2 ESFPs - so my sample size may not be big enough to give you a reliable answer.What a lovely relationshipI couldn't tell you directly, but I know that it can be hard to identify the dominant function in introverts, so I'll ask, do you think you struggle more with seeing other people's viewpoints and being creative/dealing with possibilities, or interacting with people, truly empathizing and knowing what to do when someone's upset?

EDIT: that was all one sentence. I'm impressed with myself.Alright - do you find yourself asking "what ifs" often and having to bring yourself back down to the ground, or relying too much on your experience and forgetting to consider alternate lifestyles or viewpoints?That's okay. Usually the 2 middle functions are more balanced. Let's say, do you enjoy caring for other people and making them comfortable, or do you naturally tinker with theoretical concepts? If you do both, which do you do more often?Alright, then. You're definitely an xNTP. I'll ask you two more questions to distinguish between E or I - which is harder, being consistent, grounded in reality, and accessing your memory and senses, or relating and empathizing as I described above? Also, in real life, do you think you come off as more robotic and closed-off most of the time, or energetic and passionate?Sorry for the hard questions. I know two proven ENTPs and one INTP. The ENTPs often come across as friendly, witty, and clever, but also enjoy poking at people and pushing their buttons. The INTP I know is much more withdrawn and we mainly bond over our mutual dislike of people, especially stupid people. But when the INTP is interested, he pulls out of his head more and becomes more energetic and reactive. I'd say that you're probably an INTP. I know that a lot of NTPs still question their type after they come to an answer, so feel free to keep getting more opinions, but remember that the point is to make a decision, so don't overanalyze too much. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. :PBeen in one relationship. It was an absolute whirlwind. I fell in love right away. But I'm pretty young, so I don't have much relationship experience. I'd say that the more damaged/cynical ISTPs would be much slower to fall in love out of a tendency to percieve love as a farce or a weakness.Personally, I love decision-making. Maybe the process is more fun, but I love reasoning my way to a conclusion and then acting on it and seeing that I was correct. Maybe that's a Se/Ni thing.Because I want to look good. When I look good, I feel good. Also, the ache that comes afterward is very satisfying.How does this relate to self awareness? Do you mean bodily awareness?It's a common misconception that Ti-doms can't be sensitive. I'm very sensitive. It's just a matter of who you express it to. I only express my feelings to close friends, most often just my girlfriend. Usually, the type descriptions are written by people of a different type, so they're mainly writing about what they see. Only a really arrogant ISTP or INTP could make themselves out to be totally emotionless and detached. That's INTJ territory. :POf course. I'm the same way. I have reacted emotionally maybe once in the past year and a half. Even if my emotions serve as a cause for the decision-making process, I go about it logically. I think that's what it means to be a TP.You're definitely an INTP. I know that a lot of Ne-users tend to question their types, but you just have to take a step back and look at the broad category. Think about how you fit your type, not how you fit others. With MBTI, you can't be right, you can only be less wrong.You mean the typing process? What makes you doubt your type?Sorry to tell you, but I don't really understand Ni well enough to try to type you. Typing MetricExpansion was easy because I spent a while trying to decide between INTP or ISTP. But it sounds like you have valid reasoning for being an INFJ, so I wouldn't doubt it if I were you.I think that it can be hard to distinguish between ENFJ and INFJ since Fe is such a people-oriented mindset. Let's look back at your childhood. How did you behave when you were 7 or 8 years old? Do you remember? That's about when your dominant function develops.ISTP: snark at the teacher, make paper airplanes and throw them when the teacher isn't paying attentionI think that settles it. If you feel fairly confident about your Ti, and you're working on your Se, then you must be an INFJ. Good for you for being so extraverted, and remember that just because you're an I doesn't mean you can't be a people person.I've had that experience. I think it's just an Ni trait. Remember, ENFJs and INFJs just have their dom and aux switched, so they really aren't that different. Don't worry about it. Logically, Fe requiring you to talk to someone else in order to organize your thoughts doesn't make sense. It would have to be an introverted function, since this is an ordering-of-your-internal-world thing.No problem. This has been an experience for me too. I think I've gained a deeper understanding of Ni myself. I'm glad I could help you!How so? I haven't met two people I can compare.I communicate in practical terms, usually. Everyone who knows me knows that I'm not a conversationalist. At my most extraverted, my Se-Fe comes out and I get very cheerful, energetic, and spontaneous, and I easily dominate conversations, but that's pretty rare.

If someone tried to bring up my thoughts on death or why people never change, I'd zone out within the first minute or try to end the conversation. I don't see the point in discussing things like that. What are you gonna do with that information?I don't have any specific topics, per se. Right now, I'm feeling sort of directionless, but I'm trying to plan for my future career, so if somebody brings up a useful skill, idea, etc. that I can see myself applying, I'll engage them in conversation so I can learn about it. That usually leads to me asking precise questions to build my understanding and asking where I can learn more.

One topic I'm always open to talking about is the MBTI. For example, I try to casually/secretly get everyone I plan on knowing to take the test so I can know how to treat them. If they're interested, I'll happily talk to them about that.

The only people I really have aimless, casual conversation with are my girlfriend and a close friend (INFP and ENFP) and I don't have much stamina for that. How I behave when I'm around my friends usually is just listening to them talk and interjecting sarcastic comments or observations occasionally. Especially with two of my fellow Thinkers (INTP and ESTP), I usually just exchange witty banter. It's pretty fun. By and large, though, most of my conversations are practical.

Edit: if you want to learn how to communicate with a sensor, don't use me as an example. I'm just quiet. :PThey're just too abstract and philosophical for me. I'm more interested in what's happening now. Usually, what makes me interested in a conversation is the practical application. For example, talking about upcoming tests in school, or planning a get-together or party. If I'm going to confront the topic of death, I'd rather do that on my own. Thinking philosophically is much easier in my head, but it isn't something I absolutely love, so if I'm going to put energy into a conversation I'd rather it be useful.

Edit: to clarify, what interests me is a practical application now or in the near future, or a conversation about a topic I know a lot about.I'm confident enough in my skills to consider another person's viewpoint. That's a skill I've been developing purposefully. If some part of my personal philosophy needs developing, I'll get other perspectives.Sorry, I don't understand your first question. 

Usually, I check to see if their viewpoint is logical, and then I consult my sense of morality. I couldn't tell you the specifics because I'd have to observe myself in the act first.

If there's a "hole" or something I'm missing in my perspective, or if I've tested it in reality and it doesn't hold up, I'll get another person's viewpoint. Usually, it's someone with an opposite perspective, so an NF. I then either incorporate that perspective into my philosophy or reject it based on its logical/ethical value.

Sorry I can't give a better answer. I haven't observed myself in this process of decision-making before.No problem! I thought this behavior was me-specific. Glad to know I'm not *too* weird. Happy to help.Yeah, usually I only think of improvement after facing an issue. Sometimes I imagine, "what are the consequences of thinking this?" and revise accordingly, but most of the time that's just not how I think.

It's tough to describe this stuff to you, though. A lot of my decision-making is very automatic. When I said that I either reject or accept a philosophy, I was leaving out the time it takes for me to do that. Usually, this kind of overhaul happens over the long-term in the back of my mind. When my mind is free to wander, I often consider these issues sort of passively until everything clicks together. That's how my mind works normally - if I'm not thinking purposefully, it can take weeks or even months to put things together in a way that's useful, since I leave that up to my subconscious.

If I feel the urge to test an idea, I usually do it in a safe way. That's often where asking for someone's viewpoint comes in. I explain the idea to them and see how they react. But these moments are few and far between, since usually ideological issues are low-priority for me.

Hope this helps. Sorry I can't give you a better understanding. Ask me again in a month. :PYour comments amaze me, honestly. It's interesting how we're more or less opposites with how we think.

As to priorities, I wouldn't say that I consciously value practical matters more. It's just how I am. I'm wired to care more about the here-and-now rather than philosophy. I don't think I really choose anything about my type preference - it's just how I developed and the way my habits formed.

The danger with some of my ideas can be putting them into practice before refining them. If I have an idea that other people may find morally reprehensible, then I'd rather not find out after I've already accepted it as a fact. So I "test" it in a hypothetical way by posing it to someone I'm close to. If they don't accept it, I put it back into overhaul and make sure I don't need to deal with it in my everyday life. If they accept it, I'll immediately put it into practice.

To be a bit more precise, when I said that my decision-making was automatic, I meant that it's unconscious. Sort of intuitive and right-brained. Since Ti is my dominant function, it's not something that I activate automatically and more of just the way I think. Same with Ni, though it's weaker. In fact, I'd view my dominant and tertiary functions as the ones that developed first, with Se and Fe coming afterward. As an introvert, it's always easier to deal with my own internal world than the outside world.Here's something that'll surprise you- I'm only 15. I was in a primary-tertiary loop for a big part of my development due to self-esteem issues and a restricted social circle. It's only been a few years, and I'm still dealing with the effects. However, I'm purposefully trying to guide my mental development in the direction of Se, so hopefully it'll turn out the way I'd like it to. Being on the Se/Ni axis seems like it'll be much more useful, not to mention fun. Though that raises the question, does that attitude already mean that I'm on the Se/Ni axis and just need to develop it? It's sort of a chicken-or-egg question. :PI've been mostly raised by an ESFJ, a very strong feeler. My main Thinker influence is from my ISTJ dad. I feel like I'm more balanced, despite being a Ti-dom.

We'll have to see what kind of person I turn out to be. It's probably important not to restrict myself using cognitive functions or whatever, and just use those as guidelines or short names for the kind of skills I'll need as a person.

Thanks for letting me talk. You've helped me develop my self-awareness a bit. I appreciate it.I forgot to mention that my dad is a pilot, so he's gone most of the time. Being raised by an ESFJ for most of my life while still somehow becoming a TP has done a lot in rounding me out.

Idealists have their place. Unfortunately, so few of them bring about real change, but the ones oriented towards the arts do a great job in changing people's minds and spurring social change.I'm 15. 16 in 2 months. And it hasn't ended yet. 1 1/2 years and still going, mainly because we're both mature people and don't do petty shit. :PThat's great, I'm glad it's working out. ISTPs can go from self-absorbed jackasses to laid-back, mature jackasses* depending on how self-aware we are. Sounds like you got yourself a good one. 

I'd say, don't sweat the small stuff, and it's all small stuff. Don't sweat anything. Although, if you have a fight, that can be a natural part of couples developing, so don't worry about how the act of fighting hurts your relationship. As long as you resolve it productively, you'll be okay.

Look at me. I'm 15, giving relationship advice to someone who's probably a lot older than me. Feel free to ignore what I'm saying if you know it already. :P

*i say this because I am oneThat sounds fantastic, to be honest. I'm glad you guys are working out. Good company is one of the best things in life, in a relationship or with friends.I like your reasoning there. Go for the shock. It definitely works.Are you not a native English speaker?ISTP?I'm just getting that Se vibe, especially physical activity. However, you do talk a lot about core values, more than I'd expect from an SP. On second thought, maybe an ENTJ. Do you think you're an extravert?Well, there you go. ENTJQuestioner. I follow my own expectations. I don't know why you wouldn't.I've considered that. One thing I think INTPs do that I don't is sort of get caught up in their own head. Get too focused on impractical questions just because they like the mental stimulation. That's alright, but I'd much rather learn practical skills.I hate when people talk to me when they can tell I don't want to talk, i.e. I'm putting in earbuds to concentrate on whatever I'm doing or just to block them out. Come on, if I'm listening to music I obviously don't want to listen to you.Ironic since SJs make up most of the population. You'd think we'd understand them a bit better.What's that supposed to mean? Are SJs not self aware?I think we call that an Fi-Si loop, and I also think that's bad.Someday I plan on making an abstract sculpture made entirely of old metal piping and saying that it's a social commentary on the morals of our generation. It'll sell for millions, but in reality it's just gonna be a hunk of metal. Maybe I'll include a plaque that says "I bet you thought this had some kind of hidden meaning, huh?"I think xSFJs are great. xSTJs just get on my nerves, mainly when they want me to do something but they won't tell me why.I'd become an artist, but not a deep one. I'd just make nice-looking things. Sculptures or furniture or paintings of wilderness scenes, or the occasional snarky art piece that makes fun of people who read into things too much. I hate it when people do that.

Hate it.Didn't Frank Zappa name his daughter Moon Unit? He seems a little bit unhinged.Says who?1. Ranging from wide awake when I'm feeling good to half awake when I'm tired. I tend not to really daydream much but I do get very clumsy when I don't have as much energy.

2. Right now, I don't have many hobbies. Occasionally I'll get sucked up in a fascinating new idea and plan out how I'm going to pursue it, but I lose motivation quickly. I'm terminally lazy.

3. Only with forgetting homework. If something isn't directly in front of me, I tend not to think about it/assume it doesn't exist and go on with what I wanted to do. This can lead to problems when I have assignments I need to turn in.And to that I'd say, "okay." If people think like that, that's fine by me. I'd still keep creating aesthetically pleasing things. Hypothetically. I'm probably too lazy to actually do it.Alright, dude. Kindly fuck off and take your argumentativeness somewhere else.Im not opposed to the idea, I just don't like the way it was delivered. I just assumed loops were part of the "official" theory.Thinkers care, too. I care. It's just not as obvious, I suppose.Lindsey Stirling and soundtracks here. Other people think I'm disgustingly nerdy for it.I'm getting INFJ, though that's just a hunch. Anyone else?Thanks, maybe it was stupid to doubt. Do you mind explaining the reasoning behind those questions? Or is it proprietary?Si also concerns your physical state. It sort of serves two purposes in that it gives you a bed of experience to draw on and also makes you aware of what you're doing with your body, health-wise. Over-using your Si would probably lead to paranoia and hypersensitivity. But in an Fi-Si loop, there would also be a component of wallowing in the past, yes. However, loops aren't technically proven to exist, so I wouldn't actually put a lot of importance in that.That makes so much more sense based on what I'd seen of you. Btw, my reaction was "well, I guess ESFPs can be smart too." Is it still breaking a stereotype if you aren't even an ESFP?IMO, being a Assertive just means you don't worry about stupid shit that oftenSe users tend to grow close to people through shared actions rather than deep conversation. You may need to find a balance between the two, and don't expect very much abstract discussion, since Ni is inferior for ESFPs.You gotta kinda lure us in. The bait is the activity, and then once we're relaxed and enjoying ourselves, bam, abstract emotional question. Works every time. :PI love winter, but I live in AZ. Everyone loves winter here because the temperatures are from 40-70 degrees.Pretty neat. However, it doesn't give you a baseline for what the types actually are. This would be useless if you tried to use it to explain your type to someone else.An Intuitive. Most likely a Feeler. I'm guessing introvert. INFP or INFJSensors don't think in abstract terms like this. Also, it isn't even approaching a logical idea. The only way an idea like this could come about is through someone's subjective imagination with no regard for logic.I say "I love you" fairly easily (to my SO) and don't have much problem expressing strong (positive) emotions when I feel them. Feeling them is another matter entirely. However, negative emotions I struggle with just as much as other ISTPs.That game was incredible. The idea of manipulating soul energy to create powerful machines, artifacts, etc. was really fascinating to me. The only problem is the ethics...You're missing a critical part of your understanding. I value physical experience MORE than mental experience. It's just more fun. I expect if I started neglecting that side of me in favor of expanding my mind I'd feel very stunted and restless. In fact, I've done it before and I have. Besides, if the main draw of acting like an Intuitive is interesting conversation, I'd rather stay the way I am, because 9 times out of 10 I don't give a shit about conversation. The way I am works for me. Thanks for preaching the superiority of Intuitives yet again, though.Dude, fuck off. You have no reason to be so rude. This person needs help.You say you're really good at making people like you? This sounds like Fe. You sound like an Fe user who's had a really bad run of things, so you repress your natural Fe... It's gonna be hard to type you in this state, unfortunately, but I'm getting Fe suppression and an over-reliance on Ti. I'd look into any FJ type, especially ESFJ or ENFJ.First part, depressing. Second part, genius. I'm gonna do this sometime.I'm constantly conflicted on whether or not I actually care about anything.I doubt it matters, but this dude is hilarious.I see the truth in what you're saying, but you're acting very arrogant and it gets on my nerves, as I'm sure it gets on others', too. You'll get better reactions if you control the way you approach people. Otherwise you just seem like an asshole trying to prove himself right on the Internet to bolster his own ego.

/2 centsI'm getting ENFP. Seems definitely an extravert, definitely a feeler, most likely Si-NeI see. I can offer a few ideas, then. 4 is high Feeling, though that would correlate more to how often a person is anxious rather than how they behave. 6 sounds like F-N, maybe Ne-Fi, or possibly even Si-Fe. 7 sounds like Ni-Te. 9 sounds like Ne. 10 sounds like high N. 11 sounds like Ne. 12, Si. 13, high N, probably Ne. 14 sounds like high F. Possible to differentiate based on whether they cry because they understand on a personal level (Fi) or because they're a sympathy crier (Fe). 15 sounds like Ti - I do this.Eh. Anything I do is a reflection of my inner thoughts. I care more about doing what's appropriate for the situation.Very useful. Thanks for postingI'm gonna be honest, I'm not really seeing the ISFP hereSomeone thinking in intuitive terms with a detachment from emotion. I can't believe an ISFP would say "nothing is right or wrong."Feelers tend to think "does this work with my values?" (Fi) or "how will this make others feel?" (Fe) as their primary mode of decision-making. Thinkers tend to be more, "what's the most efficient way to achieve my goal/what strategy can I use to do what I need to using minimal energy" (Ti) or "what's the best way to achieve my goal/what are the facts of the situation" (Te).Of course nothing's objectively right or wrong, but moral values are necessary to exist as a human being in society, and they play a key role in making you personable and worthwhile to be around. So you can't really say there's a universal value for right and wrong, but that doesn't really matter, since realistically and groundedly (from a human perspective) morals are what give our lives worth, in the end.Ni-Te. It's a kind of weak ENTJ argument. Not backed up with substance, but insisting the conclusion is right anyhow - perfect inferior Te.Technically you are correct. But, God, who *cares*? Your nihilistic perspective isn't doing you any good.Or maybe you're just stupid and you're trying to prove your intelligence by being all "morals are social constructs" because ethically deprived bastards are very socially desirableFirst, make sure she knows you don't feel good, or make sure that you secure time together sometime soon. Second, you're good. Visceral emotional reactions aren't meant to be logical. I'd be upset too. Really, it isn't worth thinking too deeply about, because in the end you're gonna get your time together, whether it's today or later.Thanks, that really helps me understand Fe. I was mainly going on how *I* experience it - as a supplement to my dominant logical side, or sometimes just a pain in the ass.Out of curiosity, how many people have responded?Everything can be fixed with the right leverage and the right strategy.This oneI use it as sort of a guide to social interaction, and to iron out my own flaws. My long-term goal at the moment is to be self-aware. If I can recognize my flaws, it's that much easier to deal with them.Wow, thanks for the detailed response. It actually clears up a lot of questions I've had lately. I appreciate it very much. It's going to take a while to digest.

I definitely relate to what you say about Ti-Fi. I usually don't think about it my own moral values, but when someone else asks me, I can produce some sort of response after a lot of pondering - although Ti does play a role here in fleshing out connections between ethical ideas, if that makes sense.IdeallyYou guys should dateI mean... it's a bit of a turnoff when they don't do anything during sex"Don't dare to tell the truth if you can tell lies."

Fucking hilarious.ISTP:

•"I'm not angry, I'm just thinking"

•Being terrified when you actually let an emotion slip through your stony facade because it ruins your aesthetic

•Wondering if you can take a human apart to see how they work before remembering that it's ethically abhorrent

•Listening to movie/game soundtracks instead of real music

•Wishing you had better clothes but not having money because you spent it on impulse purchases at 3 AM

•Doing chores instead of actual work

•Having people tell you they're scared of you because you always look like you're gonna kill someone

These might be specific to me personally. I don't know about anyone elseThis is a trend? Thank god it isn't just me.Anecdotally, my INTP friend is much more expressive than I am. I'm usually very focused and he's usually more scatterbrained, and also a very Turbulent (-T) personality, so it makes sense.Social ambiversion (going both ways) is a real thing. However, the function model doesn't accommodate for that, since it assumes you would be stronger at Ti or Ne inherently.Me too. I think it's just an Fe thing. Do you personally think you're a healthy person? Are you happy with the way you behave? Do you have qualms?You sound like an IXTP to me, except for playing pretend as a child (possibly Ni) and wanting to connect with people (Fe). Just my 2 cents. Not sure if you know about functions. I'll leave this here for more qualified people.IxFP, maybe. I'm getting Fi. Maybe developed Si/aux Se. Do you think about the future often? Fantasize? Romanticize?INFPAnyone feels like typing me, that'd be greatWhatever type you are, you sound fairly balanced. Let's measure your thinking. When making rational decisions, do you consult the facts of the situation, possible solutions, and factors in an objective manner, or do you consult your own understanding and rely on a process of logic to connect the dots, make a series of "if-then" ideas and use that to generate a conclusion?

Te users tend to think in a very "bulleted list" style of listing data points. Ti users, by contrast, reason toward a conclusion by making a series of logical statements, things like "if I do X, then Y, and if Y, then Z."

Hope this helps.It's best to answer based on your impulses. What you'd do instinctively.Yes. I agreeI've seen ISTPs and INTPs who are hopeless romantics. Inferior Fe can sometimes lead to idealization. However, you sound more like an ENTP to me.Sounds more like tertiary Fe since he acknowledges it as part of his personality. Inferior Fe is very unconscious.Good for you. I'd say that goes for me, too, but I'm still figuring it out. I'm gonna stick with ENTP.Nah. INTJs are just socially awkward. Not worth the IQ boost.IQ tests are designed with Intuitive Thinkers in mind, because of the social idea that people who think logically and abstractly are smarter.They existed.

Have you looked at xNFJ?It certainly makes sense for an ISFJ 4 to want to be an INFJ, but that kind of logic doesn't really help determine your type. I'd suggest gathering more information about Si and Ni if you're really confused. As I understand it, Si is concerned with the body and its health, care, and function, and it gathers information by paying attention to the sensations of the body. Ni is about the mind and perspectives, delving into ideas deeply and fleshing them out in order to create a holistic understanding. Ni users tend to prize being aware of how their mind works. However, I'd ask a more reliable source for more info.Get very short with people, incredibly easily irritated, generally just want to focus on solving whatever's stressing me and then spending a long time alone to de-stressWhen I'm angry, my height fluctuates anywhere between 5 feet and 7 feet.

I might shoplift something and then go back to find my family eventually.I heard it was because this dude named David Kiersey didn't believe in the functions and thought that Sensors differed in observed behavior more between SPs and SJs (Se and Si), while Intuitives differed more in observer behavior between NFs and NTs. He has a point.55.6%. I was really getting the pattern towards the end, but I stopped before I raised my percentage significantlyWhat happened?I AGREE. I ENJOYED THIS CONTENT.Fi/Ne or Ne/Fi? Hmm... not much of a difference thereISTJ, then? Or ESTJ? I'm not sure how people-focused Te is.

Seems like the encouragement could be because he recognizes encouraging words will help people reach a goal. Te. I can't tell whether Fi or Ne is weaker, though.I think ESTJs are just fine. Most people don't like the perceived aggressiveness/pushiness and uncompromising attitude, though. Explaining a thought process or even just the desired result in a sentence or two can go a long way in making sure people react well.

Edit: also, welcome! We need more SJs on this sub. There tends to be a very biased/simplistic viewpoint of SJs on here and in MBTI sources in general.I like useful things. I think they'll help me get farther in life.That's quite a leap of logic. Practical people have morals too, you know. And I don't mean to start an N vs. S argument, if that's what you're upset about.It's because an ISTP is technically a Judging dominant (Ti), so Socionics says "they're an ISTj" since the J or P just corresponds to the top function. In MBTI, the P or J corresponds to the highest extraverted function, so ISTjs in Socionics are ISTPs in MBTI because they use Se.I'd say Fe. For everyone else, it seems evenly split between Fe and Fi. Seems like high Fe users are less likely to cry, though.Nah. We're awesomeDon't earn money currently. That's fine because I suck at managing it. I make impulse purchases and am not very good at saving. When I move out, I'll probably improve.I'm thinking INFJ.Does he prefer to talk about abstract/strange/uncommon topics, or his daily life such as what he ate, what he did the other day, etc?Just the vibe I'm getting from you. You don't have the more grounded, concrete responses of a sensor - you're more general and abstract, and focus more on thoughts than events. Also, you seem very focused on other people. Very self-sacrificing. It's a good trait.

Some people will try to tell you that you aren't an INFJ because they aren't statistically likely. Personally, I think it's better to type based on the individual situation rather than general statistics, so as to be less biased. So be open to other ideas, but don't doubt your type just based on statistics.

Hope this helpsI'd probably say INFJ. I see a lot of aux Fe in there, especially in the "it's hard to tell whether he's introverted or extraverted." With Fe doms, you KNOW theyre an extravert.Hey, tert Ni can have vibes, too.The dominant function's opposite attitude ends up being fairly easy to use and develop. I find myself switching to Te mode pretty easily. I think that a lot of the Ni/Ne questions on the Keys2Cognition test are fairly confusing and may not be accurate, anyway, since Inuition is less understood. Thus, it makes sense that an Intuitive dominant would be the hardest to type.

If you say that you're very unhealthy, and you score INTJ, then it would make sense for you to be an ENFP. That would be an Ne-Te loop going on. 

The description you provide does seem fairly ENFP, too. It's the mention of the specific philosophy you like that really gives it away. I'd consider that as a very likely type.How do demonstrative functions work? This is totally new to me. How would Si be demonstrative for me as an ISTP?Very, very nice.

MBTI advice: You have no functions in common. Try to see her perspective before getting emotional over different priorities. Try very hard to make sure that you both know if either one has problems. Don't bottle things up, just solve them.150, somehow. ISTP

Edit: just realized you weren't asking for scores. Oh, well. Gonna leave this here for my egoNot sure. I could just Google it and post the results, but I don't know what an accurate IQ test is. Getting such a high score (genius level right?) just seems like a fluke or something about the test, since I'm pretty sure I'm not that smart. What do you think of the idea that someone can purposefully develop their type?

For example, if I'm 15 and I start developing my Se on purpose, even if I'm sort-of predisposed to being Ne, could I be a successful ISTP?

If I find that I *can* develop my Se, does that mean that I was never predisposed to Ne in the first place, rather Ni?Okay, I got 46% on that test. I don't think either scores are a good representation of my intelligence.Don't know about the other types, but I'd be a versatile one liable to gain lots of power. Mage, maybe, with an emphasis on practicality rather than book learning. Sorcerer. In d&amp;d, a psionic class. Something badass.Relaxing. Playing video games. Probably gonna go outside.Seconded. Anyone has some practical advice, hmu. How do I tell from observing someone?What are you trying to figure out?I'd go maybe ESTP.Less distracted by workplace nonsense.

Commonly seen as more intelligent (which is not true, but still useful)That can easily be twisted around as "taking longer to order your thoughts carefully is a sign of intelligence." That's one theory. Certainly true for me. I meant more "stupid social bullshit," though it depends on the person. Office politics, whatever."Robot. You are 100% Rational, 0% Extroverted, 29% Brutal, and 14% Arrogant."

I'm probably more 40% extraverted, but oh well.

I really like this test. It's hilarious to read and gives me genuine insights about my personalty.

Couldn't get a good picture. Eventually had to say fuck it. Here's the best one.

ISTP, 15. Hopefully that explains why I look like I'm about to murder the camera.Sorry, dude. Looks like you're out of luck this time. I see it. Sort of. I like to think I'm a bit more attractive. Not that the photo is a good example.Yep, you sound like an ISTP. Congrats on being more social than I am.

IMO, this system is too rigid. It doesn't allow much room for all types of people to be expressed. Introverts can love their friends and enjoy meeting new people. It just depends on the personality.

Anyway, you love solving problems, work well in chaos, spend lots of time alone, observe people, and always need to have an escape plan? Definite ISTP.Love it. This is something I've thought about a few times. Introvert doesn't mean antisocial, and it shouldn't.

Edit: somehow managed to post this 5 separate times. Go me.ISTPNo. No. No.

No way.

A computer and a person are two different things.Romance and love for me is more tied to physical attraction/presence than anything else. If an averagely attractive girl started being closer to me and messing around/joking physically, I assume I'd start to find her more attractive. Maybe it's shallow, but I don't think you can place that kind of evaluation on an ingrained quality. A deliberate choice, maybe.

If I couldn't be close to/touch/feel another living person, it wouldn't be a real relationship to me. Just a mockery.

And anyway, that AI wouldn't be living. It would just be following instructions based on my own input. It wouldn't be a real person in any sense.If you're an INTJ, and you don't look down on people, then not all INTJs are assholes. No type is inherently good or bad.

It seems to me that survey-takers wouldn't want to go through such a huge survey that includes all those different categories. Plus, a wide range of options could easily become confusing for people who aren't sure about genre labels.You could try to write using people as real-life examples. Consult people of different types to get their perspectives and learn what they would do in the book's current situation.Ti-doms can sometimes become very rigid and axiomatic, making them seem like a J.Hell yeah.

Edit: Also, my awkward phase was when I was 10-13. It was really long, but also really early. I guess I just grow up fast.That and we give zero shits. Went to a friend's house with a bunch of people I don't know. I dressed as Edward Scissorhands' cheap Mexican knockoff, Eduardo Knifefingers. I taped plastic knives to my hands.

It was great. Somehow I managed to not be too awkward.Yep. Se is primarily about taking in information without much processing, and it lives in the outside world. This isn't to say that Se users are always aware of their environments - I'm fairly aware, but I also tend to zone out for a few minutes while I'm thinking. However, Se users are generally better at being aware of and interacting with the environment.How about ISTPs?Yes, though I should say that Si isn't about remembering specifically. It's more about the impressions a person receives from sensory input. Let's use food tastes as an example. An Se user (like me) would be more inclined to powerful-tasting food, interesting combinations, and meal variety since Se is novelty-oriented. An Si user is capable of the same, but is more likely to have favorite foods based on their past experience of that food. "This pie reminds me of when I lived at home, so it always brings me comfort when I eat it." An Se user would say, "this is a good pie," and maybe, "the crust is crunchy and perfectly baked and the strawberry filling is delicious."

Edit: An Se user, when given food options, is more likely to say "I want to eat somewhere I've never eaten before" or "surprise me." An Si user would be inclined to visit restaurants where they've eaten before, and know that they like the food.

At least, that's my understanding. You may want more information.Not sure, though there obviously is a benefit. Most of my ideas are thinker-centric, since I'm not very attuned to the Feeling side of my personality. Just a disclaimer.

•Keep us thinkers from becoming assholes by reminding us of social convention

•Providing people with a moral compass

•Giving people the emotional support they need when they can't do it themselves

•Keeping society on track by making sure people do the "right" thing

We'd try to pool our practical skills to carve out an existence on this island. Everyone's treated equally, with equal access to resources, which is ideal in a small community where unfairness could lead to revolt quickly. 

I'd try to smooth out any emerging heirarchy/power structure to make sure nobody gets too big for their britches. Those performing special tasks get priority access to resources unless someone else is in dire need.

Logical principles of fairness which everyone understands should be best at keeping people behaving well. We'd thrive and be successful.Hell yes. Love Christmas. I get so much stuff."Fuck."

"Shit."

"I'm working, fuck off."

"My latest project is..."

"Why would you talk about that?"

"Don't speak to me for a good two hours, please."

"I really should clean my room."

All of these are things I say on a daily basis.Is it possible to change it? I've been wondering.He sucks.True. I have a reputation for swearing like a sailor. To me, it's a point of pride.Sure. I love ENFJs. I don't know. I'm actually the opposite. I tend to avoid one-on-one experiences in favor of smaller groups. Larger groups are okay in some situations, like if I'm comfortable with them.

If I had to take a guess, I'd say that he/she just prefers fewer people. It's much easier to open up to someone and be happy/energetic around them when it's just one person you're comfortable with. I think your friend likes you.

Disclaimer: I don't have enough experience with one-on-one meetups to tell you whether I'd be good at it. It just boils down to me feeling awkward making conversation. Group conversation is easier because I can just interject when I like. It sounds like your friend may not have this problem.I like to be comforted. Mostly creature comforts. Give me a comfortable place to sit, some good food, and the company of someone I love, and I'll be happy.Sounds like he's just comfortable with you. Maybe he's into you. I know that I often avoid eye contact with the people I have crushes on until I screw up the courage to talk to them.Winter all the way. But I live in AZ, where the winter highs are around 80 degrees and it never goes below freezing. Winter is the only time I can go outside.Source?Come live in AZ. A week ago we just set the record for 100-degree temperatures latest in the year.Thanks for getting that in my search history.You can be whatever you want to be.Then you know my *pain.*Detailed and thorough?

I have a simplistic view of friendship. I enjoy being around people who share my interests and views. If I go to things when people invite me, then they're probably my friend.Come to the ISTP sub. Zero pretension, just people shooting the shit with each other.

/plugI was thinking ESTJ, though loving to meet new people and thinking about their motivations doesn't sound as Si-ish.

Sounds like a low Feeler, since they keep people at an arm's length. Probably low Fi to boot, since low Fe still forms bonds easier.What about an inferior function? It's either Fi or Ne/Se. He seems more of an extravert, which would make it Fi. He also seems too grounded for an Ni-user, so low Ne seems more likely. Do you have experience with ESTJs?Would you say that you prefer to figure things out for yourself and sometimes focus on ideas for the sake of ideas, or are more focused on application and practical use?

It's okay if you're both.How do you figure people out? Do you put themselves in their perspective and gain an intuitive understanding, or connect data points through a logical process?

I'm trying to find evidence for/against Ti, so bear with me. I've never done this beforeDo you think you need to act more in accordance with your own values/develop values in the first place, or act with more consideration for other people's feelings? Which do you struggle with?

What do you think of a journey of self-discovery, in which the person gains a deep, mystical, emotional insight about themselves which can't be described in words?

Do you have much of an inner sense of reverence and/or respect for religion or certain institutions or are you more skeptical and distrustful?

You're sounding like an ISTP to me.

Edit: changed "processed" to "described in words." Sorry for any confusion.Because it makes sense given his presentation. I was just getting sensing-thinking vibes, and I also thought low Fi, so ESTJ would make sense./u/mirrorconspiracies, what do you think?Thanks! I think ISTPs can care about social status as well - that's a thing ESTPs are known for, and ISTPs are still Se-Fe. I definitely care, but it's a lot more relaxed. Se also tends to be very materialistic, so it isn't hard to imagine an Se-user loving fancy brands - again, something I can relate to.

So the possibilities are ISTP, ESTP, and ESTJ. At this point, I don't know how to get an accurate typing. I'm gonna turn this over to more experienced people. Oh, yeah. Ever since I decided to stop eating sweets and lose weight I barely even have a sweet tooth anymore. I do my best to control myself in order to meet my goals.What's the way to fun power?

Ultimate power is ultimately boring. I want a good amount of magical power that I can use to pursue my interests. In a D&amp;D game, I'd be an eccentric wizard who crafts golems and magical items. Maybe i'd use the things I craft as means to an end in order to gain money and further independence.

Edit: assuming there's no level system in whatever D&amp;D universe this is, I'd probably end up trying to extend my life through magical but non-evil means and then learn as many fun skills I can.You sound just like my girlfriend, who's an INFP."Emotionally retarded." You've got that right.What are some of your inconvenient truths?Fascinating. I'd love to find out how Stuxnet really works.What about ISTPs?I'm sure Fi could play a big role if staying healthy/away from something becomes a strong value.Which people?I think so. A lot of the "masculine" and "feminine" stereotypes we have are actually just thinker vs. feeler stereotypes. I agree. I'm not sure about this. Maybe it would be safer to say it's accessed more easily, or it's "on" in a small portion during Ti mode.I understand. I just said that when processing new information, I would use Ti-Ni to make sense out of it and Se to gather more.Yep. I'm mostly in things only for as long as I'm interested in them. Once I learn what I wanted to, I move on.

Or I just forget after a while.

Edit: to be honest, I'm not even sure of my type. I don't act like other INTPs I know. I'm much more self-assured. But I also don't really know if I'm an Se user, just because it's hard to find a description that isn't "great at sports and well-coordinated." I'm neither. "Lives in the moment." Maybe if I had energy, but I'm so sleep-deprived that I don't ever really have the energy to engage with my surroundings for a long time.This makes sense, actually. The fact that I recognized this in myself must mean that I'm usually in a "resting state." I should fix that. Thanks for your contribution, it really helped clear things up.I'm in school. Currently, there is no useful knowledge to be gained by my senses. It's all fed to me by teachers.

I do end up getting very restless and not paying attention in class. I fidget, doodle, make paper airplanes, throw stuff at my friends, etc. Or I snark at the teachers who can handle it.Mechanics and sci-fi? Sorry, just clarifying.1. Beta.

2. It sucks. I was hoping for Hillary. But this is what we have to live with. I'm gonna make the most of it.

3. Right now? I'm feeling like I want to get out of bed, but nobody else is awake and I can't wake them up.
If you mean about the election, I'm hoping that the protests eventually get Trump kicked out of office, but that seems unlikely.

4. Personally, I'm not that afraid, but I have friends who aren't white or straight and they definitely are afraid. I'm hoping Trump doesn't turn out to be as bad as he's seemed.I like some sci-fi. Mostly movies. Every once in a while I see a piece of technology onscreen that captures my imagination and I almost feverishly try to figure out how it works. Generally I wouldn't say that I enjoy either one more than the other. Mechanics I enjoy when I can use it to accomplish a goal of mine, e.g. increase social standing by impressing people with a thing I built.Side note. I appreciate that you make it logically foolproof. One of my biggest pet peeves is when Fi users just ignore logic.

That's a better way to describe the theory as well. Functions of the same attitude tend to "feed" each other. Say each person has an introverted and extraverted "mode." In the introverted mode, their introverted functions would stand out more, and in the extraverted mode, their extraverted functions stand out more. 

This also takes into account relative strengths. When I'm in my extraverted mode, I'm using Se-Fe, but with Fe inferior, I can come across as immature/insensitive/not thinking through my actions. Like an ESTP, but younger and more awkward.That's a better way to phrase it. Thanks.What led you to that conclusion?I don't think people realize they're ignoring Te. It's more that they twist facts unconsciously.It's more of a sudden flash.What's this subtype theory you mention?A little bit. I start getting really depressive though. I personally can't have a good relationship without touch.doot dootThis makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.

I like the idea that the function stack is a bit more fluid under this theory. It makes it a bit more realistic.I'll organize them into tiers, since there are some I can't rank over others. Tier 1 is the highest.

1: adventure, solitude, freedom, knowledge, humor

2: wealth, power, justice, creativity, popularity, compassion

3: faith

I think I'm the stereotypical IxTP.I love California as well. The beach especially. The sun, the smell of the air, and the cold water always rejuvenates me.

I feel the best when I'm exercising, swimming in the ocean, spending time with my close friends, or playing a favorite video game.

My "flow" gets ruined when people nag me about my responsibilities or try to tell me what to do and where to go. My stress level goes up instantly.Baby, don't hurt me.I sort of listen to both. Mostly the sounds though. If a song doesn't sound good I can't listen to it. Often I sing the lyrics without even really thinking about what they mean.I'd love new clothes, computer parts, useful things. Not big on stuff that only has emotional value unless it's from someone I really, really care about. I'm far happier with either something I can use in my daily life or a fun experience I'll remember and treasure.The guys who do shit.Compliment their butt.I'd disagree. Two people I know of the same type have said this independently of each other.Maybe so. This is actually me and my father, who I suspect is an ISTP. It seems reasonable to say in the moment, but I look back and cringe now.It sounds like a Ji-thing in general. "I'm confident in my decision-making process and I don't think that I need to apologize for acting on the information I had."Being able to ignore emotions to get things done.He obviously has very strong feelings towards his beasts. He more learns about them out of a sense of wonder and reverence than a desire to know how they work. Plus he's happy spending time with them as opposed to with people, which points to Introversion. Ne/Ni because he seems more scholarly than grounded, and (IMO) only an NF would be willing to go against the grain like he does. Plus, he doesn't seem to have the same problem-solving ability an ENTP would have.Creedence is too damaged to be typed properly IMO. He *seems* introverted, but could just be very unhealthy.That's because climate change is fucking real, dude. 90% of the scientific community agrees on this, and the scientific community is designed so that science produces the correct answers. 2016 has been the hottest year on record, following 2015. The Arctic is 36 degrees hotter than it should be and ice levels are at an all time low. 

Pizzagate is total bullshit. People seem to forget that most people are actually good and decent human beings and wouldn't orchestrate a massive child smuggling ring. All of this was started by alt-right trolls trying to stir things up. Besides, no political party could organize something so massive and shady. It would be a total disaster for press and totally destroy their credibility, thus letting the other side win. 

Do you seriously think that so many individuals could be involved in a massive, shady conspiracy? It defies rational thought. The odds of the conspiracy falling apart increase exponentially with every new person added. If you aren't gripping, man, I don't know what you're doing.

Edit: the reason your opinions are censored is because they're wrong. People like the idea of being a "lone warrior" who knows the truth, or being in the minority going against the majority out of a sense of self-righteousness, but most of the time, the "lone warrior" is just wrong. We only have that idea in our heads because a lot of movies glorify it.

 And I understand that all of this comes from a basic moral stance of "lying and child trafficking is wrong." You are a good person for believing those things, but the information you have is just wrong. You're seeing conspiracies where in reality there are just people doing their jobs as they see fit. Example: muting people who spread false information.

Edit: clarityYeah. Not sure what caused it, but I think our system could do with some major overhauls. 

I'm starting to sound like someone who cares about politics. This violates the ISTP neutrality pact. Brb, deleting accountEmotions are the real enemy, anywayShit. Deleted my own comment on accident. Anyway, your INTP example is more what I was going for. I said this in a moment of anger. However, I didn't feel inclined to apologize for anything because in my mind I was doing what was correct based on the situation.Hey, it's a valid tactic. I say I enjoy getting things done, but in reality I'm lazy as fuck except when something comes up that I see as worth doing/fixing, such as a community project or a crisis situation. Every other time, I'll say anything I can to avoid work.Because they crave death and Cthulhu the Destroyer can give it to themThis is a valuable perspective for me. Thank you. As someone with inferior Fe, I've said things like this a few times. In my mind, everyone else is just being unnecessarily emotional and getting in my way. I'm still leaning that way, but I'm going to try to be more considerate in the future. Be nicer to people when I'm steamrolling them. :P

Seriously, thanks. This has helped me become a bit less of an asshole.I have traits of every house except Hufflepuff. Fuck Hufflepuff.All good advice. The situation wasn't as big as you think, though. It was really a momentary argument between me and an ESFJ where our viewpoints clashed, but it got me thinking, so that's why I made this post.

It's hard for me to express regret that isn't genuine, though. I'm not in the habit of forcing emotions. I can put on a smile when I'm feeling neutral so I can butter people up, but it's hard to bring myself down from self-righteous anger to apology. I guess the best strategy for that would probably be just to calm down. She was demanding an apology in the moment and wouldn't let me go otherwise, though, which made it tough.

Thanks for the advice. It's always fascinating to learn about how I can make things easier when socializing. People are complicated and the sooner I can master talking to them, the better.

By the way, how's the typing going? Last time I was here you were identifying as an ENTP, and that's what I saw from you. Then it was ISFJ. Now I'm sort of seeing both, leaning ISFJ. Sorry, man. That sucks.

I've only had one death in my short life. It was my great-grandfather, who fell and broke his hip at 95. It affected me deeply back then, and I was sad for a few months, even crying a bit. But then it just stopped hurting. I suspect now that my recovery period would be even quicker. 

But I'm abnormal.I've been *trying* to be gone. I've had a little bit of success. I keep realizing that the MBTI is unreliable and I should stop overanalyzing it, but I keep coming back. I'm gonna keep trying to "kick the habit."

Relatedly, I think it's good that you aren't identifying as a type. Humans are too complex to fit in boxes, some more than others, and you don't seem to fit into any box that I know of. This kind of overanalyzing about your type/identity only leads to ruin. At least, it does for me.They have their own strengths. But then there's caring about people. Nah. Working hard? That's hilarious. I'll stay lazy and apathetic, thanks very much. :(Sorry, I don't use "you're" as a pronoun. I prefer "fucker," "fucko," or "sex demon."Nah. I love ENFPs. Just try not to get too weird on me since my fragile brain can't handle itI can show you if you likeWe're off having fun. I think the ISTPs you're seeing are actually ISTJs in disguise.I'm ISTP. Don't really care for marriage. Weddings are an extravagant waste of money for momentary satisfaction. I'd rather spend my time with with whoever I'd marry on a quiet beach.

In my perspective, marriage just has the potential to cause so many problems. It's hard for people to like each other for so long, and I don't want to be bound to someone to the point that I lose my freedom. Relationships can't be forced - they have to start and end naturally.Can you roast sensors too? ISTPs specifically? Maybe go the "borderline autistic" route?ESTPNeutral Good. Neutral Good. Neutral Good. 

No problems here.Why are you like this?Not OP but probablyHey, I'm pretty weird as well. When I'm around my favorite people I easily dominate the conversation/get really energetic/generally become a little shit. Extended conversations suck, and I'd rather just mess around. And I have a weird sense of humor that borders on bizarre/stupid and mainly revolves around me suggesting bullshit solutions to people's problems. 

Nice to see I'm not so strange.These are the basic stereotypes. You're getting the diluted Reddit version, though. If you want real info, look up Socionics or the MBTI wikipedia pageESFJ?I like being like this. It's fun and you generally get a good laugh/shocked look out of people.Surprise, /u/SubparBologna is my alt account. I'm desperate for human attention so I upvote my own comments ;_;Shit.What I'm about to say shouldn't imply I think the MBTI is perfect or objective, but I have had some luck categorizing people based on the types. I just use it in a really loose manner without boxing anyone in. Some people fit really well and some people don't.

I think the MBTI could be a lot clearer and more precise if it described the integration certain traits have into the personality. Like, the percentage of strength of Thinking over Feeling. A 60% thinker is gonna act different from a 90% thinker. 

Of course, with all the traits, the goal should be 50/50. People who live by logic will be very unhappy, and so will people who can't control their feelings. Same with S/N. Any strong preference toward a particular trait results in losing touch with reality.

Just my two cents.There's no value in it if you think about it too much, or try to live by it. It's just a tool that's meant to be used. It's superior to astrology in that it has a basis in real life, but is still unreliable unless you're well-versed in the theory.no clue lol that was 5 yrs agoAnyone read this? It's a "rational" retelling of Harry Potter, fitting the plot of all 7 books into 1 because the characters are no longer stupid. [The fic is here if you're interested.](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality) I'm trying to type Harry Potter in this world - he seems like a bizarre INTP/INTJ hybrid like most super-genius characters (BBC Sherlock). Thoughts?Hey all, I'm trying to decide which type I am. I'm unsure of my functional stack as well as my perceiving axis, and it's been stuck in my head for a long time - I can't drop this problem until I figure it out. Does anyone know some defining factors that can tell the difference between a TP and an FJ? I'm confused because I do tend to be very logical and suppress my emotions, but I also have good social skills and a strong sense of Fe "fairness." I'd appreciate it if anyone had the means to solve this problem definitively. I'm open to pretty much every typing method. Thanks!I usually play fairly complex games with many factors affecting gameplay, such as Elder Scrolls Online and some management games like Cities:Skylines and Towns. I also play stealth/action games like Dishonored (favorite game) and Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. If I had to break down my video game choices I would say open-ended games with multiple choices and courses of action with an emphasis on logical strategy and also exploration/dynamic environments. Anyone feel like overanalyzing that? INTPs? :PI've been on this sub for a while and I've been fairly convinced I'm a Ti-dom. I'm very logical and people usually say I come across like I'm angry all the time. However, I constantly doubt whether I'm an ISTP (the type I test as) or not. Does anyone have an opinion to weigh in, or a questionnaire they'd like me to take? I'd appreciate some help. Thanks in advance.Has anyone bought one of their premium profiles? Are they worth the purchase or can I get that information online?Does anyone else find Socionics's type descriptions to be too flowery to derive meaning, or that they overemphasize aspects of personalities? For example, the LSI-ISTj profile just seems almost worshipful. "Often arduous producers of logical systems." It seems to present a very unrealistic view of ISTjs. I certainly can't relate very much.

Anyone else have this problem? I've heard that Socionics is a bit troublesome for MBTI enthusiasts.I've got this half-assed theory in my mind and I want to see what you all think. It goes like this: if an introvert primarily spends time in their own head, then they would engage their introverted functions (Dom and Tert) more than their extraverted functions. Vice versa for extraverts. That's one half of the theory. 

The next half then says that the Dominant and Tertiary functions would be considered a person's "dominant state," and would contribute to the person's motivations.

For example, ISTPs and ESTPs. My ESTP friend is much more outward-oriented and is a self-described people person. Most of the Ti I see from him is bent in the interest of learning how to navigate people and social situations (Se-Fe). As an ISTP, I just want to learn things. I want to figure things out and I do that with a combination of logic and conceptual understanding (Ti-Ni). When I run out of information, I gather more with Se, and then repeat.

This is based off of one user's theory which I read (can't remember who, shout at me if you know). Basically, dominant states reflect the person's dominant and tertiary functions and that's a big contributor to their worldview.

Did this make sense? What do you all think?"It wouldn't be genuine. I don't regret what I did. Based on what I knew about the situation in the moment, I was justified."

Any guesses as to what type would say this?
As an ISTP, I can attest that I am not quick to anger, but am rather patient. In fact I would say I could probably count the number of times I have been angry on one hand. 

That said, the times I have been angry might have seemed a little spontaneous to observers. This is because I won't be angry for one thing, but a series of things that you have done deliberately to get me riled up. Straw that broke the camel's back, etc.*Anecdotal evidence incoming* 

**1)** I like writing on legal topics, because it requires logic and reasoning skills - an exercise in Ti, I guess. Creative writing, not so much but I would say each to their own.

That said, I love the physical act of writing by hand with a fountain pen, so wherever possible I will do that rather than typing.


**2)** How old is your brother, OP? I think this would describe me when I was younger, and a little more shy, but my adult brain manages to *brute-force* these interactions and I act more confidently and with less regard to stepping on toes. 

Internally I really do care about people and their feels etc., but provided I can justify saying everything that comes out of my mouth then I see no reason to censor myself. I would say this is my version of confidence...


**TL;DR**: I don't think either of these things rule out the possibility of him being an ISTP, merely young or shy.&gt; He's actually very boring. He believes small talk and pointing out small little obvious things... accounts for a real conversation and it doesn't.


A) If you find him boring, why are you with him?

B) ISTPs are not generally interested in small talk and often find silence preferable. Are you sure that is his type?

C) It sounds like you are being incredibly dismissive of him, and assuming he should follow *your* model of conversation, rather than having a personality of his own.

I have to agree with u/SirSplodingSpud. You seem to have him pegged as some sort of Se retard (your problem, not his), and that sort of thinking is not going to be conducive to any healthy relationship. Ne /&gt; Se. ISTP 5w6 here, so maybe I can weigh in with some anecdotal evidence...

I am an ectomorph, so not a physically imposing person, although I am fit and I like to keep myself in good shape. At school I was always drawn to sports that allowed me to use this to my advantage (such as sprinting etc.) Having strong leg muscles and a  very light frame can be advantageous.

In my day to day life I am quiet, and prefer to walk around wearing headphones, in the hope that people won't try to interact with me. The regular description of 5w6 as a hermit fits me perfectly. 

I prefer to eat one huge meal per day (more efficient time-wise, and my body doesn't seem to mind doing it that way).

I could happily spend weeks in isolation, provided I had a supply of food and some form of entertainment (generally my PC for games and wikipedia).

As far as careers... I had no motivation to work until recently (wtf years etc.)
Now I'm an ESL teacher, and I love my work, because I get paid to speak my own language, and I am a huuuuge language nerd in general.

My strengths, I would say that when a problem appears, I will become MacGyver until I resolve it. I love tinkering with stuff, so a broken something is much more fun than a functional something.

Weaknesses, I would describe my life as a sort of organised chaos. I know exactly where everything is, although it might not seem like a conventional filing method (floordrobe etc.).
Also punctuality. I'm not good at committing to things, even at the last minute. My best friends know that's just how I am, but it comes across a little differently with people I don't know very well.

By relationships, what type are we talking about? Familiar, platonic, romantic etc.
I would say, like a lot of ISTPs, I form stronger bonds, but with very few people.

My sense of humour is very dry, and is not everybody's cup of tea. I love dead-pan delivery of outlandish statements.

Anything else you wanna know?

ISFP I think.I think Eva would be ESFJ and Lunge is INTJ
ISTP. "freedom means to live true to yourself, not without law." - GintamaWhen they have a problem, they pull everyone who's sympathetic to them, then blame it to the third party who has nothing to do with it"We fully support your decision" - ISTP community
this is true\&gt;no results

worst survey of my lifeI've noticed a lot of ISTPs hate high school, but personally it's alright. thislel
I do that. Not to that extreme but I randomly laugh quite a bit. 

Dunno why. Usually it's a long thought train that leads to a funny thought.ISTP Male.

Was the Magic nerd. Hung out with a small group of fellow nerds who are still my best friends. I'm only 19 though. Everyone says this but I was pretty smart but never did my homework and dropped out in my Junior year (I got an 85 on my ASVAB so that must mean I am somewhat smart). While I was in school though I was the smelly poor kid who always slept in class and was always late. Didn't talk to anyone but my close friends but I wasn't shy. Just didn't want to talk. I would often speak out in class when I identified bullshit and I would always be one of the more active people in class discussions. I think I was trying to show off. I was and still am I know it all. I go to Benning in September.http://imgur.com/PZw8TS6ISTP.ISTP. I usually like to play a Ranger or a balanced warrior, not like a brute or a barbarian, just a good warrior. A Rhetorical question, just for conversation.

I am an ISTP. I think except for the entire resistance to authority aspect that ISTP's and STP's in general would perform well in the Military. We are really good at sensing our surrounding and making quick and logical decisions. We are also more mechanically inclined and good at mastering tools.

I ask because I just joined as Infantry in the US Army. 
Extremely lazy when it comes to things I don't want to do (homework is a big example), awful at conversation, and unmotivated (Ti-Ni loops/WTF Years)[Frank Zappa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eln3J6BxWN0) is the quintessential ISTP. [Solid Snake](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Solid_Snake#Personality_and_traits) is also definitely an ISTP.ISTP

Extroverted type: ESTP

Introverted type: ISFP

I like Se.First off, you strike me as a perceiving type. "Ramblings" with no script and little preparations, and living your daily life based on what you want to do that day screams perceiving.

When you answer the question about your younger self, you say that she'll know that you're being "genuine". Being genuine and judging someone or something as genuine is a trait of Fi.

The "moment experienced through your body" question negates all possibility of you being an Se. As an Se user myself, physical moments are powerful, I can describe those experiences with detail, and they're vivid to me. Not being able to describe how it feels and being really wishy-washy about your "feeling" of the music at a party says you're an Ne to me.

So from what I've seen, you're either an INFP or an ENFP. Leaning more towards ENFP.Musical Intelligence. I dunno. I just like music. I don't really play any instruments.INTP. You seem to think things through very logically, and you say you value you thoughts more than anything else. Your avoidance of people and lack of knowledge of the external world is common amongst some INTPs. The long, detailed way you talk, covering every detail also screams INTP. INTPs also historically lack motivation because of their tendency to get bored easily, which you have also described.Rationality, Shyness, Aggression. [According to this I'm an ESFP.](http://puu.sh/rfIGM/b5ab0ea903.png)https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/4oju6q/your_istp_care_and_handling_user_guide_and_manual/

This as well.&gt;Does this mean Ti may or may not accept facts if it's consistent with their thoughts? What exactly defines and develops Ti stream of logical consistency?


Ti is about being objective and accepting fact. That's the whole goal of Ti, to be completely logical and objective in their own thinking. Most Ti's I know, including me, would never just throw away a fact just because it doesn't fit in line with what they know. They would incorporate that fact into their logical system and do away with their old misconceptions.


&gt;What are some general good tendencies or quotes to get a general feel if someone is Te or Ti?


Te doms are generally more controlling of their surroundings. Ti doms are more aloof and laissez-faire. This is just a generalization though. Not true for all.


&gt;Is it generally true that Ti will be more likely to learn information just for the sake of learning since it's interesting to them


Definitely rings true for Ti doms, especially INTP's


&gt;I guess when we look at them a little more fundamentally does this mean Te is more like to be open with sharing it's logic outwardly (Extroverted) while Ti is more likely to think to itself a lot before sharing it with the class (introverted)?


Yes, this is generally what would happen. A Ti dom would most likely think through the problem carefully, accounting for everything, Ti doms want to be correct, therefore, will spend a lot of time making sure they are. A Te dom would more likely be open to share their answer because they value decisiveness and quick thinking. They get an answer and run with it.


&gt;Does this post feel more Te or Ti in nature? Or neither?


Neither, but if I had to choose one, Ti. It seems to have a "get to the point" vibe to it.Huh?ISTPs are arguably the most blunt and punctual of all types. Yes. I'm better off alone. Stop asking.The Road Eternal. All my basic needs taken care of, eternal life, and the ability to go wherever I want and do whatever I want. Deal.My [ISTP] Mentality:

Fuck everything that's unnecessary. Get focused on what you want and need to do. Things that you don't need/want to do right now? Leave it for later. Things that you need/want to get done? Ignore everything else and do that.

And don't force yourself to do anything. "..."Exactly. Either way we're fucked, but at least this way we get to be entertained while we get fucked.
Thought I'd give this a go :)

1. I respect honesty, sincerity, practicality, forward thinking, inquisitiveness and a sense of humour.

2. Rudeness, aggressiveness, arrogance and ignorance, and short sighted. 

3. I can remember moments with a sensual component - the smell of bushfire, the embrace of a person, a meal shared between friends. I have trouble remembering exact phrases, actions or 'firsts'. Sometimes I also have emotional memories but these are only of moments with very strong emotions, otherwise my memory is void of emotionality. 

4. I mainly think about the present and then future. My thoughts focus on practical matters - What I'd like to try as a hobby, where I want to holiday next, where shall I eat dinner. Occasionally I think about ethical concerns as well, and how wonderful the natural world is. My thoughts can be scattered but they seem to follow a path like on a map. I daydream, sure, but about real life scenarios. 

5. I'd like to converse with someone who could provide both questions and reception. A discussion should be added to by both parties. 

6. Environmental health, plants and animals. 

7. I wouldn't confront them unless it came to the point of unending aggravation. In that case I'll question them as to their actions and be honest about how I feel in relation to them. I'd be more upfront with family and close friends. 

8. I enjoy trying new food, exploration of areas, listening to new genres of music, reading books that'll expand my knowledge. This occurs fairly regularly. I would not be riding coasters or leaping out of planes due to my fear of heights.

9. I'm reserved and aloof, quiet initially and then more boisterous when known. Sometimes I rarely speak and at other times I enjoy a good conversation (though sometimes the topics can be considered odd by others). When speaking I talk rather quickly. I speak as clearly I can and as politely I can. I can forget words easily or muddle my sentences up (today I called thyme term). I like being active, up and about and exercising every day. Sitting at my desk for 8 hours per day is mind numbingly boring. I love to take mornings slow, read a book and eat my breakfast, then work up to lunch and exercise, then go out for dinner or band rehearsal or go for a walk in the evening. 

10. Assisting my husband with a job application and not having him fully understand how to address selection criteria. Or my boss assuring me the new pay process would work without any hitches and me trying to explain we haven't completed certain details for staff to be paid, on the day the pays were to be processed. 

11. If a situation feels wrong I usually get out pretty fast. I attempt to talk with others but I mainly make such decisions on my own. Big changes happen once every couple of years for me. Most changes involve me being at the helm, though involve opportunities that have miraculously appeared. I enjoy getting others' opinions and advice before making decisions though. 
 
12. 30, female, Oz. ISTP - Musical, nature, selfMe (older sister) ISTP, younger sister ESFJ, mother ISFJ, father INFJ. I assume my husband is INFP. 

Fun times.ISTP/F

Heartbreaking: "You're such a head case" - INTJ friend (when admitting I don't know how to deal with people). 

Heartwarming: "I can spend my life with you. Just need a retreat space handy." - ISFJ mum. I got rationality, independence and shyness. For me as an ISTP.
Likes:
1. Consideration of others. Maybe keep the radio volume down while other people are working, or let a person be when they are reading on the bus.
2. Honesty (with a bit of tact). Please say what you mean, but don't be an asshole about it. 
3. Awareness of your surroundings. Be observant, look around you, treat where you are with some thought. 

Dislikes:
1. Insincerity. Interact with others with respect and do so as you, not as a version of you. 
2. Incessant complaints. For most people I know, life is not that bad to be constantly bringing them down. 
3. Lack of humour. I'm aware most of what I say is drenched in sarcasm, absurdity and/or black humour, but for some reason people keep thinking I'm serious. Even an unsure laugh would suffice. ISTP 9w1

I find my inferior Fe creates a sense of emptiness. I can distinguish between good and bad, pleasure and pain, but my emotional state seems to remain steady with no notable highs or lows. 

Occasionally my temper rears is head but it's over in a flash and then I'm back to "normal" but to get that response it has to be a really bad situation. When I'm quite frustrated (usually because something makes little logical sense) I don't become angry. I become teary and upset and I have trouble with trying not to react in this way. 

As others have mentioned with their IXTP's, people seem to have difficulty with my lines of questioning, and completely miss what I'm trying to gain from conversations. I've been called a weirdo a number of times when I've wanted to find out information. I miss insinuations and implications that are socially frowned upon. I also have difficulty with how to maintain acceptable small talk. 

Finally, if someone is overly emotional around me, I shut down. I've no idea how to help or respond emotionally; I resort to helping out by doing things for the person, or I run and hide. It sounds horrible, and I agree it is, but I've no idea how to cope. 

Edit: Forgot to mention, I try not to rock the boat. I refrain from saying how I truly feel for the sake of the group and if people are arguing amongst themselves I become extremely uncomfortable, but refuse to step in, unless it violates my principles. 

Staying still is harder than moving. Nakama or the road eternal. An opportunity to explore other perspectives and sensations should not be passed up - Nakama would be preferential as allows experiences in different environments but using different bodies with varied means of sensory input. With the road eternal I would remain myself in my own body and explore only different environments. A good selection of pictures - Many works by some of my favourite artists. Love Robert Mapplethorpe and Picasso, and Marina Abramovic was there too I believe? Your Alpha selection was also entertaining. It'll be interesting to see the other quadrants and how they contrast to this. Master outliner. Yep that sounds about right!Phew, a robot. Thought I'd be human for a second there. From experience, ESTJ and ENTJ types are very talkative, and not only that, they explain exact details of upcoming activities by using extensive monologues. I just want the outline and/or key points so it can drive me a little nuts.As a female ISTP, I am a strong believer in equality and fairness. For me, this means that the same rules and regulations in an organisation/government applies to all people within, - male, female or other - without a "get out of jail" card, turning a blind eye or finding a loophole. If something does not seem equal or fair, the argument needs to be given as to why it's not and how we should fix it. 

Socially, this should be same. Sexual assault and harassment should not happen from male to female or female to male. What some don't understand is most women who bring this topic to attention don't hate men for "being men"; they hate feeling belittled, attacked, shamed and not in control of their lives. Men don't enjoy experiencing these, and neither do women. Freedom of choice and expression should not be restricted by gender boundaries. Basically don't intentionally harm others, no matter their sex or gender.

Overthrowing the patriarchy is not the way to achieve this (replace one extreme with the other). We need to be aware of how we interact with one another, and treat everyone with respect. We need to work together to overcome our differences. Freedom

Honesty

Humour

Happiness

Adventure

FaithI rarely have nightmares - When I was younger they were more frequent but I guess I was an anxious child and that impacted my dreams. Nowadays my dreams involve people from real life and crazy scenarios or environments (stuck on an island during a storm being chased by military; or driving along, finding a house on fire and attempting to put it out).

My recollection of details in dreams disappears pretty soon after I wake, but I remember how I felt ... like physically. I can remember hugs, kisses, food, weather, and some strong emotions too. My favourite dream was waking up and feeling my friend still hugging me but I was alone in my bed. Sounds odd but it was a wonderful start to the day. My lack of direction, constant questioning of choices and inability to identify where my interests lie. I would like someone to just tell me, "This is what you need to do with your life. Now go and shut the hell up!"A. Age, gender, and nationality
30, female and Australian.

B. What kinds of things do you remember easily? What kinds of things do you usually forget?

Things I usually remember:

* Drum beats and guitar riffs
* Plots of stories
* Flavours in food
* Scents
* Tactile experiences
* Codes/numbered lists
* Procedures (though not necessarily step-by-step)
* Birthdays
* Locations of places

Things I usually forget:

* Details in stories
* Names to faces
* Specifics sayings or quotes (both in discussion and written)
* Sometimes the words that I am looking for

C. What kind of people do you feel most comfortable around? What kind of people make you feel awkward or uncomfortable? What kind of people annoy you the most?

People who make me feel comfortable:

* Calm
* Friendly
* Quiet
* Thinker
* Has a sense of black humour

People who make me uncomfortable:

* Loud
* Brash
* Overly proud
* Those that invade your personal space / are overly intimate without invitation

People who annoy me the most:

* Oblivious (not learning after being instructed again and again)
* Conniving
* Tactless
* Disrespectful

D. How do you usually handle interpersonal conflict or confrontation? How do you wish you handled it - what would you change about your usual approach if you wanted to improve?
Feel free to give examples if it's helpful.

If I can, I will avoid interpersonal conflict. Most situations I either get my way, go with the flow or find a compromise. It is difficult to make me angry or push me to a point of retaliation; the farthest is a state of frustration. However, if the situation is quite heated or personal for me (either a value I hold or an attack on myself instead of remaining objective), I will lose my composition and say quiet stinging comments ... and then go and cry. I wish I didn't do that.

E. What is your demeanor like?

Talking with my hands is a habit I've grown up with. My eyebrows seem to be one of my more expressive body parts. I have trouble hiding my feelings in facial expressions. Apparently when I am thinking, I have a "monk" face according to my husband (I shut my eyes and drop my head).

I'm not very talkative. I definitely listen more than talk and will only talk if there is a discussion I feel is worth contributing to or I am seeking information/help. I talk a lot faster when excited, but I'm never very loud.

I see myself engage with others in the moment then I step back and feel disconnected.

People would term me as more rational, definitely. And serious with a goofy side.

I stumble on words because I don't always remember the particular word I want to use, but I tend to take a moment to determine what I'm going to say.

Excitement happens over random or small aspects, so I'm not often excited, and I'm not overly expressive when it occurs. I make a little laugh, smile a fair while and sometimes make a small "eeee" noise. Boredom happens a bit more, but I can usually find something to do or something to read/watch to combat this.

I love doing things, in part to do something and also to be productive. I have to mix up my days, otherwise I will become bored from not doing anything, and I feel amiss if what I've done during the day has no benefit whatsoever. I try to find the positive outcome. 

F. What kinds of things do you seem to notice more than most people? What do you more often seem to miss?

What I notice more than others...

* Small aspects of buildings, shopfronts and vistas that stand out.
* Scents - I seem to pick up on them before others do.
* Errors in names and categories.

What I miss...

* Changes in a person's appearance (more initially though)
* Others' emotional states and intentions behind behaviour.
 
G. Think about your energy, interest level, and skill doing various activities. What energizes you, relaxes you, bores you, or stresses you out? What do you do well, okay, or poorly? What can you do all day, for a while, only in short bursts, or barely at all? Which of these seem like a waste of time, not just for you but in general?

What energizes me...

* Being given a challenge or task and completing it in the most efficient and time-saving way.
* Applying frameworks to decision making e.g. legislation or codes.
* Being physically active - I'm not much of an Adrenalin junkie but walking, working out, playing instruments etc.
* Cleaning out my room and redefining what will remain - does it represent me and where I am right now.
* Consuming delicious food.
* Holding an argument or debate with others that's not emotionally charged.
* Reading about news and articles regarding politics, business, health, the state of the world but not emotionally charged topics.
* Instructing others to complete a task.
* Being thrown into a unknown situation, establishing what I have and what is the expected outcome and trying to solve the issue.
Virtuoso, ROI-C. Sounds very much like me... Except the specified careers (military, pilot, police etc), though the same criticism can be said about ISTP profiles.ISTP female - Little John, The Sheriff, Maid Marion, Robin Hood. 

"You too, believe that morality is another word for commonsense and suitability, and not something which is universally valid or a religious truth. Your feeling for security is strong, and you would rate reliability as one of your virtues.

Women: You are more permissive about the morals of others than you are about your own."ISTP 5w4. 

In high school, my grades were high for my classes, scoring distinctions and high distinctions, except for math (never found a teacher who I could follow). I focused on music, history and English. I wasn't a teacher's pet, but teachers liked me because I paid attention and applied myself, and occasionally challenged what they said. Most other kids paid me no mind. I didn't fit in, but I wasn't excluded either, so it worked well for me.

My friends consisted of a group of 30-odd people, but I had 5 or so close friends in that. Mostly I'd keep to myself unless I felt there was a need to talk to someone or was in the mood for a chat or a walk/drive. I did plan parties and get-togethers during summer holidays for the group - Figured if I was bored and stuck at home, they'd be too, so the events were welcome relief. 

I never got in trouble in terms of detention or suspension. I'd skip out of math class occasionally, but the teacher didn't care. 

My family had the usual dynamics.

Hobbies were playing instruments, listening to music, reading, going for long drives, discussing stuff, eating watermelon, and hanging out at the beach. 

Finally, I had no plans as to what I wanted to be; I just lived my life in the now. My parents tried to get me to study history or anthropology and become an academic, but at the time it seemed too vague a path to take, and instead veered into a communications degree.  When I was younger, I didn't keep a journal as such (nothing so regular or formal), but used notebooks to write thoughts and ideas in when I needed to express them. I reckon I used up a notebook every 3-4 months. At the time it was more comfortable than confiding in another person. 5 huh? Here's 5 that I've enjoyed. First is my all-time fave, the rest are in no particular order:

Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad

Buffalo for the Broken Heart by Dan O'Brien

Notes of A Dirty Old Man by Charles Bukowski

The Year of the Flood by Margaret Atwood

The Triumph of Seeds by Thor Hanson
 I guess when I drink, my Se and Fe become more pronounced. I engage with the people around me more and become highly aware of my environment. And on occasion, I become self aware of my social ineptitude which leads to me being melancholic and tearful. I try to ease off drinking before that happens. &gt;ISTP = the sarcastic b*tch i sit with errday, but hilarious

As an ISTP sarcastic b*tch, I can confirm this is accurate. 

There weren't really definable cliques in my grade, just groups of friends. I guess if we needed a label, we were the "nerdy" bunch of students, but we got along with the other students fine. Insincerity is one way. Lying is another. Being stuck in a rut (for better or worse) and doing nothing to get out of said rut also annoys me - guess that'd be described as lack of ambition. Had to take it as a career advice session. My top 5 are:
Adaptability 
Ideation 
Intellection 
Context 
StrategicISTP here - That is almost exactly what happened last time I entered a Starbucks, 8 months ago, but it was unsweetened tea. Damn you're good. I enjoy being involved with activities (e.g. lunch, gym, project at work) but may not fully engage with other people. I also enjoy spending time with others mainly one on one or in small groups. Conversations and physical activities are the best way to keep my attention (walking chats are great!). 

Rarely do my emotions flare up; I'm fairly level unless a stressful situation arises. I use music and physical exercise to moderate this. However, if a situation happens, it's either an uncontrolled outburst of crying in frustration (not ideal and embarrassing) or I become sullen and snarky (also not ideal).

Hope that answers your question OP.INTP then ENTP. Some tests still see me lead with an extroverted function, but Ti is certainly the dominant one.  I (ISTP) plan the route and navigate, pack the booze and decide food options. Husband (xNFP) packs board games, researches accommodation and entertainment, and does the driving. 

We seem to cut it close when it comes to ETAs and inevitably forget at least one important item each. Such is the life of two perceivers.Looking way back at senior year high school:

A) What I liked most to least

- Legal Studies

- English Extension

- Advanced English

- Music

- Studies of Religion

- Maths

B) What I did well at most to least

   I recently had to work with an ESTJ on establishing a new pay process at work. When we sat down together, she (Te) took her old procedural document and began to identify where it now differed, trying to redefine every step to match the new process. I (Ti) only noted the key requirements and the order they were to go in, focusing more on the categorisation of the info. After a few heated moments about what was more important (method vs material), we decided it would be best to separate the two: Ms Te would write the new procedural document, and Ms Ti would create shared spreadsheets and code references to assist with amending the pay each fortnight.

When we do the actual pay runs, our Te/Ti clash is also obvious but thankfully we take turns to do it individually. She follows the procedure like it's the bible. If something is not in the procedure she becomes flustered. I still don't have a set way of completing the run but will refer to all the documents if need be - as long as the requirements are met and the info is correct, I'm good. I avoided other children, spent too many hours reading, and was both introspective and curious.My top three as an ISTP are quality time, acts of service, and physical touch. ISTP: Dogs all the way. I'm the older sister and I have one younger sister. With me being ISTP and her ESFJ, we clashed in interests/behaviours when younger, but we would mostly enjoy each other's company. As adults we get along well now. She inadvertently instructs me on how to relate to others better and not be so business-like.  The Explorer. Female ISTP. 

Geopolitical: 699. 
Technological: 553. 
Male cultural interests: 691. 
Female cultural interests: 649. My result in the test was ISTP, which is spot on. I found the options to be quite clear, especially in terms of the cognitive functions. It does pay to read all the text in the options given. I appreciated the small profile before the third set of options. ISTP - Thinking introversion, followed by anxious, then social and restrained/inhibited. ISTP

Structure: Confederal technocratic nation-state

Governing system: Constitutional semi-presidential republic

Economic system: Mixed economy

Social system: Authoritarian progressivismISTP - Respectful analystI too am not a mechanically minded person, but am more interested in physical hobbies (gym, drumming) and logical reasoning/ethical discussions... So I guess you could say my strength is systems thinking and practical applications of same, which is how some ISTP profiles are written. Maybe you share a similar approach to life? 
Just awful.Let's put it this way: I like exciting** things. If someone can stay exciting or if it's my first relationship of the sort, it will last a while. However, as soon as that excitement is gone, I wish I could leave it. If there's something harder than expressing love, it's expressing the need to break something off because the idea of dealing with someone else's emotions or expressing my own in relation to them makes me cringe. Why can't every relationship just being growing together and then maybe just growing apart?

** Doesn't have to be sky diving kind of excitement. Could just be the little ways the person does something.Sky diving, motorcycle, snowboarding... I must be the most boring istp ever.
My best childhood friend is an esfj and it is the easiest relationship. She gets frustrated with me because I suck at staying in touch or making plans to see her. I'll send her the occasional funny text but if nobody approaches me, I'll be reading at the nearby coffee shop alone and thoroughly enjoying myself. I'd say that if he is actively messaging you, hanging out with you, and accompanying you to events like weddings, he likes you.


But I'm a chick so... who knows. 7w8 here. Yeah, I don't come off very extroverted or friendly at first. People tell me I seem very cold, but that changes into something apparently endearing as they get to know me. It's not something I try to do, I just really don't find the point in small talk or things I don't care about. I have no problem talking to others, as long as I want to talk about it. Absolutely not a mechanic. Nope. HiA bit 
I think your ages might be an important part here. I'm nearing 30 and as an ISTP, I've just started to get good at communicating with people when I need to because I actively work on it. I have an ISTJ brother and an ESTJ stepdad, and it's really just being mindful of how they are (and vice versa). My ISTJ brother and I are actually very close, which is helped by sharing a lot of interests, but we mostly just ignored each other for a good decade. He's only 20 and is just now starting to figure out how to talk to people and I give him he space to do that (organize his thoughts before he speaks, etc). My closest friend (of 15 years) is also an ESTJ, and again, it's just being respectful of our personalities. She pokes fun at me for taking a year to tell her I am dating someone and I poke fun at her for needing to live her life on a timeline, but we accept that it's just how the other is. 

On the other hand, I also have an ESTP brother and I've just accepted that we will never really get along. We can do it in small doses, but we both just kinda stopped trying beyond that because it just doesn't work. We both want completely different things out of a discussion or debate and it's frustrating for both of us when we even try. He'll try to bait me sometimes because it's fun for him, but I just shut it down immediately. I'm strictly about facts and if something doesn't "sound right" or "feel right" to him, it isn't a fact to him. To me, it's pointless to even try to engage that because we're both too stubborn and don't back down easily.

Sorry for the novel! I hope there's something helpful in there somewhere.That probably has a good chunk to do with it! Most of my siblings are much younger too and it's really hard to find common ground sometimes. My only sister is your age and you would think I would be closer to her as the only two females when we have three brothers, but we're really just starting to get to that point now. Relationships are work! I know family should be considered freebies in that sense, but sometimes it just doesn't work that way and both parties have to be willing to try harder.I'm an ISTP and I love *some* sports. I have to really understand it to get anything out of it. I grew up in a soccer-loving family, so that's been kind of ingrained in me. I recently learned a lot about hockey and am starting to get more into it. I don't care about watching other sports really. I need to know players and completely understand the rules. I'll go to superbowl parties and get no enjoyment watching football, really. 

I do love playing all sports casually. I get pretty competitive and pick things up quickly. That's still enjoyable for me. That's definitely an Se thing whereas I think the former is Ti.Oooh, this is fun for me because I'm an ISTP and my brother is an ESTP and we're fairly close in age (I'm 2.5 years older). I think function order has A LOT to do with this because we are very different. The biggest thing we have in common is that on a good day, we can talk for hours about a given topic we're both passionate about, especially over a beer. As kids, we also got into a lot of shit together, he just never really grew out of it.

For me, Se represents itself in feeling restless and stuck and bored easily, as well as being spotaneous and up for trying new things. For my brother it's that he just DOES stuff. Whatever comes to his mind or seems fun at the time, he does it. Whatever he wants, he has to have it right then. Whatever he wants to say, he says it. I do have this side to me, but I funnel it more realistically especially since I have kids now.

I think the Fe/Ni flip also adds to this. My feelings are super repressed and only burst out sometimes, whereas my brother is actually quite sensitive. He will, of course, act like he doesn't care about anything just like I do, but it's more obvious that he does. I think the swap also adds to the fact that he's more easily influenced by outside sources. He's very reactive, whether it's being easily excitable or easy to anger. 

He also completely disregards his Ni, but that could be a maturity thing. 

Edit: Just wanted to add that this is obviously just my experience, but I thought it might be helpful to see a real life example.Glad it helped!ISTP, also thunderbird, haha. My regular house is Slytherin.I like what you did here! Is there more information besides the brief paragraph I've seen on the American houses? Also, how would you differentiate exploring the world vs experiencing the world? I'd argue (with the very limited information I've come across) that Thunderbird could be Se since they are the adventurers. It's entirely possible I'm just attempting to make it fit for me since I was sorted into that house, haha. I do get your rationale of body vs soul there though!I can see that. Thanks for clarifying!How does it work out for you guys? My ESTP brother is honestly the sibling I get along with the least, but now that we're older and understand each other better, it's definitely been better. I'm sure age gaps and shared interests really play a part here too.I generally test ISTJ or INTJ, but knowing people of both types it was painfully obvious that I wasn't. I always ignored ISTP because I don't fit some stereotypes (adrenaline junkie, for example). Once I learned more about functions and different ways in which they can be applied, I reevaluated and also found tests that just test for functions. I've accepted that it's more about the way I process things than 100% fitting the stereotype bill. I also realized what things might influence the parts I don't fit. For example, my age, the fact that I am the oldest kid, how I was raised, and things I prioritize now (especially as a mom). Also, my whole life I've kind of felt like a walking contradiction, which makes a lot of sense as an ISTP, but it made it hard for me to feel "at home" with a type.What kind of sandwich?I'm so in.I vote ISFP, btw. Because why not?From a similar thread a few days ago, I outlined some differences between me and my ESTP bother:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4qaeca/z/d4rfswo

Sorry, on mobile and one handed so not formatting.That and if you're currently in school or how long you've been working in your field. There's definitely much more needed.I have a lot of younger siblings (6!) and two kids. Kids are constantly testing the waters and figuring themselves out. Plus, they learn by example, so it's not uncommon for kids to try to emulate their parents or older siblings. That and environmental influences in general, and I think it makes perfect sense that you don't truly have a type until you're older.

Anyways, as a kid I loved to stay home and read or play video games (though sparsely by today's standards because it was the 90s) or write stories, but I was also always up for adventuring. I lived in a small town, and would just ride my bike everywhere or take the bus into the city. I was much more social than I am now, but I think this had more to do with "fitting in". I was somehow class president in the sixth grade, which seems ridiculous if you know me today. 

I think me as a kid lines up pretty well as an ISTP, but besides being almost a social butterfly, I was always myself and kind of a dominating personality. I think "changing" probably has a lot to do with how much of a follower (for lack of a better term) you are. For example, my ISTJ brother was much different as a kid than he is now, but he needs clear instructions in his life. He also has myself and our other brother that are older, and would tag along and try to copy us. It definitely took him longer to just be himself, but he's still not fantastic at making quick decisions for himself. I don't know many INTJs, but to me, they are more calculating? My partner is an ISFP and I can't imagine him being mistake for an INTJ. He's super laid back and go with the flow-y. Se is an aux function for both us, but Ti vs Fi dom is *very* obvious. It's one of the biggest annoyances we have with each other. He feels something is a great idea and just goes for it. I feel it's a great idea, often think about it, and then change my mind. It's almost as if he's Se dom because he rarely second guesses it. 

Obviously that doesn't really help with INTJ vs ISFP, but Se is so low on their stack that I don't see them as being impulsive often. Someone with more INTJ experience might be more help here, but I thought it could be useful to see read about my experiences with an ISFP.The former, and not really either of those. He's very okay with who he is and openly acknowledges that I'm the rational one. If I disagree with a decision, he'll definitely listen to logic even if he doesn't get there on his own. He's definitely in tune with his strengths and weaknesses, and honestly gives no shits about people around him and how they make decisions if they don't influence his life in any way.

Edit: I should add that while he might follow my logic, he does often disregard it or make the same "mistake" more than once because he just doesn't think about it. For example, he helped a friend move and when I got into the car a few hours later it REEKED of weed. (We don't live in a great state for Marijuana laws.) He had transported all her smoking paraphernalia without even thinking that he would be the one to get into legal trouble if he had gotten pulled over on the way. He followed my "that was a really dumb decision" logic, no problem, but I'd be lying if I said this was out of character for him.This actually sounds a lot like my brother who is as ESTP, haha.Spot on for me.The only thing I do this with are terrible puns. Maybe all your friends have had way too much caffeine?My people!ISTP. Caffeine just kind of keeps me going and makes me tolerate people better. It makes me feel "human" and I drink it pretty much all day long.

Alcohol makes me more social, and I build up a tolerance very quickly. This also makes me quickly slip into dangerous territories, so I stick to beer (trying new ones is fun with all the craft brews around) and the very occasional whisky. I have to force myself to buy alcohol once or twice a week, otherwise I lose all impulse control.

I have had many other substances in my late teens to early twenties, and it was always for the experiences. It made me enjoy talking to people for hours or go introspective. What I don't like (and is also the reason I don't really drink heavily anymore) is completely losing control. I've never really regretted doing something because that's not my style, but I'm not comfortable with any kind of memory loss.ISTP. If money was no issue and I wouldn't have to work all day every day, own a bakery. That being said, I in no way require this to be happy and it's nowhere near my actual career goals.ISTP female, graduated 10 years ago. I was smart, but got horrible grades because I never did homework. I had no passions and didn't join any clubs or did sports. I had a wide array of friends, my best friend to this day was varsity cheer captain, but I also had emo kid friends. I didn't have a ton of friends though, most were friends of friends. My actual friends would often basically force me out of the house. I went to concerts and later raves. I had an older boyfriend that would buy me alcohol. I spent a lot of time on LiveJournal and Harry Potter forums. I regularly visited a hookah bar and smoked a lot of weed.

So painfully stereotypical?ISTP, aware of every detail of my surroundings, but mostly looking straight ahead. You'll be fine! ISTP here too and I obviously can't speak for you, but for me, I'm okay with authority as long as it makes sense. In the infantry especially, authority makes a lot of sense.TIL why I always felt overprotective of poor, misunderstood sharks. ;)ISTP. Red because it's what my ISFP husband picked and we like to take over gyms together. I would have gone blue.ISTP female here and I make similar choices. I think it's just common sense to not befriend annoying people when you keep your circle of friends small. I don't innately dislike women at all, but I don't do drama.Women on the internet also a first?A wild female ISTP appeared!Oh, hell yes.This got too cute for me. 

Wild female ISTP got away safely.:DThe post states they want to understand what other people are talking about when they refer to stereotypes, as is often done on this sub. That sounds to me like they want to understand a conversation, not apply stereotypes to people.*tips hat*I would probably always turn them in because if someone is capable of killing someone and successfully covering it up, who knows what they could do to others (myself obviously included)? However, if they're that good at murder... why are they fucking it up by telling me? Then I can only assume it's an accident of some kind they now feel massively guilty over (is that still murder?) and I don't want to deal with that.

ISTP.What others have said, also keep in mind all the outside influences such as family dynamics (especially how you were parented), experiences in general, psychological trauma, etc. It's all about cognitive functions--how well developed they are and how you apply them.Beeboop.I'm actually very organized and just accepted I don't get stuff done early. I keep a calendar and to-do list so there's no surprises and get stuff done when I need to get it done by and am pretty good and gauging how long it will take. I'm in school right now, and by an awesome person's standards probably super procrastinate, but I get it done by the deadline and do great work. I don't fight it or get frustrated with myself anymore, and that's actually made a huge difference.Must be the Se because I'm very very similar to this. I stick to beer (3-4 max) about once a week or the very occasional glass of bourbon now. Better for my wallet, tolerance, and health.

Regarding my behavior when I'm drunk, I just talk more, really. I used to get sloppy obnoxious (try to fight people or do other equally dumb things) when I was younger, and have learned my limits the hard way.I'm horrible at fantasy people apparently, so I'm going with ISTJ (fave brother) and ESTJ (best friend). They'll keep me in line and we'll get lots of shit done.I'm apparently choosing to leave my husband at home while I'm on an island for an indeterminate amount of time. Don't tell him.I'm just thinking of the kids!That is actually pretty funny and insightful! See, he's a great dad and would be pretty useless in this situation (ISFP). The kids are 4 and 9m and would be utterly useless as well, so I could focus much better on getting home without them there. This is all in theory obviously, I'd definitely be sad and wish they were there at some point if it actually happened. Logically, though, there would be no benefit.

Edit: Also this totally goes along with what I said in a post a week or two ago that was asking about how ISTPs and ESTPs could possibly be so different. Perfect example.So cliche, but I mean, we'd definitely have the most fun.Also, I was surprised there was yet another ISTP/ESTP sibling pair, but went back on my comment history and realized it was you from two weeks ago, haha.He's 2.5 years younger, and we actually got along great as kids. Much like you and your brother, we really kept our parents on our toes and I have a lot of fond memories. 

We had a good decade, mostly as teenagers, that we just didn't get along. He had a lot of behavioral issues though. Got expelled from every school, would steal cars, that kind of thing. (I don't really attribute this to his personality type, but our parents got divorced and we moved to another country--that's a whole different story, but he didn't take it well.) It got very exhausting, and was not really something I wanted to be a part of. I was by no means a model teen, but I didn't make it my mission to get caught doing something ridiculous. In retrospect, I think we were both mad at our parents for different reasons (I was often made to be responsible because I was older and just scrutinized a lot more) and focused it on each other.

A combination of getting out of the military, and I think age/maturity, helped him a lot though. He's  much more in control of residual emotional issues (mainly his insane fuse) and we've both accepted the ways in which we are different. It's a lot better, but I still would not take him with me.Super late reply! I'm also hella interested in stuff like that and will read up on those links. How people develop is super interesting, for sure, especially now that I'm responsible for my own tiny people. My parents honestly did do their best coming from very terrible home lives themselves, and we're all completely okay now. They had to learn on the job, haha. Their younger kids have had a much better experience, for sure. I do often wonder how we would have turned out under different circumstances, but I'm pretty happy with myself now and a lot of that is because of learning experiences I had.I was expecting to disagree with this but I can't do it, haha. ISTP married to an ISFP, and it's pretty dead on here.I think my dating history is about as ISTP as it gets. Prior to meeting my husband, I only had 2 serious relationships and both were mostly long distance. I preferred it this way because I could mostly still do my own thing, but still experience being in a relationship as well. 

I dumped my first boyfriend at 18 because he was too clingy (which he somehow managed despite being in the infantry at the time and deployed a good chunk of our relationship)--he really wanted to get married and have babies ASAP despite me still being in high school. He would drive 5 hours to see me almost every weekend for a year, not counting the times he was otherwise occupied with work. We had a lot of fun though, and still hooked up for about a year after we broke up. He always bought me alcohol and was fun to go to shows with. Now that I've developed some empathy, I feel kind of bad that I dumped him while he was in Iraq.

I got into another long-term, long distance relationships about a year or so after that. He lived in another country, but would come every 3 months and we'd travel a lot. Very out of character, but I was super infatuated with him. Perhaps a lot of that had to do with the experiences we had together and the fact that this overlapped with some heavy substance use. In any case, we was even less interested in coupling up than I was and when two people don't really care to work at a relationship, it just can't go anywhere.

I'm not really too sure about typing them because it as a long time ago. I think the latter one may have actually also been an ISTP, and the former maybe an ISFJ. I'm not good a typing people.

tl;dr: One was too clingy/pushy, and the other was as disinterested at being tied down as I was.FWIW, I've been with my ISFP partner for 6ish years and it works well because neither of us is the clingy type. We have a lot of shared interests, but we also totally do our own thing frequently. No hurt feelings or expectations. You just gotta find someone who gets it!I'm pretty sure he's an ISFP. Incredibly easy going and terrible at thinking things through ahead of time. He's one of the most genuine and easy to read people I've ever met. He would never do anything to intentionally hurt anyone, but again, he doesn't often think about repercussions of actions and will go with whims. We do share that, but I'm heaps better at rationalizing and talking myself out of bad choices... or even recognizing ideal choices. He's very "sounds good, let's do it" at the first option.

He's an amazing dad and super family oriented almost to a fault. He dropped out of college when his mom was hospitalized to take care of his younger siblings without a second thought. He is up for doing anything, but equally happy just hanging out at home (again, something we share). He needs alone time less than I do, but he gets a lot more stressed out over things like money.

Most importantly, he just gets me. From the day that I met him, I've never felt the need to hide anything from him. He's the kind of guy that without me needing to ask would scrub out my puke buckets 5 times a day when I had hyperemesis (extreme morning sickness) with our first kid. Despite thinking about his wants first usually, he has never turned down a request to help me. He's not intellectual in the slightest, but it actually works out really well because he pulls me out of my head. He's kind and loving, but without ever being overbearing (okay with me not being comfortable with PDA and not taking it personally, etc), which is perfect to me.

It really took us a few years to get perfectly in sync, and it's a good balance now of leaving each other alone and fostering our relationships.I've seen people say they changed it based on the color they like.
Lol what. In what universe would ISTPs be okay with totalitarianism? A lot of ISTPs are probably libertarians? Though, I think we mostly just think our political beliefs are personal. :PNo, it made me uncomfortable.Yup. And who knows how long before she started recording she had been pressing him. He didn't react well, but I cannot side with her on this.ISTP. All of those. I toss and turn like crazy and kids often ending up in my bed does not make it any better.ISTP, definitely not emotional here either, but I really appreciate intent and skill. I don't really care if I don't "get it" or it invokes something in me. I admire the creativity and/or skill that went into it. If that makes sense. I've also never really disliked a work of art because I know it's all deeply personal. Maybe I art wrong. I'm not an artist at all, haha.

Edit: Autocorrect evil.Feel like this works for me too (ISTP).ISTP. Very aware of my feelings and others. Read people and situations well. Definitely hide my own emotions (but at the same time, have no shame when I show them) and get uncomfortable in emotionally charged situations. I am good at dealing with them, but I will never seek them out. I don't let people bait me into arguments, for example, if they are just trying to argue for the sake or arguing or attempting to feel superior. Despite generally avoiding arguments, I tend to do well at them because I don't actually get emotionally involved and don't say things unless I'm 100% sure it's factual.Alternatively: high schoolers are all selfish (and a lot of the time assholes) and some people just don't grow out of it.Of course. I actually totally see how you get to that conclusion. Fi + Se is pretty self-serving, but I do think most people grow beyond that because it makes for a lonely life.It'll be fun to see more input on this!Well, for one, people are innately special snowflakes so your point is kinda moot, but I'll play. As an ISTP female I spent my adolescence not really relating to people and just got used to being different. That was and still is my norm. ISTPs generally enjoy living their life in stealth mode. I've never lived a life as the other types, of course, but I can only imagine that sometimes people actually want to stand out or simply just enjoy talking about themselves. You bring up some really good points. As an ISTP, I need a lot less from other people. Confirmation that I'm special would fall under that, haha.I agree, and think it makes perfect sense. Even if that isn't the case, I will never understand someone choosing to live their life a certain way can so gravely offend someone. Cognitive functions teach us that people have different processes, and this is just an example of that.ISTP here. When I met my ISFP husband, we were super casual in the beginning and it ended up just working out really well. There was no pressure and things just progressed naturally. Don't know if it really counts as a "doubt", but I did not see him as relationship material in the beginning. He was nothing like anyone I had ever been attracted to before. So easier said than done, but taking the pressure off and just seeing how it goes worked out well for me. I have never felt the need to be seriously involved with someone though, so this always came naturally to me. I still can't relate to friends who are questing for "the one". It sounds terribly frustrating.

Edit: Also, re "just knowing" that's a yes from me. Again, it didn't happen right away, but I don't really have a doubt in my mind now. Sometimes my Se monster wants to run away and I have to rationalize it away, but 99% of the time I can't imagine not being in this relationship. That being said, just because it "feels right" doesn't mean it's effortless and doesn't still take commitment to making it work from both sides.I can try!

1. By excluding potential partners based on presumed (I say because I don't think you can accurately type someone you're casually involved with unless they're super open and obvious) type, you could be shutting out someone you really jive with before giving it a chance.

2. Romanticising a type in your head is not helpful, and if you seek out a relationship with someone based on their type, shit can just as easily not work out.

3. Let's say you do meet your ideal female. I think with this kind of thinking, you're likely to then put her on a pedestal and have SUPER high expectations. Maybe not consciously, but it'll be there and nobody wants that pressure put on them.

4. Just because someone is of a certain type, does not mean they act how you think they will. Are all ENFPs you meet exactly like you? You're pining for a person that does not exist right now. Or maybe it's someone specific who does exist? Which you still won't find in someone else.

5. Most importantly, relationships are largely emotional and love is irrational. This ties into point number 1. There's *nothing* wrong with having preferences, but someone might surprise you.&gt;How many minefields you've unintentionally stepped on when friends or acquaintances seek your council?

Surprisingly, not that many. I do have one friend (I think she identifies as an INFP) and I'm kind of surprised we're still friends because I would constantly, yet unintentionally upset her. I think this was probably one of my greater learning experiences because I learned to be more tactful. She's one of the few friends I still have from high school, and it's both that she now knows to only come from me when she wants the brash truth (which is actually quite frequently) and I know how to word things a little better. In general though, the people who do come to me know what to come to me with. I'm not the friend who will just say "that sucks" in 10 different ways. 

Okay, I lied, I have stepped on a lot of minefields back in my day, but they weren't really friends and we just didn't hang out after that, haha. I mostly just shut my mouth unless I'm really comfortable with people or directly asked now.

&gt;How many times has siding with a friend or acquaintance's boyfriend regarding a critique in "clingyness", "smothering" or their tendency to be overly "reactionary" (more Fe for that observation) has landed you in hot water?

At first I thought I had never done this, but then I realized that I lost a friend in high school over this. She was kind of a shitty person to begin with, but she dumped me as a friend because I told her boyfriend at the time that I could understand how her behavior annoyed him. That's the only instance I can think of though, or maybe that's just the one time I noticed.

&gt;How many times have you thought, "Drop 'X' and insert 'Y'. Instead of a sneer I would have been bitch-slapped so many times by now!"?

I don't think I'm understanding this question, but I also got like 3 hours of sleep last night.

&gt;How many times have you thought to yourself, "You really don't want me to be honest with you."?

Probably daily. It goes back to the stealth mode thing. People are very open about their lives in general, and I mostly just sit back and take it all in and never really share (reddit being my obvious exception). I have to know everything, but I don't actually care usually. If that makes sense. 

&gt;Although it's progressively easier to "brick wall" passive-aggression directed toward you by about mid-twenties, how did you maneuver around that in your teens and early-twenties?

Oh, this will set me off. I love my mother dearly, but she cannot deal with things head on, so she is frequently passive aggressive. This is obviously not much of an issue now that I'm an adult with my own life, but it still gets to me. It's not even really malicious, but her way of phrasing things is "I can't believe nobody did the dishes. [Insert rant about working all day.]" vs "Hey, can you do the dishes really fast? I'm tired from working all day." I don't know, but that's just a huge difference to me. The latter is solved in two seconds, while the former gets everyone worked up and defensive. Or maybe just me. But yeah, I'll readily admit that I still cannot deal with it because it takes me back to being a kid. I'll argue about it and point this out like 95% of the time, and not just with my mother.ISTP and ISFP, together 6 years, have 2 kids. We are both 100% honest always, but we're both not big sharers. We have some mutual friends, but we also have our individual friends. We know the basics of what the other is doing, but we often do our own thing. I don't really tell him about conversations I have with my friends, but I would if he asked. We are always open when things are iffy, for example, if the other got hit on because that's not something you want the other to even think you were hiding. We both need independence though, and our situation is obviously different from yours. There's only your normal. Our normal is definitely to not to be together always, but the other always has an open invitation.Rouge.&gt; Sick and/or fussy kiddos, I'm assuming. I hope you get some peace tonight.

And they say sensors can't be intuitive. /s

&gt;I forgot one, singular word "chromosomes". My fault. 

Ah, that makes it a lot of sense. In which case, 100% yes. When I was like 18, I liked to play a game where I would try to get people to punch me. (It never worked, haha.)

I am not someone who downvoted as I don't participate in typing threads, but I can only imagine that is why. It's not necessarily lazy, but you give nothing as a jumping off point. Kind of like the "read my comment history" threads... you're asking people to do all the work for you. People are much more inclined to help you out if you give them *something* to work with.I'm not great at typing people, but I'm an ISTP with an ESTP brother, so I'll gladly answer any questions you might have. Also summoning /u/trippin_daisies who has been trying to figure it out as well.

For me, one of the biggest indicators is how Se manifests itself. If you're all about DOING whatever pops into your head, you're likely an ESTP. It's kinda shoot first, ask questions later. Whereas I would have the impulse to shoot, but most of the time rationalize it away in some way. (Not saying ESTPs can't do this, of course.) Also us ISTPs are kind of notorious for, as I've been calling it these last few days, living in stealth mode. The more we fly under the radar, the better. ESTPs, in my experience, are much more comfortable with attention.Maybe your responses here will be helpful. I'm just saying if I were into typing threads, that's how it would read to me and I would not be inclined to type you. You asked, and I answered, you don't need to argue about my opinion with me, haha.You sound a good amount like me in high school, actually. I think people think being an introvert means you have to act a certain way. I also have good social skills and no issues being around people, but I get to a point where it burns me out and that's really the key difference here.

You're still pretty young, so I can honestly see it going either way for you. I am the same in that I love going hiking and such, but I'm also happy staying home and playing video games. I *need* to get out at some point, but I also *need* to be alone at some point. It's a near constant yo-yo of conflicting needs for me, haha.You got me reminiscing now, and I actually think that does sound more ISTP. I think the getting away with stuff because you make decent grades bit checks the stealth mode checkbox. If I compare myself to my brother, he's the one who always got caught because he just didn't care or think this through (when we were younger, people obviously grow out of that mostly). I was equally "bad" but I can tell you the exact times my parents ever found out about it. You can always pop on over to /r/istp and see how you relate to people there. And it's no problem! Glad it helped.I think you are too focused on this one aspect that you see as a key trait to ISFPs. I think you're not remembering that they are also incredibly laid back. My partner, for example, is happy doing anything work-wise, as long as he's working for a good company and making enough money. He's just not career-oriented and fulfills his passions elsewhere.

I also think it's perfectly normal for people of any type to not have one thing they are incredibly good at and then passionate about turning into a career. That's just having realistic expectations about your skill set. I was very lost after high school because I didn't have a *thing* and I thought everyone did. Not so surprisingly, I saw a lot of people graduate even more lost and not working in the field they saw themselves working it. I went back to school at 25 to "follow the money" and get into tech because it makes sense for me. I'm good at most things I try, I'm interested to learn more, and there are many options with a degree like CS where you don't have to box yourself in too much and you know you'll make decent money. Why not start a weekly thread or something for some pizzazz? :)I often test ISTJ or INTJ depending on the test. I think you can convince yourself you're any type if you try hard enough, haha. I think I get ISTJ because I have a pretty good sense of responsibility when it comes to my family, however, that's upbringing and being a parent. I identify the most with INTJ characters on TV, so I bought being one. My Ni is also pretty developed, but that's just being older. It was the first time I considered having Se too. So that was kind of my door to ISTP, which I'd always dismissed before because of stereotypes that didn't fit me. It was really learning about functions and being honest with myself
&gt;Type? (if not in flair)
ISTP

&gt;At what age did you start wearing makeup?
Maybe around 11 or 12 with friends sometimes, but it made me uncomfortable when people commented on it. If I wanted to do it for school, I wouldn't do it at home. I stopped for a few years and then again at maybe 16.

&gt;How frequently do you wear it?
Right now basically never. It's too hot and I'm a cliche with my two small kids and lack of time to care.

&gt;How long does it typically take for you to finish a full face?
10 minutes max. I'm low key.

&gt;What's your favourite part of the routine?
Finishing? Haha, I don't really know.

&gt;Least favourite?
Sometimes I try to do more or something new and it just ends up looking the same.

&gt;Favourite lip colour?
Classic red.

&gt;Favourite eyeshadow?
None, on myself.

&gt;Do you contour?
No, it's too much work. Sometimes I throw in bronzer and highlighter, but I'm super pale and feel like it looks obviously unnatural and don't like it--again, on myself.

&gt;Smoky, winged, or neither?
Sure to both.

My partner is Fi dom and the most obvious way that I can identity it is that he lives his life on essentially gut feelings. He's not overly emotional or anything like that, but it's very obvious that he does what *feels* right. If there are no obvious issue with option A, then it doesn't matter if there's a more efficient option (this could maybe be more Se at play since he's an ISFP). Same here. I am actually good at talking on the phone, but I hate it and dread it so much. I'll put it off as long as possible. Perhaps I also value it more because texting was not common when I was in high school even. It was getting there, but it was still expensive and nobody had unlimited texting. I really appreciate that I can keep in contact with people on my terms now.&gt;1) What is your type? How sure are you of your type?

ISTP. Very sure.

&gt;2) How old are you?

27

&gt;3) What are your parents' types?

ESFJ (mom) and ESTJ (stepdad). I'm not sure about my dad, but he's bipolar so it's probably hard to actually type him.

&gt;4) What is your job? If you are in school, what is your field of study? If unemployed, what did you study/enjoy in school?

I dropped out of college after one semester, and got a certificate to work as a pharmacy tech for a couple of years. I went back to school at 25, and am studying programming.

&gt;5) Do you have a significant other? What is his/her type?

Yes, he's an ISFP.

&gt;6) Do you have any children? What are their types? If you don't have children, do you want any children? How many?

Yes, I have two sons. They're too young to type.

&gt;7) Do you drink alcohol? What are you like when you drink?

Yes. Just beer (mostly trying different craft brews right now), and bourbon. I like making mojitos or sangria for crowds. *Edit:* I'm mostly just more chatty when drunk. When I was younger, I was downright obnoxious and used it as an excuse to be an asshole.

&gt;8) Do you use any illegal drugs or substances? If so, which ones and how frequently? For the sake of this question, this includes illegally obtained prescription drugs (Adderall, etc..) and weed even though weed is legal in some areas.

Not anymore, but I used to. I smoked daily and would do everything else under the sun maybe once a month or every other month from 18-21ish.

&gt;9) What are your favorite tv shows and why do you like them?

I like and watch most things, honestly. My favorite comedies are probably Parks &amp; Rec, Arrested Development, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. My favorite dramas are Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Sherlock, and Game of Thrones. I am currently watching: Stranger Things (just finished and loved), Scrubs (never actually finished all of it), Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (perhaps odd, but I have a huge soft spot for musicals), The Mindy Project, Mr Robot, and probably others. As I said, I'm okay with most things.

&gt;10) Are you religious in any way? Explain as much as you feel needed.

No, but I have no problem if other people are. I can't wrap my mind around blindly believing in something, but it's cool with me if you can. I'm not one of those atheists that thinks religious people are wrong because I don't think it's my place.

&gt;11) Please answer. Im working a 10 hour shift and Im so bored plz help me.

Okay, chief.I've never done heroin or injected anything. Name anything else and I've probably tried it. Well, I'm sure there's a ton of research chemicals I've never heard of by now, haha. Not remotely interested in finding out though.The genuine ones that leave me alone when necessary. Whatever that is. In a perfect world, just follow my lead. I'm 6 years in though, so at this point, we've got no problems just saying exactly what we need. 

For actual suggestions, watching movies/shows together or spending time in the same room but doing our own thing are my favorite low key ways of spending time together.

It's all about compromise though.Skeptic. Terrible at planning how long projects take apparently, but I'm just that good at doing it done during crunch time. ;)

Edit: Wanted to add that I got 60s across the board and scored Reflective, Subjective (which I'm not sure I agree with, but I'm probably in the middle somewhere), Carefree, and Skeptical.See, things like that I always give myself way too much time because I know shit happens--especially now that I have kids. However, I've never dropped the ball for school/work projects. I was honest based on the scenario they gave, haha. If I was very comfortable with the material, it wouldn't take me close to the amount of time the other papers did.We're just terrible planners. Time to accept it!ISTP, and I understand nothing about what makes YouTubers appealing. I enjoy what YouTube has to offer when it's useful (tutorials, etc) but have no interest outside of that.I'm not opposed to it at all, but I post something maybe twice a week and I have no interest keeping up with people I don't know. I am fairly active in several Facebook groups and message friends daily, but that's about it. I do browse throughout the day and check new things out early. Like, I have people messaging me daily for my tumblr usernames because I was there before it was a thing. I tried out snapchat for a few weeks before deleting it. But again, I just personally don't see the point without a specific purpose. I enjoy tweeting during sporting events, but that's it, haha. When youtube first rolled out, I definitely mindlessly watched a ton of stuff, but eventually I just get bored. When it comes to sharing my life online, I am only okay with doing it anonymously or with select people. Apparently people disagree with you! Answering a question seems to be irrelevant to the discussion somehow, haha.It's all good. My kid is obsessed with YouTubers, and we often have to pretend to be cooking or playing games for an audience (he's 4), so I feel like I get to experience plenty of it.I don't think you understand how MBTI works. It's awesome you visualized a change you wanted to see in yourself and made it happen, but you weren't an ENFP 3 months ago and willed yourself into an ESTP.Start doing some research on cognitive functions. While INTP and INFP have the same functions, being Ti dom is a lot different from being Fi dom. To make it even more annoying, the dominant function can be pretty hard to nail down for most people. Auxiliary is more immediately obvious most of the time, so being unsure between two types that share aux Ne actually makes sense to me.ISTP. Logic/math, movement, selfISTP with good Ni here, so I'm happy to answer any questions. Are you a bit older? I've found that Ni kinda sprung to life my mid-20s.This is me, actually. I'm not proud of this now that I'm older, but I knew exactly what to say to make my mom cry when I was mad at her as a teenager.Everything I've got no control over, really. Often how situations could have gone differently and the best way to act in hypothetical situations. Are you drunk? (This* seems like something I'd do when drunk, haha.)Best of luck!ISTP married to an ISFP, have 2 kids that are too young to type.

My immediate family is ESFJ mom and ESTJ stepdad. Don't know about my biodad, but he's definitely got high Fi. My brother (with mom and bio dad) is an ESTP. Rest of my siblings are with mom and stepdad. ISTJ brother, INFJ sister, ENFP brother.I don't lie, but I just don't offer all the information. For example, when making a return. "I need to return this." Sometimes it gets met with "is there something wrong with it?" And usually it's "no." End of conversation. When I worked retail, people would go into 10 minute explanation (often very obviously bullshit) about why they were returning something. I've come to find that in most situations, you really don't need to lie. So I just start off saying the least amount possible and work my way up to whatever level required.

I also never lie to my kids. I don't care if they're super young and sometimes it's easier, I don't do it. No little white lies. Again, I don't start off explaining every little detail of everything, but I never lie. You've got no idea how many nurses try to tell my kids that shots don't hurt, etc. so they don't throw a fit until afterwards. I can't do that.When I was younger (high school), people told me they thought I was arrogant before they got to know me. RBF over here, but I think that's gotten better.Best liar I've ever known is an ESTP.I get that. I wouldn't even really call him a liar in his daily life, but he's just so good at saying everything with conviction and he really knows how to work people. Sure, sometimes it's just for fun or to save his own ass, but he also made a great military recruiter.To not fall into a rut.ISTP who is often referred to as Type A here. I think it's a combination of upbringing and age, at this point. I don't expect shit from other people, but I expect a lot of myself.I think terminology really matters here. I'm never angry. Really, never. The only times I've been truly pissed off, I was heavily influenced by hormones (pregnant). I do not have any sort of tolerance for bullshit though, that's true. Those are nowhere near the same thing to me. Just because I'll call people out on the bullshit and straight up say that I'm not dealing with it doesn't mean I'm angry or even annoyed. I just don't have the energy for it, but usually my response is to remove myself from the situation. If I can't remove myself from the situation (like at work or whatever) then I'll rationalize why I need to put up with it.Resilience, playfulness, shyness. 

I do agree with this part of shyness: "The upside of this is wise caution: people are indeed often too rash, whereas you know, by instinct, that holding back can save you." That's about it though. I think they confuse introversion with shyness because I don't know which answer I even picked that could give me that result. I'm not shy at all. Unless it has to do with the art ones, but I'm bad at "feeling" art, haha.Yup, and I haven't really thought about it in terms of MBTI since I always classified it as anxiety. I suppose Ti+Se would make sense since it's impulsive, but then I rationalize it away--quickly. Also because I rarely immediately give into impulses. I give in when I shouldn't, but never without considering all the options.

I do consider myself to be emotionally mature. I don't think emotionally mature has anything to do with "controlling thoughts" unless I'm misunderstanding. I don't have any problems with having these thoughts because they are just thoughts. I think trying to make them not happen would cause even more anxiety and I would argue that accepting that thoughts can just flow freely without making a big thing out of of is healthy. It is for me, anyways. 

Am an ISTP, with no doubts.

Edit: Actually! Thinking about it more, maybe it's a Ni thing. I think it might be more about visualizing what COULD happen, which sounds more up Ni's alley.I'm okay with the person knowing *almost* everything about me. It's feeling comfortable in a way that I don't generally with people. Gross.Oh sweet summer child.First, tests are just a jumping off point, so it could be right, but it could also be wrong. Second, the adrenaline junkie stereotype comes from having high Se, which can be manifested in a number of ways. MBTI is about cognitive functions preferences, so it's more that you have a similar process as others of your type, not really the same personality. Describing Se as needing constant stimulation is just an easy way to do it (and it is true for a lot of Se users), but for ISTPs it's more like we gather information by living it and feeding it to Ti. We make sense of the world through experiences, and they don't have to be adrenaline-inducing ones.Actually, when I was younger, I fell pretty hard, but it was always "right"/serious. Even at 16, I was in that relationship for over a year. I didn't ever really casually date or have many crushes. I acted on sexual desires sometimes or had those serious relationships. I definitely feel like I had a different dating experience from most of my friends. It's kinda like once I'm in, I'm in. I've been with my husband for 6 years now and pretty similarly, I'm just in. I don't really have FOMO or anything. So I wouldn't say I necessarily fall easily, but I do with certainty when I do.

There's also a somewhat timely thread on r/istp right now about verbalizing feelings.Ti-Se, to feel better, mostly. The longterm benefits are an added bonus, but I like the endorphins.ISFP. So I have a hard time sometimes because I try to rationalize the Fi, haha. Other than that, we work pretty seamlessly.I think this falls under my opinion that it's just hard to type teenagers in general. You're trying on so many different hats attempting to "find yourself" and probably answering questions like you think you should or based who you wish you were. This, and what you're saying, is also completely discounting cognitive functions. Someone valuing and embodying certain characteristics is a lot different from *how* someone's thought process works.For me, it's more that I categorize it into being able to talk freely about anything without offending anyone and casual conversation. The former is what I'd probably consider deep or can get to whatever other people consider deep because I'm comfortable.Not to mention that their jobs basically require them to have a public "face". I'm not an actor or a politician and I am fairly certain nobody that knows me in a shallow/professional way would accurately type me. Obviously celebrity types should be taken with a grain of salt and I think the quotes they attribute to people are a fairly good representation of a type.ISTP and 5 (with no wings apparently). Slytherin. Thunderbird. Buzzard. Too lazy to check the wand, but it's phoenix feather. I don't really understand buzzard, but I don't know anything about birds.I don't know about other ISTPs, but for me being Ti-Se used to be a great internal struggle. It's like being two completely different people sometimes, and I "use" the understanding of my type to be more okay with needing to change course to appease Se. I've started to be more okay with being me before turning to MBTI, but it's also helped. Yesterday, for example, I was writing code for 4 hours straight and just felt awful. Instead of pushing through to finish, I went on a 3 mile hike, and had no problem finishing quickly when I got back. I used to try to silence the impulses, but I've learned to just about balance and knowing when it's better to give in.I deal with this so much too, man. It's hard. I want to be the most efficient, but a lot of the time, I physically can't do it. It's definitely frustrating at times, but that's why I started being so lax with my weekends. Helps me get through the week without going insane.I'm not saying you're an ISTP, but this is how I felt before I realized I'm an ISTP.I think a lot of us have probably been described as walking contradictions.Nope. I mostly just assume they're wrong.Depends on what needs to be communicated. I have no problem just talking about whatever with my ENFP, INFJ, and ESTP friends. Communicating about stuff that "matters" (work, school, if I just need someone who gets to the point and I can be blunt with, etc.), ESTJs, ISTJs, and INTJs. I approach it a bit differently, but I enjoy talking to any of those 6 types the most.I don't know why 2 characteristics make you definitely not a Ti users. I'm not sure either of those even mean you aren't a Ti user, but even if they are, there's so many other things that influence development, I wouldn't say you can't be a Ti user because of it.

I'm personally not hot-headed, but you'll see other ISTPs who are. Especially younger ones. I don't have a natural inclination when it comes to math because it's, frankly, boring after a while. I "get it". I had no problem completing various discrete math, calculus, and statistics classes in college, but I hated every second of it. ISTPs, while being Ti-doms, pretty stereotypically don't have patience for the theoretical. We love solving *real* problems, and if we don't care, it's basically impossible to get us to care. Again, age/development also helps here. I would never have done all that math when I went to college at 18, but at 25+, I am better at powering through things that are important for an end goal.Knock yourself out, but it will be moot because I won't change my mind.I promise I'm not trying to convince you that you are an ISTP because I don't feel qualified to find people, but just pointing out that you seem to be too focused on stereotypes vs. cognitive processes. For example, Se doesn't have to be about being "physically in it" over all else. For me, it's that I need to experience something in order to make my mind up. I absolutely do have physical impulses too, but I am in my head mostly as well. I just learn through experiencing something, not by thinking about it, which is pretty common for ISTPs. 

&gt;Yes after awhile if I have too much socialization I'm wore out. Give me a good 1-2 hours of alone time and I'm good. 

Also, that's all being an introvert is. If I'm around people I like, I can be around them for literally days without a break. Hell, I have children, so I'm never not around people, haha. Mostly, I'm fine, but I will hit my fill and just need to lock myself away somewhere for a bit. Again, this is probably just upbringing. I likely have a higher tolerance for it because I have 6 siblings, so I've always had to be around people. I've never even lived completely alone, so I don't even know what it's like not to have to really schedule my recharge time. We're not all going to act the same because there's a lot of other factors to consider. 

Despite what type you might be, I think it would be helpful not to look at how you think people of a type should act, but instead focus on how your thought process works. How do you learn? What does it take for you to accept something as truth? How do you go about solving a problem?

^ Mostly hypothetical questions, because again, I'm not one to type people. Questions like this just helped me look at MBTI and myself in a different way. I made my original comment not to convince you that you are an ISTP, but just to point out that this was a very familiar thought process for me. 

&gt;I can create another world of my own in my brain and it will be just as real as the actual real world.

I think this is Ni or Ne, btw.Might wanna look into which type likes to argue and nitpick, hehe. ENTP, I think stereotypically? I could actually see Ne-Ti here. Hope you find what you're looking for! It's definitely nice to feel "at home" with a type finally.*straightens tie*I second this. After talking to OP a bit on the other thread, I definitely see the case for ENTP.When I was younger (high school and first time at college), I only went to classes that interested me. I did well when I cared, but was a pretty solid C student. I did the bare minimum. Often skipping assignments too.

I'm back in school now, and I just go to every class, take notes even if I feel comfortable with the material, and do all my assignments. I never really study and have like a 3.8--which would probably have stayed a 4.0 had I not had a baby in the middle of one semester. All of this. You'd think it'd make us even more cynical, but it really just makes me grateful that I've got it so [relatively] good.Seems like a lot of Fi. I'm not great at typing, but ISFP or INFP?Funnily enough, my first instinct was INFJ, but I couldn't figure out how to support that beyond "you remind me of my INFJ sister", haha.Failed people watching. 70% right brain.It's okay to ask for help sometimes.I grew up in a small town, so someone working the store would know who I belong to*. My dad still lives there and 20 years later one of the cashiers still asks him what I'm up to now, so... this wasn't really a big concern for me or ever happened. I was very independent from an early age though. I walked to kindergarten alone. So if I had been in that situation, I probably would have waited around outside or just walked home or taken the bus if it was a store in the city.I got pretty anal about putting stuff where it goes as I got older, so everything is neat. I don't keep unnecessary stuff though, so that part is pretty easy. My kids probably have the most stuff, but I put everything away immediately so that doesn't really become an issue. Decoration is minimal, but between ISFP husband and my mom who rubbed off on me, it's definitely nice and homey. I take a lot of photos, so it's mostly prints and some more tasteful geek stuff. It's really nothing terribly personal, but just whatever works with the aesthetic.Thanks for the Discrete Math flashbacks. *shudders*So change what you're doing? I dropped out after one semester at 18 because I was unhappy with what I was doing. I took a break from school for years and went back at 25. It was much easier that time because I *wanted* to be there and I chose to study something I actually really enjoy. 

Come join us in /r/istp, we love discussing our wtf years.Clear Introversion: 18/21

Interesting. One of the few times I've gotten ISTP.I'll try. Ni is pretty elusive and hard to put into words for me. I'm almost 30 though, so I think it's fairly well-developed for me. When I was younger, my life was definitely about experiencing (Se) and feeding it to Ti almost exclusively. Now that I've got a good idea about what works and what doesn't, I think that Ni helps with future planning. I've spent all this time feeding Ti and while that analyzes also, I think Ni helps with applying it. 

It helps me figure out what's the best way (and not just in a rational way, but in a way that just makes sense to me in that indescribable way) of doing something. Sometime in my earlier 20s it's like some flip switched from just following impulses to using what I've learned through those experiences and applying them to the future. I had concrete career goals for the first time, and a way to get there. 

As far as I can tell, it doesn't full steam roll me. Even inferior Fe will sometimes do that (heyo random emotional outbursts), but I have to say I don't really know what that looks like in terms of Ni. Can someone enlighten me?👏👏👏&gt;I wouldn't say Ni is about planning- but it's about sort of contextualizing what's happening. It's like making your life into a story, with a direction...? I'm not sure- I don't want to assert anything without seeing more examples.

That's actually a really good way of putting it and very helpful.Overall, I dig our sub too. I wish we got less relationship advice questions where someone is excusing their partner's asshole behavior because they think they're an ISTP so it's fine because we're just assholes. That's my only gripe though.Bad. I understand how to be better (my stepdad is in finance [not exactly, but close enough] so it has been drilled into my head as a kid), but I just don't care to change. My bills are all paid on time, I don't have mountains of debt, and my kids are always taken care of *first*, but I don't have savings often. I blame aux-Se, which my ISFP partner also has... we both have issues with impulse purchases. It's a little better because we made the rule to talk to each other before spending over $50, but sometimes we still fuck up.I don't believe in anything, but I don't think I'm *right*. I only know what's right for me. Constantly fighting in front of me and just shoving me out of the way. Divorced. Dad shittalked my mom constantly. Stopped talking to my dad. Mom parented out of guilt and we had no boundaries. I did okay, but my brother is still an entitled toddler.

My other siblings had my stepdad so they're mostly okay. He's kind of emotionally distant and it really affects me sister. When that came out during therapy, he tried a lot harder. His parents were very abusive, so it's hard for him. He's a good person. So is my mom, but she's a pushover. They've been married for 20 years, so he's mostly my go to dad.

I emulate my stepdad's work ethic and my mom's sense of responsibility and loyalty, but that's about it. All except for one of my grandparents were pretty terrible, so now that I'm older, I do get that they did the best with the tools they had. It's funny how shit goes in cycles. My dad was pissed my grandma left his dad because he doesn't remember him hitting her. My brother was pissed my mom left my dad because he was too young to get how broken their relationship was.

I'm okay with it all. I try to use it to be a better parent.

Okay, raaaant.You should pop over to /r/istp. Many of these points have recently been posts, actually. Nah, I wouldn't bring my husband back, but I wouldn't be opposed to having an AI partner if given the opportunity. That sounds right up my alley, haha. I can turn them off right? ;)I've got some time, so I figured I'd give some more perspective on this. Disclaimer: I don't for sure think you're an ISTP, but I think you're focusing a little too much on stereotypes/descriptions vs cognitive functions.

&gt; Introversion: yes. I value time alone and I need time alone to recharge my batteries. I love my own company and I rarely suffer from being alone. However, I'm not quiet and reserved. When I do talk, sometimes in groups of people I just met, I'm the absolut opposite of shy. People often call me "the icebreaker" because i'm so good at being talkative with new people and making them feel comfortable. Also in groups, I'm loud, I love to crack jokes and I'm often the "leader of the pack": basically, I carry the conversation, I do the talking and I often just get on with it and take the descision.

This is me in a lot of situations. I'm the oldest of 5, so I was kind of raised to take charge in situations and I never really had the space to go full introvert because I've never not had people around me. I'm also female, and most females connect by talking, so I kind of just learned to be a good communicator in order have any friends, haha. On top of that, I spent like 6 years working customer service when I was a bit younger, so small talk? I can do that. Point is, *a lot* of things can influence how you develop. and social skills are just that, skills. They can be learned and developed. Needing to recharge makes you an introvert. Period. 

&gt; I also love to meet new people and I'm good at being social, but it exhausts me. It's like sports: I can be good at it, I can enjoy it, but it quickly drains me and I need to be alone to rest.

Se can take a lot of forms. Social interaction is a sensory experience, for sure. I personally don't seek it often, but people are fun and can add to an experience. ISTPs like having fun experiences. 

&gt; I love my friends. I'm the kind of friend that would help a friend bury a body so to speak. I would go through fire for my friends and I know my friends love me. When they need me, I'm there for them. They know and appreciate my loyalty and it's reciprocal. But I only have like 3 true friends. I love to be alone, but not to be lonely. I love my friends and my worst fear is to lose thme one day for some reason.

This is actually very typical ISTP behavior. 

&gt; I can sit at a bar, a tavern or even at the sports gym waiting for my buddies sitting at a table and quietly observe people without saying a word. People often mistake this for shyness. I probably won't initiate a conversation randomly to talk about some irrelevant crap, but if a person talks to me, I'll respond and I'll start chatting with him about stuff. I don't shun people, I don't feel uncomfortable at all talking to a stranger. Sometimes I do spontaneously talk to someone, but that' sonly to people who I want to talk to at that moment. Sometimes about something specific, sometimes because I genuinely like their company

Again, pretty typical ISTP behavior. Especially the part about not initiating conversation to talk about random crap, but reciprocating it. Also stereotypically, we give off that cool and confident vibe, which people dig. 

&gt; I'm very frank. If something annoys me, you'll know it. If you ask my opinion, I'll tell you what I think. If you anger me, you'll see it. I don't believe in "supressing anger". Not exactly introvert-like right?

Also typical ISTP behavior. Very typical. 

&gt; Strange but true: at work for example, I love it when there's a lot of work and when there's lots of problems to solve. It feels like... I dunno I get more productive in a chaotic environment. I'm good at solving problems in a messy situation.

Okay, now you're just listing stereotypes, right? Haha. First and foremost, we are problem solvers who like to stay busy. Ti-Se, my friend. We like to do stuff to learn stuff or use what we learned.

&gt; I have a hard time retaining a romantic relationship. I enjoy the.. let's call it physical intimacy, but I absolutely need to live alone and to be a on my own a lot. Sorry to enter into details, but after "doing it" with my girlfriend (assuming I have one a tthat moment of course), I often just feel like going home and be alone again. I don't see myself living together with a women in a thousand years, and I'm 34...

Ah, inferior Fe.

&gt; I don't always want to go out with friends. But when I do, I have a blast. But I must have an "escape plan" and know I cna leave whenever I want if I need some me-time again.

I do this like 98% of the time. Again, aux Se. 

After reading this, I amend my previous statement. I'm fairly certain you're an ISTP. I can see the case for ESTP as well though.People who don't seem genuine.

People who drive like assholes.Yup. I am a parent and this question is absurd, haha. The cool part about having kids is seeing who they turn into. Wanting your kids to be what you want them to be is a huge pitfall that's an unfortunate reality for many people. I'm sure OP thought this would just be some lighthearted fun, but it's perpetuates that kids are extensions of their parents and not their own people, which I absolutely can't get behind.&gt; Now on the other hand, I'm mostly questionable about Se because it seems I might have Si. I'm an extremely predictable person. I stick to the things I like, even if I do cycle them every 3 months or so out of boredom. I go to the same restaurants, get the same food every time, get the same drink every morning. I have particular preferences for games. Several people would say I don't like change.

Let me address this as an ISTP. I'm like this, and it's because I know what I like. I've tried a lot of things and I don't shy away from trying things, but when I find something I like, I stick with it. This is actually how ISTPs are stereotypically with friendships and relationships as well. We're hella loyal or we don't care at all. 

Ti-Se can manifest itself in a lot of ways. You'll find a lot of ISTPs who are lazy and a lot of ISTPs who need to get out and do stuff... and most of us who are kind of in the middle. All having Ti-Se really means is that you learn through experience. Se is used to feed Ti. I'll read up on something, but then it isn't really solidified for me until I do it myself. 

Anyways, the rest sounds pretty stereotypically ISTP to me, but I also see the similarities between ISTPs and ISTJs as well. The main difference I see between myself and my ISTJ brother is that I'm more rooted in reality. I like real problems and he's got an easier time with the theoretical. If I can't apply it to something concrete, I have a really hard time with it. He also has a really hard time making a decision sometimes. We're both in college right now and he'll take HOURS to pick his classes. I make sure the basic boxes are ticked (need it as a pre-req for something later, time is good) and I have an easier time putting faith in it working out. I solve problems quickly and efficiently, but he solves them *perfectly*. However, I'm actually more organized than he is so that it saves me from doing the work later.My personal anecdote being from Europe and having lived in the US for 15 years is that's it's pretty individualistic. To be fair, I've never lived in a small town in the US, so I can't really speak to having neighbors you care about... but just politically it's very "every man for himself". I mean, the majority of people don't want to pay more taxes for everyone to be better off if it doesn't directly benefit them. They don't care about the environment. Even in the 90s, plastic bags in grocery stores weren't a thing in Germany--people compost, etc etc.  The individualism really solidified when I had kids too. Moms are expected to do it all alone or they're failures for asking for help. In fact, asking for help in any matter comes with this big sense of shame that you've failed somehow. Can't afford groceries this week? "Have you tried not being poor?"1. I'm friendly with lots of people and would probably call them all "friends" in conversation, but like 4 I actually consider friends that I'd rely on for something.

2. Why? Pretty sure you've seen one.

3. Did they ask me if it is*? If no, then I wouldn't say anything because I don't care and obviously they must like it so meh. If they ask, then just give them my opinion point blank.

4. Yes. Nah, but thanks for appeasing my curiosity.
thank you :) I think he is an istp tooISFJ?ESTP?I guess INTP stereotypicallyinfp?INFJYes I know an ISFJ . some descriptions made me guess ISFJ but ISFJ's wouldn't have plans learning about different countries and languages and travelling abroad to teach.infj is my last guess
this is fun I'm gonna give it a go. please don't cheat :)

English isn't my first language so apologies for any grammatical errors and if any of my sentences don't make sense please reply I'll try to make it more sensible.I'm an ISTP . I'm close to N somewhat in a sense I like gaining knowledge and talking about philosophy. I enjoy talking about philosophy sadly I don't have anyone to talk about it.I'm not as confident and as extraverted as an ENTP :)I upvoted you :) 

I agree with you. It's better if we get to the point and give truth instead of sugarcoating which can be misleading. Everyone has good side and bad side. Its better to say yes I have dark side than saying I'm this way because.... you don't understand me..... And may be Fi is selfiish but we say it as a function and not as people. We aren't just one function. We are given our type based on our behaviour not that we should be that way because our personality is stereotyped as such. Selfishness or being selfish isn't entirely a bad thing it's like a shield to protect ourself. what good is it if you're a selfless person being taken advantage of and end up broke and homeless.(It's not a good example but I'll try to think of a better one)


I like to think everyone has all the functions it's just that one function is slightly or may be very more than the other function like everyone has Fe and Fi someone has Fe more than Fi same for other functions meaning everyone is not entirely selfless or selfish just someone is more selfish than others. Same with other functions.


And I have questions does having Fe make ESFJ and ENFJ make selfless and having Fi make INFP and ISFP selfish? I like esfps because they're fun, intps are cool to observe (L from death note is intp) I'm an observer enneagram 5 and I'm observing an observer lol. I like entps too but if they're the type who talk non stop they're annoying. and I have a post why I like enfjs. I'm writing as types and not as people while I can type few people I'm not very good at typing people.

is this suppose to be funny it was for me lolif you're taking free online test:

I get results as istp mostly , intp and even istj sometimes that is when I think I'm not the kind of person who follows schedules so I must be p I like ideas that have practical applications so I put myself in s it's not a way to get an accurate result but it worked for me then I read functions of istp and watched lots of istp videos and read lots of contents on istp and I related to them even watching real and fictional istp personalities helped me. Then I was sure I'm an ISTP. I agree with the point you're more likely to get mistyped if you're under 20. just relying on online tests for mbti result won't give you accurate result I recommend taking online tests multiple times from different sites be sure to know exactly how you are in a given scenerio according to questions test can't give you the same result if your answers are different on each test then know about the 2 or 3 different results you got then see which fits you the best then you can read about functions. As you explore more you'll find your type and maybe still doubt sometimes I don't know if its just me I still think may be I have Fi on top my functional stack but I can't see myself as any other type than ISTP.

I don't think there is any ideal time to take an mbtiyou described meISTPs can be very augmentative also they're very stubborn * insert laughing emoji * my friends complain about the same thing you did. I'm sure ISTPs around you appreciate the things you do even though its very difficult for them to express it. INFPs can confuse usthank you INTPs are one of my favourite mbti types.I think it's cool we both have Ti and Fe but you can think what we cannot and we can sense what you cannotlol may be you're just highly intuitive. I'm trying as much as I can to understand Fe and Fi but I can't understand it at all while I had no diffculty understanding other functions. Having an inferior Fe when you're surrounded by feelers is difficult. I also get mistyped as INTP because I enjoy theories and philosophies. I'm not offended but INFP saying they're being realist is irony.

Wow cool ISTJ response My brother is an ISFP. He's not good in academics but he took interest in music he plays musical instruments well. He's good with gadgets and most of the fixing at home is done by him which is a shame to lazy istp me. I had no problem with school while he struggled I think he's artistic and sporty too. The way we see things are common yet different. We understand each other. He surprises me sometimes because he does things totally different from what I think he would do. We have similar interests and agree on most things. We can talk a lot together on a topic that I don't have anyone to talk with but we don't spend much time together to avoid getting on each others nerves.

I don't like it when he says I have to do things the proper way and he thinks there is only one proper way so I have to follow steps what he learned. ISFPs do you do this?

I think ISFPs are very artistic. They work very hard to polish their talent and art. It annoys me when they base their judgement on their Fi dom but ISFPs do amazing things and I love their work.My brother is lazy but he plays drums and guitar at midnight. He is more hard worker than me in what he's passionate about. I'm more laid back than him but I don't drop what I've started even if I don't like it while he has no problem doing it.No. ISTPs are awesome. Haters are jealous.Sorry I deleted my comment while trying to edit it. Yeah ISTPs can have different enneagram so not every ISTPs are same. 

Today I got into an argument with my friend who was loudly arguing to prove her point and saying I was being full of myself when I didn't even want to argue but I got quiet so argument wouldn't go any further. It was disgusting seeing her saying I was wrong to a friend beside her one-one when the friend who was listening her didn't even care. That is when we'd like to be thought of someone who is full of our self rather than play victim. I'm sorry its not related its just I think people don't understand ISTPs at all.No not really I was shocked when she suddenly started blaming me I wasn't even talking to her she was just next to me. Then when I talked back she started arguing then saying I was the one getting loud and arguing with her it didn't make sense I wasn't thinking that way at all. She was just being annoying getting irrational and saying she didn't want to talk to me but started talkng I was wrong right there to another friend. It was really mean its not her first time acting that way she just thinks she's right all the time and doesn't back down but most of the time she's very friendly. So I acted normal and like I didn't care to not make our friendship bitter. People aren't made of all the good qualities I think people should accept others flaws and remain true to their relationship. I hope she learns to respect others and know she can be wrong. I can't give that advice to my friend because she won't listen logical/math, musical, kinestheticAs an ISTP I understand what you mean
You're understanding an ISTP now.May be INTJ or INFPI think I intimidate loveYou seem like a Fi-dom with Ne . Online tests aren't inaccurate as much as everyone tells. If you're highly logical you may be an INTJ. Everyone has feelings INTJs can't be robots like internet stereotypes them to be. I found I give people an unapproachable vibe. Boys think I have walls around me they're not willing to break. When in fact I'm trying to be very open with people. I can't do small talks and have a habit of choosing people to talk and choosing what to talk I'm not good with talks I'm not ready for so I'm a bit of a loner. I have friends but I'm the least social person I know. I try to get out of my comfort zone and join people but then I like being in my Ti so people draw themselves away from me.

I think love and I can't meet with very less interaction between me and anyone.I realised I get infatuated easily now it's not difficult to ignore the feeling.Based on all your responses and my personal observations of people in MBTI community, my judgement tells me you're an INTJ .The first time I took a test from 16personalities.com (when MBTI was completely new to me) I got result as an ISTP and I made my friends and my brother take the test. I think they all got typed correctly.  I tried to type myself to check if I am not an ISTP. Online tests type me INTP or ISTJ sometimes. I'm confident I typed myself correctly but I wish someone could validate it.I say I'm boring but I wouldn't call any ISTP boring, may be because I understand my fellow ISTPs. Besides stereotypically ISTPs are cool.That's my point.I won best handwriting prize in school. It's not worst but very messy now after over a decade.I'm too lazy to bother explaining.I would get energised.You're empathetic. That's Fi. If you make rational decisions you must be heavily inclined to Fi(ie Fi-dom or Fi-aux) as F and T are rational functions what I know in socionics. Perceivers hate routines. You sound like an XNFP. If you have good socialising skills may be you're an ENFP.My friend is called a robot. I type her INTJ. ;)I say I'm boring because I know that is how anyone would see me. I'm not involved with things that are unboring to others and my lack of expressions of excitement definitely makes me seem boring. I've realised that I'm not boring and I don't have anyone to talk about my interests so others are boring to me actually. I wonder if other ISTPs are the same way. Crowd intimidates me but I can get involved in partying and gatherings as an extrovert but after that I need alone time so I'd be typed boring like most introverts I think.I'm an ISTp in socionics so my dual is ENFp but ENFPs are worst match for ISTP(me). 
ENFjs are ISTps conflicting match. I'm an ISTP but I'm not an ISTj. My ENFP(mbti) friend and me are not a good match as P doesn't flip for an extrovert she is supposed to be my dual(ENFp) theoretically but we don't get each other very well we are ISTP and ENFP. Now my dual is supposed to be someone who is ENFJ and ENFp. Is it possible for Ps and Js to be flipped for an extrovert?Introverts can only socialise in some situations where as it comes naturally to extroverts.  All the extroverts I know love socialising and they are good at it, Introverts may want to socialise but they're not good at it (my observation). Introverts don't socialise much whether they want to or not. Differentiating between an extrovert and introvert isn't difficult. Personally, I don't know any introvert with very good socialising skills. We're good at communicating with close friends and few people in a room, we can speak for a crowd but we can't socialise like an extrovert. I don't think being cold/intimidating/robotic makes anyone an introvert.You'd have to go to the wrong direction ;). You must be an NF, may be INFJ?Is your type the biggest assholes? jkI've seen people fitting their astrological descriptions so I believe in planetary positions somewhat.60% right brain. Failed people watching.  I thought ISTPs were great at people watching.m.youtube.com/watch?v=klMW7r_AUMcHow about clannad(after story)?Somewhere I can't get noticed.Sorry, I gotta go.Lol yeah same with my ESFJ mom. I was only thinking about students I've met in school/college.* Indecisive people.


* Unreliable people. People who can't keep their promise.


* Controlling people.


* People who ask my advice and don't take my advice. They act like they never needed my advice.


* Fake people. People who act nice and genuine but are not.ENFPShe clearly sounds like an Se dom. "Points out logical inconsistency"  that's Ti and also she regerets her actions which makes me think she is ESTP rather than ESFP. She may be ESTP or ESFP.I am the deep weirdo rugby guy who has complex labyrinths in head so doesn't really make much sense to others who also happens to be secretly overcaring bitch. I feed my Se when that happens.Ne comes up with many possibilities for one case, too many what ifs, can it be this?, can it be that? where as Ni may think of two or three ideas in a situation but it holds on to one idea that it thinks is best and digs in to it. Ni doesn't jump from one idea to another and ends up completely different from where it started. Ne comes up with many ideas but doesn't go deeper with anyone. Ni follows one possibility and digs it completely ignoring other possibilities so can miss out the true answer while they were chasing wrong one.Rhythm/melody.

I would listen to a song without lyrics.What is it that makes you really disappointed with someone you can't be nice to them anymore?How much time can you spend with no human contact?Si : seeing something reminds them of their past sensation what they sensed the last time they saw something similar.


Ni : seeing something reminds them of some ideas they came across in the past and what ideas can be developed.


Also compare inferior Ne vs inferior Se


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rRsedLZpI0You don't have to feel guilty. You don't want someone in your life who can cut you off so easily from their life.Do you know any ISTP personally? What do you think of them?INTJ“I see many possibilities.” 
INTPFollow functions not behaviours.what is steve jobs mbti? please give reasons.



people on the internet say entj or entp some sites say istpwhat do you think of an ISTP? do you like us? do you not like us? why?My experience  (not in any particular order)

ESFP,
ESTP,
ENTP

I talk a lot too but the above types randomly start blabbering and I feel like they will never shut up.
No offence. Remember it's not personal but personality. ;)

Edit: my ESFJ mom too XD
I think you missed the "not" at the endSo if someone pays almost no attention at all to the emotional atmosphere of the room, what does this say about their cognitive functions?So you're saying that if somebody you love does something you disagree with, you should disregard your own beliefs and side with them no matter what? This is absolutely not an Fi thing.I guess its true for you, but I'd say most people including other Fi users would not do thisEvery type has their strengths and weaknesses. There are things you can do well that other types have trouble with.- Most people enjoy talking about the type they think they are
- A very low % of people identify as ISFP. Probably because many think they're INFP or INFJI'm seeing lots of Se here and you have a Te/Fi axis. So my guess is ISFPI can tell you that if my country got into a war for a reason I don't agree with, I would try to dodge the draft for sure.ISTP

I have this need to look at everyone in sight, just in case theres somebody I know. If there aren't any people I look at my surroundings. 

Also, Flux_n_Uck the ESTP's comment describes me perfectly except for the music and smiling part.infpSeems like Se is high in your function stack. Se users tend to not enjoy speculation and the type of theorizing which you describe which sounds like Ne. When you go outside and walk, how easy is it for you to completely immerse yourself in your environment and turn off your thoughts? Essentially turning your focus to everything except your mind. So you think this is typical of NJ types?My Ti-Se was pretty obvious when I was younger (&lt;12?). I loved reading about animals, the human body, space, the earth, etc. I remember stumbling upon a book about atomic theory for kids when I was young though and I thought to myself (i didn't know what a scientific theory was) "It's a theory so are these even real? Theres no way im going to waste my time reading something that isn't even real lol". I was pretty quiet and reserved but I had tantrums at times. Could improvise lies that made sense logically and could act out the emotion involved too. Also I don't think I had any empathy and I was very self-centered. I don't think I really thought before acting or speaking, and this got me in a lot of trouble. I had little self awareness. I also cared a lot about being accepted by my peers and I would participate in the social games. I was also very into sports. I had a thing about self improvement too, like I would challenge myself to random goals like "doing 50 pushups", or being able to kick above my head. Then it all changed when I started seeing Ni at around age 12, started thinking about my actions, becoming socially anxious and more awkward, working harder in school, was a lot less spontaneous with my actions, and was more sympathetic and understanding with other people. I suspect other ISTP's have very similar childhoodsOf course its _possible_ for an _individual_ ISTP to be smarter than an INFJ. When people say intuitives are smarter than sensors, I'm assuming they're talking about on average. And even then I've never seen a study on MBTI and IQ.Yeah this describes exactly how I reacted to itmoron

edit: why does this have upvotestrucould be anything reallyWow, chemistry for ISTP is extremely spot onSystems design engineering. I chose it because I thought I'd have lots of career paths available, but I still have no clue what I'm going to specialize in unfortunatelywhat do you think of this?

https://reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4rubsm/the_tertiary_inferior_and_polr_functions_and_how/?ref=search_postsI got 20, despite having not the best spatial intelligence. I used a trial by error approach and I just chose what looked like the best answer. I'm not actually able to fully visualize these objects in my minds eye.

As for daydreams, I do imagine scenarios in my head to entertain me if reality isn't stimulating enough. This happens during boring lectures for example. I also do the Ti thing where I debate myself and tune out of reality, though I'm not sure if that qualifies as a daydream.I'd like to tell the ISFPs to please have more confidence in themselvesThis test about childhood type was accurate in my experience

https://www.personalitypage.com/html/pqk_indicate.htmlI don't see a Fascism option.IxFJAlmost your entire post describes your high Fi, but you haven't given many good reasons for why you could be a high Ti user. I'm pretty sure you're an INTP. To be sure though, can you give examples of what you mentioned here?

&gt; Also of note is that in recent months, and the past week in particular, I've acted very uncharacteristically in harmony with my emotions, something that actually scares me quite a bit, as my Fe and Ti seem to be working together now.Can you tell us about your thought processes?Yeah I'm going to stick with INTP. From what I can tell, you've undergone a lot of personal growth, which developed your Ne and Fe. Also, liking stability and the obsession with not being influenced by emotion indicates dominant Ti with Si. It also seems that Fe (the inferior function of INTPs) is a much bigger weakness for you than Si.brb getTing my kNiFehttps://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4spc12/population_by_cognitive_functions/&gt; It would be difficult to argue that a depressed, lazy INTP with anxiety and no Fe is healthy.

If anybody here is willing to argue this, I'll be glad to hear it!

Watch this Michael Pierce video, especially the part from 3:15 to 12:46. If you don't relate to what he says about introverted feeling, you're not an INFPSkeptic[Fiestar - You're pitiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JvwOp3yE4o)

I started listening to non-english music a few years ago because I started studying/working with music and songs with words I could understand were more distracting. So that's why I only judge songs solely on the audio and not the lyrics now.Shinsekai Yori - Very thought provoking and I recommend it to anyone who likes worldbuildingI speak with a chinese accent when I speak to my (chinese) family in english, but speak with a more "canadian?" accent with others. I've been unconsciously doing this my whole life and I don't know why. It's definitely not on purpose.I don't know this guy enough to type him, but maybe those of you who claim to know his type should explain why you typed him that way.Almost certain that you're INTPCurrent type: ISTP

Extrovert: ENTJ

Introvert: IxTJThanks for this perspective. Negative feedback is often much more thought-provoking than compliments. I've found most of what you've said to be relevant to me. Though personally, cheating on your SO just doesn't make sense.A being that knows everything does not need or have perceiving functions.

Edit: Stop hiding behind your screens and tell me why you're downvoting me, cowardswell....The only thing I didn't like about high school was having to take courses I didn't enjoy (mostly language courses)I'm curious to hear why you think Saki is an F type. Also, I'm confident enough to say that the Balloon Dog is an introvert.I meant the exploding dog. I made a bad jokeYou're describing sense impressions which corresponds to SiI don't think Se can be represented by an instrumentThat's a great example. I was thinking earlier that Se doesn't view information with any kind of filter so an instrument wouldn't be necessary. An instrument that lets you pick up as much information as possible is a different story thoughYou two haven't actually given any kind of argument explaining why he's an INTJ thoughHey! Get back to work you three slackers!,;,??;.!::are you an isfpfar rightI don't think sheep can have cognitive functions.Lying. I can partially believe my own lies, though this probably isn't related to typeI usually have some kind of rationalzation for the lies I tell. I'm still young (adult) so I'm partially under my parent's control at the moment. So for example, if they told me that I wouldn't be allowed to go somewhere I wish to go, I'd disobey and lie about it without remorse. I believe that I should have my own freedom as an adult and that I have the right to lie to keep that freedom. Other than that I don't tell much of any other lies except for white lies.Initiate conversationPersonally, resisting temptation isn't an issue for me. What's hard is doing something unpleasant which has to be done.I'm happy with the resultssameits just a squidI can relate.

https://gfycat.com/InsecureFewFlickertailsquirrel&gt; You could be an ISTP and love sitting on your ass and eating food, lol

Can confirm.

Im lazy but the action comes in other forms, like for example I love a good rollercoaster. Not just your normal average amusement park rollercoasters, but rides like [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/OoenTQCPvPXaM/giphy.gif) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnHMJK5Shps). The second one may not look way too threatening, but people black out on that ride on the hill after the first drop, its an amazing ride. Im also not too active when it comes to sports (which ISTPs are apparently supposed to be very good at), Im a bit out of shape stamina wise and also lazy so I dont like sports that require a lot of running, but people fear me when I play dodgeball. But most of the time I sit on my ass eating and on the computer.I agree, I would say 90% of what OP said describes me and most ISTPs.Every ISTP is different and this is just my personal situation and opinion. From the various typing websites I have read, my experience is similar to other ISTPs, but obviously it doesn't apply to everyone.

I am pretty emotionless on the outside, don't really show my emotions to anyone, not even my family most times, because I have trouble expressing them in the first place, but Im a teddy bear on the inside. My heart melts at the sight of a cute animal and I have developed crushes and attachments to people to where I think about them at night but never act on it due to my crippling 91% introversion. But no one knows about this except friends I have made over the internet and will never see because they live thousands of miles away (oddly I have no problem opening up on the internet but never in real life, probably because I also don't talk and only communicate to them by IM). That being said, the fact that he has opened up to you emotionally and comes to you with those kinds of things means he probably really likes, or maybe even loves you, but knows that you both have agreed to keep it as a friends with benefits kind of relationship. 

That part about everyone being so self centered and you only caring about yourself is probably just an ISTP thing, because I feel the same way sometimes. It could also be him trying to tell you that he might have feelings for you, and is projecting his anger that you both have agreed not to commit to a formal relationship.

The ignoring for weeks at a time part might also be an ISTP thing because we live in the moment and the present. If you are not directly in front of us or directly in our lives every day, we might just forget about you. Nothing personal, just out of sight out of mind.Top thrill dragster at Cedar point. Amazing amusement park, they have some of the best coasters in the country and the world. That, the millennium force, and the maverick are probably my favorites. Boring on the outside at first glance when we're at school or work trying to get things done, but ISTPs are stereotypically emotional on the inside but don't show it, adrenaline seekers and competitive. At least I am. People would never guess at first glance that I love riding rollercoasters that make people black out and that people fear me when I play dodgeball. I look and act like the average quiet guy who doesn't talk much and is boring, but there is much more to me and most ISTPs.Me - ISTP

Dad - ENTP 

Mom - ESFJ

Sister - ENTPWinter &gt; Fall &gt; Spring &gt; Summer

I like the cold.Some people love the summer, but I hate it when it's hot out. You can always wrap yourself in more blankets but it's harder and also more expensive to cool yourself down, plus the sweat. I also really love snow. 

Fall is nice cause it's cool for most of it, spring is mostly warm and hot, plus the tree sperm everywhere but the heat of summer is the worst for me. Went out to vegas, Palm Springs and LA this summer at the same time it was +100F while I was there. Those cities should not exist. They're a testament to mankinds arrogance. Palm Springs it reached 120F and it felt like when you open the oven door, except the over was everywhere. He sounds disturbingly exactly like me. 

I personally don't talk to strangers at all unless they talk first 99.98% of the time, but have no problem opening up to people once we're friends. I also don't even say hi first to most of my current friends, and I won't go out of my way to say hi if you don't notice me. I also am very happy being alone, so much so that every weekend for the past 10 weeks I have stayed indoors for 3 days straight the only other human interaction being texting with one or two other people, with my roommate and to get food. As for eye contact, I usually avoid eye contact with everyone cause it would be awkward for someone to turn and see me looking at them, but it sounds like he likes you if he looks away when you look at him. The fact that he approaches you and walks home with you sometimes is definately a big sign, and as for being shy and avoidant in group settings, I'm guessing he definately likes you and doesnt want to open up in front of other people and / or doesn't want other people to know. 

Now that I think about it, I did almost the exact same thing with the girl I really liked, only knew her my first semester of college but she moved back and switched to a college in her home town before things could start rolling, I'm still sad and think about her a year later:( FeelsBadMan. 

My major is really small so we had a 3 hour lab and another class together, same lab group and sat behind her in the other class. The first few weeks I did exactly what you described, avoided eye contact as much as possible, never said hi first, walked home alone, short conversations and didn't open up much. A few weeks later and now I started saying hi first sometimes, some eye contact, sometimes I walked with her when we left at the same time and were going the same place, medium conversations but didn't open up too much. It was at this point that I noticed she would stand pretty close to me during lab, close enough to where her arm would brush up against mine. We also found out that we have the same birthday and started talking more, I opened up like I shared my hatred for scary movies and I found out she has a dog. By the end of the semester I usually said hi first, eye contact when we were speaking (usually I look at people's nose when I talk to them for some reason), and it even got to the point where we were taking the final for a class and she got up and left, I was on the last few sentences so I finished those as fast as I possibly could, packed up my shit and caught up with her. Unfortunately that was the last day I saw her. I really had to poop and I didn't know she was leaving so she said something along the lines of "see you, never?" And I just said "ok cya" and walked away. 

Sorry for the long rant but typical ISTP me doesnt open up to friends or family so the Internet is a good place to get things off my chest, plus I figured it would reinforce the idea that I'm definately sure he likes you if he's anything close to what I'm like. Also, if you like him, make the first move cause I'm willing to bet he really doesn't want to. There were a few hints that tell me she liked me, like when it was raining and I didn't have an umbrella she asked if I wanted to share hers, when we were talking with our lab group working on a project and I mentioned how I have hundreds of dollars in food debit left (cause I'm a cheapskate and didn't buy a lot) she said (kind of jokingly I guess) something like "haha yeah you should buy me dinner". Of course me being me said I'm fine it's only a light drizzle I'll walk in the rain, and shrugged it off awkwardly. but me being me I never acted on it so I'm going to bet he won't either unless you say something first, or lead him into it. 

Edit: I knew I wrote a lot but wtf. I guess it's late and daylight savings means I'm not ready for sleep just yet. But can't stress this enough, I think he likes you. From what Ive heard they use different scales so the best course of action would be to read up on the actual functions themselves and how they work, and take multiple tests for the specific judger vs perceiver. I am 90% sure I am ISTP but sometimes I test INTP on 16personalities, and reading up on the general descriptions of INTP and distinction between S and P and I can definitely relate so I think I am more in the middle, but more S as multiple other tests and my intuition / experience tell me.

edit: I just realized how ironic it is that I couldn't decide whether to say intuition or experience cause thats one of the main differences between S and N and Im indecisive and sometimes rely on bothWould also have help if she hadn't done the unnatural head and facial movements like the one at the DNC and when she had to be chucked into a van like a side of beef at the 9/11 memorial bringing up the issue of her healthI think this is an ISTP thing cause Ive read a lot of different sources that bring it up and I have it too. For me its video games. My senior year of high school I played 1700 hours of a video game which averages out to about 8 hours a day.. with 8 hours of school a day. Now its a bit better, I play a few different games but my newest hobby is headphones which can get quite expensive so Im hoping I lose interest before I sink too much money in.Well intentioned sociopathCan confirm, would cuddle the shit out of my girlfriend if I had one.

I also have a very large collection of stuffed animals including my beloved 4 foot polar bear that no one except my family and a best friend knows about.I don't have one, its a waste of time and I don't like people.I like room temperature oatmeal when it gets all congealed &gt;i can't decide whether i'm an ISFP, INFP, ISTJ, ISTP, INFJ, or INTP ._.

Thank you. I will have to consciously try this, and more often.Thank you. You definitely get the process. I think I unconsciously do this pretty well, but it doesn't hurt to be more conscious of it. Between you &amp; /u/BorschtParty 's advice, I have an idea of what I need to do; plenty of exploration followed by plenty of reflection.It makes good sense. Thank you for your answer. I had a good session of meditation today, just to clear my head a bit- then followed that with 20 minutes of this sort of contemplation. For me, it's really a lot like exercising control of the chatter and trying to build something from it. I like to think I have a pretty firm footing in reality, yet exercising Ni seems to bring everything into a more comforting order based in this reality. It's pretty exciting.

We don't all ride (or care for) Motorcycles and we are not all mechanics.   
We are, or *can be* thrill seekers, but we are not *just* thrill seekers, and *not always* thrill seekers; we are thinking types first and sensing types second.

We are capable of thinking abstractly. This includes philosophy. See: musashi, Diogenes, dalai lama, bruce lee.    
If we do, you may never find out about it.   
We do not care about systems in the same way as INTPs.   
We react to abuse and criticism.       
We would rather have harmony than tension.  
We avoid fights (and arguments) if they're not worth fighting for.   
We become total trolls if you have nothing to offer us. See: Karl Pilkington.     
Most conversation has nothing to offer us. We want practical meat and tactical potatoes.   
We generally appreciate people being open and honest with us, even if it's with their feelings.   
We can and will create art. See: Zappa, Kubrick.      
We have an "inner world" in a sense, and most people have no idea. It's rare that people "gain entry" but if youre that *rare person*, everything that we offer is all yours, too.   
We have a softer side for those who gain entry.   
If we want to be, we can be the most spontaneous person in the room. See: Tom Cruise.  
We are only cool-headed when we want to be. See: Tom Cruise.  
We know we can be unfriendly. Some of us *are* friendly. Some of us aren't, but *want to be*.  
We know what you're doing.    
In many areas, we have no idea what we're doing.    
  

  
The misconceptions are so rampant that i have been called "not an istp" regarding every single one of these characteristics, and it's getting old.
  
Tl;dr: With the way some people talk about ISTP, you wouldn't realise that Ti, Se, Ni, and Fe are all a part of who we are.    
 
Edit: Let me know if I missed anything.I like that. "there's nothing to it" is a recurring theme in istp art. Bruce Lee's script "The silent flute" got made into the shoddy "the iron circle" when he died. The ideas are there though. Basically, its about a spiritual seeker looking for "the book of answers" or something like that. When he gets it at the end, it's a book full of mirrors. (The answers are "within", get it?) And the guy refuses to become the guardian of it, and instead moves on with his life.   
   
I love our anti-Ni NiYeah totally. The natural stuff is where it's really at. The anti-Ni stuff comes in because there's basically nothing to offer.    
   
Sarcastic stuff is pretty great, too. God I love me some Frank Zappa, or Dead Milkmen.   

The conspiracy stuff drives me crazy. When I worked in retail, every product had a back story as a "means of control"; it wasn't the most contented period of my life.Yeah, haha. Maybe noone should hold their middle finger up so high.ISTPISTPUnassuming.   
Classically handsome.   
Thoughtful.I like art and philosophy. That being said, the stereotype is nonsense.The first list has more types that i like, and the second has more types that i dislike.O shit. How would we know it's you?Interesting. I would put isfj and isfp up there too as extroverted introverts. Those types usually actually think they are extroverts, from my experienceI had a post here recently asking something similar that might give you [bonus insights](https://m.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/51b214/developing_tertiary_ni/).     
  
Moving on- The comments in here about watching and reading weird things is pretty spot on. Some recommendations on stuff that woke me up a bit, all being pretty "down to earth" and brief "between-the-line-readers":     
  
Movies: Bob Rafelson's Head, Jan Svankmajer's Faust, and collected shorts, David Lynch's Eraserhead, Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog, Kurosawa's Sanjuro, Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker., Ron Frick's Samsara, and the music film, Heima. When you finish all that, give Tom Verlaine's Music For Experimental Films a go, and just let the images play out. Lastly, Pervert's Guide to Cinema, with Zizek, is as entertaining as it is mind bending.   
  
Books: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Epictetus' Discourses, Lao Tzu 's Tao the Ching, Buddha's Dhammapada, Musashi's Book of Five Rings, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, Fernando Pessoa's The Book of Disquiet, Ernest Becker's The Denial of Death, Hayakawa's Language in Thought and Action, and Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd. Right now, im reading the basic writings of Martin Heidegger.   
  
Look at art. Stare at it. I enjoy Ernst Haeckel, Hiroshige, Edmund Dulac, Jan Svankmajer. Try to see what their pictures are saying. Stare at their stuff sensually til something insightful comes out of it.   
  
Music: Fujiya &amp; Miyagi, Aesop Rock, Dr Dog, The Beatles. They all have cryptic lyrics for your deciphering.   
  
YouTube: The School of life, Every Frame a Painting. Channel Criswell, Rob Ager, Nerdwriter. Stuff like that, which do case studies, mostly on film, will blow up some extra ideas of abstraction for you.   

These are all just, like, my opinions, man. But as a fellow istp, I figured it all might wake you a little too. I used to be called "joshy" and after a year of isolation with this stuff people were calling me "membrane". Major shift. Feel free to Pm me if you have anythin to say. Good luck.EarthA juicy bootyWe all die despite everything, and yet, we die.No. Stay off of my ISTP lawnHit meSurewhynotDon't worry the istp stereotype is only a stereotypeENFP: simplifywhats the diff tho?Ni is just a click of "wait, what does this imply?"   
I normally go about my business adaptively, and when something new comes along, however small- as things do in the world, be it someones feeling or a change in the situation, I step back and figure out the implications, and from there my Ti-Se-Ni figure out a solution to get things back on the level.  
  
I love thinking up abstract ideas. I real alot of philosophy that is not too longwinded, dry, or far off the ground. It helps me consider new perspectives to use throughout my day. Ni isn't my main function, but it is surprisingly (to some) a large part of my persona, and a major interest to me. We like help from outside (art, literature, etc) to help us with developing our intuitive ideas, but a bit of sensory deprivation and a lot of focus (doing so post meditation helps) really helps us come out with unique and often-times original ideas (seemingly) out of thin air.  
  
Let me just say, little surprises me since I started working on myself in this way. If something really out of the ordinary happens, it does take some processing, but my strategy is to pace my life slowly enough let Ti-Ni come up with a solution. When I do, I level the playing field, if I don't completely decimate my opponent.http://i.imgur.com/xhuHswXh.jpgDe Botton falls into the category of people who think being contrarian = being philosophical. Look at the other videos. He wants to, at the very least, destroy monogamous relationships.Sure. What good comes out of existentialism?ISTP here. Trying to figure out Ni, and whether or not I can master it for the sake of creating surrealist art. I found these great quotes [here](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/94443170887/how-ni-acts-in-all-4-positions) about Tertiary Ni:  
"Don’t tell anyone, but I like symbolism, archetypes, and mysteries."  
"I can visualize a goal, and won’t stop until I turn it into a reality."  
"(I) trust my insights more in my creativity than in life."    

Also, a helpful INTP here told me "Ni, in the tertiary position, is called your eternal child. It takes in information in either a childlike or childish way that isn't very reliable, but is very appealing to a person."    
 
Well it definitely is very appealing to me, my Tertiary Ni. I'm addicted. Actually, I once mistyped myself as INFJ, because at the time, in escaping my WTF years, I was reading all sorts of abstract books, and fancying myself an originator.  

The helpful INTP also said: "Since you aren't very proficient in this area, you prefer for others to help you out in this area."   

Now if I still have to read 100 books to find something worth saying, I will. I was wondering, however, if:    

A. Anybody knew of any particular activities, or methods of thinking that might bring my Ni to it's full potential  
 
B. There are any particular artworks/books either inspirational or informative that might blow my mind open, like an Ni-injection.     
 
Thank you kindly!
A strangely large amount of my close friends/girls I attract are xNFP (mostly INFPs but two ENFPs).  I just seem to get along with the chill artsy types for some reason.  Which sucks for my dating life because it's often a one-sided romantic match since I don't really have emotions :/ oh well.Well I actually use it in the workplace a lot...it helps me figure out how to manage interaction and team dynamics.  

But I do agree that these mass workplace typing things are gonna lead to people stereotyping based on type and not understanding functions and stuff.Either way you're still treating MBTI types as a homogeneous group.  They aren't.  People are infinitely more complex than their MBTI type.Don't sweat the stereotype, friend.  You're uniquely you and shouldn't sweat those ISTP generalizations.  

That said, people with ISTP traits tend to be: analytical, blunt, and none too sensitive to others' feelings.  Just from that description, you can see how more sensitive people might interpret that as asshole-ishness.  I don't actually know any stereotypically asshole ISTPs irl, though...the few I do know are all fairly quiet and unassuming unless they're around someone they know.I do the exact same thing.  However, not everyone is capable of taking constructive criticism well.* Hank Moody from Californication (or at least I aspire to be)
* Sandor Clegane from ASOIAF
* Arya Stark from ASOIAFThey're more fleshed out for sure.  Arya is a POV character so we read her thoughts, and Sandor shows up pretty frequently in different characters' POV chapters.Just Pam x Brienne sounds awesome af.  I'm imagining some unkillable badass woman who is solemn, dutiful, and super addicted to coke. I have [this PDF](http://faculty.mtsac.edu/khigh/assignments/assignment_documents/jung_functions.pdf) saved for when I need a reference for function stuff.  Enjoy!Damn skippy.Rotom-W.  My friendly little washing machine buddy.  We have won many a famous OU victory together.Haha you damn empaths!;)I use the term "empath" in a non-scientific way; I had an INFJ gf who could just sense people's emotions/the emotions of a room and the joke between us is that she was a psychic empath.Awesome! Thanks!I procrastinate with basically everything.  I've learned to manage it - especially in my professional life as a software developer - but it seeps in to a lot of other facets of my life.  I have to put in more work than I should have to just to not look like a lazy asshole.As interesting as this is, I don't think ignoring introverted functions with regard to persuasive reasoning is going to give you any more than the broadest of broad strokes.  ISTP and ISFP both have Se as their highest introverted function, but have Ti and Fi as their respective dominant functions.  Both types explore using Se, but how they're filtering that sensory data is completely different and that's definitely going to affect how they respond to persuasion.
ISTP - Modern Languages (German, Dutch and Russian)If my university let me then honestly I probably would...I don't ride motorbikes (or even have any interest in them) and I don't smoke cigs, sorry to disappoint.
Someone with a heartbeat I'm okay with that as long the body is hotI'm the same, but I'm 8w7. People don't believe I'm introverted when I drink with friends because of how much a talk when I have interest in something. To die. No matter what you do you'll die. "and if you don't tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to know?" The Road Eternal. Hunter is good too, but it's not what I want. With Road Eternal I can experience new things constantly, I'll always have enough action to entertain me, not forgetting to mention being able to travel to parallel Earth's. We do it better while doing less. "I'll be okay no matter what." 

“Better to live passionately for a day, than to live a century while stifled.”

"Even the supposedly bad things can be good if you look at them from a different angle."

"Never regret anything because at one time it was exactly what you wanted.""look, you give me the loot or I'm going to wait until you need my heals and I'll smite you instead" Procrastinate to procrastinate"Whatever happens, happens." 

We do think about the future, but it doesn't stop we from doing what do what we want to do. We may as well get caught in an accident tomorrow and die. 
One thing I learned early is to learn from my mistakes, from the mistakes of others and to know my limits, because shit happens when you don't. 

&gt;I honestly do wish I could just be in the moment sometimes because I'm always in the future and sometimes I'm in the past. It can get annoying that when I'm doing something super fun my first thoughts are "I need to video this so I can relive the moment that I'm not even really living right now in sixty years!!!".

I don't understand that emotionally. If I'm doing something I want to enjoy it, not share my attention between recording and doing it. The only thing that I'll feel when watching it is the will to do it again. 
I bought it from the ESTP It's a normal day like any other. Since my friends/family celebrate it and I probably won't be doing anything, why not celebrate it together? 
Things would be better if people didn't need a day to be together and instead invite friends/family to have fun whenever they feel like. Let's see... Most of the time I try to make  the feeling something logical so I can think about it, but when I use it without logic, it just comes naturally to me. In the last few years I started to open more to my feelings and emotions. Being a fucking Exterminator prototype isn't fun. 
It still is a little hard to do something when I see someone I care feeling bad without trying to fix the problem and giving solutions instead of just hugging the person and giving emotional support, but it's something i know the person will appreciate and I'm not going to lose a limb because of it, so I do it. ISTP's frown The infj's I know look like they're dead inside Fucking soul eaters Yup. I rarely look happy, but when I do, I'll smile like an idiot haha Something to do with him. It can be anything, but something that both of you can enjoy would be really good. Since he had a shit time in the last few years, something intense that can make him feel alive would be good. Sleep is for the dead
Was in the Ti-Ni loop a few years ago. Kicked the bucket and started doing things, like going out and trying new things.  Probably to most istps who experienced it the Se just comes naturally or they want some change in their lives. Yes. What voice? They're more like pictures and movies, thoughts without any voice in them And beer! This or something with cool mechanics, and it's even better if I can play with something that makes my opponents mad. 

I love Mei &lt;3You're the first to die. Support, leona mid and everything else except adc. 

IstpThis. 

What's the point of living if I don't like myself? lolFriendzone doesn't exist. What I mean is that if you think you're being friendzoned you're a loser. That shit isn't real. 

ISTPYeah, it's so easy to blame someone else instead of accepting that you're a loser and try to change that. It exists. It'll die. It's only tool to allow me to do things. 

I look in the mirror and the only thing I can think is: "I'm not fat nor there's any apparent signal I'm dying, nice" 

I'm healthy, so if I don't have enough strength to do something it's my fault, but not because my body isn't working as it should be, but because I didn't put enough effort in getting stronger when I could. IstpI don't any use for them. I don't see the point of sharing my life with others like that. If someone is interested they will talk to me and ask about it. Force your way through everything. That's the istp way haha. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I had a rbf yesterday when talking with a friend about the deaths in our families. Afaik no internal world. When I'm drunk or heavily think about something it's a dark space where images of what thinking appear and disappear when I stop focusing on them. Well most of time I don't have one. As I'm writing this I don't see anything. The words come naturally. ENFJs are okay. Sometimes a little overbearing when I don't show any feelings about something. 

Most of the time they're fun to be around because I love seeing how they show their emotions and make the people around them do the same. Well if that's happening outside work I make them explain or hear me whether they want or not.  If I'm already affect by it and it's making my life shitty, I become really obnoxious until they revert their choices. It's only malicious if you want it to be. *now I'm going to laugh at you too*60+ and  a few other sessions with 100+ tabs 

ISTPSometimes I start researching something and that's what happens. Nothing wrong with you mate, let the haters come. 

You also could get rid of them, but that's not legal, so.. I don't know if you tried but alcohol helps a lot Alcohol. ISTPNah, there's no need for that. The only requisite is to like alcohol and to be happy while drinking. 

Just don't forget that alcohol is humanity's friend. Silence is okay. Makes my stare more focused Sonic: FASTSimple. Be aggressive. Why submit to someone? Why do you need her approval? If you know you did your best and she isn't satisfied, it's her problem, not yoursTake a pic. Tell them they have a few days to tell her what they did or you'll do. Since you have a pic, they can't deny it. ISTP. Because betrayal is something inexcusable. It's a betrayal of loyalty. 

Well, tell them the same thing. Since we would have a friendship that long they know I don't have any reason to lie. * Entp evil 

The fuck I'm okay with evil, but my type is istpHow dare you say we aren't stone cold killers? Watch me kill this beer. THEN WE DRINK TO CELEBRATE THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERVENTION 
Oh well. I always try to talk to people calmly first, but when that doesn't work I make them submit one way or another. 

I'm istp, so there's that too. Istp 7w8 sx/sp 793War. War never changes. Mercenaries. We offer our services to those who pay more. Damn don't even start. When people suddenly ask me something sometimes I freeze for a second or two when speaking because I'm trying to find the right word or example and it's like I'm searching a database. 

The droning voice is my normal voice when talking with strangers or when very serious. 

Sarcasm is life. Istp here. I usually take pranks to extremes, but isn't that what make them fun and amusing?Brb going out to buy cigs and milkOf course I doTo not give a fuck and drink. Not having enough beer/r/PrimitiveTechnology 
do i need to say more?This, except i wasn't obedient. Also used to beat the other children when they wanted to play with my toys and didn't understand no.You can't help everyone. Thinking otherwise is just being delusional. give us alcohol and then Fe will work (not guaranteed)ISTP: Alcohol, sex, games, going out without a goal, dismantling things for fun and setting things on fire.
git gud you piece of shit

that's me when someone acuses  me of cheatingtell them to stop sucking so muchExactly. And since i don't wear my glasses most of the time it doesn't  matter where i look, i can't see anything.Eh i like making eye-contact. Most people get uncomfortable after some time haha.Talk? Just give me a beer and we can quietly enjoy our drinks at the same place.i'm istp. ESTP when drunk.enjoy it the most you can. Fuck memories, they're uselessYour scores:

Affiliative humor: 50.0

Self enhancing humor: 46.0

Aggressive humor: 33.0

Self-defeating humor: 17.0
Or when they're stressing themselves about something so simple yet they make it look like the world is going to end.ISTP

I drink too much, smoke too much and don't give enough fucks to important things.It depends.My room is mess to everybody else but me. But i know where my things are and i can easily reach them when i need. 

What's the point of organizing things if i'm going to undo it all when i want to grab something and they're in the way?8 and 3-4 

I still don't know what i'm really feeling sometimesISTP.

My favorite games always change, so right now they're:

Dark Souls

RimWorld

Mark of The Ninja

SMW (because of the romhacks)

EU4

CK2

XCOM EW

Darkest Dungeon

CS:GO

ToME

Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun

Dota 1

To The Moon

Chrono Trigger

Phoenix Wright gamesISTP. 

Either i look like dead inside, angry or really sad. The thing is that i'm just thinking most of the time.What are the best spots on the map? How does my enemies play? What weapons they're using? How my team is playing? Is the communication in my team good? 

Take all that information, analyze it, throw some intuition on it and let the Se do the job with the random insights of Ni here and there. We just don't care or don't have an opinion about most things. 

We just see things as they are and treat people based on how they treat us.Me ISTP, father ISTJ, mother dead, probably was an INFJ.




INFP ex. I'm ISTP. I don't think i need to say anything else.Schedules suck. It's better to just force myself to start even if i don't want at the moment or because i'm just being lazy.Too much feelings and not much logic.Sure. Let's use organs. Or people.Hell no. Feelings are good, but not when you're their victim. If she can't handle things without getting overwhelmed by feelings, she isn't the right one.ISTP here . I like to sort things out too, but only by the necessary amount. For example, I've been playing a shit load of Rimworld recently and most of my bases are a big mess inside a mountain, but it works. 

Better to have something working, even if it's ugly, than something  beautiful that doesn't do shit.

And i dislike crowds because of what op said. Too much people, things happening and sounds at the same place.6-7 i guess. Most of them are healthy and know they shouldn't bother me with stupid shit and drama unless we really aren't doing anything and we still are drinking.Try to learn to breathe deeply, really to taste food when you eat, and when you sleep, really sleep.

Try as much as possible to be wholly alive with all your might, and when you laugh, laugh like hell. And when you get angry, get good and angry.

Try to be alive. You will be dead soon enough.

Ernest Hemingway

I always say that you'll have time to sleep when you die. Fuck sleeping, waste of time.XNFPs are weird as fuck, so that's not uncommonToo much sensibility sucks tho. Or when they get into fights or arguments just because it goes against their ideals, even if it's something that does no harm to anyone.ISTP? Political? Hell no. Most of us don't care about that shit. We want freedom, comfort and a dramaless life.Exactly this. I'm very curious, so if the person starts talking about something they did, do or want to, i ask about it. I ask why they did or want to do it, what are their future plans, etc. Just be yourself but don't come talking to me about the fucking flower you saw 5 years ago on the sidewalk and what it means to life.I eat what i want when i want. I don't care about calories and all that shit nor do i care about how something might make me get some disease. I do exercises a lot too.

What's the point of living if you don't do what you want when you can do it?Subhuman. Don't make him feel good.Maybe. I'm type 7w8 who does not care about most things, so i might come as rude to some people.So that's a maybe for me? hahaSo where do we prefer to live? Jungle?Hey! We're more civilized than that. We live in huts, not bear made caves.I have aux Se. Even RoboCop dance better than me. 

The only time I danced I don't remember because I was blackout drunk.ISTP here and i love to party. I love meeting new people and doing silly stuff sometimes, but when I'm drained I'll just stay at some corner drinking and observing everyone.Especially when we set the infp on fire.We only make good soldiers if we have a lot of autonomy and have an explanation about why we need to do something. Most of us hate hierarchy, so the best role for us is as a mercenary. What the fuck?!It's so random that even if I set myself on fire I wouldn't find any meaning in it.https://i.imgur.com/embE8ew.png

Here bby.What?Yeah. And actually being able to really understand what i feel at the moment most of the time would be nice.And that's why i kind of dissociate from my negative feelings. I got no time nor do i want to feel that shit.Sorry if I i wasn't clear about it. Most of the time I don't know how to react to something until a few seconds/minutes/hours later too.It's not that we're going to kill ourselves, we just want that adrenalin or things are just boring the way they are.Most of them are really fun to be around, and they charm is almost irresistible to me. Except when they want to be the fun police because "harmony".I'm the guy who just shouts "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ALL TALKING ABOUT?!?!". 

I listen to everybody and try to reach the most logical conclusion based on what they all said. if someone doesn't like it and they're the minority, fuck them. I try do to my best but i can't appease everybody.Coward: INFP

Loser: ISFP, INFP, INTP

Loner: ISTP, INTP, INFPMe.More money.To have fun. I don't want to leave a legacy or any of that shit, I only want to enjoy life and die.Short reasonable goals. And if a problem appears I deal with it whenever possible. 

I try to do what I want whenever possible, but if I can't I'll just deal with that and do something else. 

I always try to see something positive even in the shittiest of the situations because not doing something or feeling sad/worried or anything else that doesn't solve the situation isn't going to solve it.

Typed me as an ESTP lol. Fe is way too low to be one thoDead inside.What emotions?That's why fire exist. You don't need fi to be selfish. ISTPs are a prime example of people who are selfish while having Fe on the stack. 

A few days ago I flat refused to give some of my bread to the kid of a friend and everyone almost jumped on me because of that, but I stood my line. I do what is best for me.Currently single, but I didn't send a message unless it was to inform her about something important, like a change of plans or something like that. I hate texting and phone calls. I'd rather talk irl whenever possible. 

Besides all that I still used to send a message some times because i knew it would make her happy.A long time ago we gave fucks about a lot of things. The problem is that we gave it so much we ran out of fucks.

Now being serious, I for example do care about how others feel about things, especially about socializing and shit, but I'm not going to give up on my happiness so someone can be happy for 5-10 minutes.

And I hate kids. I won't mistreat them, but don't expect me to be very nice to them. ISTP. 

RTS, Grand Strategy, RPG, Platform, Action RPG, simulation games like Rimworld, Prison Architect, etc.

Let's see, the best games of all times to me would be:

Super Mario World and all the rom hacks

Dark Souls

Rimworld

Donkey Kong Country trilogy

Crusader Kings 2 / EU IV

To The Moon

Darkest Dungeon

Chrono Trigger

Total War: Shogun 2

DCSS

Urban Terror / CS:GO

Online games are fun sometimes, but most of the time I hate the grinding, so I tend to stay away from MMOs and all these games with an almost infinite grinding system that's boring af.

Let's blow up stuff and set things on fire instead of getting political. Fuck that shit.This. Do you want to know how to fix your problems or how to sugarcoat things and/or  to please everyone? We don't make good soldiers unless we have autonomy. We hate authority. Try to explain his artistic side.

I can't create anything related to art, but I kind of can improve something if I have an idea.

I also was a little devil when I was kid even though I was very quiet sometimes, just doing my own things. Nah. It depends on what are your goals. Destroy the world? Dominate it and slave the other races? Make everyone a slave for you own pleasure? Each one of these objectives will have a type that probably will do it better than others.

Destroy the world? Anything with mentality and an evil enough STP will do the job.

If you want to dominate the other races or to make everyone your slave, you kind of want someone with enough charisma to pull some people to support him while making others fear what he's capable of. "I'm alive"

"depressed" http://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/7gk0yaWell, I always try to deal with things in a civil way. Always did. When that doesn't work, I use violence if it's something I can't go away or shouldn't. Be that violence psychological or physical.

Violence always works. If it didn't it's because you didn't use enough.

Might makes right. That moment when I identify with most of your answers and I'm istp haha"JUST FUCKING DO WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. IF YOU  DON'T WANT TO DO IT, I'LL FIND  SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO IT" Nope. For example, if you say red I'll think about red, but there's no image or word, I just what the color red is and i may associate it with some things, like an apple or blood. Helps a lot when I want to read. I love to play as Mei and Pharah. More Mei than nothing because I love her skill set and how much of a cancer I can be with her. Freezing someone while singing let it go and spamming emotes/hi is fun af. Bronn from Game of Thrones. One of the most istp character I ever saw. Yeah... INFPs annoy me sometimes with their views of the world, their randomness or being too emotional. They're fun when they aren't like that tho.Idk when they aren't talking i guess? Or talking but without all the gibberish haha.Because of things like this that I like ESTPs Tall with about something we really like and we'll probably speak like there's no tomorrow probably an xnfp. Burn xnfps.Understanding doesn't mean agreeing. Most of us understand others opinions, doesn't mean we'll validate it if it goes against our opinion or if it is plain stupid. Outside when the temperature is 12°C or lowerlower. Charismatic enough to annoy peopleJust start talking about something like philosophy and leave the intp in the rabbit hole. Maybe? Now that I think about it's more of skill than charisma. I was drunk before, my bad. We istps get into the Ti-Ni loop when unhealthy. Thinking about stuff without really doing anything. intps don't have that problem though. There's also the problem about the low Fe and being really... Rude ? Insensitive? Can't find the right word to define it, but saying an unhealthy TP is an asshole because of low Fe isn't totally wrong.

Can't say much of xntps because I ain't one and sooner or latter one will comment here or someone who understands a lot about them. Start setting things on fire with body spray or anything flammable. Kill fire with fire. THEM START A FIRE AND THROW GASOLINE TO SHOW SUPREMACY SCREAM LOUDER THAN THE FIRE WITH THE MIGHT OF A THOUSAND SUNSSeniority doesn't mean shit. You just didn't die yet.

Just because you're her leader or something else doesn't mean you can order her whenever you want.

It isn't that hard to be polite, is it? ISTP

You fucking asked for it though. 21 and still setting things on fire because it's fun and fire is beautiful Same, but most of the time I end up skipping the validating their feelings because they're irrelevant when facts are what they are and they aren't going to change no matter what they feel. In my perspective they should deal with the problem instead of creating drama around  it. "if I can't use a real weapon I'll hit people with a lamp post" Till now everyone said feelers would do the most damage. Then you have us, the most idgaf type yet we'll listen to you and understand what you said.

See, most istps don't judge people. We don't care. Because of that people end up opening to us when you're a healthy istp yet we rarely open to someone. That gives us the ammunition to literally destroy someone. We won't say anything subjective, only objective based on what we see and heard.

You're insecure? Depressed? There's someone very close to you who's dying? Attack there. What matter is the win, not the method used to it. Ethics, moral and all these things go to hell and we plainly attack someone without filters aiming to hurt where it hurts the most. Action speaks louder than words. I'm not even a feeler and that would've bothered me. Life is meaningless anyway so I'm not going to spend it in a way I don't like. Fuck that. "if you don't want to wash the dishes, I'm going to throw them away and you'll have to eat like a dog."ISTP: Stoicism. That depends if there's something for us to gain or not. And being lazy makes me try to find the most efficient method to do things so I don't waste more energy than necessary. Let everyone die and save the animals instead. Don't lie. You made a tnt cannon and started shooting at your friends base. If you have enough resources you can automate them while you climb to the sky layer, make a floor of glass and make lava rain on their bases. They'll have to do deal with both things at the same time. You could make it worse and have water falling somewhere near the lava to make everything obsidian. I wouldn't say strategy, but instead tactics. Think about something simple and flexible that can be adapted to anything else at any moment. I hate to feel stuck in a role.

I mainly play as support, but I can fit in any other role if necessary. Support is good to me because usually I can analyze the situation and give input to the rest of the team depending of the situation. Started to think more about the future instead of just doing whatever seemed fun for short-term happiness. The infj gas everyone that disagree with him. Ti: Rimworld to anyone who likes systems, human hats and watching the storyteller fuck you over in ways you thought to be impossible. I usually have an strategy that has been talked with the team before. Then I adapt it as the game goes. If I notice that the enemy team or just a certain someone has a pattern, I'll do something that can take advantage of that.

 Sometimes I also like to just do something that's crazy enough to work, like smoking or bombing at times where it isn't thought to be viable for myself. "I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name. Best friend I ever had. We still never talk sometimes." Being paralyzed I guess. 
Both!What the hell is a dragon fruit? That's a pretty cool looking fruit.  Always ISTP. Great!  Even less reason to engage in smalltalk :) hmm. Lot more introverts than extroverts. Not really surprising tho.Thats also a barn parrot.Then, why are you constantly wasting 15 minutes? Me too thanks. Beeing on time is not late, it's beeing on time. If you are constantly early because it allows you to finish early, you are in practice disagreeing with the time table. That time table might suit you, but it might not suit everybody, and the chosen time table was probably set for a reason.  
I know, 15 minutes isn't much, but that is not the point. I don't care if you are 15 minutes early, do what you want. But don't expect the same from everyone else, and don't expect to leave early (even tho thats probably happening in most cases) That was a poor answer. I'm not telling you how to live your life. I'm telling you that to some people your actions can be precieved as rude. I'm not attacking you, I'm giving you an alternative view. Maybe be a bit more humble, instead of not even thinking and going straight into defense mode.  Ok. Strawman, you are missing the point. But to answer your question, it's actually possible to arrive on time, be ready and go straight to work. And it's perfectly fine to expect people to be ready at the set time. 
The rude bit comes into play when you try to shift the entire timetable forward.  
Edit: if that's what you want, come early and leave early, just say so. Make that arrangement. Don't set guidelines that fit you and expect everyone else to adjust to it. This is where the rude part comes in, you don't take other people into consideration. Im not assuming, you are precisely showing me what you expect. And nailing my point.  
See the edit I wrote while you wrote your reply. Aww come on! You are doing what you accuse me of. "concrete"? Read this conversation again. I've said" if". 
I've tried to show you another point of view, but you appear unwilling to consider how it is for other people... Hence, rude. No it doesnt. There is nowhere ive said "...just move things around all the time for giggles"  
But yeah, we can end things here. You are unwilling to even try and see it from another angle, and rather stick with your strawman arguing.   
So... have a nice day. Nice talking to you. missing my point again... ;)What? Im not shure how much your mother really liked you...Ideal: ISTP  
Real: ISTP Lol, this shit is as accurate as horoscopes.Brown and blue. It hurts when IPYeah, well. Maybe i want a second opinion.I just fuck them if they let me. How I get there I have no idea.Got any examples?
I like ESTP. They make me laugh a lot. I'm ISTP. That doesn't happen that often.Why, exactly?Haha yep they're awesome... I guess&gt;Express emotions only when laughing to shitty and rude jokes.

Can relate.I'm really laughing now. Thanks. Gonna be a lurker there too.To keep myself fairly entertained. To learn more interesting things. To do what I want the way I want...

In a nutshell, to have fun and be left alone.Both and none. This isn't strictly related to the type. Also, both leads with a Pi function followed by Te, so not even this already flawed point of view (T functions = logic) can be taken into account here.Yep, they taste good.We're awfully awesome, yeah

^(^By ^the ^way, ^forget ^the ^badass ^adventurer ^stereotype. ^We're ^lazy ^most ^of ^the ^time)Maybe, I don't know. I actually hope so, this way I'd be able to say that I'm super active when someone complains of my laziness.^ This...I really thought I was on /r/shittyMBTI. Lmao.Cognitive functions don't change like that. You probably just didn't find your own yet. Also, don't trust these tests too much. They're good for you to have an idea of where to start searching for your type, but not much more than that.I don't think you can type someone only for "being ironic".

But, being totally anedoctal here, I'm ISTP and I'm usually ironic af. Yes, to the point that people usually don't know whether I'm serious or not. However you shouldn't rely on this to search for this person's type.Yes! Or think that I'm funny when I'm actually being an asshole.I don't because the ISTP sub is cool.LolWell, yes, maybe. I think it's active enough tho. Comparing to the other S subs, at least.That's true, but I think it can't be helped... I mean, there will always be those posts. That's like our curse.I don't believe in any religion, but people believe whatever they want. As long as they don't bother me with it, it's alright.ISTP. I feel... cool about it.  
I don't know other ISTP irl (or at least not that I know) so I can't really answer that.  
I don't really have a favorite type.  
If it was for only one day, I'd like to try every type only to know how it is like. Otherwise, I rather keep being an ISTP.I'll probably stay in my home. Maybe I can go out and hang out with someone, it's not very likely but I don't know yet.Eh, being totally honest here, I don't think these questions are quite good. They seem to be even worst than most of the online tests. I'm not trying to put you down or anything, really, sorry if it sounds like that. It's just that they are really vague and most of them doesn't even really relates to a cognitive function and seems to be based off mostly on stereotypes.

That said, I removed my flair to give you a try, so... Let's go:

1. It depends heavily on the subject. People usually says I'm very imaginative, but to be honest I quite don't agree.

2. Not really.

3. Not at all. Well, sometimes.

4. Completely messy.

5. It depends on who they are and the situation.

6. Also depends on who I'm talking to, the subject or the situation.

7. Hardly.

8. Nope, but if someone asks directly for my help or something I'll more likely than not try to help.

9. Quiet room.

10. Quite.My mum is ESFJ. I don't know my father so idk his type. I have an ISFP sister. Am ISTP.I almost always do it and I'm ISTP. My sister is ISFP and also does that.Yes, please! Do us!Rather easy going, despite the serious RBF. But quite unapproachable, it seems.Oh my, is that place still that circlejerk? Lol.

This is one of the reasons I'm reluctant to believe when someone says that they're INTJ...Couldn't describe better. You nailed it.Attacking the other kids in my class with bites, scissors or whatever when I was a child. Don't ask me why I did that because I don't remember, but apparently it happened often.Eh, I totally suck at sports tho.r/istp seems to be ok for now. Idk about the others.

I barely browse r/mbti anymore tho, for these reasons you listed, so I guess this might be true.ISTP here. I do it often.  
Sometimes because someone just bothers me and I have no reason to keep in touch.  
But most times it just happens, rather naturally.Oh my. I've been away for some months and this place completely turned into /r/ShittyMBTI.

Oh wait, at least there is a funny place...Heh I don't know what has changed because I've been away from Reddit for quite a long time, but /r/ISTP used to be a pretty chill place, and often considered around here to also be the most "accurate" (whatever the fuck it means) of the MBTI types subreddits.

We don't really miss our chance if someone is themselves being "toxic" or just straight up trolling tho, maybe the problem is in you? At least from what I remember, it was a really chill place there, either things changed a lot or...1.) Vulgar for anus, the opening at the lower end of the alimentary canal, through which the solid refuse of digestion is excreted.

2.) They are born like this.

3.) A low one. Generally they are blindfolded anyways.

-

Now, seriously tho, it's rather difficult to define an "asshole" since it completely varies from one person to another. And each asshole is different, so their world views will often not even be similar. People become "assholes" when someone else defines them as such, imo.  
In general, an asshole would be someone who's unpleasant to the others or who may or may not do something to harm someone else, I guess. But the other two questions, I don't think it's possible to answer them even in a very generical way. Each asshole is a different asshole with their own views, thoughts and circumstances. Hm, I think it's a bit difficult to define some sort of pattern, but in general they're people with no respect for others and/or are rather obnoxious. People can be considered assholes for many different reasons by many different people, so I think there is not exactly a clear line. Honestly, I might be a bit pessimistic when I say that, but I think everyone (including me and possibly including you too) is an asshole to some extent. What I mean by that is that most likely everybody has already done or will do something in their lives that will make someone else think of them as assholes at least once. But yeah, if it is needed to define a pattern, I'd stick to the "lack of respect for others and being rather unpleasant" thing.ISTP. My results:

1. **Spatial** (3.43)

2. **Social** (3.14)  
Wut  
No, really, wut

3. **Musical** (3)  
Ok, I love listening to music but I don't know how to play any instrument or whatever lol

4. **Self** (3)

5. **Language** (2.57)

6. **Logic/Math** (2.57)

7. **Body Movement** (2.43)  
Fair enough, my body sucks.

8. **Nature** (1.86)&gt;walk into a room and start talking and everyone jumps. its like they dont hear me walk in and then i just appear out of nowhere

Lol, this happens to me so often

Even more so because I'm really short and I've been insomniac since I was a child, so I got used to walk the most silent possible.YoMBTI. Ngl, I still don't really understand Enneagram.
I agree. Just speculation, but I would think the chink in the armor to finitely assigning childhood shyness to one or a few types could come down to outlying variables that might be completely subjective.

Just perusing some of the commentary, questions as to certain outliers arise:

* Birth order, or only child? (Whichever may be applicable.) Multiple studies have corroborated that this can have an effect on assertiveness or shyness.

* Gender? Where do societal expectations and mores start being conditioned?

* Parental investment in offspring(s) early childhood socialization.

* There's the screamingly obvious question of the hormonal/biochemical transition from childhood to adolescence. (Suggested reading on the GPR54 regulating/determining effects on adolescent behavior and prevalence among certain populations, if some choose to do so.)    

Not every human quirk can be reduced to typology.  Since the ESTP commentary train has started, I'll throw in. 

Although gregarious, I was obnoxiousness and chatty as a kid. In retrospect, the pre-teen phase could be where I started being the de facto rallying cry for some great ideas and some painfully, excuse my French, dumbass ideas.  

Example: After about a month of torrential downpours at about age twelve, a group of us were debating on whether to raft down a rapid flow creek. A great source of thrills (even more so when you know your parents would object) until the moment the cheap, plastic beach dingy careened into a downed tree jettisoning all four from the raft in rushing water. (I think I just had a twinge of a "days of slow dial-up", mental nostalgia boner recalling that one.)

Most of my "loud" was channeled to court, field or stage as a teen, actual competitive venues. (There might be some age discrepancy and socially conditioned gender differences coming into play after reading the commentary of fellow ESTPs.)  I'm going to preface by saying that I'm really uncomfortable with typing people I don't know in person.

&gt; There are plenty of aspects that makes me unsure of which type I am. The only cognitive function I managed to pin down in how I interact with the world is Se, and absolutely nothing else, but at the same time, I'd like to think I'm adept at typing other people.

With ESTP, myself and another user around my age-group (/u/Kbnation), question our types. It might be the inferior Ni manifesting itself in a stunted self exploration with serves as a threshold to indecisiveness, maybe? Ti's need for finite, substantive evidence before proceeding in thought or action could come into play in self-assessment. 

A recent observation by an INTP member of the community, /u/jermofo, in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4pesre/why_do_online_mbti_test_tend_to_be_innacurate/) might ring true as well.

&gt; Certain types will be more adept at typing themselves than others. In general, introverts will be better at it than extroverts. Extroverts might be more adept at typing others though. That is just how it works.

This could be indicative of Se while giving wiggle room to your admission of being in a state of flux over your own type. 

&gt; My questions are two, one, one someone experiences what they might consider 'flawless communication' with another person, would that be a strong clue they're users of the exact same functions (sans different order) or would that be irrelevant? Is it possible for two people who use different sets of functions to experience zero communication mishaps? What about vice versa?

1.) Just my experience (and I am still a novice at applying MBTI to the collective), I think there are underpinnings in fluid communication that might be indicative of function. I haven't been able to tune into cues that would lead me to believe they are the exact, same type, with the exception of actively observing written cues in how they process information here. The written word speaks volumes as far as type is concerned. You start seeing definitive patterns and similarities in how each set of functions expresses themselves on here.

As an aside, before plunging in here, I observed a marked and curiously collective distinction in how functions convey their "messages" via written form while grading essays and short answers questions that may require no more than a paragraph that seems to correlate to what I've seen here. 

I would think it would require patience, repetition and compromise, and bilateral cooperation in identifying the communicative hiccup that is the source of confusion in the first place. Hey! As a fellow Se user, isn't that the utilitarian application for delving into MBTI anyway? 

2.) See third paragraph of answer one. I find it somewhat helpful, but I err on the side of caution when applying, lest the application of MBTI become invasive. 

I hope that helps. A little bit hurried, so I hope it makes sense to you. 

Edit: Just to reiterate, I am a novice at typology. Yeah! Semi dual brothers and sisters. They're fun ones who are unaware of it.This isn't going to be a very popular opinion, I'm aware:

I've been miffed by people obviously searching out an identity of sorts as a justification for their shortcomings, underachievement or general douche-baggery and playing up the stereotyped role and conforming themselves to such. Healthy exploration is fine, but it's screamingly obvious when some are young and still retain a fallacious, heroic sense of self.

I'm a teacher and I legitimately wonder if more wide-spread knowledge of MBTI might be a hindrance to how people approach situations and comport themselves in reality, granted this is not indicative of everyone who knows their type. Since May, the pervasive thought in the back of my mind is, "Are inexperienced children playing with matches?" I honestly reflect on past students when reading some commentary here. Complacency and using a type as a crutch is unacceptable.

This was not meant to offend, but there it is. I'm kind of at an ethical crossroads with this now. 

Thank you. I'm just now dipping my foot in the water with Enneagram and further into Socionics.

I was wondering if the supervisor/supervisee angle had any legitimacy in it, but I was a little apprehensive about bringing it to the floor given very general knowledge on that aspect.  It's bothersome until you're blindsided by the brick of reality. Almost everyone operates under some hierarchical bureaucracy whether a person *wants* to acknowledge it or not. Such is society.   Yeah, I thought you did. It was more directed in a general sense. Sorry for the confusion. I think my tone is coming of cynical today. &gt; whether the details are accurate or not doesn't matter

You say this while criticizing INFJs when they're tertiary is Ti? Know your audience. You're also saying this with Ti users present, yourself included? Are you completely, 100% positive you're ENTP? You might be projecting a bit.
Thank you!

It's kind of bizarre how people equate both Fe and Fi doms as somehow lacking. Being able to naturally and sincerely empathize or sympathize is nothing to sneer at, and has applicable use in the world. This is an interesting turn of events. All cards on the table: I've been pretty hungover today.Agreed with your comment in its entirety. 

&gt; Ironically, given what I just said, too much "typism". That is, people relying on oversimplified stereotypes and generalizations that treat human beings as way less complicated than they actually are. Not so much intuitive bias as it is not understanding and using MBTI on a deep level.

This being applied to INFJs and ISTPs is what induced this entire needless saga. Had a user applied MBTI as a means of cooperative communication, we wouldn't have this melodrama spewed across three(?) threads now.  

Ridiculous.  

Yeah, I found one person recently who trolls ISTP under the ESTP flair. When you look at his or her past commentary, it transitions from ISTP to ESTP. I noticed that the verbiage, grammar, tone and use of "text speak" also flows along with his or her caricature of an ESTP. This person also took it upon him/herself to antagonize people in the ISTP thread after replanting his or her flag. 

Needless to say, I was not pleased. It's very easy to call shenanigans.  And I've been sitting dumbfounded with my head in my hands wondering, "What the hell is going on?" today. LOL!

You have a good night regardless. Eh, not really. I'm sure most people would understand that respondents are gauging by their own subjective experience. People's perception of "right and wrong" vary, also. You took the words right out of my mouth.I (Se dom/Ni inferior) don't enjoy watching sports on TV. I do enjoy being caught in the whirl of thrills and chills of playing or being in the stadium. My husband (ESTJ, so Si aux/Ne tert) enjoys all three, and gets very whipped up by watching football and baseball on TV, which is beyond my comprehension. He also indulges in a couple of fantasy leagues, and is the commissioner of his work league. He thoroughly researches stats for his team in the month preceding fantasy football season. 

As far as our participation in sports, I played soccer, volleyball and ran track. I was in ballet, jazz and lyrical, and served as the drill team coach and sponsor until roughly over a year ago when I tore my ACL. Running is primarily how I decompress now. My husband played football, soccer and baseball. He still plays softball for his company league. &gt; I did enjoy gymnastics, ballet, jazz, and other dance-related sports, but anything that involves a ball or puck is outside of my realm.

Completely understandable. Dance is invigorating in itself. It was the only one that I, obviously, took into adulthood to share for as long as I could. Gymnastics always seemed fun!

&gt;  My human is an ISTJ, so he also has Si/Ne in his stack, albeit in a different order than your husband - and is completely as "whipped up" by televised sports, too. Haha.

That's hilarious! There was a lady here who I was comparing notes with on how similarly I/ESTJ husbands handle traffic. LOL!Thank you for the contribution. Good read.I've mulled over this a few times.

According to some, we are what we are regardless of age it's only that our other functions develop as we age. My Fe/Ni developed where as your Se/Ti developed, and we might be reassessing the value of both and be more in tune to those as we age. So, supposedly, it's more of an evolution. That's how I understand it, at least. 

By the way, the ones that we developed or are in the process of still developing, respectively, are the ones we both lacked when we were younger but opposite. Brown isn't listed. I want brown.

Quell your astonishment, but I'm pretty sure brown is for skeptics.    

Where do you stand on chakras and gris-gris?I'm noticing an inordinate amount of T's in here. For the chuckle factor, possibly?

&gt; Sounds like a couscous-grits hybrid.

Never thought about it, but it certainly does! How appropriate for voodoo. Me too. We'll send ourselves to the corner. SHAME!Why is a 20-year-old concerned with what a 14-year-old does or doesn't think or do? You're the older sibling. Shouldn't you be setting the pace?

My brother is an ISTP two years my senior, and throughout childhood and our teen years and into adulthood we've always had an understood "loyalty". I can't image him, being older, ever pining away for my approval and in desperate need of adulation vocally. 

Given he is ESFP and a 14-year-old, why are you getting bent out of shape about it? 

&gt; However it seems like our moral beliefs are also completely different, for example he cares about other people. Sometimes when I am in conflict with other people he tells me to stop because he thinks I am in the wrong? 

What if you are wrong in some situations?Same. The only stereotypical ESTP characteristics is/was involvement in vigorous physical activity and a few novel vices picked up in college and promptly shed. Flippant, half-cocked remarks here and there. Other than that, I'm at a loss.   Funny. I'm convinced my brother is ISTP. Other than the typical childhood spats, we're pretty solid. We're only separated by two years with him being the older one.I've been wavering, though I will admit to being somewhat of a skeptic regardless. I think the most off-putting aspect is that people put a little too much stock into MBTI to the point where questioning it or themselves is a segue to disregarding or not even trying to incorporate established or actively explored, more credible  avenues of psychology, neural physiology, sociology, etc. (Actually, it casts a wide, categorical net from what I've noticed.)  

There's been some instances where I've drummed my fingers and exhaled wondering why some are so quick to give up on asking questions because of their stalwart belief in MBTI. Just saying, that's been a little weird, and I've only been here since May. Four letters on a flair is not indicative of intelligence.There it is!You can start feeling the wear and tear come wintertime as early as your thirties. Minor physical limitations and obligations to work and family as a precursor is a little unnerving. I would say childhood to early twenties offered more freedoms. Please, please, please don't be offended. I'm glad you said it before I did.I would say a begrudging TP is an underdeveloped TP. It's not worth the time or effort. [Do you know what time it is?](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/time-for-tickles.jpg)American with friends and family in Denmark, Austria and Germany. I'm torn to be quite honest, and I've been following the mirrored US and UK with keen interest for years.

Although I fluctuate between more classically Liberal to somewhat Libertarian, I am flabbergasted by the lack of forethought in the economic ramifications by the "Leave" electorate and their leadership. 

The domino effect in the coming two years, contingent on the path the UK decides to take, will be interesting as a, somewhat, outside observer. I understand Berlin and Brussels holding firm to send a message, on the other hand, I don't think those who opted for "Stay" should suffer the fallout. With Vondafone and Seimens (and probably more to come) having halted investments, I think people might be a bit naive to applaud the market slightly recovering when the UK is still in a state of limbo. In all honesty, if history is any indication, I'm not sure how anyone thought the EU would survive. I think we'll see it dissolve in our lifetimes, but I might be a bit cynical. 

After a little more than a decade, a lot of my political fervor has run dry. I'm a "Fuck it!" whateverist. I have been a firm believer in keeping a firm distinction on the bounds of federalism, I'm in a state in which the party that purports their protection of state, regional and local affairs has overstepped and has infringed on the personal rights of citizens. 

Edit: You need to treat yourself to a damn beer or seven, /u/Kbnation. Everyone should have one right now. I try to stay optimistic, but sometimes I can't suppress the thought, "Fucking hell! This world is going to shit!"

**Edit: Some people here, including myself, who started their careers right before or during the most recent global recession could tell you, don't take this lightly. Fair warning.** 

[Hm?](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4nmrpt/im_thinkng_of_starting_an_mbti_club_at_my/)Happy that you weren't discouraged after the last attempt to pool ideas. Kudos!ENTP, because either you had flair at one point or mentioned it, and users who contribute thoughtful, useful and/or genuinely funny commentary are seared into my memory. So, I kind of have a running, mental cheat sheet. Sorry if I blew your cover.As a preface, I really don't want to delve into this too much.

Although I try not to be a cynic, I think it's an amalgamate of idealism, the media and people having their "fifteen minutes of fame" readily available via social media. I try my best to stay ahead of the curve. It's almost painfully obvious seeing biases, whether media outlets or personal, subjective opinion that is almost conditioned (sometimes of not of their own doing) with some people.

Compromise is a foreign tongue to people, unfortunately, and having to feel the need to "pick a side" when Americans, in particular, don't have the option of having more parties to represent various ideologies is how we've found ourselves in such tumult over the past ten years. Then again, I look at Britain and they have substantially more ideological representation but are basically in the same predicament. Admittedly, I'm in a state of flux, given the micro to macrocosm outliers that have come to the forefront in the past ten years. This might be a horrendously unpopular opinion but, depending on how old you are, pitch MBTI out the window when it comes to dating. Dating and relationships, just as anything in life, are learning experiences. You will always have negative and positive reciprocal "gifts" that you and any partner could share, and add better insight into your own nature, whether good or bad, with the aide of the microscopic lens of a partner of any type.  

Inevitably, you are always going to have hills and valleys, and you can at least use MBTI as a guideline for  understanding each other in some capacity when you cross certain relationship milestones. 

Do what you will with these words. I'm of the belief that every type has something fascinating or beneficial to bring to the table, be it a romantic, platonic or professional capacity. 

&gt; please refrain from using vague Fe vs Fi and Te vs Fi

It's not remotely "vague" using these. It's even more detailed. 

What age-range are we talking here?&gt; Uses language 

I never thought about this until now, but my best friend of eighteen years, who is ESFP, and I articulate ourselves very differently. She's also developed a more stereotypical American southern accent (it sounds almost forced) after moving to a more rural area about eleven years ago. She also has adopted a bevvy of other mannerisms, a bit of nasaliness and *STILL* excitedly screams for no reason. I always thought the "transition" was within a very short span of time.

Sorry. I saw her and her husband over the 4th, and every-fuckin'-time she speaks as we've progressed out of our twenties I have to fight the urge to scream, "You grew up in a suburb outside of a major city!"  

Seeing all this during the proofread, it certainly does hearken back to what /u/Flux_n_Uck mentioned (Te is their tertiary, right?):

&gt; Te-Fi wants to think right and feel independently

Oh hell! You all induced a flood of youthful idiocy ESTP/ESFP stories in my skull.&gt; Te-Fi wants to think right and feel independently

This that you relayed from /u/blueottersocks. You brought it up. I just honed in on it. In for the rebound! LOL!

Since you mentioned it, I really wonder if the relatively quick metamorphosis was in part because of Se-Fi-Te needing to accommodate more to their immediate surroundings, be it accent, verbiage, colloquialisms, etc. Before this, I simply chocked it up to being circumstantial. I've never felt the need to change the manner in which I convey myself.

When she and I are getting foot-loose and fancy-free by ourselves her accent becomes somewhat more tempered and reminiscent of how she used to speak.

Hey! We helped each other out! It is rough picking up on some functional quirks no matter how long you've known a person. I think OP might be on to something with women being a bit harder to pin down.I have to admit, I'm diggin' the ESTP tealish color. ENTP has that nice, regal purple too. I get you. It's hard to pass up.  Would [this](http://www.livescience.com/33324-purple-royal-color.html) change your mind at all? I thought it was tongue-in-cheekly appropriate for one of the Alpha Quadra, INTP or ENTP specifically. (I have Ti user bias, obviously.) I'd rather see one of you donning purple, given the connotation.  While I agree with you, it's really strange thinking about my grandfather. As I retroactively type people, I've waffled on the S/N when it comes to him. I have no doubt in my mind that he was IXTP. Although he was an engineer for a well known company that made radar systems, components for electronic circuit and punchcard computers of the days of yore, along with various defense technology post-WWII, he was a pilot during his service. 

Have you seen the dashboard of planes made before, say, 1980? My uncle, who I have no doubt is ISTP, restores planes, mostly puddle jumpers. Simply ruminating on the somewhat infancy of flight, I don't know. I think ISTP would have been well adept to those circumstances, although I agree with /u/regrettablenamehere about Se and Te being beneficial. 

As an aside, there was a thread (I want to say it was in the INTP sub) in which someone made the assertion that generational fluxes in type (more so the S/N preference) could be due to the circumstances of the time. There was one person who mentioned that type preference could have, of course, unwittingly, swayed due to say the Great Depression, so you would have more ST crop up. Although this was just a floating theory in the thread and zero evidence for a legitimate correlation, it does make you wonder if Ti-Se/Se-Ti could, inadvertently, have been beneficial for pilots during WWII. 

Believe me, I know how many BS threads you end up fumbling through on here, but once in a blue moon there is a diamond in the rough of a find.    No slight toward you all at all. 

I hate that jokes can easily get lost in translation on here.ESTP: I should have never added flair. Well, sometimes, I do get a little curious about whether some would be able type me accurately. I think you and /u/Kbnation would have picked up on it. It would have also weeded out those who are presumptuous and dependent on the flair for their assessment of others. The thought is there, but it seems like a waste of time now. I've taken it on and off at times just gauge receptiveness. 

In all honesty, there has been maybe two times where what went through my mind was: *Well, have no fear! I have a four letter typing for you. You're in luck! There is an NT. Unfortunately, not in the order you're thinking of and there are two wildcard letters preceding it. I don't flagrantly toss around this type too often, so you should feel honored. XXNT. I'm sure you can figure it out.* 

I've pulled back on the reigns a couple of times and scoped their, respective, histories. Sometimes, you have to throw a dog a bone.  

I hope some here can find humor in this.Same. I don't think typing in an impersonal venue leads to accuracy either.

Latent asshole tendencies are still somewhere in there. :P

I can't even remember. So, obviously, not engaging was the right step. I completely understand. I still waver at times. What do you think about Enneagram? I've been lurking there and another user was kind enough to give me resources on the Beebe model of typing. It was pretty interesting, given Jung's work on the collective unconscious. It really depends on the people I'm around now. I really can't handle liquor that well anymore, but I used to love me a good silver tequila. I was definitely more loud, playful, touchy-feely and flirtatious. Girls' nights or bachelorette parties can still bring that part out of me, but I definitely don't act that way around my husband (ESTJ) unless it's directed toward him.

A friend sent [this](http://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/1341798306124_7698241.png) to me a couple years ago. Pretty on the nose in terms of drinking now.  If it makes you feel any better, ESTJ (husband) and ISTP (brother). I'm sorry, I would have to bring my niece, nephew and, I guess, my ESFJ sister-in-law.

I wouldn't mind the Swiss Family Robinson vibe at all for a bit.Oh. Well, if we're doing that, [redacted].

Don't worry. No harsh judgement from me. You're in luck. Neither do I.Read you loud and clear. That could be detrimental depending on resources in this hypothetical, also. 

I guess our intent was opposite. 

ISTP: Leave one parent home for the kiddos.

ESTP: Well, I can't take the dad without the kids. Eh, let's bring them along too.

The direction this took was kind of funny.  I will say that this exchange left me completely confused. Is there another ESTP waltzing around here or was there another one who previously engaged more? Do I need do less reading and sticking to lighter commentary and more engaging? Am I inadvertently offending people by not engaging while being cognizant of ESTP stereotypes? Kbnation and I are an ocean apart, and, last time I checked, I didn't have a penis and testicles.

What's going on here?

I can kind of see how ISFP could throw a wrench in the spokes of the utilitarian aspects of this scenario. Nine-month-old. No way would that work out, especially without access to immunizations. That would be a frightening reality.

Glad we could help each other out. Adding another layer to this, I think it's also funny that two STPs are jiving on survival scenarios. How cliché!You're confused. I'm confused. I will figure it out.I remember. You have quite an age discrepancy between yourself and your ESTP brother, right? I'm glad you two have come to a better understanding in your relationship with him.

We made quite a mischievous duo and he will absolutely admit to being the provocateur in some events from childhood on. When we vacationed we used to steal canoes at night when our parents were asleep and row into the creeks that fed the massive lake that we visited every year or explored the islands that would crop up during drought season. We've been well heeled in the ways of flounder spearing and tossing crab cages. So, of course, there is no question as to who I would take.Okay. I misunderstood. The gender is flipped with the elder and younger. 

Reading something like this:

&gt; He had a lot of behavioral issues though. Got expelled from every school, would steal cars, that kind of thing. (I don't really attribute this to his personality type, but our parents got divorced and we moved to another country--that's a whole different story, but he didn't take it well.)

Wow! Things like this remind me that I was working at relatively tame levels. I totally see how it would be like running a marathon with him. That's unfortunate that your parents foisted that responsibility on you.

It's good that he found a way of channeling his aggression, and could make reparations. 

How the gender roles and hormonal influences fit in conjunction with MBTI has been a pervasive thought on my mind. (Along with a cavalcade of other questions.) Although it's a dicey subject with some, another user, /u/Jermofo, who is extremely knowledgeable on various off-shoots of MBTI was kind enough to share [this](https://stottilien.com/2013/02/01/queen-mother-wise-woman-and-lover-rediscovering-the-archetypes-of-the-mature-feminine/) and [this](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/07/31/king-warrior-magician-lover-introduction/), if you're interested.    

&gt; All these people are about the age of 16 and 17.

&gt; They are basically what you would expect from a teenage version of that type.

Ah, I see. They're all annoying, much like teenagers of all types.

Jokes aside, why these types specifically, and why assign genders to specific types in this hypothetical?&gt; So that led me to believe that males and females tend to have small differences.

Actually, though I'm also a novice, I have been wondering how hormones, [neural physiology]( https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160516115447.htm) and social mores between males and females relates to MBTI for a bit.  Have you tried the P90X yoga yet? It will kick your ass.I think the artistic and musical proficiency in my family is inherited. My paternal side of the family is naturally skilled in both. I've drawn since I was able to hold a pencil, still paint (acrylics only, one, minute flaw that I can't correct will drive me up the wall) and have been playing piano since about age five.

As for sports, I excelled at anything that required agility, speed and accuracy ((dance, volleyball, soccer (wing and forward) and track)). I'm a waif and I hated weight days in high school, unless it was leg-oriented, but loved agility drills. Development in these was probably natural ability, build and repetition.   You know, when I see statements like this, I have to wonder if this is the same brand of asinine lunacy as, "Fire signs are only compatible with wind signs. Never date an earth sign!" I really don't want to discredit anyone's stalwart notions about MBTI, but some things I just can't help but cringe at.   Oh, I wasn't addressing you at all. Sorry for the confusion. I share the same thoughts as you in terms of the merit of an individual before typology. 

&gt; They do actually.

It was this. My positivity is contingent on circumstances. 

Psst. Hey, Beta brethern, you don't even want to know how many sadistically fun jokes I've passed up. There's been an element of, "Let's get weird!", especially when quadras have been brought up.  Okay. Had to pool the resources. Pretty lubricated, so let's get weird! You weren't present for [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4sbx3k/names_of_the_four_quadra/?st=iqn7nzsm&amp;sh=186580c0) sub. Although, I put my thoughts about Alpha quadra forward upon reading this:

&gt; As Pre-Modern Cultures:
Alpha: The Greeks (Philosophy and Pleasure)
Beta: The Mongols (Conquest and Dramatics)
Gamma: The Persians/Achaemenids (Politics and Profit) Note: Cyrus the Great was an ESFP and Darius I was an ENTJ.
Delta: The British (Conservation and Moralizing)

I don't mind that we got the Mongols. [Why?](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/9/01-0536_article). Biological warfare. 

Which led me to think of [this](http://www.cine365static.com/assets/img/peliculas/2087/1/extra/36ef5-Apocalypse-Now3.jpg). "I love the smell of ~~napalm~~ plague bodies in the morning." Which led me to think [Brando's character](https://media.giphy.com/media/t8vI9EexNVS24/giphy-facebook_s.jpg) in *Apocalypse Now* has to be INFJ. I don't like typing celebs and fictional characters, but what is Stanly Kubrick typed as? 

[Eine Kleine Nachtmusik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY). For that matter, what is Jimi typed as?First relationship of a little over three years (ISTJ), we grew apart when we went to college.

Second relationship of a little over three years (INTP), he was a couple years my senior, thus, graduated before me, and accepted a job out-of-state. Though we had trysts after the break-up, we called it quits.

Third relationship (ESTJ), married to. The lyrics put makes me wonder sometimes. [My favorite] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3xy0ZpIoeE). I wish I could find a better example. I would think INFJ or INFP. I know I could be wrong. 

"Voodoo Child" is a good one too. Okay. So, you're basically boiling this down to inferior Se, but we can come to a consensus on INFP. 

You have not seen a Stanley Kubrick movie and that's a crime against humanity. No *A Clockwork Orange*, no *Dr. Strangelove*, no *Lolita*, no *2001: A Space Odyssey*, *Full Metal Jacket, The Shining* or *Eyes Wide Shut* (which the story it was based off of, *Traumnovelle*, would be a Jungian/Freudian wet dream). Fuck. What am I doing here?Okay. Fair enough. I really need to go to bed, but I'll try to get back to you on his interviews before he died and his wife's and daughter's accounts of him. One of his daughters is a Scientologist now and has renounced her family. His wife is really interesting, as well as her family history. (His wife is 1970's, vintage, "Hot shit!" in my book.)
You noticed that this is just a condensed paraphrase of one of the sugar-coated sites too? Good eye! Yeah, that was an embarrassing read. I'm not sure why anyone would want to resuscitate that or why anyone would want to participate.I do! I'm experimenting with something at the moment. Okay, bud. I get where you're coming from. The only legitimate studies I have come across have all referenced one significant [twin study]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9529660) (which is a bit outdated). The author, [Thomas J. Bouchard] (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1660-2_2), seems to be the most consistent in his investigation into the question of heredity and, conversely, environmental evolution of functions. The former study yielded no significant genetic correlation and pointed to environmental variables.

As an aside, and as a fellow Ti user, I think you can find the humor in [this](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.413.841&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf). Seemingly, we both are, along with others, continually asking for the same thing time and time again. Realistically, you'll be reading until your eyes bleed and find yourself coming up empty-handed but with additional questions, in my experience.

**If someone can point those of us who are genuinely interested in the viability of this theory of heritable traits/functions, with definitive, reliable evidence indicating such in the right direction, I'm positive some here would be very appreciative of your submission.** (If someone could also do me the kindness of telling me how to upload PDFs on here, it would be greatly appreciated.) I think you and I have read the same studies. I still err on the side of caution since some were published over fifteen years ago. If you have anything relatively new to submit, I would be eager to give it a go.  That's unfortunate. I referenced Thomas J. Bouchard's that lightly touch on the topic at hand. Your 40-60% figure was what led me to believe we've, respectively, perused the same sources. I don't know. I find myself reading ISTP a lot more than my own sub, especially when I need a reprieve from MBTI proper. INTP either gets a little too down on itself sometimes or really pretentious (there are some legitimately funny ones in there (which is what I expect from that brood in reality, damn it!)). You can still find a gem of a topic in both NTPs). 

*Whistles while quietly sweeping ESTP sub under the rug.*

Don't look! I've spotted some of "my own" in there that I would not see eye to eye with. While initially cruising through the some of the graphs, I noticed two types absent from the stats. When I had the time to read your submission, my suspicion was confirmed as to why.

This appears a couple of times, "E/ISTP are omitted due to small sample size."And if you have a front-and-center, presence with an experience that exposes harsh truths that could sway your line of thinking to the negative in some aspects, what then? Is "ignorance is bliss" really qualifier for extroverts? Some things are pushed away but never forgotten. At least you can learn from the negative as well as the positive.    I would say, extroverts are more adept to hiding negative thoughts. 

It's not a slight to you at all, but I've been seeing this oversimplification of extroversion negating negativity. The approach is different, but both are sometimes confronted with some undeniably fucked up shit. How the aftermath is dealt with is different, also.  I really don't care to engage in a STP versus NFP pissing contest, but in regards to Fe/Fi dom and aux, I'm curious as to:

* How many minefields you've unintentionally stepped on when friends or acquaintances seek your council?

* How many times has siding with a friend or acquaintance's boyfriend regarding a critique in "clingyness", "smothering" or their tendency to be overly "reactionary" (more Fe for that observation) has landed you in hot water? 

* How many times have you thought, "Drop 'X' and insert 'Y'. Instead of a sneer I would have been bitch-slapped so many times by now!"?

* How many times have you thought to yourself, "You really don't want me to be honest with you."? 

Navigating this crap has added more to the relentless Gordian knot that needs untangling. 

Edit: Forgot a good one.

* Although it's progressively easier to "brick wall" passive-aggression directed toward you by about mid-twenties, how did you maneuver around that in your teens and early-twenties? 
Er, if it gives you any consolation at all, unabashed belligerence like this and delving a little more into socionics makes me question whether I'm straddling the line on the XSTP. 

Either way, I can't pass up the joke here. How 'bout dat Ti, huh? Looks like someone saw your flair and rode roughshod on that one. This has been immensely helpful. I still have [this](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Gulenko_Cognitive_Styles#Causal-Determinist_Cognition) in the queue as far as reading material.

&gt; She's one of the few friends I still have from high school, and it's both that she now knows to only come from me when she wants the brash truth (which is actually quite frequently) and I know how to word things a little better.

I have two friends who are more receptive, but there have been bumps in the road, more so when we hit our teens. ESFP and ENTJ are my closest of about a little over two decades now.

&gt; At first I thought I had never done this, but then I realized that I lost a friend in high school over this. She was kind of a shitty person to begin with, but she dumped me as a friend because I told her boyfriend at the time that I could understand how her behavior annoyed him. That's the only instance I can think of though, or maybe that's just the one time I noticed.

Check that one off the list. Conversely, I've had to perform two "friend" amputations, because they find themselves perpetuating abusive relationships with new men in the rotation all the time. Watching the cycle repeat itself time and time again was galling.

&gt; I don't think I'm understanding this question, but I also got like 3 hours of sleep last night.

I forgot one, singular word "chromosomes". My fault.

Sick and/or fussy kiddos, I'm assuming. I hope you get some peace tonight.

Obviously, I wouldn't have asked those specific questions if they weren't consistent roadblocks. It's interesting retroactively evaluating unintentional offenses in which people transposed certain intent on words or actions. Comments and jokes that seemed so benign to me were met with passive-aggression when misinterpreted so often. It was always so exhausting doubling back when cognizance of the trespass was delayed and finally set in.

I need to take care of something. I'll get back to the PM later this evening.    Citation, please. As /u/BlueOtterSocks mentioned, there are two theories on this, neither is finite.  We're both very much aware that even MBTI is not generally accepted as a definitive science. It's two steps forward and one step back when people use anecdotal evidence as confirmation and speak in absolutes. Especially when there are so many tributaries that have been spawned from the source that people quibble over.  

This isn't meant to offend.&gt; conjecture and the eggheads want hard proofs

It seems as though you didn't read beyond the first sentence. This might be a fool's errand and an exercise in tautology. Those "eggheads" could say that your viewpoint is conjecture, in turn. 

&gt; requires skill to type and the eggheads want a formula

So, you're saying that a baseline formula (among others, given avenues opened off the base of Jung's ideology) hasn't been submitted? If so, then this off-shoot wouldn't exist, neither would your assessment of yourself, nor would this sub.

Here's an example of conjecture: Those loose ends that the "eggheads" want tied up might be what's separating MBTI from, say, the zodiac, auras and what have you.  

I'm still working out whether I'm Se-Ti or Ti-Se. You're working with Ne-Fi. I think we're going to have to call this one a draw. Nevermind. Just go take a cruise around Saturn on your interstellar unicorn. Thank you for your submissions. Unrelated: I love your user name.I don't really like sites dedicated to pop-culture. &gt; Se=“consciousness of consciousness”

&gt; Si=“unconsciousness of consciousness”

&gt; Ne=“consciousness of unconsciousness”

&gt; Ni=“unconsciousness of unconsciousness”

Unrelated: I could have sworn about two weeks ago someone presented this very wording in a thread to gauge the general consensus and share their opinions but didn't bother to cite Beebe. 

Thank you again for being consistent in citation. This place is increasingly becoming at hotbed for my pet-peeves.

Originally, I double majored in History and PoliSci, until I hit a snag during college and went History and German.Nope. Far from it. It's German for "devil cat". I thought it was funny. 

How is it related to the Marines? You've got me curious now.**Type?** E/ISTP. Leaning more toward ISTP since being pointed to [cognitive styles](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Gulenko_Cognitive_Styles#Causal-Determinist_Cognition) as an indicator. 


 
**At what age did you start wearing makeup?**

Maybe five, at the earliest, because of stage wash-out. It was kickstarted by being in dance for decades. I started experimenting with it a little more in middle school, but by the time high school came around it lost its novelty, bare-face/natural was "in" then and it wasn't practical for my day-to-day activities. 

**How frequently do you wear it?**

I place more value on skin and hair care rather than make-up. Bare-faced at home and on weekends. Mascara for work. Liner, eyeshadow, (sometimes) powder and lipstick for special occasions or going out.  

**How long does it typically take for you to finish a full face?**

[What's this "full face" you speak of?](https://m.popkey.co/b843ab/AKkVq.gif) Maybe ten to fifteen minutes, I guess?

**What's your favourite part of the routine?**

Leaving to do whatever it is I felt it necessary to put make up on for?

**Least favourite?**

N/A

**Favourite lip colour?**

A nice, vintage red.

**Favourite eyeshadow?**

N/A

**Do you contour?**

No. I have high cheekbones and a narrow face anyway. I wouldn't even know where to begin with that. Youtube made its debut when I was in college, thus, this contouring fad wasn't around when I was younger.  

Also, that's a lot of damn make-up for the climate I live in. I can't imagine that being combined with the humidity and sweat when the temperature reaches about 90°F and above, for months on end, would be comfortable. 

**Smoky, winged, or neither?**

Tried the wings a couple of times. I've driven myself up the wall trying to get them symmetrical. Usually, the occasions that merit smoky or winged, I can find someone else in the flock to do it for me. Mm, you're not taking age into account what was in vogue ten to fifteen years ago in regards to make-up application and the overall aesthetic. Natural was favored over what's going on now.  &gt; principals

I wouldn't take any source seriously whose author doesn't know the difference between the words "principals" and "principles". What's this from, an amateur blog? 

Yep! I'm *that asshole*.Have you considered professional counseling? Your self-worth shouldn't be intrinsically tied to some silliness on the internet. You should see someone if you're actually contemplating suicide. 

Take a breather. Think it over. 

I hope this doesn't come off condescending. It's not my intention.  Those two were exactly the resources I was pointed to, by another INTP on here, as reliable and consistent in their information. Very helpful since I was trying to determine where I stood on E/I and where I sit in regards to Fe over the summer.

Yep. Now that I'm reading through /u/intelligentfolly 's link, this site seems as laughable as initially thought, although I was, admittedly, matching picky ridiculum for general ridiculum as a joke.  
How old were you during his presidency? Departed from whatever political leanings anyone here might have, I'm not seeing where the judging function comes in. I know that the majority of reddit leans more to the younger side. &gt; ESFP

This is where I was leaning. Although, I am hesitant about typing celebs and other people since there's the possibility of outlying information we're not privy to.  /u/HGF88 must have been downvoted for a relatively benign and understandable request more than once.

Before lunch: Journalist

After lunch: Detective

Findings would suggest my results are contingent on whether my stomach is running on empty.You definitely should. Glad you're back. I was thinking about you last night when I was suppressing the urge to call someone a twat. 

*British colloquialisms are just great! My only regret is that I usually opted for "chode" over "wanker" in my more formidable years when the opportunity presented itself. I wonder what /u/Kbnation is up to?*  I don't really listen to a singular song on repeat, but I have certain albums in rotation that have been go-tos for years now.

The White Stripes - [Get Behind Me Satan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxDbJtlQR3E&amp;list=PLJAPe32ITFJJmvO7wXmc8Jj4018aOFT_c) coincided with a metamorphosis period at age 19/20.

Good one! Before or after *Garden State*?

[Caring is Creepy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUMkxH03V5c) is probably my favorite.Not to be picky, but you should have probably left a text box for some of the questions for those born in the 1970's and 1980's. The parameters came off more restrictive than comprehensive. Some perspectives are going to be a little different.   Well, as you said, this is for fun. 

It was more or less the section pertaining taxation that got me a little curious about the age stratum. After reviewing the results, I did question how many have actually crossed certain thresholds: Income tax, property tax, there are a few states that have estate tax and, if I remember correctly, the majority of EU countries. So, it wasn't so much the pop-culture milieu. I totally get why you had to compress that for a, somewhat, consistent outcome.

Just questions upon questions. I know when I start thinking in terms of age, experience and level of education, it becomes completely detached from MBTI. No big deal.  

Edit: I had a hearty laugh about you including the Goya. I loved reading the responses to that! Cracked me up! I saw someone responded with "Attack Titan". Two recognized it.Hear me out. *Or maybe* it should be left as is for the S&amp;Gs? 

I smell a DAE thread in the works regarding attention to detail. Considering his life before being a Congressional representative and reading *The Revolution*, I can see how he could be considered ISTP.

As /u/kazejin0 mentioned, we're not privy to every aspect of a public figure's life.  Which is a hell of a thing to start picking apart to evaluate yourself objectively.You completely misunderstood. I'm open to it. I just wonder if, sometimes, this is more about self-adulation than self-improvement or finding a communicative bridge (which *might* be the only applicable use for MBTI) with some. Are you angry because I'm testing it? Ideas and concepts get corrupted with ease. From what I've seen here, some would disagree. 

Why jump to the conclusion that if someone is critical of a system they are completely opposed to it?  You came to this conclusion after reading a singular post, also? Well, I'm sorry if you're overly offended by things that might be funny to others. It's pretty hit or miss. If you're reading it as antagonism, that's on you.

Enjoy your night.Although this has reached multi-layered levels of hilarity over something I would consider benign, the STP skepticism, tinker, poke and troubleshoot flew over more heads than expected with all the nuance of a roaring Boeing 777. 

I'll fully admit that this probably wasn't the place for it. I'll take that end of it. If you want me to expand it'll have to be via PM, since I seemed to have rattled some cages.After reading a little bit of your post history, we actually agree on a lot. Can we talk about how obtuse this statement is, though?

&gt; If you dislike the system so much, why are you subscribed?

Essentially you're saying, "Believe as I do. Practice as I do. Don't question it. If you don't conform to my belief, get out." It's a really confusing statement coming from an INTP of all people. You're aware of how this sounds, right?

I'm actually curious as to how this didn't register with you.

Don't worry about it. I absolutely agree with you about the amount of "fluff" that seems to be pervasive and cyclical to the point of predictability. Contrary to the intent of MBTI, you kind of have to walk on eggshells more often than not. 

Just my opinion among a sea of opinions. If you think about it in terms of Stardust Theory and reanimation via the carbon cycle tracing back to the Big Bang, then voila! Although, you, yourself, wouldn't be conscious of it.  Ah, got it. Just throwing in the physical state of being as an alternative. You win this round, caffeine and multi-tasking! The god damn worst!The gauntlet has been thrown. We demand a Beta blood sacrifice. I will put money on the one known as /u/FoxPee as the victor. 

*I really wish I had a glass of wine right now.*If you are basing this around lyrics have you taken into consideration that most pop vocalists (male and female) don't write their own material? Are you basing this around Top 40 "artists" or are you expanding this into various genera? Are you referring to current musicians or is there leeway for retroactive inclusion here?How did you come to the conclusion that the three qualities you listed are somehow exclusive to NTP? 

No problem.

I was actually wondering the same. When someone recognizes the inconsistencies, the limited lens that others have to evaluate another in this venue, and how others will project their positive or negative interpretations of types here, then I tend to wonder if it's simply double-speak when someone is dependent on others to assess them. Self-contradictory in the same breath or trolling? 

Admittedly, I take more of a voyeuristic approach to the "Type Me" threads for all the reasons that OP mentioned. I'm not entirely sure what to do other than laugh once in a while. 



Let's see. The first was from age 14-18. The second was from age 19-21. The third, and the one I ended up marrying, we dated for a little over three years and have been married for almost six years.

They were all my best friends in the preliminary stages and it would develop slowly and organically rather than an overt push. When it did happen, it was more or less an epiphany on my end. I'm picky about my partners, despite sporadic, meaningless flirtations peppered into some periods. It's always for the long-haul, if those three were any indication. I think I'm justified in my pickiness. I can't say that I've had an actual *bad* relationship in comparison to some of my friends'. Break-ups were more due to circumstantial drifting apart (attending different universities/graduating before me and accepting a job out-of-state) rather than some melodramatic implosion. 

I will say it is a little awkward hovering in the same circles later on  with someone you dated for nearly three years when both of you are married. So, a sample size of one while others are still submitting their contributions conclusively closes the book on the case? 

What if, say, in a few years, with more life experience and with further exploration, you or your boyfriend start reevaulating your types? Uh, let's keep some perspective on this. Plenty of people think MBTI is completely bunk and [its origins are just as questionable](http://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history). 
Comme ci, comme ça. 

At least he or she is on his or her toes and legitimately open to and questioning every venue.   

As an aside, I don't necessarily believe in most esoteric paths, but why not take a gander? 

Okay. I can get behind that. I'm not easily bought and sold on much either. 

Edit: It's not necessarily you either, but the hypocrisy in some comments sometimes are blaring and repetitive, even if it's a matter of cascading theories pertaining to MBTI. &gt; I think it's somewhat disingenuous to lump it in with astrology.

As do I, but if this was the conclusion you came to after reading the article in it's entirety, I have to question whether you actually read it. No mulling over a little [Gliese 832](http://phys.org/news/2016-04-earth-like-planet-nearby-star.html) or maybe [Gliese 581](http://www.space.com/23821-gliese-581g.html)?

Eh, nevermind. I'd probably go batty being confined to a tube on route to either. Unless, HAL's aboard. That dude is on the up and up!I can't believe no one's inner ten-year-old hasn't upvoted this yet. Kubrick jokes aside, you probably should have left a text box for write-ins. &gt; I like this [one](http://i.imgur.com/PluLUXJ.gifv) for ESTP. But feel free to suggest others or claim it for another type.

I love this!Morality is subjective. Would it be too much to get a breakdown of *only* US citizens with the contrast of age eligibility by MBTI type?

Edit: I understand that you're trying to be inclusive, but it does dick all for working out realistic percentages of those who are actually eligible. 

 No problem. Thank you. Sure. I'm sure I can work out the kinks that are nagging at me in the primary overview.No problem. May as well give others time for their submissions also. You enjoy your evening.&gt; I know he'll never understand my abstract mind and what I find fufilling in a conversation.

Did you ever stop and think maybe he's equally bored of you? 

You describe him as though he were a toddler (obviously, you don't allot mutual respect to your partner), and you could be exaggerating here for sympathy points. Maybe he's trying to coax a conversation out of you as a Hail Mary before he dumps you. 
Uh, you should probably respond to the other two. *I'm not the one who called you a narcissist*, but my opinion is up for grabs. You're not looking good from this angle, especially with your accusatory tone and lack of attention to who said what. 

Edit: I don't think you've done much research into either INTP or ISTP gauging from your response here. 





Let's review:

&gt; **Did you ever stop and think maybe he's equally bored of you?**
You describe him as though he were a toddler (obviously, you don't allot mutual respect to your partner), and you **could** be exaggerating here for sympathy points. **Maybe** he's trying to coax a conversation out of you as a Hail Mary before he dumps you.

Take note of the bolded, but go ahead and scream into the void of the internet instead of initiating a sincere conversation about your grievances with your SO one-on-one. You know, there's always the option of dumping him if he causes you this much anxiety and aggravation. May we ask why you're even holding on to this, seemingly, tenuous relationship without you projecting your angst upon us? 

You seem young. Questions posed are left unanswered. You've wasted my time. You're obviously looking for fights on here. 

Good luck. Look, this will be the last time. I looked at your post history, hoping that I could find reason to give you the benefit of the doubt. Did it ever occur to you that this isn't about MBTI and more about your ten year age discrepancy? Are we safe to assume this is your first long-term relationship? 

Questions unanswered tally:

/u/Hiromant

&gt;If he's boring and you don't click, why are you in a relationship with him?

/u/grandmasterethel

&gt;A) If you find him boring, why are you with him?

&gt;B) ISTPs are not generally interested in small talk and often find silence preferable. Are you sure that is his type?

/u/DarthZell

&gt;How the hell did you get in a relationship with him in the first place if he is THAT boring?

This is discounting the four I've asked so far.

You gave us nothing to work with and started spewing highly  unnecessary emotive rants at people. You're not asking for help. You're asking for consolation. You should take note of what /u/SirSplodingSpud said in the latter part of his comment. Your intent is transparent at this point. 



She was withholding a very significant part of the yarn she spun. Young and financially co-dependent for a period. 

Honestly, we all knew there was something more to this saga. Dat Se!I've waffled among three, so feel free.  Nah. Fi and Te were easy enough to cut out, so it was never ESFP.

It was a couple of years ago when I was weighing ESTP to ENTP for a period. DVD: "Atonement" 

Book: "Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned", Wells Tower 

CD: "Kid A", RadioheadThe first or second-hand knowledge that there are people who have substantially worse problems than I do. Mine are minuscule (by my perception), so I have no room to bitch.

People who conflate their problems to garner sympathy, even though there are 7.4B people on this planet and somehow think their problems are unique to the human experience.  
Glad you came in for the assist. That could have been worded horribly on my part.

It's more gratitude. Citation, please. Hm. I blame this one on siphoning off my caffeine intake. 

Sly, sir or madam. I don't know. There was a thread here a while back sporting MBTI merchandise and a corresponding link. There might be some who see the need to don an LED board with their assessed type.We have an oceanic color scheme working throughout the house. I took a lot of joy in the process of remodeling. Minimalist and utilitarian. Unnecessary clutter is not our game, but the formal dining room we never use is a mess. That's what doors are for. 

Married to an ESTJ. I repeat: Dining room doors closed. Out of sight out of mind. There's always that *one* room, drawer, and closet. From what I've read INTP and/or ISTP is what he wobbled between. The OP seems young, so maybe he or she doesn't have the opportunity to surround his or herself with older Ti doms.

I am on pins an needles in anticipation of the revelations OP has to offer in terms of our Anima/Animus kin. (Not really.) The thrills and the chills, and just in time for Halloween! *Beware, Fe doms, bell tolls for thee!* I'm sure they are petrified. Technical foul! Username conveys criminal mischief and frenetic energy, and haphazard, flagrant use of a variation of the word "dick" would indicate you are most definitely a Se user with either tertiary or quaternary Fe. Welcome to Beta Quadra, dick or diquette! 

Hm, /u/drivebytyper is quite the conundrum. Wielding "dick" and "cunt" is genderless under some circumstances. I formally retract my previous assessment of Beta Quadra. 

The game is afoot! I like your style!I clicked this thread, saw Alex Jones, and was done.

So many variables we're overlooking in this scenario. "Robot" on the cusp of "Hand-Raiser":

71% Rational 

43% Extroverted 

29% Brutal

12% ArrogantTo sum this up, basically, INTJs are always channeling Duran Duran. The most definitive cues would be feathered hair and a Members' Only jacket. Once in a while, they might surprise you with fingerless gloves.

Google it, /u/L7k5u8. Eh, don't get too miffed about it. The repetition of the "I versus E" topic echos "N versus S", sometimes. Granted, most *here* steer away from generalizations. 

If anything, experience is always an ace up the sleeve and having a wide array of interests is advantageous in terms of the level of ease in which you relate to people. (I wobble on whether the Ti-Se or Se-Ti is more prevalent.) I have to say, I love it when some clamor for the moral high-ground in an offshoot of Jungian theory, whose peer and predecessor was Freud. All of them, including *Saint Isabel*, have an undercurrent of the nitty-gritty that is absolutely up for critical grabs. Is each group dropped off with an allotment of supplies. If so, what?

What resources are already available on the island?

*This is critical information that will determine how to proceed!* 

You're really putting the screws to my brewing plan without at least one substantially sized pot. Flamethrower grade, half-assed terlet wine it is, depending on the vegetation. 

Edit: I feel kind of bad for the putz who ended up with a pole to, possibly, trade. S/he is going to have to pretty convincing to those whose grandparents taught them how to make a cane pole. The person who would accept that barter, I'm not even sure what to say about that.

A map seems useless in the long-run. If we're going with your time frame, that's more than enough time to tread through and become an amateur cartographer. What else are you going to do for "several decades" anyway? A compass would most likely prove itself equally useless to those who are familiar with astronomy.   

What climate are we talking about here?Well, since you're the only other female, that I know of here, that cared to comment, what happens when there are no prophylactics? This is probably tert Ni coming to rain on everyone's parade, but  "several decades" without modern medicine seems as though it could regress into a high maternal and infant mortality rate, and this is discounting some bungled, amateur midwifery. 

I think invoking the Baba Yaga/Holle mythos and becoming the island-bound hermit witch would be well worth it after watching so many die. That's a hell of a legacy to leave behind, too!   It's a hell of a thing to pull apart too. Emphasis on object orientation via separate functions provides a little more clarity when narrowing it down, as well as Gulenko's cognitive styles.

When taking into consideration early-childhood socialization, cultural gender mores, and age group pre and post-internet availability on the wider scale, it does make you wonder if some interpretations of extroversion versus introversion could be a matter of people getting the shit end of the stick as far as opportunities in self-exploration or not allotted the tools to weave through social situations. Whether definitively the case or not, it's unfortunate when E versus I is reduced to such a binary concept.I was really apprehensive about adding my anecdote. Since both of ours are in the same vein, except mine was very intentional at the time, I guess I'll share.

In college, I was in an organization that participated in intramural sports. One of my friends within the organization was cast as the relentless whipping~~boy~~girl. After watching her endlessly harassed for months by a certain triad of girls within this organization, I finally snapped during a soccer scrimmage.

I knocked my friend's aggressor down a peg by knocking her teeth out with a swift dive while thrusting my elbow from jaw to nose when we were both going for the ball. I kind of snapped when watching that group heckle my friend for not participating, even though she was not athletically inclined, from the sidelines that day. 

In the immediate aftermath, I was overcomed by a sense of relief and hung myself over to feign catching my breath when I was really hiding my grin. Seeing her mouth coated in blood didn't mean anything to me. The blood seeping from the gash spanning my elbow to a third of my inner forearm didn't mean anything. It wasn't until I found out that she had to have her lip stitched and have veneer replacements that I felt bad about the ordeal.     Yeah, although, even a little over a decade later, I can't deny that taking the Hammurabi-esque route à la "tears for my friend's tears" is a supremely fucked justification. That was the pique. There was an period of escalation. We both ended up ditching that organization not long after that incident. Obviously, it was an unhealthy atmosphere. 

&gt;I mean, I'm sure he's fine and I didn't mean to pop him like that.

I completely understand. Sometimes you end up underestimating yourself.

/r/ISTP should ditch the pretenses and have a ["Physical Scars"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLjNzwEULG8) thread.  &gt;What they reflect is the same dramatic impact of type on what kinds of thing somebody's likely to be interested in as the fact that Carl Jung, Katharine Briggs, Isabel Myers, David Keirsey, Naomi Quenk, Lenore Thomson, Linda Berens and Dario Nardi are all — can you guess? — INs.

Another hole in this entire hamfisted theory, removed from the self-reporting, would be, how many sensors would be more likely to use the resources on some of the forums to field information but would see no point in bothering with subscribing or engaging? I mean, if we're pitching hypotheticals over sensors being adverse to IN theories based on forum subscriptions, I think someone might be overlooking the possibility of the nauseatingly repetitious nature of internet forums and navigating the superfluous smugbox to hugbox is boring and/or a waste of time when you can just get your information and go in most instances without having to register. That's not even starting in on how forums can sometimes be guilty of diluting information in a game of Telephone.    

Jung: Type debatable and certainly has been subject to such. 

Kiersey: Responsible for widening the gap in his interpretations of the S/N.  

Isabel Meyers: Questionable (maybe self-serving) intent and application of societal normatives of her day that are considered antiquated by today's terms. 

   Anyone else notice the uptick in pointless threads dedicated to the S/N divide merely leaning on anecdotal evidence corresponds with exam week being over? 

I'm a 300', 62-year-old reptile from the depths of the Pacific Ocean. Hit me up!Dating website!? I thought this was where I could covertly advertise the semi-autobiographical musical I've been working on.  

Now, I'll let you in on a little secret. There's been a delay due to a little legal snafu with Andrew Lloyd Webber (iNtuitive (?)). I'm not exactly sure how the ballad, *Mothra*, is somehow an infringement on *Memory*. 

Good news: There's quite a few roles that need to be filled before our opening. 

Bad news: Not until we sort out this litigation mishegoss. 

Edit: On a serious note, did you actually sing it mentally or vocally?   Wow! Twice in one week, huh? I'm pretty sure you did this broken record thing in late summer, also. Is this really the only information you ever peddle on here?Heyo! Former Austinite here! We went to a vintage shop for my band of leaves. Love the signifigance of the Forget Me Nots for your ring.Or! (Hear me out.) Or if you're feeling a wee bit mischievous, you could test how seriously they take typology by tagging yourself as their Super-Ego or Conflict type.  

I don't know much about Tinder or online dating, but that option is there. I'm just being a bad influence. 

Advisory: Do not do this if your intent is to actually pursue a relationship one of them.Strange timing. Before scrolling through this an INTP and I were questioning whether most of /r/MBTI has ever read *A Brave New World* and contemplating the possibility of it being dashed as far as  the required curriculum in the US based on some of the commentary that presents itself here. Lo and behold...[This ENTP](http://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/9bd5ffd1-e196-4d9b-8259-1f44bdc457f7/dd56c131-29dc-4e1c-a956-7b39ec7afca9.gif). 

  

Well, since no one else is taking a crack at it, I'll give it a go. Granted, this is simply based off a few biographies I've read and I'm still a novice when it comes to typing, nor do I usually engage in celeb/politician/public figure typing threads.

Queen Elizabeth II - ISTJ

Philip Duke of Edinburgh - ESTP/J (He's kind of a character.)

Princess Alice of Battenberg (Philip's mother) - ISFJ

Princess Margaret (Liz's sister) - ESFP

No clue about the younger ones. Oh! Phil is my guilty pleasure, too! That is one irascible, old codger and was a rapscallion in his youth. That would be an interesting combo.  

Alice might be a harder one to nail down. She was plagued with mental problems (possibly schizophrenia) and was shuttled off to a convent. I don't want to presume too much. So, the jury is still out on her, I suppose?

Margaret was a "free spirit" but very short-sighted, so typing her ENFP probably doesn't check out. 

Louis Mountbatten - E/INTJ (?)

I'll have to really refresh myself on some that expand beyond the earlier part of the 20th century or look to other European houses within that time-frame to come up with some that would be undeniably iNtuitive.

What were you thinking for the contemporary ones?

Edit: More British aristocracy than royalty, but when thinking back to Jessica Mitford's *Hons and Rebels*, she could be ENFP. 

&gt;What do y'all think?

You have terrible taste. Are you absolutely positive you're not projecting a bit there?

After reading your justification I can give credence to why this would be a personal interest of yours, but let's refrain getting overly testy about a mere four words. Deadpan does not come off well in this venue.     No problem. Wires crossed. It happens. Out of curiousity, how old are you and what area of law do you practice? Ah. I see. I assumed you were still in law school rather than already licensed and practicing. Yes, I'm aware. 

I *was* going to suggest Family or Environmental (provided you would have the opportunity to work for the state) to specialize in based on the anecdotes of a few friends, but, then again, I have no idea what would be more advantageous where you live. That's unfortunate. One of my closest friends had a similar experience, but it was not as "front and center". If it's any consolation, after reading Trevor Noah's *Born a Crime* I was reminded of some commentary on here where he was tagged as ISFP. (The autobiography's release succeeded this thread, so leeway can be allotted.) If his accounts of his adolescence and youth are any indication, he's probably EXTP. My guess is people go off what they are presented via visual or auditory medias and their "public face" rather than investing the time to evaluate by the subject's own style, diction, how they processed experiences, etc. Whether an autobiography or correspondences within a biography, it gives more insight.  

I could be completely wrong, but, *"Who needs to actually crack the spine of a book when you have Spark Notes at your disposal?"* rings in my mind when reading some assessments here, sometimes.

Either way, I'm not flitering through PMs as I am bedbound, and you already pinged /u/Jermofo. I'm sure he can oblige with the link to Socionics-based writing analysis, if you're that curious.  

Edit: Just to add, it's probably no surprise to anyone how many would *want* to claim Maynard as their own "tribe" for the sake of bragging rights.  Why are you letting MBTI influence/dictate who you date?  

&gt;Dear Mrs. Briggs,

&gt;Thank you for your news of the X family. It is indeed an unfortunate end to your attempts; yet an almost unavoidable one in such a case. You overdid it. Your attitude was altogether too Christian. You wanted to help, which is an encroachment upon the will of others. Your attitude ought to be that of one who offers an opportunity that can be taken or rejected. Otherwise you are most likely to get in trouble. It is so because man is not fundamentally good, almost half of him is a devil. 

&gt;Sincerely yours, C. G. Jung

*(July 4, 1931): Letters of C. G. Jung: Volume I, 1906-1950* 

Now, if Jung himself had to divvy out a proper cautioning/earboxing to Katherine Briggs on her invasive wielding of a cudgel that she was blissfully ignorant of with her analysands, why would you bring this figurative cudgel to the realm of dating? What's your preferences? Hold 'Em? Stud? You're in the ballpark, but how you prioritized guaging others and "gut feelings" over watching the river and the rate of discard when compared to how many are at the table to work out probabilities in real-time is beyond me.

It's Friday. I require a bottle of Cabernet and you sound like fun!S/he didn't include any XSTP women at all, and it seems like they were all boosted from a singular site (the name escapes me at the moment).

Edit: Bear with me, I'm on my phone. Since there was mention of Kiersey, that would explain those who are unincluded. If you wanted to give *Please Understand Me* a once over you'll probably find yourself tossing it aside to continue with other reads. (Going to plug Hillman and Beebe here.) Kiersey's assessment of Sensors is what brought about some contentions.

There's gender-specific descriptions in Socionics, but even those are a bit lackluster and might be more Eastern-European centric.You're right. I completely overlooked how etchings and paintings usually try to portray, in a very nuanced way, the person who commissioned the work's subjective sense of self or what ever propaganda needed to be pushed within the context of the era. I suppose that would be what you're getting at?

It's really not a big deal about the sectioning off of gender-exclusive examples and use of pronouns when putting the writings in the context of the time they were written and by who, so it might have been by no conscious fault OP's own (as s/he stated).

Anyway, if you're up to it, go ahead and attempt Kiersey, despite people's apprehensions. A lot of the more discerning iNtuitives here raise their brow to it, thankfully. (I got about 120 to 130 pages in before I put it on the backburner. I might revisit at some point.) Since we're talking STP here, may as well drop the formality and make with the n'yuks: Some people are going to try to wax poetic about their escort service. When you take a peek around the bend, it ends up being a singular, aging, meth-addicted lot lizard. Anyone who needs a rub and tug from aforementioned lot lizard, just let them have it.Well, Ti-Ne, bully for you! You got a whiff of the stuporficial before I did. Scroll through and you might see we need a remedial lesson on stacks. This needs more upvotes. Everything else is fine, but that word induced immediate convulsions. Likability or relatability? Even a well-written/developed villain can be likable in some aspects.There can be overlap, whether we're speaking in terms of a protagonist or antagonist. Relatability would involve similar, personal, behavior and characteristics, where as likability of a character can be completely departed from yourself.

Neither outweigh eachother in importance, for the most part.

I hope you get a little more input to tinker with.Appreciated the sentiment, but any typological bitchfest, whether directed toward Sensors as a whole, INFPs, ENFPs, ESTJs,  whatever the "whipping boy" du jour is for any given thread is, I, personally chock all of them up to merely being the bumbling KKK members' scene from *D'Jango Unchained*.

I have to question whether people have invested the time and effort into understanding eight function models, whether Beebe's archetypes or Socionics' ( I know that's a "dirty word" to some), and/or Renin Dichotomies. I know some are dismissive, but there's a lot to be said of those who try to grasp the notion that all eight are within us to varying degrees. The concept of some being constructive and destructive (not in the negative implication), seems to give a tad more leeway in understanding the intricasies that would make the more "snarkier" commentary exempt.

To each their own, I suppose.

On a lighter note, I noticed only one other sensor so far. Some of us don't need a hero, but good effort. I'm sure you got plenty of upvotes from our brood, regardless.

Edit: God damn it! I would hope I wouldn't have to put an advisory on this, but I would hope that some would understand the specific Tarantino allusion being made and not have a freakout session. Who knows? An ESTP here got his shit reamed for having "KKK" in his username, which was obviously tongue-in-cheek, given his commentary. (Yeah, some "iNtuitives" here are a damn joke themselves when mouthing off about the underpinnings of references they obviously have scope for. You can get a guage of people's age-range by those subtle nods, also.)Stop getting your information from bullshit internet memes,  for one. These typological theories existed before the rank idiocy of the internet co-opted these ideas. Well played! Due applause.Fuck it. I just got the Christmas lights off the house today. It's only been a month and two days too late, so I'll play along.

Hey, lady! Hey! Crunchy leaves come in handy when bracing for impact  when jumping off a roof or tree. It may not be as thrilling as cliff diving, but you take what you can get sometimes. Don't knock the leaves! They are integral when evaluating the risk to reward ratio!Yeah, that was the only part that came off as a complete misfire.

Problem: Burglar

Solution: Blowjob?

Edit: Just saying, the wording might need to be tweaked. That's what I got from it. Not a prude, but that was a shelved plot from a very lame skinemax porn. 

No offense intended. I'm glad someone else saw it.She specifically stated in the primary post that it was merely satire based on exaggerated stereotypes. She's only fucking with Thinkers because of a previous "roast".Go for it if you want.Hey! You're back! I hope you're well.

You get no JPEG jubblies, sir!Go to the brick and mortar establishment, talk to an actual person, stay and watch as the customer service person sorts it out. Who's your provider? If it's AT&amp;T, that's exactly what you should do.

If worst comes to worst, you've got bitch face for a reason. What an optimal time to put it to its intended use.

This isn't type exclusive or rocket science.Your commentary is seriously one of only four reasons to continue browsing r/MBTI. Scalpel-like precision in your humor. Easy scroll-bys, but u/pm_me_your_molars always delivers on the n'yuks.

The compliment, TAKE IT!Your flair reads as INTP. In socionics, you reverse the J/P for introverts. Did you mean to look up the INTJ description?The one that stands out the most was a buddy from college. We ran in the same crowd and played intermural soccer together.

Two hurricanes blew through our college town, one within a week or so of another. They closed the university, but a gaggle of us jackasses decided to ride it out and stay with buddies who lived off-campus. Kegs and bonfires for three days straight. In our drunken genius, we invented the lovely game of Stump Darts. If you have downed trees, a chainsaw, spraypaint, and three hatchets, you have Stump Darts! 

The only time he actually pissed me off was when baited me into doing my first and only keg stand without giving me the complete rundown. I felt like I was being waterboarded, and it didn't help that he was violently shaking with laughter. It ended with me spitting out the dispenser and closed-fisted popping him in the gut upside-down. Pretty funny in retrospect, I suppose.

He failed out after three semesters, joined the Marines, and no one in our circle has heard from him since.*You mean to tell me that IXTPs are capable of being cordial and use cooperative communication? You sooo crazy!* 

*Everyone knows the aspergers meme has to be true! Pictures, man! And sometimes there's even a frog! Who could deny that juicy piece of evidence?*No explanation needed. I'm certainly not the one who downvoted you. Sorry if the off the cuff sarcasm led to confusion. My time was limited.

If I had to take a wild guess, it was probably leading with "mistypes" that made a few hot under the collar.No problem at all. The overall tone of some of the commentary here is the only reason I saw the need to clarify.

Just my personal thoughts on the matter, all avenues of exploration should be taken into consideration before being dismissed. Socionics allots a bit more leeway for type variation via DCNH, as well as the symmetry of intertype relations. 

I can give credence and respect to those who object, but have immersed themselves enough to have apprehensions. People who default to voiding the discussion simply because they might not have taken the time to indulge in the intricacies do tend to induce a raised brow when looking at their "tag". No theory is beyond criticism, but, in turn, no theory is beyond the realm of exploration.EJArdenee?Oooh! Solid alibi, huh? Seems kind of defensive to mention that off the bat. Just be straight with us. You two went Thunderdome and he's buried in your backyard.

On a serious note, raised in a Catholic/Lutheran family. I don't practice, nor do I take exception to those who do.ISTX. (Washy on my primary, demonstrative and role functions.)

BA in History. Just started applying for graduate programs for PoliSci.He didn't leave *Eyes Wide Shut* "open to interpretation", he died. It's based on *Traumnovelle*, which is something you would think Ni would be tantalized by, whether ISTP or INXJ.

Look into Christiane and their daughters' musings.You silly buns! Didn't you know you were suppose to roll over and lay prostrate to the internet ubermensch?God! I hope so. Well, this is going swimmingly. Criticism of soft sciences and humanities, of which psychology is categorized under, in a sub dedicated to an offshoot of psychology that is under scrutiny?Ah, thanks for the clarification. Look, you're getting beat up in a thread that is looking like a back alley crapshoot. 

Though I will say that it could be a toss up, Christiane reads as ESTP and her artwork seems definitively Beta. I, personally, can give credence to the idea that Kubrick was INTJ because of their relations.

When the top rated post roughly translated to, *"Hey! I have a narrow frame of reference. Here, INTJs, have a video and a reach around!"* I don't think some here are afforded the luxury of wailing about who is distanced from reality. Nice kneejerk, though.&gt;sheeple

Nevermind. Resume dumpsterfire!Open thread thinking, "Great! A possible correlation to polyglotism!" Was very disappointed.

Thank you, hangover! Very selective with the word "each".I came to describe the pasta flinging method. Glad it was covered. 

Addendum: Add salt for areas with high mineral content in the water.How accepting/inviting are you toward EXFJs? Big money, no whammies!Let me ask you this,  if you were not privy to MBTI do you think your perception would be different?  

There's a twinge of the adage, "If a tree falls in the woods, and nobody is there to hear it [...]," at play here, whether you think so or not.Sh*iiiiiiiiiiiiit*!

Love this show. Haven't watched it in about five years, so not sure if I could throw in for this one. Good viewing taste, though. It's an HBO drama series from the early 2000s detailing the crime and politics of Baltimore. Carcetti is supposedly based on Martin O'Malley.Better watch out! We're treading "wanking it to The Wire" territory.

Phenomenal show.Only in the sense of drunkenly riffin' on the piano with a sweet, early 90's, Bryan Adams power ballad unabashedly.

Intuitive, carry on.Okay. There's a hairy area here. I'm talking "Everything I Do" *Robinhood* Bryan Adams. All cards on the table.: This is my week off, and I may or may not have polished off a bottle of Moscato to the tune of immaculate and consummate awesomeness that is, "Bette Davis Eyes", and the entire album of "Control" by Janet Jackson while cleaning. It happens. LOL!
 
Edit: Errors.

Edit 2: More errors to be corrected later but I need to go to bed.Quick! Thoughts on Annie Lennox! Typed as INFJ, inclined to agree. (I might be being selfish here, though.)That guy has always read as young INFP.

Unrelated, but when SJW starts infiltrating the everyday, face-to-face vernacular, that's when you introduce the old acronym CHUD. I get it, but it's always the most annoying people who spout off about it.

Look it up. You might appreciate it.In response! You use CHUD in response. Phew! Close one. That could have been bad considering the direction of this thread.Maybe just a little bit presumptuous there in some cases.You do realize that what individuals define as government overreach can be state-to-state contingent? Do you happen to be a Te dom or aux yourself? Your focus seems to be centralized on the macro level rather than taking into consideration the nuances of state/regional culture and mores that influence legislation at the micro level.

The Devil is in the details.Really? Why does it matter so much whether a mod of r/INFJ may or may not be INFJ herself? **Look at the type tags of mods in other type specific subs.** If they're doing their "job", why does it matter? You're exposed to different types daily.

Much ado about nothing.Ouch. Yeah, that was pretty uncalled for when you and /u/peppermint-kiss were only trying to help.Caution. Tread lightly, both of you. Probably not the best time to point fingers. When traversing the path of Individuation, guess who you address after your Anima/Animus? If you guessed the Super-Ego, kudos. There comes a time where what you say about your Super-Ego is only a reflection of yourself. I'll wager that is PLoR, not Animus. 

I beg both of you to read what Jung denotes as the "soul"/psyche before throwing ISTPs under the bus. INTP/ISTP inferior is not that dispersed from each other's. The delineation would be where they stand in regards to Eros and Thantos. Fun fact: ISTP and INFP are both in the Thantos corner, as is INTJ.  Yes, thanks for the heads-up. Should have specified the distinction in Jung's dispersal in terms of Eros/Logos and Freud's and Lacan's idea of Thantos and Eros regarding "Death Drive". 

Anyway, I already know your reaction when I utter the "magic word" and follow up with the Process/Result dichotomy, so we'll just leave it at that. Have a fun one for you if you're interested, though. 

Edit:Just to get a gauge, what's your threshold for tale of two star-crossed lovers in terms of swarthy Egyptian gods of yore and spooge, front-end Ni?   &gt; Ni: no one has this function

By the tip of Pazuzu's plasmatic pussing prick, no one! New übermensch diagnostics should be set in place. A culling is upon us.

Also, we're not administering Rorschach Tests now, right? Just asking. [For a friend.](https://media.giphy.com/media/MqxZxTlvcY5BS/giphy.gif) Always a pleasure to be of service and a lovely evening to you, madam! Time for some much needed "get weird". 
Keirsey.Too late already read "Please Understand Me" per request of my INTP lovie two years ago. Double-teaming Ti with the benefit of double-helix coverage of our respective Se-Ni and Ne-Si, both tossed Keirsey to the wayside. Not to worry. 

I can certainly see the appeal and the reasoning for the over abundance of mistypes thanks to Keirsey, though. I think we both know why I left the matter to one, singular word.   Psst. Everyone conveniently forgets on here that NFJs bleet Alpha values in tongues over a pentagram while decapitating a chicken. On the other hand, STP's preserve Alpha with a menacing, "I'm your Huckleberry!", ESTP overtly and ISTP covertly. 

Then, we all end up fucking ourselves and Gamma rolls in.

Agreed, though. Probably more polarity in Delta because of Fi.We also have Teddy, Eisenhower, and LBJ (albiet contentious figures in their own right). You seemed to be knowledgeable about societal Quadra progression effecting the ethos of eras, though.

As an afterthought, a little from ESTP [LBJ](https://youtu.be/nR_myjOr0OU). Love them or hate them, the US does have an affinity for Beta leaders, past and present. Socionics details why Betas are at the national and international stage in terms of politics.

By the way, it was an INTP who showed us the LBJ clip after an ESTP commented on LBJ's antics. At least low tier Fe takes humor in itself. Ne/Fe or Ni/Fe.Me (ISTP): Baptized and Confirmed Lutheran but agnostic now.

Brother (ISTJ): Baptized and Confirmed Lutheran but apathetic now. Had his children baptized Lutheran, though.

Sister-in-law (ISFJ): Southern Baptist.

Mother (INFP): " Lutheran. Atheist.

Father (ESFP): Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, etc.

Paternal Grandfather (ENTP): Formerly Methodist and coincidentally converted to Lutheranism a decade before our parents met.

Maternal Aunt (ISFP): " Lutheran. Agnostic.

Maternal Uncle By Marriage (ISTP): " Catholic. Apathetic.

Could continue, but it should be unsurprising that the maternal Danish/German side of the family are Lutherans and Catholics with different degrees of apathy. None overly religious.Mm. I agree that specification of use of Model A or G is in order, but information/energy transfer is much more elaborate in Model G. There was a semi-recent article on A.A. possibly not being ENTP, which would account for the discrepancies in duality only being ideal for Alpha Quadra, denoted by Talanov. Either way, it's all cumulative.

Side note: Model T is a god damn rabbit hole.Surprised you haven't had someone bellow, "Boomer Sooners!" at you yet. I assumed the same. Ha. Either way, always thought responses to your username on here were amusing.

Won't be hearing it from me. My Alma Mater isn't even in the same conference. (Rather play than watch anyway.)Welp. To counter this one, and given your patience in a previous submission, I'll just go ahead an state that the most enviable quality of INFPs is their patience.

Godspeed, INFP. Guess I should be belting out a "Gueax Tigers!" for undergrads. Not a big deal, though.

Funny segue, this. Especially, given the topic. We just need an INTP to chime in now to complete the TX TP box set. Anyone putting money on that one?Mm. Just a suggestion, you might want to review Beta and Gamma Quadra values. The impetus and "end game" between those two quadras obviously boil down to Fi/Fe. While you're at it, the Aristocratic/Democratic (Collectivist/Individualist) dichotomies might offer you more clarity.

Se in Gamma tends to straddle the line where you easily could make the argument that MBTI definitions of Se overlap with Socionics. Dionysian definitions of Se might tilt the scales just a little more to the high Se users of Gamma or the low Se users of Beta. (Last sentence was more of an observation by mere subjective experience.)INTJs are intriguing, and pretty decent platonically. Picking around Ni-Dom skulls can be fun. There can be a point where it comes down to "Rules for thee but not for me!", that's when you lead them to a balcony after locking the door from the inside, slyly, quietly, and gracefully shove any item they can use for "worst case scenario" possibility of the apex of hashing things out in conversation (because they're not paying attention to their surroundings). Worst case scenario comes, you take a two story jump, knowing full-well none of their roommates will return in days, and leave them stranded in a "Saw" situation where they either jump or punch a glass frame in the door. (Admittedly, top three in cunt moments.)

You can share a laugh with them, privately, half-a-decade down the road, but it must never be brought up publicly by anyone in a mutual circle, no matter how funny others find it. NEVER.

Not the only one who managed to get their dual in the results. Out of curiosity, and don't feel you need to oblige at all, what's your age range and what were the results on the margin between between real/ideal and sensing/intuition?

Real: ISTP
Ideal: ENFJWell, happy belated.

While combing through the responses, I kind of figured we might be in the same age peer group, possibly in career paths where integration (dualization, by self or otherwise) might be necessary, or both. Wish I would have saved the results from earlier to swap with you.There's quite a few up for grabs in that list. I forgot which Socionist points to a typing of ENTJ. Either way, the US has a strange relation to Se, whether Mobilizing or Demonstrative. 

Mm. Another test with very bland Sensor options.

Results: ENTP  (Muse, Sage (5), Lover (Sx), Utopian (9) Archetype)X-Z dead-on in the axes in relation to Strauss-Howe Generational Archetype Theory and Quadra Progression. Lost-Silent missed by one letter. Boomer two. Either way, a damn fine example of Ni at work when compared with two other avenues of thought on the topic. Nice work, and was that simply rolling off the cuff?

Probably the first and last time I'll see commentary with a Ni-Dom flair beside the username on here, and NOT lift a brow and mentally mutter to myself, "Remains to be seen."

Barring two other INTJs who no longer participate here.Know two ESFPs and one ENFJ IRL (and one conundrum of either/or from online that had all the calling cards of both, which was hard to decipher) that displayed the same attributes. 

"Kids as a novelty and source of identity for $800, Trebek." 

"What is, there's actual work involved when other human beings are under your guidance/stewardship?"Mm. I get where you're coming from. In this entire sequence of back-and-forth, could OP have acknowledged the simple fact that in eight function models Parent Te is cross-examined by "Critical"/Senex/Demonstrative Ti in IXTJs. 

An obvious joke regarding Ti Ego could be made here, but I guess I better steer clear of the "Te Boogeyman". His entire presentation is a bit heavy in subjective connotation that doesn't check out with every interpretation/description of Shadow functions. 

As an afterthought, I wonder how s/he will address EXTP's Child Fe? Now that is a hell of an adulation-seeking "Hold my beer!" function and positioning when weilded by juvenile EXTPs. Love EXTPs, but damn.Having seen Tom Morello as a guest on Bill Mahar's show many times, his appearance last night had me wondering about his type.

[A bit from last night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUTZGjInaBg)

[Overtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ptvL0KU8Ls)

Background for those who may not be familiar with him, for whatever reason: Guitarist from Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. Bachelor of Arts in Social Studies from Harvard.

First guess, but not completely confident in my assessment, ISTP. No. It's not Pokemon.Damn storms interrupted trick-or-treating, I have nothing up my sleeve in response to this other than Red equals HP!

Also! Also! (Here's a rant.) Fuck all this "trunk-or-treat" church business! I have pipe-cleaner spider legs on my damn Toostie-Pops! I want to see some awesome costumes!Um. I'm an ISTP and I'd ingore if I were you and have read Beebe at length and believe in an eight-function model (not crossing wires about that here). I'm put off by the obsessive focus on the Demon and Trickster that this person presents as well as the stigmatization of Fi. That was strange. You can't have a full understanding of an eight-function model, Beebean or Socionics, without understanding that, when you take a swat at XNFP, as and XSTP, your taking swats at yourself and visa-versa. 

He might very well be under "archetypal possession" in Jungian terms. 
Nix my fuckin' assumption. Hell! That's not a bad call either! "Motherfucker, I've got Boolean Algebra, The Maunder Minimum, and Bottleneck Theory under my sleeve! I cleaned this kitchen top to fuckin' bottom pristine! You wanna talk shit? Hit me with it!" I miss college, but I don't.

TL:DR: *Young* Tert Ni crazy talk is what we're addressing here. Adderall certainly adds to that.You have terrible reading comprehension and information retention. That is all.Apologies. Didn't know you were dyslexic, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense.

Although, not a single word you have written in this response applies to anything I said, yet again. Funny though, I assumed you were ISFP. Thought the discombobulated writing style was due to Child Ni and Demonic Ti. 

We'll leave it at that. Have a pity upvote.Betty Draper [ISFP](https://youtu.be/0wGCjMYB1Kk) moment, now that you mention it. ISTP, but did love her tick-tick-tick. Need to think about the rest since I haven't watched it since the finale. 

Edit: Went as Betty Draper for this very scene one year for Halloween the season after this episode premiered. To put some levity on this, she was a really bad shot. All show, no accuracy. (But the writers who created her had that!) I'll show myself out.I might be out of the loop, but ISFJ for Betty is lunacy! I'm surprised to see Betty as Si over Se. Sometimes, I think internet "telephone" takes over. Completely agree with Don being STP, grantend I lean more ESTP for him. Peggy, can see her as INFJ, also.

God damn! That was a hell of a show! AMC needs to up their game again! Without "Mad Men" and "Breaking Bad", not sure how it will go. "The Walking Dead" is their boring carrier now.  Question: Did you ever happen upon "Hell on Wheels"? That was a good one.

Edit: Megan: my call, ESFP or ENFJ, but I haven't watched it in years. I think Northern ethos is ingrained in seasonal sparsity. Ni-Se cultures, and their lore, might be derivitive of stages of the perennial in unaccommodating environments.

This is not exclusive to Nordic myth, either. The ancient Egyptians, Steppes, Bakongo, and Inca, all recognizing the same. 

It's not that Ni-Se axes is not given to tulmult, but in times of abundance, they're not. 2000+  years of myth makes up for that. We can look to the Peloponnesian Wars, whether by Homer's (Ne-Si) compared to Aeschylus's (Ni-Se) interpretations, and it makes a definitive point.Same. Saw a couple of her addresses. Although I'm aware the Daily Mail is basically a gossip rag, if what they revealed about her spending habits thus far is true (on wardrobe alone), overcompensating Se as the Tertiary/Child/Activating seems on par. Like her, but yeesh! Take it easy with other people's money, considering Britain's previous austerity measures a half a decade ago only to be thrust into another state of economic limbo. (If you, or anyone else happens to be an eight-function follower, Ignoring Fi fits the bill on that alone.)

Side bar: I've seen England or the UK typed as INTJ. The few times it appears, taking into consideration Tories and Constitutional Monarchy, first thought, "You out 'cha fuckin' mind!" and I'm STP. Oh, you know. Fuckin' Linda over there who says all that stuff n' junk. C'mon. You know Linda [Kasabian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Kasabian). Wait a sec!

Sorry. Needed to joke around. Good for the soul.After reading this, and having been a PM Assistant for a General Contracting company during college and a year after graduation, there's some peculiarities in the situation you're describing (if I'm parsing out the hysterics correctly) that lead me to believe that you should be less concerned with duking it out with ISTPs on Reddit. These variables might be state-to-state contingent, though.

Your husband owns or is co-owner of this sub-contracting company, correct? When you are referring to your husband's loyalty to the "ESTP" over "contacts" are you referring to vendors or General Contracting companies? Does your husband have you as a owner or co-owner for HUB status?

Mm. This ISTP is cringing a bit right now.Well, I'll be damned! I can set aside preferences of a four versus eight function models, and intricacies and/or accuracy, or lack there of, to rag on CSJoseph's numbskullery. 

Not looking to throw-down with you, but I find it hilarious that the Beebe fad is now at the forefront because of the popularity of CSJoseph, when actual psychoanalysists who give credence to the Beebean Model do not look upon the Shadow, or the capabilities within the Shadow with such (Dare I say it?) fear and admonishment of it, which is incongruent with the path of Individuation. Whether a strict adherant to Meyrs-Briggs, Beebe, Socionics, or all listed, CFJoseph has some serious explaining to do. Not behind his self-assessment of ENTP either.

Hm. Quite the predicament. Oh, were you hoping for a super-dee-duper internet bestie!  Like OMG!  You and I both know ITXX aren't given to superficial pretenses but will give credit where credit is due, despite trivialities. Doesn't matter how you slice it.There's Socionics explanations for the similarities that you have observed. Not going to bother with resources unless you're genuinely curious. To some, a nine letter "S" word may as well be the the four letter one. So, just get back to me if you're interested in that venue. If not, oh well.My personal favorite since it premeired in the later childhood seems to be centered around and explores Ni-Se/Ti-Fe axis (NFJ/STP) themes.

[The entire episode is priceless.](https://youtu.be/yt1Bf28sYvY)

[Best one.](https://youtu.be/YnBMVAzhKFg)

[Hands down.](https://youtu.be/_0hsGJ-GKJA).

Edit: Loose commentary on Jung's Process of Individuation, now that I'm thinking of it.No problem.

With regards to ENTP and ISTP, according to Socionics, they're in the same Supervisory ring (shared by INFP and ESFP also (INFP &gt;&gt;&gt; ENTP &gt;&gt;&gt; ISTP &gt;&gt;&gt; ESFP &gt;&gt;&gt; INFP)). In each respective ring of Supervision the commonality of [cognitive style](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Gulenko_Cognitive_Styles#Causal-Determinist_Cognition) serves as an informational river (or a game of "Fuck the Dealer" for younger ones). 

ESTP and ENTJ observe a relation of [Benefit](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Request) as an informational segue. (Supposedly, relations of this nature are more prone to mistyping as each other also.) In the case of INFP/ISFJ and ENFP/ESFJ, they would also share Rings of Benefit.

There's more intricacies, but those are the two that come to the forefront immediately, and I wouldn't want to overwhelm you or run the possibility of overlooking something since it's been a fun but hectic weekend. I'll try to get back to you at some point, if needed.


Funny. I was thinking ESTP or ENTP if I absolutely had to choose.Can't even contain a Cheshire Cat grin for that one. Too true.Glad you were Johnny-on-the-spot with this one. Not surprised if we both had the same reaction. Putting that guy aside, how convenient is it to have an aggregate of information to dispel to people, in a Swiss Army knife of sorts? ITP's, all TPs, can give leeway for their indecisiveness while on their respective Ti ingestion and expulsion, but it comes from an intensive place. The discrepancies via Si and Ni might be different, the expulsion via Ne and Se might be different, but we're all very attuned to the idiom, "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions."Hey, man! According to Socionics, you're just as much a "gatekeeper" (maybe not in the internet colloquial sense) as I am.  No problemo. I assumed you were having some rascally fun. I was jumping in on the frivolity. 

I really need to start italicizing jokes again. Since google doesn't exactly provide the best up-to-date resources on the study, [here you go](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=Functions#Demonstrative_function).

[The run down specifically for ENTPs.](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=ILE)

There's also Viktor Gulenko's [site](https://socioniks.net/) which you will need to run through Google Translate or whatever preference you may have. ISTP

B.A. of History

Nine hours shy of a B.S. of Political Science (I should just finish that)

Finishing a M.Ed. of Educational LeadershipOkay, so here's the plan. Follow me on this one, because it's going to require us invoking the inner ENFJ or enlist some ENFJs and ESFPs for this one in the most grandiose fashion. Pitching a Mexican telenovela titled "Aye! Que Linda!"

Thoughts, critiques, reservations? Fuck it! Let's roll with it.Agreed. People are very dismissive of his abrasive and ostentatious characteristics.  

A guide for people to needlessly obsess over instead of actively immersing themselves with others who have dovetailing interests, whether in the platonic or romantic sphere. 

Reading some of the commentary on r/MBTI leaves one wondering how many unpublished harlequin romance novels and/or cobbled together totems some might have hiding under their bed dedicated to certain types simply by profile. Creepy.Yeah, unfortunately, not every Socionist propagates the notion of Duality. It's mostly Asura Augusta (ENTP) and Vicktor Gulenko (INTP) who tout Duality. 

Descriptions of Central Quadras (Beta (ENFJ/ISTP, ESTP/INFJ) and Gamma (ESFP/INTJ, ENTJ/ISFP)) take a turn for the "trailer park" and are fraught with lies, deception, swindling, sado-masochism, manipulation, and abuse on par with a soap opera. Strat, Talanov, Bukalov, and *sometimes* Gulenko highlight this. 

It's a highly exaggerated but very entertaining read as with most compatibility descriptions, MBTI or Socionics. You should probably look up Socionics Romance Styles, too! ["Aggressors" (SP)/"Victims"(NJ).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpOWrzBvCdI) Pretty funny. Gulenko and Strat seem to have a glaring problem with NFJs.Errr...I'm not INFJ, if that's what you're implying. Close but no cigar. 

Do go on, please. I'm sure they'll revel in the delight!Need to get back to this tomorrow. Not taking sides on this one. Have equal amounts of skin in the game since Strat and Talanov are Gamma. Not totally disagreeing with the Aggressor/Victim dynamic. Not totally disagreeing with the cultural influences on thought. 

You seem to have a real knack for putting words in people's mouths, though. Every venue is up for exploration. 



[Don't shoot the messenger.](http://socionika-forever.blogspot.com/) When you manage to wade your way through her commentary on all central quadras' relations, take your personal beef up with Stratievskaya. Shit. All this went sideways. 

For the sake of clarity and the weird tone this thread took, nothing against your commentary. 

Alright. Putting aside whatever indiscernible fallout in the wake of ragging on [ Stratievskaya's](http://socionika-forever.blogspot.com/) penchant for dramatics, which I was poking fun at. If you read how she describes Central Quadra relations, it's pretty comical and includes some unsavory commentary on each relation. 

&gt; Personally I need to research the socionics authors, because I really don't know them

Going to overlook going chastisement-for-chastisement over content that you, yourself, have yet to even touch for the sake of getting to the meat of the conversation. (And for the sake of those who are genuinely curious.)

Now, people seem to be under the impression that Socionics is a homogeneous arena without some conflicting schools of thought, which could also be due to respective types of Socionists. Yes, cultural differences and the remnants of The Iron Curtain do factor into discrepancies. 

So, getting back to Alpha (Ne-Si) and Gamma (Ni-Se) schools of thought. Unfortunately, most people only review Ashura Augusta's (the progenitor of the arena) and Gulenko's research, theories, and models. As with the evolution of any area of study, it would be foolish to assume there are not people who contest some findings to further the study. 

Didn't mean to "ruffle feathers" or anything of that nature, but, lo and behold, when Se-Te gets in on the mix. 

&gt; BE is positively influenced in marriage and negatively by an emergency. Let's pay attention to the fact that there is only one dual pair, with which with mutual fidelity in marriage at the level of the trend everything is in order (LII + ESE). But SEE and OR, on the contrary, at the level of the statistical trend are mutually prepared for their treason.

[Features of Sociotypes in Sex and Marriage - Talanov (ENTJ)](http://sociotoday.narod.ru/sex.html)

*OR is ILI (INTJ), by the way.

&gt; Third, on the basis of the properties obtained for dual pairs of clusters, conclusions can be drawn about the activation of certain subcortical and cortical centers in the corresponding dual pairs. Thus, the clusters of the LSI-EIE pair clearly indicate an increased activation of amygdalar nuclei and the left insular area, and most of all in this pair of sociotypes. The result of this increased activation in LSI and EIE is their increased paranoia (distrust, rancor, negative attitude towards people), as well as increased irritability, self-centeredness, greed and xenophobia, a painful attitude even to thoughts of any possible damage and deprivation. At the same time, amygdala is primarily responsible for vindictiveness, self-centeredness, distrust and aggression, and the insular cortex is responsible for intolerance of damage and unfriendly treatment of strangers, although in part the functions of these structures overlap.

[General Psychological Properties and Values ​​in Dual Pairs of Psycho-Types: Psychological Types of Alpha and Beta Quadras](https://translate.google.com/translate?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.newsocionicsmodel.narod.ru/dualy1.html&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700105,15700124,15700149,15700168,15700173,15700201)

Now, I'm not going to presume the notions of Ne-Si Socionists reservations, or lack there of, about Se-Ni Socionists getting their [word in] (http://danidin.ucoz.net/index/0-38) in terms of their observations, but, yes, as many others have mentioned, Duality is integral, but it happens much later according to Jung:

&gt; The question of therapy is a problem that cannot be disposed of in a few words. It was not my intention to deal with it here, but I would like to outline my point of view. Younger people, who have not yet reached the middle of life, can bear even the total loss of the anima without injury. The important thing at this stage is for a man to be a man. The growing youth must be able to free himself from the anima fascination of his mother. There are exceptions, notably artists, where the problem often takes a different turn; also homosexuality, which is usually characterized by identity with the anima. In view of the recognized frequency of this phenomenon, its interpretation as a pathological perversion is very dubious. The psychological findings show that it is rather a matter of incomplete incomplete detachment from the hermaphroditic archetype, coupled with a distinct resistance to identify with the role of a one-sided sexual being. Such a disposition should not be adjudged negative in all circumstances, in so far as it preserves the archetype of the Original Man, which a one-sided sexual being has, up to a point, lost.

&gt; After the middle of life, however, permanent loss of the anima means a diminution of vitality, of flexibility, and of human kindness. The result, as a rule, is premature rigidity, crustiness, stereotypy, fanatical one-sidedness, obstinacy, pedantry, or else resignation, weariness, sloppiness, irresponsibility, and finally a childish ramollissement with a tendency to alcohol. After middle life, therefore, the connection with the archetypal sphere of experience should if possible be re-established.

CG Jung *Collected Works of CG Jung, Volume 9 (Part 1): Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious*

There's also quite a few apprehensions noted by his pupil, eventual colleague and cohort, Marie Louise von Franz: 

&gt; In marriage, as Jung points out, one tends to marry the opposite type, and then again he is, or so he thinks for the moment, freed from the disagreeable task of confronting his inferior function. That is one of the great blessings and sources of happiness in the early stages of a marriage; suddenly the whole weight of the inferior function is gone, one lives in a blessed oneness with the other, and every problem is solved! But if one of the partners dies, or the need comes up in one of them to develop the inferior function instead of just leaving those sections of life to the other, the trouble starts. The same happens again in the choice of analysts. Frequently people choose the opposite type as analyst because, for instance, the feeling type cannot think and so admires tremendously a person who can. This course is not to be recommended, because if one is always with someone who knows it all he gets discouraged and gives up completely. He might feel very happy because now thinking is taken care of, but this is not an adequate solution. Jung, for instance, always liked to send people with the same blind spots to each other because, he said, if two idiots sit together and neither can think they will get into such trouble that at least one of them will begin to think! It would, of course, be the same with the other functions: they just sit there and hope the other will do the work. If one goes to the opposite type, something t be borne in mind, especially by the analyst, is to be very careful not to display the superior function too much. One must, against one's real feeling, constantly pretend that one does not know, or feels incapable or-has no idea- and so on. One has to give up the superior function in order not to paralyze the first shy attempts the analysand might make in this field.

ML von Franz, *"The Inferior Function" from Lectures on Jung's Typology* (Pages 7-8)

Really, there's no finite word on type compatibility, but people are more than welcome to continually fuss over it should they choose to do so. 

Edit: Tossed you an upvote, by the way. Washing my hands clean of even dealing with the level of seemingly sour that arose elsewhere in this segment. Mind over matter seems to be dispelled from the breadth of the commentary that I'm reading thus far. There's quite a bit of equating Se with Si going on here. Leaving it loose as far as further commentary. Not a grain of shame in vouching for another STP in the threshold of physical pain tolerance, and not at all surprised about the INTJ who piped up on the subject. I don't know if I should let the rest of these assholes in on the IXTP glory of playing Metallica's ["Fuel"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExmfjrQ3ik0) with B-52's ["Rock Lobster"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvJiSfMl4sI),  vocals only, simultaneously.  

Get on our damn level, non-IXTPs! Clearly, We're researching the heart of the matter here while the rest are left in the dust.

Edit: IPs take this venue of exploration with the respect that it deserves, damn it! Hetfield-esque "Yuuh! Ooooh - Shaaa!"
I pussed out at a Tool concert. That is too much weird contact. Regardless, the premise of this of the OP is jawdropping. Next thing you know we're going to get a thread discussing whether NWA and the Ghetto Boys are intuitive. No Se in Metal or Rap whatsoever, nope. &gt; Will an intuitive EVER get a job?

Good God. Saw that when prowling around. What is this anymore? Can't make heads or tails of it.

I love that with both get a chuckle out of these occurrences.[Producing/Accepting and Tactical/Strategic dichotomies, hm?]( https://i1.wp.com/24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx1gqkL4aQ1qe5cn6o1_250.gif) Good scout.Don't worry about it. Muddling through something from another venue on the output among all IPs and EJs again. You simply brought a query to the forefront. May as well add a little levity and an encouraging pat on the back. 

Edit: And there was prime real-estate for a *Dogma* reference sitting wide-open. Oh, you lovely human being! Have you seen John Carpenter's iteration of ["The Thing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ftmr17M-a4) (circa 1982). INTJ's do the damn thing with Sci-Fi. 

How much do you know about Jung's concept of the Anima? There's a distinction in Scott in the earlier part of the series and when he resumed with "Prometheus", which, from what I understand, was butchered in editing. 

Edit: Semi-"controversial" still don't understand why people claim Kubrick as INTJ, when he used symmetry as a means of the viewer's sense of isolation and claustrophobia when put against Carpenter and Scott's creeping notion of isolation in the expanse.  

Well, hell! All my upvotes if I could. "The Thing" has been one of my favorites since age seven or eight. (The remake was garbage.) Jesus. I could geek out about this for eons but need to turn in.  

Have yet to Read *Jung on Flim II*, but the Anima of directors Kubrick, Carpenter, and Scott are addressed in the first.

By the way, Xenomorph and Face-Hugger jokes for STP/NFJ are a hell of a way to weed out Ni. You can get in trouble for it, too. Recommend (head shake), but do not recommend (nod). However you see fit. 

 Nope. As for the rest of this segment, /u/kbg12ila was spot-on about the Demonstrative and the only correlation to Jung that could be tangentially correlated would be to the approach and eventual tangle with the Nigredo, if I remember correctly. 

I know that you're probably already aware. In terms of "strength", nope. Unconscious fluidity, at times, yep. Leave our weird, little Ni kids alone, damn it! (Even though we have to approach it eventually. Exasperation for all.)

To add a little levity, fuckin' Kronos and Yaga Baba. Sorry. Might be a misfire with the "Nope." Was in agreement with you. "Nope" to this being prevalent in the "Socionics crowd". Sorry about that. 

Oh, good. I thought you were both opening the door, just butted in since he might have very well been referring to the impasse with the Nigredo when referencing Jung with the definitive period. 

Enjoy both of your commentary. So, thought I might field, just in case there might have been a little confusion. Slinking the fuck out of here. D'aww! You're one of my favorites too. Let's be real honest here, we both know the majority here are probably still making withdrawals from the First Bank of Mumsie and Daddykins.  [Ian Shults](https://www.ianshultsart.com/). Hm. By the transitive property, can we assume this would also be applied to moobs?  Sh! Your ellipsis is too loud. They'll know you're coming.[So we meet again, SLI!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uYOrR7rs4k) Glad you enjoy his work. Admittedly, pimping a local artist. Met him briefly years ago. After learning of his method of execution, I do wonder if he might be ISTP.  That's an interesting take. I definitely thought it was a Supervisory relation but in the vein of Process +Fi and +Se. 

Not looking to argue about it, but I gauged them at Andre 3000 INFP/ Big Boi ESFP. [Funniest response to a post.](https://old.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9kk21u/the_types_as_an_eyeshadow_palette_shitpost/e6znqty/?st=jqh7x8xk&amp;sh=6720a4c6.) /u/my-dude-police.

/u/namelessuser deserves due credit for a helluva lot of responses, also.
/u/gravitre for his [contributions](https://old.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9aou5t/definitive_way_to_tell_the_difference_between/?st=jqh0vwbb&amp;sh=319e0560) and, if needed, [corrections](https://old.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/9afaoq/why_are_sjs_more_common_than_sps_but_njs_less/e4v59t6/?st=jqh86u8y&amp;sh=b954cad2). Oh shit. I like you. You're a fun one! I see you've got some Strauss-Howe in there too!Oops. Looks as though there's a mistype. Pretty sure /u/namelessuser covered the ISTP male method of birth control. (God, I hope some see this as jest for jest.)

Maybe don't make it a habit of getting on all fours for junkyard dogs to put a bone in you? They're easily discernible. I know this is going to sound outrageous, but prophylactics and birth control? Sounds like a personal problem. The use of "baby daddy" is just the crème de la crème (if you know what I mean). 

Edit: Pity upvoted you, by the way.I see your "Lateralus" and raise you ["Reflection"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja3LGFY1i0o) off the same album. 

As for /u/bonbear question. Lifetime favorite since childhood is undeniably Heart's ["Barracuda"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0OX_8YvFxA). Instantaneous vitality, especially when poring through tedium at work. Thank you, parental units, for your musical tastes. Yeah, that entire album is phenomenal! As an afterthought, *Anima* and *Lateralus* is where you really see Maynard traversing his Shadow. Stellar. 

Recommendation and weird segue: If you happen to stumble on your old, burned CDs from your teens, give them a whirl again. This might genuinely be the most amusing post I've seen on here in a while. ENTP? Really? ENTP? As an experiment, why don't you casually drop Jung's *Aion* and *Psychology and Religion: West and East* in /r/ENTP and report back? I double-dog-dare you!

I understand that there might be a flurry of mistypes in there, but they're not going to park themselves for dense Ni material.  

As an after thought, pretty ambivalent about the guy and the hub-bub surrounding him, and I'm not sure if he's simply capitalizing on the fervor of his acolytes (:cough: NFJ) even after reading *Maps of Meaning*. The guy shed very obvious crocodile tears in one of his videos.&gt; But, since he tends to rely exclusively upon his vision, his moral effort becomes onesided; he makes himself and his life symbolic, adapted, it is true, to the inner and eternal meaning of events, but unadapted to the actual present-day reality. Therewith he also deprives himself of any influence upon it, because he remains unintelligible. His language is not that which is commonly spoken -- it becomes too subjective. His argument lacks convincing reason. He can only confess or pronounce. His is the 'voice of one crying in the wilderness'. 

Jung, *Psychological Types* (Page 511)

Oh, his framework is already structurally sound. It's continuously building just as Ti does. Freudian Slip? I mean, it is another euphemism for "dick". But what about Linda? You know Linda. C'mon. Everyone knows Linda!

(Okay. I'm being a little too cunty about that one. I'll send myself to the time-out corner.)Ah, that Tertiary/Child/Mobilizing Ni will definitely lead you down some interesting avenues of exploration, for better or worse. Those deposits in the Ti bank come in handy over time. Eh, I don't know. Half expect him to start speaking in tongues sometimes. That's quite a bit of gusto for ISTP. Still can't reconcile his almost neurotic fear of *Aion* considering how many times the apocalypse and imminent coming of the Antichrist has been foretold. Not to mention, how many iterations of similar accounts are in the Collective Unconscious cross-culturally for over two millennia. 

*Ooooh! The bogeyman approaches!* Mm. So, should we even lightly strum upon the topic of NFJs being masochists went it garners attention, and, once galvanized by that attention, their inner sadist makes headway? I do wonder sometimes if the latter goes hand-in-hand with the "god complex" via some strange means of over compensation. Yeah, not even miffed by the "god complex" as a stand-alone when the pattern of behavior I just described was observed cyclically in late-teens and early-twenties. Thankfully, everyone kind of planes out later on.

Both of these, intertwined or not, are easy enough to simply walk away from. Sink or swim. Sometimes, NFJs need to learn the hard-way and alone, just like everyone else.

Will say, all things considered, NFJ guys are way more respectable in most circumstances. I could go on and on with anecdotes. Don't care to unintentionally roust equal doses of annoyance and exhaustion from a rapid-recall play-by-play of every damnable incident. 

Well, it just now occurs to me that I should have probably worded that very differently. Not necessarily talking about the boudoir. Ha! SPed up the lexicon inadvertently. I was really trying to avoid the words perpetual "victim" and "damsel in distress", and substituted with "masochism".  Glad NFJ guys don't ride roughshod with those qualities.

Anyway, platonic or romantic sphere, in late-teens and early-twenties, there's a mutual understanding on the Ti-Fe/Ni-Se axes of: 1.) STPs probably need more depth to channel and facilitate a sense of commune, 2.) NFJs can't operate solely on the self-styled title of iconoclast while sitting on their ass. Learned temperance in both, maybe by cultural imprint? (Granted, Leading Ti can drift into a bit of the god complex also, no denying that.) 

NFJ gals and STP guys, on the other hand, not sure what to say about some second-hand experiences. For better or worse, just a soap opera sometimes.  Upvoted, but you're not telling me anything I didn't already know. 

:Glances at title of sub again.: Oh boy!Oh, thank goodness. Thought you might have caught the drift but had to reiterate since some could see this going off on a coquettish tangent. 

To bring a little levity, any and every semblance of "coquettishness" is completely out the window at this moment. If I were one of the Four Horsemen, it certainly the pale horse of plague I'm riding. So, unless anyone likes codeine cough syrup ramblings and a very unhealthy dose of translucent phlegm...

No, but seriously, you're a fun breed. Gents and ladies (after a little bit). So, what does this mean in the case of the following scenarios:

1.) "Rather benign comment but I'm sure someone will be unnecessarily offended. Better throw that person a bone preemptively."

2.) "Benign comment at zero? Fuck it. Have a bump."

3.) "No time to respond. Read and acknowledged, though."

Thus, we bridge the gap of the binary outlook depicted here. And it needs to be reiterated that CSJoseph's "system" is a bastardized amalgam of Beebe/Keirsey/Berens. It was never his, and he should never claim it as such. If a 70 pound, snausagey German Shepherd (who presumably swapped brains with a cat) counts, then why not your cat?In addition to your comment, if anyone had actually bothered to read *Psychological Types* by Jung, people would know that Fi, Fe, Te, and Ti leading are categorized as Rational types.

*But hey! Why not let Keirsey cherry-pick?* And this gives us the convenience of knowing the relative placement of Ni, doesn't it? 

Anyhow, just thought I'd bolster someone here who seemingly has their shit straight, given some weird everlasting, internet saga that has been playing out over a month. 

Dear Super-Ego,

Don't worry. You're solid.

Sincerely, 

Super-Ego

Edit: I know it's horrible, but I tend to think that there's many extrapolations that can be made from people who do not tread into all exploratory tributaries related to this arena. People who are only using this study for self-edification and do not take it to the outer-realm of relations are easily spotted. Of course, age-contingencies leave some leeway. Spoken like a true Ni Dom. Doesn't know where to turn acute attention to. 

Edit: If not me, it would have been someone else. Surprised it's clocked at four hours now for someone to say it. Preface: Hate doling out anecdotes about myself on here. 

If it gives you any consolation, I semi-changed trajectories and quit teaching after almost a decade of it. Although I aligned my dominoes and got my Masters as a segue into my state's education agency prior to jumping ship, almost a decade of observing administrative redundancy and wasteful allocation of funds was galling. 

The real tipping point was when a city bond measure to up property taxes plus a university system stipend for more STEM curricula integration was squandered. In addition to that, funds earmarked for expansion and integration of Advance Placement Psychology and a peer counseling program in the wake of a student murdering his older brother (very grim circumstances that I don't want to get into and makes me anxious about summoning every detail to the forefront)  was cut. Funding for the Arts cut. Free lunch program for the elementary and middle school campuses, which really should be funded at the state level more so than federal, cut. I do believe there's a balance to be had between scholasticism and athletics, but guess what wasn't cut? A new stadium.

Now that we have that out of the way, what specifically has you bored? What level do you teach at? Have you thought about AP accreditation? From your age I know you probably don't have enough experience to be department team lead.

If you are going to jump ship, I can tell you that being a Project Manager Assistant for a general contractor was stimulating, satisfying, and challenging. Had to learn programming languages and CAD on the fly. Did that my last year of college and a year after graduation. Prior to that, was a Cash Office Assistant for a major retailer. Had to wake up at 4:00 AM, but that's nothing chugging coffee couldn't counter. Remote, quiet dungeon, running numbers, prepping deposits, searching for possible monetary discrepancies, AND BARELY ANY INTERRUPTIONS. Très magnifique!

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, no matter what career path you choose, you're going to have to do some socializing. Sorry. You're aware there are other uses for typology that don't revolve around you specifically, right? Gee whiz! What if people apply this to how they relate and communicate with/to others? Crazy talk!

Edit: Well, now that I've had a moment to thoroughly peruse the commentary, I saw that you're not much for maths and sciences. Good luck? I'm sure you'll figure something out. Personal favorite: CHUD. (Cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller.)

May as well up the TP ante that's going on here.And you're more than welcome to it. Rather convenient for when incel vernacular makes an appearance. 

You broke the chain. Oh my. We'll just have to make you an honorary TP this time, but next time...Okay, cutting in for a sec. So, since we're going down the hypothetical route of organ donation (even though /u/SpyMonkey3D's joke was obvious and with best of intentions), if you were a match (let's throw in the rare blood-type scenario in the mix) and a friend or family member were on a waiting list to receive a kidney, if members of your family objected you would abide by that?

Second thought, assuming you are an adult, **are you a registered organ donor now** in case of untimely death? [That's fairly easy to do.]( https://www.organdonor.gov/register.html) Unless you're under-age I'm not sure why you're relinquishing your own autonomy. If you're legally old enough to make these decisions for yourself, you're unwittingly reinforcing the dude's second and third comments.  Okay. That makes complete sense now. No problem.

It's just such a bizarre topic when it arises off-line. People who are adamant about organ donation, barring legitimate ailments which would make the offer redundant, baffle me.

*"What are [you] (universal "you") planning on doing with your organs post-mortem? Are [you] going to be buried in a knock-off Pyramid of Giza, dedicated organ urns and all? I'm sure Anubis will be very pleased."*

Can't help but joke about it sometimes. Same here. Same outlook and sentiments to a T.Yeah, definitely glad there was clarification. 

[Are you absolutely positive this wasn't an INTJ you were debating?](https://i.imgur.com/FCDI3KU.png)

&gt; they weren’t always right of course, **there’s never right answers to those kind of things**

In my experience, INTPs usually operate within the bolded, too, for whatever that's worth.

No. I'm confused now. When you stated, "they weren’t always right of course" was there an admission on the end of the INTP's part that s/he [isn't] always right because of the nuances of the topics you discussed with this person?

No problem. Was in a bit of a time crunch. Got 'cha. 

Jokes aside, I just happen to find it easier to come around the bend, shake hands, and come to a compromise with INTPs more, too, in these situations. Although, Ti on Ti can be as stubborn as Ti on Ni. Their spitballing of Ne does offer a bit of food for thought in terms of other avenues of exploration when all is said and done. You know what? First meme I've upvoted here. With much gusto, mind you.

[Preach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNausGfSRiA), /u/yayoletsgo!"Yurt."

If anyone has discovered a means of time travel, that doesn't involve hallucinogens, I suppose we could ask the nomadic people of Mongolia of their love/hate relationship with the term. Simple, utilitarian, and they're on the steppes way too much. Couldn't have said it better myself. So, according to /u/ENTPositive the MIA total is: Tertiary/Puer(lla)/Mobilizing Ne, Aux/Good Parent/Manipulative. 

Assuming you're using the "S" word over the "B", Ni Opposing/Control and Se Senex(Crone)/Brake in the Super Id positions. Someone might not like peering into their Shadow? Firm adherent of the MBTI model and suppressing the wider conversation? You might have inadvertently touched someone in their "no no spot". Von Franz and Jung both have something to say on that matter.  

The game is afoot! Can't help but get a little chuckle from the fact that this segment is INFP ---&gt; ENTP ---&gt; ISTP ---&gt; INFP (Something...Something...CD types) all looking at this with a brow raised. 

Edit: You should probably field and create a compendium.Oh goodness. I'm not offended at all, if that's what you were thinking. Just joking with OP and putting the puzzle pieces together. Don't worry about it. 

I'll need to get back to you thoroughly when I'm not as strapped for time. Quick ins-and-outs, I'm left mouth agape wondering, "What the shit is going on here?"

Edit: The grand comedy of it all is in MBTI, as a stand-alone, Ne is correlated to "Openness" in the Big Five.  So much for "Openness" in terms of other tributaries if /u/online_persona37 is getting his contributions pulled. Reeks of "Rules for thee, not for me!"

Retreading some information on the Puer(ella) stunting Individuation (Jung, ML Von Franz, probably should sprinkle in some Hillman) while adding in Leonore Thompson's observations on the Tertiary that coincide, while applying it to Socionics for another venue. This discovery of possible self-preservation tactics, by way of voiding information at a whim, popping up is just fuckin' hilarious to me. 

This just coincides with telling Lennie to take a few paces forward and go look over the horizon as s/he "pet[s] the bunny". Ne Ignoring would be your latest, correct? If so, not there. Submission clocked at 4 hours. [Removed.]

 Working on something simultaneously. Corrected myself. Sorry about that.




Mm. I smell skinwalker/knobgoblin malarkey. 

What on Earth is "offensive" about eight-function models?

Edit: Being an ass now. Guess what? Jungian Rationals (Program Ti, Te, Fi, and Fe) are about information dissemination while Jungian Irrationals (Ni, Ne, Si, and Se) are about self-preservation. Ain't it a bitch? No ego-inflation from Kiersey while parsing through PT. Nope. None whatsoever.  I'd say take it up with the mods, the INTP mod was more than amiable when Jermofo and I spoke to her in the past, although it seems there might only be one person on-deck as of late. 

This is pretty fucked up. AWOL, except for some off-the-cuff comments on here, but I can now see why some have a bee in their bonnet. 

Bad time to suggest a snowball fight? Ha! Funnily enough, same result. 

Unlovable Parasite Persnickety Antichrist

You know what? We got [HAL 9000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkyrW2NiwM). Fuck it. Why not?Sounds like a helluva plan. Cutting off life support systems might be just a bridge too far for either of us. I think one sacrifice won't hurt. Just one. One. I mean, we really don't want to go full-tilt HAL.

We got it. We got it.Have to say, I take much joy in seeing someone pay it forward in this segment. Well done. I'd contribute, but, alas, the misfortune of being a double amputee. (ツ)



In every iteration! Noun, verb, adjective. It's the one word in the English language that really gives and receives. Did I say I agreed with the typing? For the record, I agree that the UK is more than likely STJ. Agreed in terms of the DM also. 

Four months?😜😜😜😍😘🧐😲🤔😎😎😎Coincidentally, it was not long after [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/b32yfh/itt_we_larp_as_a_different_type/?st=jtgionze&amp;sh=a84b0143) submission. If my suspicion is correct, well played mod/s. Just putting two and two together here, folks. Really?! Not only fascinating but a tad refreshing to hear, considering I've been very skeptical of the ENTP/ILE typing for him for god knows how long now. Any way you slice it, archetype/allegory/allusion falls within the domain of Ni (depending on typological method). I could buy INTP/LII or INTJ/ILI, but Opposing/Control Ni has elicited a few apprehensive head tilts.

Can kind of see it. Then again, I do love the taste of victory when even the most trivial instances arise. Might be getting ahead of myself. Well shit. Now that I've had a chance to reread this while not on an intermittent break, I realize I completely misinterpreted what Beebe relayed to /u/namelessuser, and, yes, I agree with you, ENTPositive. Was convinced of ESFP a while ago, too. 

Apologies. Really jumped the shark here. For some reason I thought NU was using Beebe's assessment of himself as a comparison to how someone might misconstrue typing via Shadow. Fuck me with a chainsaw! Vindicated victory lap revoked. Might need to get back to both you and /u/ruskiix on this one. In the meantime, Danidin did propose that the [Central, Involutionary-Stabilizers]( http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=On_Waves_of_Aging_and_Renewal:_Progress_Orientation_in_Combination_with_Jungian_Aspects), INFJ/INFp/IEI and ISFP/ISFj/ESI, would skew more toward a Beta/Alpha for IEI and Gamma/Delta for ESI as a [hybrid](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;tab=TT&amp;authuser=0&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdanidin.ucoz.net%2Findex%2Fmalye_gruppy%2F0-15) of sorts because of their respective Suggestive/Inferior functions. All of the Stabilizers could be rightfully regarded as "the black sheep" of their own quadra. Either way, if I'm not mistaken, it's the Feeling component in both as downshifters into [The Clock of the Socion](http://www.wikisocion.net/en/index.php?title=The_Clock_of_the_Socion:_Energy_Dynamics_of_Quadra_and_Benefit_Rings) that make their passivity (?), for lack of a better word, a little bit more of an outlier from Beta and Gamma or INTP/INTj/LII and ISTJ/ISTp/SLI as fellow Involutionary-Stabilizers.

That's the long and the short of the theoretical explanation for some of INFJ/INFp/IEI being a little more tempered with their grit and gusto. And thus, we have the reason for the popularity of "seagulling" porn about fifteen years ago. *Bah-dum-dum Tiss!*

Front-end Se should have really taken a moment to evaluate the potential outcome of presenting "Two Girls, One Cup" at a crawfish boil for the shits and gigs factor, too. Poor form, ESFP and ESTP. Poor form. Boomsticks?! Well shit. I want to see how this goes down. Might I add that I am also skilled in MMA, including the secret discipline of Unagi. Little tid-bit, and you should really keep this one under your hat, but the trick to the ancient art of Unagi is channeling your inner duck-billed frogapus. Nobody suspects the covert poison ass spine! Paired with the hoppiness (interpret "hoppiness" as you will), a formidable force! I'll let you in on a little secret. See, if you flair yourself as INTJ you need not concern yourself with being CAPT certified nor have studied at the Jung Institute in Zürich. Hell! You probably don't even need a degree in Psychology. Definitely not arguing with your assessment. The real question here is, hourly wage or salary for a CEO Truckerina? Mileage? 

I CAN SEE THE DREAMS IN YOUR EYES! AND THE RABIES! Clearly.Hm. I swear I'm going to start timing the imminent "screech-factor" on these. Not the scenario I was expecting but there's still time. 

*Doo-dum-dum-dum Kah-tiss. Doo-dum-dum-dum Kah-tiss.*

*All along the watchtower!*Mm. Some serious Puer/Anima problems going on in that one, methinks. (Given dimensionality, he might be INTJ.) Either way, not your burden to bear, thankfully. Another thought occurred to me, pissing in the wind should really be an Olympic event. There's quite a bit of untapped potential on Reddit. 

Nice approach to eight function models. More playful and less clinical which would probably make a smoother transition for some whose curiosity might be piqued. Might I add, by condensing it, you've probably got a better gauge on the audience here. Way to accommodate. Keep it up.No problem. Chuckles abound. I get it.

Goodness. You just summed up the rationalization for injecting some Delta NF blood elsewhere, funnily enough.No ~~puppet~~ Trickster! No ~~puppet~~ Trickster! You're the Trickster!

Let's be honest, though. [A gaggle of TPs, sometimes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGTWmrnPdgk) Just waiting for ENFP's signal since he expressed interest.&gt; This bias runs through all of MBTI, Socionics ...

Er. Why, exactly, are you including Socionics in this assertion?

You do realize that type dispersal among the population is thought to be relatively even when speaking in terms of the general population and by way of gender in Socionics. If you're equating (Ti-Se-Ni-Fe) ISTj/LSI to the banality of the Kiersyian nomenclature, you're gonna have a bad time.ISTP Female - Always Sheik or Samus. This is even back in Game Cube days when it was Zelda/Sheik. (Down time for Smash Brothers between Game Cube and Switch.) What natural vegetation/resources are on said hypothetical island?&gt; mistyped Sensors (SFs, specially)

Hey now. Let's not bring STs into the steaming, shit pile du jour that is cropping up here. Thanks in advance. Reactionary, emotive, accusations? What are you? Some kind of sensor, *especially* SF?A little less than a decade younger than you. Not even remotely attracted to any who can't remember life before internet ubiquity. Something very off-putting about that ilk. I'll take the compliment, but it's dead-air from guys not within the age-range of ~1978 to 1986. 

As an aside: Do you ever get a chuckle about the commentary laid out here on what constitutes the S/N divide? You might dig Strauss-Howe Generational Theory.Half agreeing with you here. "Loops" are internet hearsay. "Grips", a la Naomi Quenk, is just sugar-coating for Anima/us Possession.And yet we both are sporting a flair. Sounds like cherry picking.True, but we're going to call this on a stalemate. More in line with Reinin affording a little more accuracy on this matter. 

You have a good one.I'm really confused as to whether you're being downvoted because people are taking the notion of "God" literally in this context. 

For whatever it's worth, you may want to consider delving into *Man and His Symbols*, *Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious*, and (have yet to jump on the following as of yet) Jung's lectures of *Zarathustra*. 

As a base for this and how it could possibly pertain to Jungian Typology, if you've read *PT* both sensing and intuition are assigned as "irrational". Now, in the case of this quote, there seems to be a little context missing in regards to "instinct" being a matter of the unconscious naturally making headway, as per the healthy course of individuation, or the sensory aspect. Primordial "instinct" is closely pinned to introverted intuition and extroverted sensing. Jung adopted quite a bit from  Bergson and Nietzsche. God/s, all fall under the notion of "will to power" in that "God(s)" residing within the Collective Unconscious are just a wee bit more accessible by an individual's own merit. 

A.) Full context lacking.

B.) No offense and I'm positive some appreciate your effort, but this isn't the best sub to explore Jung in-depth.No problem at all. Thought I'd give you a little boost of sorts. After reading the commentary felt that little nudge to at least say something. 

/r/Jung has quite a bit at their disposal if you need it. Best of luck and hope you get some more engagement.If you're using the concept of Socionics duality, you should acknowledge that  Nietzsche is regarded as EIE/ENFj by Gulenko and Talanov while Jung is stationed at LII/INTp by the same metrics. 

Pedantry, admittedly, but "You're out of your element, Donny."Jee-jumpin'-jillekers! Cannot contain the non-existent excitement about the prospect of a SEE doling out a thorough synopsis on Nietzsche's typing using Model A or G, whose prowess on the matter eclipses both Gulenko and Talanov, while simultaneously beginning the segment with the following:

&gt; I think it's just another one of Jung's rambling quotes that have no meaning.

On pins and needles. Denying the possibility of your Benefactor while claiming you don't understand your semi-dual (as per "your" typings, which are MBTI's). Sorry, bud. I does work like that. You're definitely doing a bang-up job reinforcing the Fi Creative and Ti Vulnerable.Well, that's a lark. Funnily enough, singular adherents of base-line MBTI place me at INTJ more often than not. Isn't that the one you, by convenience of theory-to-theory, salivate over? I mean, if you were adept in any tributary of this study, and the multitude of variables within, both are kin. Then again, INTP is close kin. 

Nice game of "cat and mouse" we had here, though. Your enlightening input by matter of convenience will not be forgotten. [Thank you for your service?](  https://media.giphy.com/media/yx3rBYngohzUI/giphy.gif)I think you're channeling, "Do unto others as you would have done unto you." Yes, something to abide by regardless.Don't forget the perimeter! If some sneaky, little fucker causally cruises in and tries to be nonchalant about ever so slightly hiking their leg, you yell, "MY REALM! My realm, damn it!"What kind of "sticky" are we talkin' 'bout here? Three. Count it, three stickies. One request will not be indulged, if precedent means anything. The second, hm...Pass to the right, please and thank you? Third, considering the denizens, hard "No!" and three steps back.So very true.Your best bet is to actually read Naomi Quenk's *Was That Really Me?* rather than fielding from here. It can be tangentially associated with with the Jungian concept of Anima/us Possession at its worst. 

Hope that helps.You know, at first glance, the angle of the grasp makes it looks as though the INXJ is helping himself to quite a delicious snack while the ISTP looks on in horror at the sight of someone devouring the book. Just throwing that out there.

Damn it, INXJs. You barbarians!Have a sausagey German Shepherd, who, despite her age is still my running buddy, and three quail. Should be four, but I have no idea where the dad went.

When I was still living in a rural area I fostered horses, raised a fawn (released), my poor-departed fifteen-year-old cat, and had a random, asshole rooster that just showed up out of the blue one day.Can get behind this! Also, did you know in some states you can raise zebra and ibexes? I'll settle for a peacock and peahen, though.Ah. So, this was an exchange between you and an INTP. You also saw fit to publicly parade this singular interaction on here to accomplish what exactly? Clearly the paragon of maturity.

So what's the plan? Draw and quartering? Ready the pitchforks, ladies and gents!If raccoons can fit into crevices measuring 4" and the human anus can be stretched to a maximum of about 6", poke an angry raccoon with a stick? Yay or nay?Well, every person should go through states of metamorphosis. To stay in a state of stagnation would be indicative of ego-inflation or a maladaptive Puer/ella  in Jungian terms. 

What's this "100 mark" business? Are you referring to Jung's concept of the "transcendent"?

Edit: I would direct you to /r/Jung, but given this query revolves around INFJ, exclusively, it might not be well-received. The more you read Jung, the less type matters.Oh, shitfire. Noticed you put this in the +30 sub, too. That might have been a better avenue. Need to jump off, but that would probably be the best option for an in-depth continuation. 

Need to get back to you in a few, if not tomorrow.Going to reserve my opinion on the matter of the initial query. Your contribution reminded me of some experiences of buddies and acquaintances, as uncomfortable as that retroactive rapid recall as it was.

Just going to add a little more in the same vein for those who see fit to peruse:

Oh boy. Why is it always internet INTJs banging on about eugenics? DQ right there.The implication that INTP would follow them, given Fe (even at a minimal stage, since we're talking MBTI exclusively here) might be an overlooked wrench in the spokes as to OP's plan, also. I just find it funny that those who bleat on about eugenics online are usually the ones who wouldn't be able to run that gauntlet, and dictate the barometer that might very well be from a Fi angle, which is why I added the blurb about the stringent conditions that are a prerequisite for NASA, or probably any space program. Comme ci, comme ca. Glad you spoke up, though. 

&gt; Then again, the real INTJs I've met have been grumpy and overly perfectionist, but they've never promoted eugenics. So who knows?

No problem. Same experience on a face-to-face level in terms of INTJs. The juxtaposition of this kind of commentary with actual interface is bizarre. To be fair, and taking into consideration the rest of the commentary, OP might be young, or...As a dog, I'm really not too keen on the fact that the cat is not in his usual sunspot. I mean, he could be *anywhere* in this house! Oh god! I'm going to get ambushed! Alright, sneak slowly and quietly in open areas, and dash past any surface above head level.

Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!In terms of Jungian archetypes, the female counterpart of the "Wise Old Man", or Senex, is the Crone.Hm. I see you're familiar with this scenario also. ISTP moseys over and busies self with specs for project currently underway or forthcoming while half-assedly listening for the relevant information.Which one(s) proposed the ["pastrami, banana bread, cottage cheese sandwich"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJQ4nt0JZ_E) (0:45-1:05) of an idea(s)? I have my guesses.I don't know. Call me a cynic, but from the looks of prolific youtube self-appointed "gurus", we might have already crossed that bridge.Oh man. I was wondering how that went. As to be expected, I suppose. As an aside, don't you love it when the "go-to" typing for an ISTP who can string cohesive sentences together is INTJ in some circles? 

Had to quell the nudge to snigger a bit and chew my arm off at the thought of what might arise. At least you and your ENFJ buddy had fun(?).[Egads!](https://gifer.com/en/kL). Great Jung, Campbell, Edinger, Hollis, Beebe, et. al.! Familiarity and frivolity via aforementioned forays even! All my gasps. We can't be Reddit buddies anymore. 

Preemptively going circumvent assumptions by the peanut gallery. He knows I'm joking.Just to get a gauge of how to approach, are you already familiar with Model A in Socionics? It would be easier to explain and make it palatable if you already have a foundation in Socionics. 

For future reference, posting here won't be effective. r/Socionics or r/JungianTypology would be the better choice for these queries.

I'm inI have friends on /r/MBTI 

(Just saying it happens)Both.Personally, I'm an ISTP and I don't particularly enjoy playing or watching sports.Social extroversion isn't the same as having an extraverted dominant function. You can be an ENFJ and still be socially introverted.You have four functions. Two introverted functions, and two extraverted functions. The function that is the most prominent in your personality is your dominant function. If your dominant function is extraverted, you will have an E at the front of your MBTI type. If your dominant function is introverted, you will have an I at the front of your MBTI type.Yes.There are actually a crapton of usI like solving problems and trying new things too. I also like doing hands-on stuff. Too bad these things have little to do with cognitive functions ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Nice intuitive-bashing sidebar. Maybe I'll participate in your subreddit when it starts holding itself to a higher standard.Most glaring to me were the posts picking apart INTJs and INFPs. I get that there's an intuitive bias here sometimes, but making fun of intuitives in retaliation is unnecessary and immature, in my opinion. If I were to join a sensor subreddit, I'd want it to be focused on sensor-related discussion, not complaints about intuitives. Nope&gt;better at math 

Speak for yourself!I'm not an SJ. Functions have nothing to do with skills. Just preferences.Typical troll. I'm done with this conversation.Live in the moment. Enjoy the small things. Try to appreciate the details and nuances of your surroundings and the things you experience with your senses. Don't worry about things you have no control over. Try all the weird stuff you've always secretly wanted to try, even if it scares you a little. When you get an impulse to try a new thing, do it. Let the adventurous part of your brain have its way sometimes. That's mostly what I'd call Se philosophy, I guess. To develop Se, practice awareness of your surroundings and experiences, and experience lots of things.

Above all, trust your own senses. The brain can sometimes rationalize away things that it doesn't want to see, or see nonexistent things if it really wants to see them. Your senses, however, are totally objective, and knowing when to listen to them without letting your brain get in the way is a valuable way to use Se. As much as I hate for this to become a wall of text, I find that this story is relevant: 

&gt;“On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like,' he asked of me. 


&gt;“And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword.” 


&gt;Arya screwed up her face. “I don’t understand.” 


&gt;Syrio clicked his teeth together. “The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?” 


&gt;Arya thought about it. “You saw what was there.” 


&gt;“Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.” 


&gt;― George R. R. Martin, A Game of Thrones
Because you're describing types based on letters and not functions. Oversimplifying stuff to the point of being incorrect. Disclaimer: I'm not one of the ones who downvoted you.ISTP - aerospace engineeringSorry, but NLP has been widely discredited and there's no evidence of it being valid. Confirmation bias is easy to fall into. (Yes, I know MBTI isn't scientific either, but at least we're all up front about that.)*thank you*&gt; istp would would find an answer initially and be happy.  

More like, ISTP would find questions initially, then seek to boil everything down to an answer, and then once the ISTP has a logical answer, then they would be happy.

I don't think anybody here actually thinks it's scientific. It's just for funsies.They're okay I guess
On a general, "purpose of life" level, the things I've done my life and the fun I've had, and the thought that i could have more. 

On a daily level, life is fun. Being an adult is challenging and exciting. Do something else right now. You have interest in real, tangible things that could transform into actual professions. Trade school to be a mechanic or an MMA trainer are real things you can do. Why the hell are you digging yourself into a hole doing something you don't want to do? ISTP as well. I have an extremely hard time making it clear when I'm making a subtle joke as opposed to a serious comment. It's actually really, really annoying. Most people think I'm an asshole when I'm just trying to be funny. ISTP. I'm pretty concerned about international relations as I am interested in living abroad. Other than that I don't care, it's not like Trump will be allowed to do even a small part of everything he wants or says he will do. Overall I find the whole situation rather comical. being an istp is the shit. infj is the only other type that seems interesting to me from a typology standpoint. infj is the only type i think sounds as cool as istp. esfp is also a pretty interesting type but i wouldnt want to be one. Nerds I guess? I was homeschooled so my social circles were limited. I tried to make an effort to talk to everyone though, I didn't like the 'us vs them' notion many people encourage when they associated with a group. That effort I made has helped me a lot in life. ISTP and I jungle/top. 

Intj friend plays adc. 

Estp friend jungles but doesn't mid. 

This is surprisingly accurate. I would try dating another ISTP but I would have low expectations. For one day I'd be an ENFJ. If it was permanent I wouldn't change.   If you can separate his politics from his science, he’s much more usefulHis YouTube lectures are the real meat of his content. Maps of meaning and the Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories are two lecture series that are much more psychological than your average newsbite of him. If he didn’t voluntarily offer his political opinions, I would agree with you 
**extraversionas an enneagram 5w6, i appear extroverted in social situations because i am a "fear" type. My anxiety causes me to speak abnormally, louder, or talk about unusual topics. Then i tire myself out and go hide and play video games for hours. 

social anxiety is not a thing, its a blanket term to describe a number of issues a person is dealing with .. much like how people abuse the term OCD. real OCD is when you touch a doorknob 100 times to prevent the demons from murdering your family. Real soical anxiety is when you are legitimately afraid of people or social situations. Some people are just introverted and awkward and that compounds feelings of shame or fears of not being liked by others, which is not a severe condition such as agoraphobia or something.

You are probably just a really introverted person with issues around people. once you resolve those issues with people, you will find yourself much more comfortable in strange social situations and your need to introvert is not so strong. its taken me a long time to figure that out.

exactly.ISTP ... wouldn't mind being INTPenneagram 4 tends to be INFP or INFJ. ISTP. i feel nothing.yeah, i find that about half of all 4s i meet are extaverted.being an S i often can't

&gt;S, They focus on what is immediate, practical and realbeing ISTP, and enneagram 5w6, its no wonder i don't have emotions.S means that its less about the big picture, and more about the immeadiate world. its why many detail or analytical people aren't Ns


F means that you make decisions subjectively instead of objectively, so an F would be more tuned into people around them.


J is just about how open or closed you are. Js usually are more rigid, so not sure how that works.  I feel like Ps would be more out there.


EDIT: why am i being downvoted.
agreed.I am an ISTP 5w6 and my wife is an ENFP 7w8hillary is clearly an introvert.do you see her in public? shes not an extrovert.im a regular poster on /r/enneagram and i get my ass handed to me for saying water is wet. sorry. have an upvote.a lot of people don't know or completely understand MBTII took the exam, 63% ISTP. everything else was under 20 or less %. 

I already knew i was an ISTP. great job.ISTPwe lack the ability to understand the more obvious things sometimes though. i pretty much don't get a lot of jokes until someone explains it to me later lol.agreed. as an ISTP i find myself tinkering alone a lot, my thoughts are more important than my actions.  I bet a lot of ISTPs are mechanics or people of a specialized carpentry trade.  1) What is your MBTI type?** ISTP

2) What is your gender?** Male

3) What type(s) do you admire/respect the most? (Why?)** I think I like ENTJs because of their decisiveness, leadership, but its hard because they are rough to begin with.

4) What type(s) do you Love/adore?** For the most part ENFP

5) What type(s) are the most dateable?** ENFP, not interested in INFJ 

6) What type(s) would you be willing/want to marry?** Married an ENFP

7) What type(s) make wonderful friends?** I have a lot of ENTP 7w8 friends. 

8) What type(s) make you LAUGH?** ESTP

9) What type(s) are you uncomfortable around or are hard to be congenial with?** I feel uncomfortable around MOST who have xxFJ

10) What type(s) can you not stand/dislike/respect?** If I had to choose one it would be INFJ
are you an extrovert?stephen colbert strikes me as an ENTP. people often confuse me for extroversion, but being a 5w6, my disintegration to 7 and integration to 8 are often "high strung" so it appears im outward or extroverted. i am at peace in a reclusive place. I watched the martian with Matt Damon, and I really wanted to be him in that movie in some sick crazy way. trekking the mars planet, playing MacGyver, and figuring out problems or tinkering with machines while completely alone fascinated me.

MBTI enneagram 5s are mostly if not all INTJs, ISTPs. very rarely are they ENTP.

you just described an introvert. are you sure?

https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personalityCommon enneagram type for ENTP is 7. Very interesting I'm the only ISTP friend of anyone I know. love makes me uncomfortable. i have love for people sometimes, but expressing it correctly is hard.I show love by doing things for someone. I will pay attention to details and try to involve something they like to do in a date or build them a chair or something lol. On a normal day I am more aloof and in my head, I find it hard to be intimate with my partners because I am too busy thinking or tinkering with some project. It gives me anxiety because I feel like their attention takes away from what I'm thinking about or doing, so they don't always get my full attention. https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality

i really love the way this is written, it definitely describes me.that could just mean that he didn't want to use the fire extinguisher. that has nothing to do with being an extrovert.there is too many intuitive details in your description. ISTPs like me are often cold (T), head types. i need to calculate what im doing first, i often do NOT think well on my feet unless i really understand what im doing. the scatter brain thing is normal, it comes from having a strong (P). ISTPs are notorious for being more closed off, but I don't know if thats also a thing for INTPs. Introverts like me do like some people time, but it is much LESS than extroverts.  I think i would lean more INTP. 

He sounds like an Enneagram 5.agreedINFP? 

&gt;I feel very overwhelmed about committing to things

P. you don't like change because it causes you to have to make decisions.

&gt;I am very emotional and love deep conversations and intimate relationships. I like finding one person I can go on adventures with and break a few rules

very 4ish. this would be a sign of being an Intimate subtype in the enneagram. Intimate 4s are very emotional and clingy to their partners. they over romanticize their relationships.

&gt;Sometimes I feel like I’m very unoriginal, even though to a lot of people I come across as very unusual.

very 4ish again. is it a matter of being AFRAID of being unoriginal or do you WANT to be unoriginal?


by reading this i would say you might be a 4. there is some kind of urgency in this that could indicate 6, but for the sake of this conversation, i still stand by INFP
im an ISTP, im a little high strung. I come across an extroverted to some people, but its really anxiety and projection. im terrible when it comes to procrastinating. 
i think i am most passionate about figuring out how things work. my focus changes a lot, but when it lands on something that intrigues me, its almost obsessive that i understand and dissect that thing.  im an architect in real life, so im the guy who can draw a complicated building detail after spending unheard of amounts of time learning about it.absolutely.ISTP clearlyas an istp i feel that i may not always follow through with analysis, even though it becomes a place of extreme focus.i can relate to some of this, but let me make a few comments:

&gt;He's also very approachable to new people, especially if he gets good vibes from them

only if i am introduced and with other people maybe. 

&gt;He's not about to wrestle the new guy down

ISTPs usually aren't 'bros', the dominance thing i feel like comes from ENTx

&gt;With girls he doesn't know he is kind, holds door open, but doesn't talk to them really

i have no feelings, so i often get criticized for only thinking about myself and NOT doing things like this.

&gt;Doesn't care what they think, will roll eyes visibly, will do the closest thing to telling them off. Does things they hate. Blares music they don't like/heavy metal because "they're a bunch of..." Well u get the point. My enfj self is running around trying to do damage control :) haha

ISTPs don't normally go out of our way to annoy someone out of spite. i can get into a spirited debate, but it comes from a place of knowledge, and i will often just leave and do whatever i want, not be vindictive.

&gt;He will build things, read, play video games, and after a few days of hanging out with people he does like down time or time with himself or just me

ISTPs are more like mechanics, or master carpenters ... ISFPs are more like campers, artists ect. 

this person doesn't strike me as a typical ISTP, maybe they are something else.Well I don't. i think an istp food would be something you have to put together. maybe traditional korean? all those bowls of stuff you don't know but you must try to figure out what they are?Why?I don't understand how those things have anything to do with being an ISTP Estps can be more outwardly harsh, but the ISTP can usually add the cold shoulder to the equation ... &gt; S's tend to be more practical thinkers (notice I said "tend") which is often more useful because it involves actual real-world applications, which can be implemented in the here-and-now.

100% agree with that. I only live in the here and now. my ENFP wife can't.How do you even confuse those two types????Flair in the sub settings.&gt;ESTP 7w8 are more introverted and awkward but generally confident.

Says who?????? They might be louder and more confident than an 8 but with a reckless curiosity. i believe that onmivert just describes the gray area near center-ism of introvert extrovert. 7s are extroverts, basically always. you even say so a number of times in this post describing yourself. also, this post is terrible to read without proper formatting.i enjoyed this very much.&gt;ISTP Enneagram 7.

no.Introverts and extroverts are just different ways someone recharges their batteries, or how they express themselves. I'm a pretty big introvert but going to an office job and having an extroverted wife makes me have to "act" a lot. I prefer to be alone. I do not get energy from other people or crowded places. I usually speak less than most around me. Give me a few beers or when I'm anxious enough, I can start to vocalize more of my internal thoughts. 

Probably one of the better descriptions hereyikes.&gt;Hey all, I am an ISTP that isn’t in love with mechanics or engineering. In fact, I really enjoy learning about business and sciences instead. 

istps want to learn about how things work, and a mechanic is just a practical tangible example of that. ISTP - yoga instructor.

Omg such a waste of time, I don’t understand why or what. No one cares about the technical muscle or body movement science but the “feel good” aspect. Give me a good science magazine any day.46% ISTP, i bet i could have answered other questions better, but i got the result i was supposed to.&gt;However he was always wanting me to stay the night, blowing off other plans to hang out with me, and even told me to leave stuff at his place to make spending the night at his more convenient (though I didn't do that).

uh, are you sure his an ISTP? when i met my wife, she being a ENFP struggled to keep my attention, and i resisted and resisted moving in with her. I always needed my space, so i can work on my projects and think alone.

are you sure he isn't more like an ISFP?Enneagram 8 is what we consider the most dominate of the types in terms of aggression and control. Obviously a person with a different ego (type) my perceive an 8 differently than another type would. Stop.Enneagram types can share MBTI types.  You can have an ISTJ 1 and an ISTJ 5. As a primary enneagram follower, i believe the different flavors of each enneagram type correlate to MBTI types.I’m a 5 ISTP NASA employs hundreds if not thousands of ISTP 5ssometimes people want to be what they want to be, regardless of truth.Bingo. People always like my honest, no bullshit, frank personality. It’s refreshing I guess since the world is full of people who prop up images of thrmselves Duuude. That’s so true. Me for example, I’ll check the non working blinker in the car. 2 am rolls around and I’m trying to find my breaker bar so I can remove the rusty bolt on the shock absorbers...My wife is an ENFP 7Plenty of 4s are extrovertsIs it the mechanical problem solving part or the distant and abrasive part?

SpatialObligatory self-deprecating commentHoly shit, is that really all attributed to inferior Si nutchecking NeTi??Holy shit THANK YOU this is fucking excellentYeah thank God I wasn't the only one who thought that was inhumane​. Jesus, OP. good protein for chadsNot necessarily. But it might be an Ne thing to see unintentional references to other shows or works while watching them and then wanting to end up watching a lot more than what's healthy for a certain period of time. 

Virtually any type can have a list of things they can but won't complete. What makes Ne stereotypically indecisive is its characteristic of making one enjoy the exploratory process. It is more likely to explore areas/systems that have no conceivable end to their possibilities. In this regard it is very much like Se (exploratory, experimental), only Ne is focused less on practical implementation than it is on generating new ideas it has not picked up before. It is more about permutation and novelty than intensity and directness, which can cause it to continue exploring without really sticking to one thing. This behavior is exhibited mostly in Ne doms. Being able to ground this habit requires planned introverted judgement and developing introverted perception when one needs to. Ideally users of Ne want to get involved in a longterm activity that can bring them new permutations of possibilities to satisfy the entire Ne-Si axis, and not just Ne. Si sees the splash and compares it to other splashes it has seen. It is probably more aware of what caused the splash than the rest. It stores this splash along with the rest of the splashes knowing what objects have constituted what splashes.

Se will be compelled to create a splash of their own. Maybe they can make a greater splash, maybe they want to use the rock for rock skipping as they pick it. Something is definitely happening to that water. This is long-winded I know, but newcomers should be able to see this so that they can apply the framework to other types and learn more about function dynamics that way. 

Yeah that sounds right. 

The first two functions are the points of two groups of coupled functions called axes that are prioritized in the psyche. The last two are the less-prioritized and tend to come out under cognitive stress.

For example. INFPs have the function axes Te-Fi, and Si-Ne. Te can't exist without Fi, and Fi without Te. The same goes for Ne and Si. 

In the INFP Fi comes as dominant, meaning that the Te end of the polarity will be the least focused on, due to there being a cognitive preference of Fi most of the time. Ne is their second, but since it is in the front lines less than Fi, its application isn't as crucial. Therefore Si--Ne's direct polar end--still gets some air time, especially relative to Te, since Fi is so dominating compared to Ne.

This means that the order of the functions from strongest to weakest is Fi, Ne, Si, Te. SiTe are the lower stack.

But at the end of the day it is FiNe vs. SiTe. A stressed-out INFP will act like an ESTJ who is misapplying sensory details to achieve grounding on a dissonant and unclear framework;may steamroll people to avoid repeating past failures. Likewise, a stressed out ESTJ will manifest as an INFP who hasn't processed their most personal values and will begin to perceive their unprocessed resolution in different areas;imagining worst case scenarios.

Though both types that have matured enough should be able to balance their usage of all of their functions throughout their lives, the misapplication of their lower stack will mark the beginning of that process. It's part of the individuation of the psyche, which is the healthy integration of the self into society. That's the goal of balance between the functions. Do you have any links on the brodmann area 37 bit? Is that Dario Nardi's work or something? It sounds interesting.I'll often find myself dropping my guard around ISFJs over any other type out there. They just seem so, well-meaning--probably not even intentionally. I would disagree with people on INFJs. While they can seem calm, they often have a slight visible aloofness about them, whereas the Si can bring an attentive interaction as well as an attention to itself which is more assuring than Ni naturally is when slouching over a daydream. This is my experience.

I guess when I actually need someone to talk to INFJs win me over, big time. It's those shared axes that do it for me.I'm right there with you. PeTi, TiPe, underrepresented Fe--you know the drill. LmaoThis is a good one for starters:

I'm an ISTP and my dream job is to have a self-sustaining farm. I could sell meat or potatoes or some shit to pay the electric bills. I think I might actually do it some day.It seems like a lot of ENFJs are teachers, most of the ones that I've met have been. I've been wanting to find an ENFJ because I want to find out if dual relationships really work, so maybe I should look for teachers heheI know it's been almost two weeks, but I'll respond anyways. I've been really busy. I think that I have the opposite problem of you, because I always take the easy way and say fuck it whenever I get too much on my mind. I think that the way I use Ni is that I oversimplify everything and do everything I can to minimize responsibilities and obligations so that I can live like a heathen all the time, which obviously comes with some problems as well. I often try to brute force my way through problems because I really don't want to plan things out too much and get stressed out. Maybe you need to reconsider what is really important to you and what you can live without so that you can give up some projects and get some stress off your mind. I think that that will make it easier for you to be more present. I think that a lot of problems that Ni doms have stem from the fact that they overcomplicate things a bit and get stressed out over unessential things.Yeah I agree that SPs and NJs make great pairs, but I'm a bit confused by the socionics description of this. The way they explain it, ISTjs are these organized upstanding citizens and ENFJs are sort of chaotic loonies that want people to explain everything to them, but when you look at the MBTI ideas of how they are, the ISTP is the type that is disorganized and sort of dumb and the ENFJ are these charismatic superleaders with an intuitive understanding of things. I really like some of the socionics stuff, but I disagree with a lot that they have to say about ISTjs. I like order and rules and things like that, but on the outside I really am a sort of laid back and chaotic person. I think that socionics gives an explanation of Ti that fits better with the MBTI idea of Te. What I'm trying to say is that I think that there's truth to both systems, but I'm trying to figure out how it really is. A bit of a tangent, but still&gt; K: ISTP 

How exactly?Damn right it is! Come at me brotherMy one weakness... You will have to find me firstI don't know how to flirt. I guess I would pick a type that I can be straight forward with.... ESFPs are pretty fun in general and easy to talk to, maybe an ESTP but that would be scaryYeah, I'm an ISTP and I'm happy with my type as well. It's a shame to see that so many people dream about being somebody else. I wonder if they actually want to be different for real, or if they are just sort of day dreaming about it without considering the consequences. You wish you were an ISTJ? Ok, so you'd like to do paper work all day and be responsible? No? Well, I guess you don't want to be an ISTJ then. If I had to choose any other type, I'd choose ESTP, but I'd spend more time alone until I'm practically back to ISTP again.ISTP: 
"The map is not the territory."

"What I call the void is where nothing exists. It is about things outside man's knowledge. Of course the void does not exist. By knowing what exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void."

"I have nothing to ask but that you would remove to the other side, that you may not, by intercepting the sunshine, take from me what you cannot give."

"The cockroaches always scatter when you turn on the lights."Yeah, I agree, it's more relevant now than ever. We live in a degenerated civilization where psychopaths are protected by the government, and where immoral behavior is justified by arbitrary laws, but when you call these people out on their bullshit, they're not so scary anymore. ISTP: I often take dangerous risks. Sometimes it's because I'm trying to take some sort of shortcut, other times I'm bored and I just want to feel like something is happening. I feel really good about myself when I take a risk that no one else dares to take and I end up succeeding. Also I'm like the coolest guy ever, that's an accurate stereotypeI really don't have any tactics at all when it comes to fighting, I just make sure to punch first and not let the other guy stand up again. Most of the times I've been the one who got beaten up though. I always wanted to do martial arts, but I never got around to it. I did some tae kwondo a long time ago but that was really lame / ISTPI prefer the quadra system. I feel as if finding out what quadra you belong to is a bigger deal than knowing your type. Ofcourse knowing your type will imply what quadra you belong to, but I think that having a good understanding of the quadras and where you fit in says more about you than your type. The types are very limiting, and I feel as if they make it hard for people to develop beyond their comfort zone. Using just your two first functions is like being half a human, I don't even think it's natural. Sometimes I wanna work on my third and fourth ones, but I'm pretty sure that I'll always dislike the functions outside my quadra, so that's why I think that knowing your quadra is the most important thing. It's also really mind blowing when you really get it. Sometimes I can't tell if a person is an NTP or an SFJ, because I just see the quadra characteristics. Yeah, I think you're right, I've thought about this as well. Another thing that comes to mind is how sci fi wrighters "predict" how the world is going to change, and then all the nerds become scientists and make it their life mission to make the thing from the movie. It's not a coincidence that people started working on the hover board from back to the future right about the time when the movie took place. I think that this is basically what Ni people are doing, it's a clever and discrete way of getting what you want. But obviously in every day scenarios it's going to play out more like "This is how our company is going to develop in the future... according to the numbers, I guess" or "No, don't hit on me, I'm totally not secretly in love with you"I like to pick human and pretend like everyone else is weird and I'm the only normal person leftThat's one way of putting it, I think that NJs go with the flow and are more accepting of global trends, which means that they are going to be on the winning team. Take someone like Ray Kurzweil, he has made insanely accurate predictions about advancements in things like robotics and AI, but automatization has been on the global agenda since the industrial revolution, so the world is working in his favor in a sense. He is looking very far into the future, but thats partly because of the fact he's working in a very standardized and predictable field. SPs on the other hand have their own agenda, and are more prone to go against the current. We will aggressively enforce our own agenda, but when the world at large is going in another direction it's hard to predict what's going to happen. ENTJs are also aggressive, but even if you are a CEO of a large company you're still working with the big guys in a sense. Compare that to an ESTP entrepeneur who is just trying to make a living selling used cars. This is not necessarily true according to the official MBTI theory or anything, it's just my take on itwe can have a long distance relationship&gt; Upvote explanations of Fi written by actual Fi users. 

No, upvote *valid* explanations of Fi, regardless of who makes them. Fi is a clearly defined term, you don't need first hand experience in order to explain it. But I do think it's good that Fi users like you bring this up, because Fi has gotten a lot of shit that it doesn't deserve, and Fi users obviously have a natural understanding of the function, so in that sense I agree that they are better at explaining it. I just wanted to add that an argument should stand for itself. Leaving the explanation of Fi to Fi users would be an ad hominem attack against everone else.You're gonna give ISTP pink? ;( I will agree with it just because it makes a whole lot of sense to group the quadras together with different shades of the same color. This means that you can actually infer what type of person someone is from just from catching a glimpse of their flair, not only what quadra but also if he's an IP, IJ, EP or EJ, brilliant. The flairs we have now are completely arbitrary, and I have to memorize what color each type has. Also, I would like to get back the ability to make custom flairs.Salmon is a fish as far as I'm concernedWell, it's about as girly as it gets and I really don't like it, but at the same time I couldn't care less what color I have, I just want the flairs to make some degree of sense. I'm actually a bit frustrated by the flairs we have now, because some mod just took the liberty to decide what color each type should have without talking to the community about it, the colors are ugly as hell, and I don't see why people shouldn't still be able to make custom flairs. It also really surprises me that so many people in this thread are against the quadra grouping, it doesn't matter if it's a socionics concept because it's still true. You forgot the part where the ISTP goes full blown Rambo mode and takes down the other quadras single-handedly and everyone loves me because I saved the dayMy best explanation of it is that you detach yourself one step back from a situation by labeling things, reaching a conclusion about the relationship between the labels, then applying the conclusion to the actual things that you labeled.

**Example:** I am feeling *frustrated* by this person because he *interrupted* me when I was speaking. Being *interrupted* makes me feel *frustrated* because it's *disrespectful* and I feel *ignored*. It's *disrespectful* to *interrupt* because you are treating the other person as if he is *inferior* to you, and being *interrupted* makes me feel *ignored* because he is not showing any *interrest* in hearing the rest of my sentence. Conclusion: this person is treating me as if I'm *inferior* to him and he's not *interested* to hear what I have to say. I *dislike* this because I'm not *inferior* to him, and I want people to be *interested* in what I have to say. I will *stay away* from this person, because I *dislike* him.

By the time I've labeled everything and made up my mind about the person, the feelings of anger and frustration have worn off, that's why I don't show much emotion. The act of labeling things has a calming effect in and of itself, because you gain control over the situation. I don't yell at him, I just avoid him, because that's the easiest solution to the situation. But to be fair, there have been times when I've made a scene and told people to "shut the fuck up when I'm talking" because of all the built up anger, but mostly I'm able to deal with things rationally.I forced my friend to take an online mbti test and he got INTJ as I suspected, he was really skeptical about it and wanted to change the subject because it is pseudo science, to which I replied that it is very typical for INTJs to dislike pseudo science. It's a bit ironic, but what you describe here is how INTJs tend to react to the mbti. Just take it for what it is, it's pseudo science, and you shouldn't take it too seriously, but I promise you that it's really helpful for understanding people and there definitely is something to it if you think about it for a while.That's good to hear that I gave an accurate explanationThanks, I'm glad I could illuminate you. I think this applies to Te as well, only it's more concerned with the application and planning out than it is with analyzing the reasons behind itNo it doesn't, just by saying to myself "I am feeling frustrated" I am having a detached perspective, because I'm analyzing my own emotional state and thereby removing myself one step away from it. I'm making myself an object. The *involved* perspective, or whatever you wanna call the opposite of detached, would be the act of actually feeling the frustration. And whenever I mention disliking something, I'm also referring to a rational principle, e.g. "being interrupted makes me frustrated **because** interrupting is disrespectful." 

Also, "I" *is* the detached pronoun because it's the subject of a sentence, if I was a feeler I would be more likely to use "me". "This is making me feel frustrated". Besides, you're missing the point and arguing about semantics which is pointless. Everyone has feelings and I don't have to write like a computer just because I'm representing Ti.Yes, I would argue that interrupting is disrespectful by definition, and that my frustration is justified by the fact that being treated with disrespect is an offence against me.  I believe in objective morality, so the way I see it I'm not just reacting irrationally, I'm feeling righteous anger by referrencing a moral standard. It seems like you think that you have to be impartial in order to be detached and I don't think that's a necessary condition. By following a standard I'm detaching from my feelings. Sometimes I have to ignore my feelings because they are irrational, but sometimes they are justified. But I guess that being completely impartial is a higher level of detachment, depending on your definition, so in that sense you have a point. What I wanted to convey with my comment is just that I am choosing to analyze my feelings and thinking about the concepts of frustration and disrespect instead of just reacting, and in that sense I'm detached. But I am biased, so yeah I'm not completely detached from myselfHaha sorry for putting you on the spot! Don't be embarrassed, I'm impressed that you're able to type people via text only at all. I wouldn't be able to do that. And I might not have given a completely accurate description of myself, and what I write is all that you can go by. But yeah I'm pretty sure I'm an ISTP so you can keep your mental model ;P really thought provoking thoughYeah it's like when people call ISTPs sociopaths, and even worse, when ISTPs seem to be proud to have "no feelings". It's absolute horseshit, no other ISTPs I know in real life are like that. It's a mental disorder not a personality trait lolYeah, I'm definitely not emotionally needy, I actually go out of my way not to burden other people with my own emotional problems because I really don't feel like I need to. And I think that's the thing, I do have emotions, I've just made it a habit to keep them to myself. I still understand boundaries and right and wrong, probably more so than most people. Often when I have this cold mindset it's because I'm trying to rise above a situation or to avoid sending off the wrong signals. If I don't know how to react I can just not react at all, that way no one gets upset. Wow you did it, you made an edgy joke on the internet. What are you, twelve? All right, anything comes to mind?Yeah I got that, don't worry about itAnd apparently you like to turn serious reddit posts into jokes in your spare time because you have nothing better to doWow that's horrible and dangerous. What if someone has had an emergency or is about to give birth and is rushing to the hospitalThe video is not available to me for some reasonYeah I get that, it's just that when I personally say things bluntly or criticize people it's because it needs to be said and I'm actually trying to do the right thing, I'm not intentionally being cruel just for the sake of itYeah that's pretty creepy, and I can see how that would be really annoying. How old is he? Maybe he's a bit under developedHaha I'll have to check that outDon't just say whatever comes to your mind like a cave man, if you want to talk down on me tell me exactly why I'm dumb, you're not exactly convincingHahaI don't see how I'm the asshole here, I'm calling people out on trolling me and turning the post into a joke. Hey thanks for answering the question and not turning this post into a sarcastic ISTPenis memefest. I guess if you define being an asshole as someone who offends other people then I'm an asshole. But I'm not deliberately trying to be cruel, it's just that someone has to rise above the politically correct spinelessness and face the hard truths sometimes, and I dislike the idea that I'm just hurting people because I'm bored or whatever, I see myself more like  martyrI'm sorry to hear that. I can get a bit carried away as well sometimes, and that is a good example of how we can be assholesAll right, I interpreted it as being directed towards me. I should've chosen a better titleYeah, I'm not exactly getting along with them haha, which you would think that I would if I was the same type as them. I think this sort of sarcastic troll humor is really lame actually. I've identified as an ISTP for so long, and if that's not the case then I'm clueless honestly, but as far as I know that's what I amWell, it sure seems like that's what people are thinking here. I'll have to reflect on this a bit, people are saying that I'm probably not even an ISTP, so maybe I have the wrong idea about what they are like as wellMaybe, I'm starting to doubt whether I have the right idea about what ISTPs are likeThank you for being sincere, I appreciate it. I get what you're saying, and I understand how that can come off as rude. The ISTPs I know, specifically that I work with, usually just work really hard and keep to themselves, and sometimes they can even be really kind by not "stepping on any toes", and I guess this is a sort of tactic to not having to deal with drama. That's how I alsways saw Fe in me, I ise it to smoothe social situations out. But obviously there are times when I don't. That's good to hear that you think I'm well-rounded, because most people here seem to disagree haha... I guess I didn't really utilize Fe that well in this postI can relate to that mindset. I'm by no means kind and helpful all the time, but I'm always striving to do the right thing. I've done things like that were I help people without taking credit for it, and it feels like taking full credit for it would negate the good deed, because then it's more like a deal than a favour. I should probably express myself more to avoid being abusive like this. But sometimes I'm convinced that I have to just get to the point even though it offends people, because if I constantly make sure to not upset anyone I won't get anywhereDo ISFJs do things like that? I've never been talked down upon by an ISFJI used to be really certain, but the fact that I don't seem to get along with them now and that I don't appreciate their sense of humor makes me question it. Also, other people have also questioned my type here. I guess I will have to reconsider itWhat I meant is that politically correct people don't always tell the truth because they're affraid to offend people, and that I choose to speak my mind even though it might be offensive and then people think I'm an asshole. For example, I was talking with my friend about sweat shops in China. He talked about how horrible it is that they get paid so little, and I responded by saying that they pay the workers so little money because that's the only way that the companies can compete on the market. It sounds pretty cold, but that's how capitalism works, even though it's very unfortunateYeah I guess being indifferent and not caring can be rude in some situations. No, I got what you meant heheAll right, maybe you have a point, other people seem to question whether I'm an ISTP as well. What makes you think I'm an ISFJ?I think I did acknwoledge that it's unfortunate, but just by giving a reason for something people will assume that I'm justifying it, which I guess I do on a rational level, but I still have ethical reasons for why it's wrong. It's just that the whole political and economical system that we live in today makes it so that things like sweat shops in China are happening. What I'm saying is just that, based on the way capitalism works, sweat shops are justified on a rational level, because it's effective, and if one company does it then all other companies have to do it as well in order to compete with them . But there is this other side of me that feels very bad about it, and I definitely don't think it's good. I did acknowledge that it was a joke, so yesRight, the reason why I have a detached point of view in the first place is so that I can more easily focus on the solution, rather than just reacting to the problem. If I would react to every injustice in the world I would get nothing done other than complainingBecause I'm a problem solver and a pragmatist, I focus on the aspects of my life that I have power to influence, while I ignore the things that I can't change. By looking at things rationally I focus on the solution, instead of reacting to the problem. If I reacted to every injustice in thr world I wouldn't have the time and energy to focus on the practical issues. I do have the ability to effect my own career and my relationships with my friends and family, but people will abuse workers in china no matter how involved I get in the matter. I think it's healthier to capitalize on your strengths instead of trying to be something that you're not. If you can use your inferior function, then that's great go ahead, but mostly what I've experienced is that it makes you feel insufficient, and really what you should do is to seek help from someone that is better at it. Because most often they will gladly help you with it since it is an opportunity for them to shine, for example ask any INTP on here to explain the theory behind mbti for you and they will write a short book for you. Really what we should do is to cooperate instead of trying to be good at everythingOur inferior function represents our weakness but also our ultimate goal for personal development. Sometimes we tell ourselves that we hate it but we really don't. This sort of push/pull relationship that we have to our inferior function is the source of most of the awkwardness in our lives,  and ignoring it only makes it worse, so let's have a moment to confess our situation with it, and maybe we can help each other out. 

I'll start, and yes I made this post mostly to have a reason to talk about my self, but I had a realization this morning that most of my problems boils down to inferior Fe. I hadn't really tied the theory together with reality before that point. Now that I have learnt this about myself, I want to hear how other people with other inferior functions are experiencing this, and if the theory is true in general. 

I have inferior Fe. Basically, I've always been into team sports and bigger groups, so even though I relate very much to the jungian concept of introvert, you could almost see me as a passive aggressive extrovert lol. I am fundamentally a big group person, but all of the groups that I've encountered suck, so now I'm this person who tries a bit too hard to be independent and calm, but you can sort of tell that I'm being passive aggressive about something. No one is this stoic naturally, I'm compensating for something. Sometimes when I'm in a group and they get really excited about something, I'll get really annoyed because I want to be excited about something too, but I can't relate to what you're feeling, and half of the people in the group are just prentending to be excited to be a part of the group and that's not something that I'm going to waste time with. It would be nice to have something to actually be excited about with other people, but there is so much bullshit these days. 

Ok now it's your turn. Yes, *you*! Just kidding I don't care, post something if you have had similar experiences with your inferior function.I've never seen myself as a mean person, and the ISTPs I know in real life are pretty decent people. Maybe I'm just biased to people like myself, but I really don't think that this stereotype is accurate, and I actually don't mind stereotypes as long as they point to the truth to some degree. If you could give me real life examples of instances where ISTPs have been assholes, I might find that I have done similar things and I wasn't aware that I was being rude, or I might think that what the ISTP did wasn't really that mean at all and you are just over reacting or we have different limits for what it means to be an asshole. Or maybe it's a myth and you can't give me any examples. In either way, tell me what you think and help me understand this.
Its kind of difficult I guess. I socialize while I am at school (HS Senior), yet when I get home I talk to nobody, just browse social media, play video games, and do whatever I feel like, usually within the confines of my room, which is my territory that is respected and undisturbed by the rest of my family. I have a pretty dry sense of humor, am always told I seem negative, intimidating, or complex, but I think I am just super chill. I absolutely love learning abouts rockets and computers. But, I also find it easy to talk to people I do not know. I am kind of a bridge between jock and geek, my obsession with football and hockey has lasted for years, and I currently play football. I am quiet and reserved, but always take charge on group projects because my way is always the best way. Also, if position in football would help in any way, I am the starting defensive end. I mostly get away with things not allowed at school by being an excellent student and keeping my grades up, which allows me to bend the rules and get away with things most other kids wouldn't, like messing with the school networks to allow me to play flash games and things of the sorts. I am completely cool with spending most time in my room, although I am outgoing as well. It confuses me. I love staying by myself, but I also like going on adventures, like going hiking, boating, jet skiing, or snow skiing. So maybe more ISTP, you think? Its good to know that I am similar to someone else, I don't know anyone else quite like me. Everyone in my family (uncles, aunts, cousins) are highly extroverted, and told me I was weird for a good number of years. I don't take alot of them very seriously because of that. I usually take a hike, go canoeing or take a drive whenever they come into town and decide to bother me while they visit. Good to know I am not alone with my social tendencies.I guess I am an ISTP then. Thank you for helping! I appreciate it man!Sorry for the shitty picture, it was 5 AM, I was departing for Europe, was tired as fuck. ISTP, age 17. And yes, I will answer your questions if you choose to ask them. http://imgur.com/pY8pxcCOoh, the bubble gum. Its caffeinated. Tired ass me decided that would be a fantastic idea, but it was quite a bit more caffeinated than I had intended, and had some terrible withdrawal issues when I got back. Its was pretty cool though, and when we were in Italy, we found out the drinking age was 16. I'll let you guess how that ended up. :)I am an ISTP 8w7. I love water sports, and snow sports, and play football and hockey. I also play a lot of video games, and my ballsiness often gets me confused with an aggressive ESTP.Keep telling yourself that.ISTP here. ENFPs are freaks, INTPs are creeps. INTJs whine too much, ENTPs meme too much. ISFJs care too much, INFPs cry too much. I like ESTPs, they are good buds. ESFPs in my life keep me from going insane. ESTJs and ENTJs keep me motivated. XNFJs drive me up the fucking wall with their bullshit. Intuitives are good if they aren't in dreamworld thinking about philosophy that gets nothing done. One friend told me yesterday "art is how we decorate space, music is how we decorate time", and I told him "righty tighty, lefty loosey". It was useless. I told my friend this (he is INTJ) and he said it was intelligent. I am sure that this sort of knowledge won't propel us to the moon, cure alzheimers and dementia, or help develop clean energy. It doesn't seem as intelligent as it is useless. So I threw real intelligence at him. Turn right to tighten a screw, left to loosen it. Makes sense.What the fuck are you talking about?I am a strong believer in getting things done. I can see how things begin with an idea, but usually these ideas intuitives come up with (the ones I know at least) lead to nowhere. Obviously medical breakthroughs won't come from tightening screws, but building an MRI scanner that could save lives will. Seeing a problem and getting work done to fix it will. Alot of the ideas and of the intuitives I know are completely useless, sedentary, and non-applicable. Its like they do philosophy for mind art or whatever. It can be very frustrating when I am trying to do an assignment and this INTJ starts talking back and forth with himself about the paper being "part of the interconnected universe, matter from long ago, shaped by the explosion that caused the inexplicable start of all, where all was created, and all will end, the alpha, and the omega". To which I would say "Ok, magic mystical warlock, this is due in 45 minutes. You can be efficient, or lose the grade, you decide". It kind of makes me have prejudice towards intuitives. Not everything has to be pretty, mystical and mysterious. Get it done, you'll be fine. Time is money, and I don't waste time piddlepaddling in my bathwater wasting time. Get a move on. You know?ISTP reporting in, picture from my Europe trip http://imgur.com/I4qY12ZHow so?Thats a better picture of me. Here are more. Also, I am more receptive to questions than a lot of other ISTPs, so if you got any, shoot away. http://imgur.com/MwzGFmu http://imgur.com/VIfMLV5 http://imgur.com/1znSCB9 http://imgur.com/pUB2ZU3http://imgur.com/vWxM0qb

Guess I am the first ISTP (8w7). And I answer questions too, unlike alot of my kind (apparently). Here we go.  http://imgur.com/tPYVjWzD'aww, well thanksI did a post on /r/ISTP, and apparently we are prone to being Gaben Praisers. I like this.Im 8w7.What do you think about Lauren Southern and Gavin McInnes? I can't seem to type them.It has no correlation, given the info from past 30 posts about it here.From a brother to a brother, do you also do annoying things, or socially probe at others to see their reaction, in an operative sense? 

Example:

Me: "Hey INFP, dude, you are a slut."


INFP: "But, but, I am a guy!" *cries or some shit"


Me: *mentally notes*Oh, god, the thought of it just rubs me the wrong wayYeah, no. Not INFP. ISTP 7w8, sometimes can come off as an aggressive ESTP.Eh, fuck off. Re-read it.My problem is that whether whatever is happening, being with people, or being alone, I crave the opposite. Never really satisfied. I just tolerate being alone by doing radical shit, like driving 80 down a 35 zone in my car when in the middle of nowhere.For starters the candidate I like saved a bunch of jobs in my hometown of Detroit by scaring Ford and GM, something no other person on the planet has been able to do. I have alot of liberal friends in the auto industry who were cold at first, but given what this candidate has done, they are lukewarm to them.ISTP 8w7, got Phallic Agressive.I most likely went from INFP to ISTP, but have always had ISTP like traits. I was pretty whimsical and sensitive as a child, moreso than I like to admit to.Barry - ESTP, Cyrus - INTP/Unhealthy ISTP in Dom-Ter loop, Cynthia - ENTJ, Roark - ESFJ, Gardenia - INFJ, Maylene - ESTJ, Wake - ESFP, Fantina - INTJ, Byron - ENTP, Candice - ISFP, Volkner - Definitely ISTP in Dom-Ter, Aaron - ISTP, Bertha - ENTJ, Flint - ESTP, Lucian - INTP.But she is very calculating and structured in her thinking, so I don't think that I would go ESFP.One could argue ISTP as well, though. I don't see how the J fits in, as his P/J isn't described by OP.Its almost like saying 'no', the fact that nobody comments, and the massive downvotes you discord people get do not really convey the message properly. Nobody wants to join.ENFP and ENFJ seem shit at it. One ENFJ aunt who is like a party animal got my brother a guitar for christmas (which was fitting) and a philosophy textbook for me. I don't talk to her that much because she can be loud and intrusive, and it is almost like she looks passed the fact that I jet ski, and drive fast cars like every day. *Thanks Aunt Jane, I love philosophy, just so fucking interesting.*You can't type people with narcissistic personality disorder.ENFPs are never outwardly honest with themselves either, and from what I have seen base their judgements on how they feel they are versus sheer observation and examples. Would explain OPs tendency to drift to all 16 types.http://imgur.com/SpcSj2D Christmas kill this year. 19 years old in 3 days. Guess my type. Edit: You guys weren't far off, but ISTP. Good game, fellas.Are you an INFP? Because damn girl you FiNeISTP. Had my flair off for another post.Y'know, my type gets alot of flack for being quiet, but as far as first impressions go, as an ISTP 8w7 I get mistyped for ESTP alot. Behave a bit like one too, but hell, best of both.My functions are based alot closer towards ISTP.18, and inferior Fe definitely comes in noticably when I am by myself or in a smaller group. I reflect over events in my day and think about whether or not I am competant and bring something else to the table of my friend group. I am usually the wildest and least remorseful and emotive. This can lead to wild stuff, like dry ice bombs, chasing pedestrians with drones, making a capacitor out of a couple of 6 volts to shock the person who stole stuff out of my locker (blackened their finger, little fucker deserved it), but most of the time is something that I think holds me back. Inferior Fe makes me a whiny bitch when I am by myself, contributes to my regular ISTP paranoia, and I believe I would live alot better given I didn't have it. On the other side, makes me more human.Not gettin itI get it nowI definitely want to know the reason, as truthful as possible. I can tell when the girl lies about it, its definitely a sense I have. It is difficult when I get rejected or broken up with, but tough shit. I suck it up and handle it by myself.It is frowned upon when people talk in ghetto slang over a mouse and keyboard. You are attracted to who you are attracted to.The reason for breakup is essential for me, I need those "cause and effect" gears cranking so I can use the trial and error method and start doing little things right. And I know how it is, man. Whole family of feelers right here. Got 2 ENFPs, bunch of ISFJs, 4 INFPs, several more ESFPs, and 2 ISFPs. Only other thinkers are my grandfather, another ISTP.Thats a big no-no for me. I *am* the authority.I see these soldiers and warrior things, and quite honestly the amount of spy equipment and espionage skill at my age is concerning. Useful to me and my friends for getting anything we want without consequence. Go figure.When I get by myself (note: WTF Years are in full steam ahead) I lose groundedness, overanalyze stupid things, stop moving on, Fe can kick in (Ever see 230 pound football player turns on ultra bitchy cranky mode?) and I become super paranoid and irritable. It is the worst.ISTPs have a very painstaking period of time between the ages of 16 and 25 called the WTF Years. It is our version of the Dom-Ter loop, and is the worst loop known out of all of the MBTI types. There is an explanation in /r/ISTP 's sidebar you can reference to.It has different effects on different types. The WTF years (name used to refer to the ISTP variant Dom-Ter loop) is perceived as far worse because the dominant function is practically disabled, and the length of time it takes to get out of the development stage for the loop (11 years) is just ridiculous.Honestly you can get more info out of a google search than out of me. I have experiences, but the internet has data. Im not a big expert on the subject, but I am learning.I mean I could re-live things and write some paragraphs if you'd like, but they won't be particularly happy or interesting stories.U wan' be my molasses pap? Im an ISTP, got a ENFP brother, and INFP mom, ISFJ dad. My childhood was boy scouts, pokemon, football, snow skiing, and hunting. I grew up in a cold, but liberal state, while my parents are pretty conservative from a rather large state in the south that wear weird hats and is the home of a helmet toting karate squirrel. I was pretty liberal, and at age 13 we moved to the state my parents are from where I realized jow restricted I was by political correctness. In the recent presidential election, the snowy state (that i like) was primarily republican, so go figure. Didnt really make friends in this new state I lived in because I was liberal, but realized how free and unrestricted people were, and I liked that alot better. Friends in my old state think I am a sociopath for saying what I want and not having remorse. Whatever. 

My family, back to that. My dad is like an aggressive grandma, but also is super pragmatic which is great because I am too. Mom is so typical for INFP it isn't worth describing. You can google it. Brother is and ENFP that likes guitars, 80s rock, metal, and psychadelic rock. He is currently today in a two man band that drops their first album in about a month. Family is moderately wealthy, we have a small ranch, a house in a suburb, a boat, two jetskis, and still went on a few vacations a year. Great for me, because I could work on projects with enough resources and work them down to get the same processes done with less resources and thus less money. 

Today I am nearly about to graduate high school. Wanna go into the medical field. Im pretty tenacious, so the chance of changing my mind is slim. I wanna get richer than my family and then when I retire I can be left to my own devices and travel, or work out some million dollar idea, or tie four jet skis on top of each other and jump off a ramp on em, or drive a car out of a plane. I wanna die extravagantly by fire or adrenaline poisoning.Tell him the latter part if you want to get married within 3 months.ISTPenis42, duh.

I work smart, not hard. Same difference, but easier.

Straight A's, took some college classes in highschool, A/B student now. Honor roll.Because everytime we do more people have questions about us.I am so anti-furry, but go ahead and try with the fursona. I kind of want to see where it goes. Feel free to use my post history for reference about me.Is it based off of anything particular? P.S. looks greathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPI3b9iPSN0    - For ISTP. Substitutions could be anything by the Arctic Monkeys, or "Don't Bring Me Down" by Electric Light Orchestra. Oxford Comma seems a bit light, and these songs are either slower or more adventurous, which can be represented by Se being like seeing action in slow motion. You are welcome.Eh, too edgy for me. The Torre Florim on suits the slow mo Se effect and seems more cool and calculated.Found out people have no clue what the famous (yet enigmatically infamous) ISTP monologue sounds like. Here is some reference.

ESTJ: Your boss.

ISTJ: Your sarcastic physics teacher.

ESFJ: That one uptight chick with the Macbook that asks if you *actually* did the homework.

ISFJ: Your grandma.

ENFP: Obsessed with Pink Floyd and Van Halen and gets annoyingly emotional.

INFP: That one girl that always carries her stuffed animals and has crying fits all the way into High School.

ENFJ: Feminist girl in your Psych class that looks pretty without makeup, but you don't date her because she cakes on makeup and lectures you on what not to say.

ENTP: Preppy rich kid that never combs his hair and won't take no for an answer, until you physically show him what no means.

INTP: Curly headed quiet skinny kid in your English class that brags he made 105 on a math test.

ENTJ: The English teacher.

INTJ: Contrary to popular belief, not as good at planning grand schemes than at making dank memes.

ESTP: The kid you always beat at the circle game.

ISTP: You. Somehow got popular. Former fat kid turned preppy football player. Drowning in chicks, but unfortunately not the right kind of chicks, bucko.

ESFP: You liked her once, and would still go out with her if she liked you back. At the same time it is kind of fucked up because she is practically the little sister you never had, despite being three months older than you.

ISFP: Have you ever played Green Day themed trivia? Oh buddy, get ready to lose.

INFJ: The swim coach that is nearly 57 but still works out with the teenagers. Leads by 
  example, I respect it.


All the English teachers I have had ring ENTJ for sure. Talkative, strict, scheduled, but creative. Seems my school had a lot of them.If first impressions truly are everything, day one at my school started with a dildo being thrown at me, the "yankee new kid", and ended with driving a kid's head into a table with the cornerguards ripped off. He got six stitches. I got suspension. I am a straight A honor roll kid so it was eye opening for people to see my capabilities. I don't like hurting people.

Edit: That part kinda makes me sad too.Hold up fam, i gotchu 

Edit: cha-chingAlso triggered. We should try to ban the word "mistyped".No problemo, mo amigo.Long list of my most common verbal mannerisms:

I wouldn't do that.

Go fuck yourself.

Bucko

Buddy 

Buddy ol pal

Make me

Nonononono!!

Rrrrg!

Well, well, well.

I duped ya.

In all fairness...

You walked *straight* into that one.

Credit where its due...

Bull-fucking-shit

Fuck me sideways with a candy cane, dammit!!

Heheh.

Are you fucking for real?

Keep telling yourself that.

Dumbass.

Fuck.

Shit.

Thin ice you walk on, buddy.

If you don't wanna get burned, don't play with fire.

Oh, *sure you do.*

Bitch.

Fucker.

Jackass.

Mi amigo.

If you want people to like you, stop dressing like a gyspy and take a damn shower.

Grow up.

Shut the front door.

Not my problem.

Sucks to suck.

You deserve a *round of applause* (in which I clap while moving my hands around in a circle)

Oh, well thats fuckin perfect.

*Great job*.

You're pathetic.

Ooh! Feel special now, my little snowflake?


(I deal with morons alot). My brother is an ENFP. I'd say the "horn" is pretty dull, so it jars you more than stabs. Its remarkably more annoying than painful. Mom: INFP
Dad: ISFJ
Me: ISTP
Brother: ENFP
It gets annoying at times.http://imgur.com/Lz1vnZp http://imgur.com/Lp5B9EG Naturally.Mina got on my nerves hardcore, and the amount of Smeargle on route 3 on Melemele is infuriating. I just wanted a fucking GrowlitheDetroiter living in Texas, here to representBruh I didUsually I will tempt or threaten them into working. "*Well, I could do this group project all by myself. I will make a mental note to carve your name off the finished project with my knife*". Or just flat out insult them. "*I understand that no one likes you. Do your work, or fewer people will. Oh, and stop dressing like a gyspy and take a fucking shower.*"I am seeing traits from ISTP, INTP, and INFP. Are you able to hurt people's feelings easily if it makes life easier for more people? Would you rather snowboard and go hunting in a day, or teach philosophy? Are you a sadist or masochist, or neutral? Would you be able to fire someone from their job? Would you be able to kill an animal for food?INTP for sure. Don't take my word, go check your functions first. Let this be a guide, let your function stack be the final decision.That seems like weird ass shit an INTP would doAtta boy! What'd she do?The Black Keys, Arctic Monkeys, Schoolboy Q, Kendrick Lamar, Deadmau5, Vampire Weekend, Drake, Tyler the Creator, Kasabian, ASAP Rocky, The White Stripes, Digitalism, Cage the Elephant, New Politics, Kanye West, Psychic Type, Colony House, Born Ruffians, Bear Hands, Torre Florim/DE STAAT, Green Day, Awolnation, Imagine Dragons, Childish Gambino, Jay Rock. Little bit of everything.Religious ISTP here. *Woah, holy shit, you exist??*  Yep. I don't force it on people, or anything like that. I don't really talk about it unless someone really wants to get into a deep ass talk about values. I tend to lean  pretty decently towards conservative, as most ISTPs do, and as long as you don't get in my face about being a Christian or anything like that, we won't have issues. Easy peasy.A+Holy fuck this guy seems INTP. 2 paragraphs was enough.ISTP here. Looking into medical, because I love science (not too much into math). Thinking maybe a certified Anesthetist, because it has no routine and pays really good money. Plus, only 6 years of college is nice. Only problem is having to major in Nursing, which is kinda gay tbh. But who cares, if you are making bank in the end it doesn't matter.Just recently, an English teacher of mine talked shit about me anonymously to another class. Everyone knew it was me, told me about it. The school was having a raffle fundraiser to pie a teacher, said english teacher is one of teachers to get pied. I put in 8 raffle tickets to pie my english teacher. Word spread, turns out she talks alot of shit, now a bunch of people are rallying behind me and buying me tickets. I won with over 50 tickets in my name that I didnt buy. When I pied her, I pulled up her showercap and got it in her hair, all broadcasted on the school news network. Live. Straight up savage move, but may fail english. She picked the pie up and pied me back, but I am not afraid to get my hands dirty, unlike her. But, I got more popular. It felt good. I feel kind of bad, but ultimately she deserved it.Not ESTP, closest thing to it, but I can tell you.Im actually quite social. I observe a bit, but ignore what I think doesn't matter.ISTP - I can make cereal.I am usually a jokester, talk quite a bit. But I am snarky and sarcastic, too. They say Spider-Man is an ISTP as well, figure I am something similar.That's a better way of explaining it.Preciate it man"Oh my gosh, I swear, if anyone here doesn't know [my name], if there is anything dangerous, you'll bet he is doing it."Yes.ISTP rings true for me, but I wouldn't want to be mistaken as a Rob Zombie fan or metalhead if I was ISFP....I'll see myself out.Its okay son. Mom and I are still proud of you. Of all the instances where I have spoken to you online, you seem ENTP to the max. Possibly ENFP, but you make too many puns for that.Just recently an INTP made a type me, I tried to help out, and his sort of "I am the best, sensing sounds stupid lul" and so I said INTP for sure. Then he said something along the lines "I knew I was an INTP, I was just testing to see how it came off". What the fuck, man? Wasting my time on these morons.Not talking about that. Talking about people that have their heads so fsr up their ass that they think that others are absolutely dying to type them. Its not that, its just those certain people. I do make attempts to type people.I was going to mention Dissociative Personalities, but I thought I had gotten my point across. No, mental disorders do not change your personality, but it can have the perceived effect of doing so, depending on your personality. This can make it especially difficult for typing. I used agoraphobia and introversion as an example. I completely understand that it comes from energy supply rather than behavior, coming from a rather extroverted ISTP.I don't listen to 'em, you probably would.I don't get it. ELI5?Childhood could matter less. Your functions wouldn't have been as developed as they are now, so you are giving near useless information. Find your function stack as of the right now, not through the past. Look for patterns, it isn't difficult.Sorry for being rude, but I guess it served as a wakeup call. Cheers!ISTP, probably Scott from Total Drama Revenge of the Island, Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers, Archer from Archer, and Mr Blonde from Reservoir Dogs.I love who I am. But I am not content with certain aspects of my life. But I keep tweaking the x's of my life until I get the y value I want.Quit being pretentious.Mine looks like a workbench. I think up lots of ideas at this workbench, and there is a punching bag next to the bench, or nearby, that is never able to satsify my negative emotions, so I create schemes and revenge tactics at the workbench. It is a playground for Ti and Ne to cause chaos, Fe makes sure it won't get me in serious trouble, and Se is the high of confidence and stubbornness needed to carry through. Its pretty neat. Don't forget dadjokes.ISTP 8w7 here. You're funny, kid.ESTP good cop, ISTP bad cop.Yeah, me. Pranks are good shit. Nearly got suspended for pieing my english teacher, who had talked shit about me, and getting pie in her hair when she told me not to. On live TV. And I also ride jet skis, go karts, climb old rusty bridges, slight parkour (to get over fences into construction sites late at night), do donuts in my truck in the backroads of my town, blaze 120 mph down those roads too. Its fun. Keeps me away from my extreme paranoia.Fuck INTx. And xxFx. Always ruining my schemes, trying to get in the way of my pranks and puns, and making life less fun.Im an 8w7. I am also unsure if I am mistyped. How common is 8w7?They have this pretentious attitude towards every move I make in my life. Brag alot too. I can see it on a double edged axis. Thinkers typically don't like clubs, feelers typically don't like jet skis and motorcycles.Well, from a few INTPs I know. Here is the cancer. "I made a 105 on the calculus exam" "/u/COREALIUM_INDUSTRIES can draw so well but he wastes his time on that jet ski and his drone. Every life is a stroke of paint to be admired, make the most of what you do and be a thick, beautiful stroke, not a dry scraggly one!". No offesnse, a lot of INTPs I know are cunts. I understand why most people don't like them much.My life is a filled with feelers, and they drag me to stupid emotional shit all the time. When I try to do something sensory related or cause chaos I am ridiculed and called a "fun killer". Its fun to me. It seems feelers and intuitives alike are prone to not liking more physical forms of fun.Its okay, you are a good person.It usually stems from me doing something I want and a feeler ruining it because it isnt morally right to them.

Me: *grabs a cookie

Grandma: "Did you grab a cookie out of the cookie jar?"
.
Me: "No-"

Feeler: "YES HE DID!! HE GRABBED THREE!! AND ATE ALL THREE OF THEM!!!"


Or something along those lines. If I pull a pun and someone is thinking about, they'll spew the answer to spite me. Why are schemes surprising?Well, call a spade a spade.I like sushi. And steak. And cheeseburgers. And trail mix. Rub-a-dub-dub, love me some grub.I could care less about other people's families. MBTI is a utility to navigate people. This isn't a fucking People Magazine.They are out in the forests talking to trees instead of doing surveysRepresent!Wow. You put my life into words. Tell me you enjoy puns as well, and make my day, stranger.You seem like a delusional type of person that believes that you can be typed on something completely irrelevant. Delusions stem from schizophrenia, and schizophrenics cannot be typed. Go find your function stack, quit this bullshit.Then say it like that. "See if you can make a guess at my type using only my wallpaper". Lots of people waltz into /r/MBTI and *actually* try to find their type from shit like this, because they see other people doing it. Makes this community far less attractive.ISTP. Adrenaline and chaos, but also a balance of knowing what I want and how I am feeling. The second part is difficult.Matpat - ENFJ

No idea about the rest, never seen emMy temper is generally pretty evident when I get pissed off. Its rare, but it'll bite'cha.Not you, /u/mirrorconspiracies, your memes are always welcomeIts meant to be directed at people of each type in your own life. My goal was not to insult you, but rather shit talk the people based on respective type. Stereotypes.I agree with you. Im trying to be healthier right now, tryed this out. On any other day I would go up and be a jerk, deck someone in the face, kick, bite, and roll in the dirt. But this isn't that kind of thing for me, right now.I wanna go punch somsthing, get drunk, and take a nap.Only when I'm distressed.Just angry or stressed.

I love it.Wow, thats great. Good for you, I'm glad you get off on that.Do you feel drained after interacting with people?


Do you like going outside, or would you rather read a book and debate the contents?


If your family was going to die, would you join them, or stay back realizing that would be another life lost?

Do you make lists and schedules, or do you just fiddle with your phone alarm to remember things?ISTP normally: Tough shit. Adapt.

ISTP now: Ow, that hurt in my feelings. Fuck you.Would you rather be by yourself isolated for a few hours skiing, or in a house with not enough seats, but lots of attractive people that you can talk with?

Would you rather drive very fast down a long road, or go slow, look at the roadsigns and apply their meaning to your own life, or other's lives?

If a dog ran into the road, and you were going 40 mph, would you swerve to avoid the dog, or hit it, in worry of rolling your car?

Would you say your internal world is messy but external world is orgainzed, or your internal world is organized allowing your external world to be messy?
You cannot change your type, similar to how you cannot change your eye color. It doesn't work that way. Research cogbitive functions to determine your type.Lets rock and roll, im in it for the karma.If a teacher asks a question and the ass is dead silent every day, but you happen to think of a snappy response, would you take it even though everyone in the class is afraid to talk?

Would you be able to shoot your own dog if held at gunpoint?You are tricky. 

Do you tend to get over relationships/getting dumped quickly, or slowly? Quickly being 1 to 1.5 weeks, slowly being a month or more.

Would you rather read a book at home, or go to a school dance?ISTP. Welcome to the club, bucko.Can you easily speak in front of crowds or talk about sensitive topics with others, without being awkward?

Are you more of the dreamer and self-proclaimed "novelist" type, or a kick down the damn door and do donuts on the beach action type?

In front of people you don't know are you more rational and courteous, or friendly and sensitive?

Bias effects everything, it is the essence of idea, and presence of life, bucko.It doesn't seem defensive, but rather explanatory. The downvotes seem defensive, on your part.No hard feelings, you have a good one.ISTP: Torn between snake, wolverine, rat, and mako shark. Marcus: ENFP

Sitara: ENFJI was trying to play INTP real hard, haha.Idk why everyone is downvoting you, take my upvotesWe'll add that one too. They are all about silence, precision, and some about scavenging.Anger to me is bad event after bad event, and there is no one you can fight, torment, or blackmail to change things. (i.e. grandpa dies, girlfriend leaves you, dog gets terminally ill, mom goes blind). Its when life loses its friction, and you cannot get a grip.It leads to frustration and anger for me. The worst part is not being able to fix it, take it out, or get revenge, because there is no cause and effect here.ISTP here. In a rut. Raised aggression, irritation, and I can get emotional from stupid things. At those points I will isolate myself for long periods of time, which is alright, but I used to just stay in my room, now I go out and drive around, climb old rusty bridges, or do things to engage Se. I also keep an Instagram account and get photography thrown in there to keep myself on the path of using Se, complete with a drone and gopro. Its more fun that way, gets me out of my own head, forcing Ti and Se to work, and makes me look cooler to people on instagram. It sucks. Im not complete as a person, but im working to at least get as close as I can.Detroit is ISTP as fuckSteve Jobs is an idiot. The only thing he actually did was make a brand, he was never a "revolutionary" or a "genius".Ignorant yourself. He didn't do any of that. Its easy to manipulate Steve Wozniak and Jony Ives into building a company while you sit back and take in the fame and fortune. Manipulation is the legacy of Steve Jobs. If you want proof of his manipulation, note how he manipulated stockholders into believing he didn't actually have a biological daughter, even when DNA tests proved that he did.No.Istp. Bork.When I was a kid, I wouldn't watch the movie itself but would go to the special feautures or disc 2 to see how the movie was made. I fix cars. I fix computers. Im a guy. I get drunk alot. I drag race. I enjoy rollercoasters. Im really bad at keeping girlfriends. I like to hike and go camping. I own 3 toolsets and a nice set of jumper cables. I am going to work in the medical field. I use humor as a defense mechanism. Dude I wish"WiLL yOu jOiN mY mInEcRAffT SeRveR.!?"More of a neckbeard cringe, but /u/Aalewis's quote, "In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony God's blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my own intelligence". Sounds like something an INTP would say tbhIf you are asking to be typed, fucking ask to be typed. Writing a song that is completely irrelevant doesnt get the point across.Garchomp, Torterra, Heatran, Yveltal, Palkia, Groudon.INTP. Yes, built a gaming PC a few years back. Its pretty neat, I play CS:GO, Watch Dogs Series, and other open world games like Just Cause 3 and GTA. Open world is my favorite, but I do roleplay games like Pokemon and Bioshock too.Google 'flairs'.ISTP 9w8s are highly introverted, and I think I suck at social stuff but am generally personable. ESTP 7w8 are more introverted and awkward but generally confident. Its confusing to understand for me, I have gotten ISTP, ESTP, and ISTJ but have only recently begun to doubt myself as an ISTP. ISTP and ESTP aren't all too different.Kind of difficult to talk about, not completely  over it but she has a new boyfriend now. She is an ESFP. I liked her enthusiasm towards my shitty dadjokes, always fist bumping me and telling me "good one", whenever we were proud we'd say "im a proud mom/dad" and were constantly texting and snapchatting each other if we weren't scheming and pulling pranks and stuff on people. I miss it. We are still friends but its difficult to find people that show that kind of acceptance towards me, because everyone thinks im a psychopath jock/evil mechanic. Im an asshole sometimes. I get im hard to be around, thats part of me. I really softened up around her and fell hard, which made this so hard for me afterwards. Its been about two months now.Just things I have read, more personal accounts. Choosing qualitative data over quantitative on this one, so thats more of a generalization. If you have something to contribute rather than "wha?????" type stuff, please share.So did you read my post history, or is that just your intuition getting all this stuff right about me? Just asking out lf curiousityIt wasn't ever put into words but yes it was.https://imgur.com/gallery/X9KHwAck your my favorite MBTI redditor ;DCan you please do this with the regular functions? Your explanation style is great.YayYou always comment useful or funny shit on my posts and comments.BingoTo an extent I'm seen as one. Formerly idetified as ISTP, found out Se is my dominant function and now classify as ESTP, possibly 7w8.ESTP - everything you say or do is taken the wrong wayESTP. Not a social butterfly. I've been feeling kinda lost lately. I'm also known to be quiet.I'm flattered, thank you. Can I ask what drew you to your conclusion?Hey sorry to bother you and all, but could you maybe elaborate to me now?Y'know, I needed that. Thank you. In the shit town I live in I wish there were more girls that had your way of thinking. Thanks so much. In accordance to question 1, I wanna be loved too. Thats a big one that doesn't come out on firdt impression, but its critical.Not a robot, haha. :)I don't know, was hoping an experienced person could come along and help me find out.I am generally clueless of my environment and terrible at sports. I play anyways because I am stubborn. I also shut myself in when I am upset, usually for a few days. Huge procrastinator, can be very quiet. What do you think?I see im context and relationships. So in a way, a little bit of both.I generate options of things I could do to figure out what I will end up doing. Like, "*I have to shit. Math ends at 3:39, so I can rush home and shit. But, the new pokemon trailers came out, so I can spend time watching those, or have a wank on the toilet.*" And right now the option is to do all 3. I do like pranks and puns too, but am told that is shared equally between ESTP and ENTP.Absolutely yes. Only if I know what I am doing, or *generally* what I am doing. If I have no idea, I try to look at the system and figure it out.The first one. But when I am upset, tired, or stressed, I lock myself up for days or up to weeks. I am clever and full of fun like the second one says, but few people share my enthusiasm and some are annoyed by my presence. I am competitive, but not really competitive with sports. These days my cool wins over my fire 90 percent of the time. But when thats reversed, life is great.

What gives away that I am stressed, if you don't mind me asking, or what makes you come to the conclusion?Well you nailed that. Im a phone addict, and when someone tries disconnecting me I get in a coversation to manipulate them away from disconnecting me. I kinda like to spy/stalk people and I can almost feel energy between people, but often times I pull pranks that go to far and frame people or one of my many alter egos for it. I don't know if any of this has anything to do with ESTP, but yeah. I do it to people I do not like *especially*. In the position I am in I cannot get an any fights without getting fired, but I also have a persistent fear of fighting. Afraid of losing, especially because if I am in a fight with someone, the goal is not getting what I want, its to cause that person as much pain as possible at little expense to me. 

Yeah, I'm stressed because a woman I am into (who I also consider my best friend) is "talking" to an ex friend of mine. I don't like it, and I have mentioned multiple times that she is replacing me to which she says "nahh, you're irreplacable". You probably saw in that other typeme post that I hate being replaced or when people choose others over me. She also told another friend that me and her were hanging out, in order to ensure I wouldn't go out partying. Yeesh.Its nothing personal, I'm very sure you were right. I just like being sure of myself, and had a moment of unclarity and wanted more opinions.By asking me questions I guess?Oh wellSounds good. Thanks alot! My buddy calls it manipulative, I call it "*persuasive*". Can be in the center, but usually have to beat an old lady with a stick to get it, or be outrageous. Pretty good at it. I like being 1 on 1 too, because it allows my *persuasiveness* to do it's work.I don't know. Is it?Of course I have. You are pulling a Monty Python Argument Clinic routine to try and get me to argue with you. Once you achieve that, you are going to diagnose me as ENTP, because I had the incentive to debate you. Did I get that right?"When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want yer damn lemons, what am I supposed to do with these?!" - Cave Johnson

"Well, to each his own. I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero. And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city. But the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying. In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate  you. Why bother?" - Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin

"There's a spiritual side of me that goes real deep, but I confess right up front that I am the biggest sinner of them all" - Johnny Cash

"When I was just a baby, my mama told me 'son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns', but I shot a man in Reno, jyst to watch him die..." - Johnny Cash, *Folsom Prison Blues*
Because nobody pays us any real personalized attention and to fill the void we come on here to do these AMAs. Makes us look really vain, but our Fe goes sour and gives us a bad rap.Answering along with OP because he is inactive, so hello /u/sperglord_manchildWe are bountifulWhy do you assume that you are above us and that we are not, and thus can not? Get off your high horse, bucko.Jesus no, my pain tolerance sucks.I get along with ENFPs, other ESTPs, ISTPs, ESFPs, INTJs, and ENTPs the most1. Got wasted and didnt feel the pain of a nasty breakup I was in

2. I've only smoked weed and snorted coke, so quite a bit. Don't plan on doing anything else but weed because med school does drug tests, and I like to succeed. 

3. I want a commitment but its hard (that was not a dick joke)1. Yes, God, friends, SO's (past and present)

2. Weak spot for the elderly. Also a friend of mine, but that isn't worth talking about. I give a fuck about things but I don't show it, because showing it allows people to take advantage of it against your will.

3. My best friend is my best friend because we understand each other through action, not words. Known him since as far back as I can remember (kindergarten? Idk, super long time ago) He is an ISTP, semi-pro CSGO player. I live across the country, but when I go home its like I never left.
Of course. But not every Se activity is life risking. I also enjoy skiing, drifting trucks, mudding, drag racing, football, hockey, flying my drone, video games, and spanking the monkey after a long day.Forgot to answer the other parts. The least ESTP things I do are probably Pokemon games, played those as a kid, still do it now. Most ESTP thing, sports, cars, computers.ESTP is literally an ISTP that ditched anime, shaved the beard, and went to /r/malehairadvice. Thats it, we aren't douchebags and we don't talk too much more than ISTPs. I talk as much as any average schmuck you'll find on the sidewalk.Gladion - ISTP

Lillie - ISFJ

Lusamine - EXTJ

Guzma - ESTP (Ni Loop possibly)

Kukui - ESFP

Plumeria - ISTJ

Hala - ESFJ

Olivia - ESTP

Nanu - ISTP

Hapu - INFJ

Kahili - ??? I have. They are both a lot goofier and animated than I am. 

One was very unhealthy, he hit on girls left and right, was very thin, and paranoid. He was very concerned about his appearance and his ego was very fragile. He had lots of money and bought top notch clothes, he had to be preppy. He never got any dates, although he got a girlfriend that toned him down. He also pushed his elderly dad down the stairs and got sent to crazy camp for 3 years and I haven't seen him since.

The other one is much healthier, he is also wealthy and cares about his appearance very much. He talks about astrophysics and universe expansion quite a bit. He is a romeo and falls in love very easily, but is always disappointed when the possibilities always end in breakup. He wears yeezys to school, and is going to a good school after HS. 

Both very much different than me, I dress very casually or in dressy REI type clothes. Both liked to talk about things and not do anything, vs me that will act when things need to be handled.No problem!ESTPs scheme too much, but ESFPs are too manipulative, which js worse. Only room for one best type, sorry ESFPs. 2 very good friends of mine are ESFPs.

One of them is a great buddy of mine, we can always go have fun. Drag racing, drinking, screwin around playing video games, talkin shit, etc.

The other was my best friend. We spent lots of time plotting against people and being hateful towards people we don't like until I canned and fell for her. It never worked out, and crushed me. She used those feelings against me. Toxic.They were PMs, not comments.Hi, ESTP here and yes, this is a thing. I am extremely paranoid about social settings and can be seen as closed off, or very guarded. I always think there is some secret connection going on between my friends that makes them want to turn against me. The kicker is that I was recently diagnosed with depression, unsure if that has anything to do with it, but I most definitely have the inferior Ni paranoia, very relatable to me. If you have any other questions, shoot.Temporary.

ISTP.Work on happiness. Forget about a certain girl. ISTP inner monologue:

*Only I can see this?!*

*Fuck yourself with a pizzacutter.*

*Why do I uselessly ramble?*

*Stop over drinking, you alcoholic.*

*Damn, I can squat tons!*

*Drive fast for a rush.*

*They are lying to you.*

*They know something you don't.*

*I can do some damage...*

*Hurt those assholes, they'll pay.*
Have a wankI can fix everything too!

Except my life. HAHHAHAAHA*HUMORISMYDEFENSEMECHANISM*HAHAHAHANo comment on the ISTP one? Dude I shower twice a day, I eat my green veggies, I floss. What gives?ESFP: "*I love too freely, thats my problem!*"

Which is why 3 ESFPs have cheated on me...

I'm sorry, I have a bone to pick with your type right now.Both. I keep riding the wave for more information while trying to figure it out.Yeah, but your opinion is stupid, and your demeanor is very naïve of how we treat pretentious intuitives around here. Get off your high horse, you are another human being just like everyone else here, not a special snowflake that deserves praise. Diogenes, a great philosopher was ISTP. Ernest Hemingway was ESTP. Alfred Tennyson was ISFJ. Sensors aren't dense, MBTI is not a stereotype basing. Get real.ESTP here. America's school system is too sensitive for me.I modeled my senior quote to be after a song with cuss words on it, but i used a clean part of the song. They googled the song, saw some words in it, and told me to change my quote, and also had to serve 2 hours detention. Also, they are too reliant on rules and regulations.What the fuckNo, not that, just your weird speech styleOh I gotcha. Sorry for being touchy about it, didn't know that you weren't native english. Just type complete sentences and limit capital letter sentences (people don't use full capital sentences very often, it can be perceived as strange). Also "nay" and variations of "xd" are perceived as unprofessional sometimes, so if that is what you are going for I would drop those. Good luck, hope it helps. Sorry for the confusion.ISTP

Achiever: 53%

Explorer: 40%

Griefer: 53%

Socializer: 53%I have taken a few different tests such as the 16 personalities. Each one describes me as either ISTP or ESTP, but I quite honestly think I fit more with the ISTP crowd despite getting ESTP most of the time. Could you guys maybe question me some and try to figure out for sure what I am? Appreciate all who can help!Y'know, I really hate to be one of these that comes on here and posts "lol whats my type", but fuck it. Anyway, I have been what I assume to be an ISTP for about a year, but sort of notice I may not fit for the 'I' part as much as I thought. When I am by myself, I lose touch alot, and that ISTP groundedness becomes borderline paranoia about stupid shit, and I get upset about things that simply don't matter. When I am with other people, I am pretty grounded and realistic, despite sometimes being a compulsive liar. It may just be that I don't get out enough, and sometimes being with people really does tire me out, like my family. Or it could be that I have an interesting friend group. I am not really a quiet person, but am commonly described as quiet, or impersonal. When I was little I was pretty talkative by my standards, but I was also really sensitive about friends, and losing them, and at a young age I developed separation anxiety. I think I am pretty desensitized now, and am fine being alone, as long as I am grounded, by doing something like driving fast, camping, exercising, etc. 'Preciate the help, for those who can. Also open to questions and further probing for info, if you need it.And do they differ from the real life variants of each respective type?For example, when I think of ENTP's, I think of memes. Or INTJ's I think of being uptight. Or ESTP, Donald Trump or Evel Knievel.Out of all the typing posts to sort through, here is a few things you should know. 


1) Nobody can "type" you. You can be quizzed, you can be guessed at, but until you find your function stack, you will not know your type. So going in with a "type me based on what beanie babies I bought when I was 4" post won't get you very far. 


2) Do not come in here with an egocentrical attitude about being typed. Like "I am bored today, so I might *let* one of your MBTI nerds *try* to fathom the inner sanctum of my mind" or simply "I guess I will *let* you type me". Newsflash bucko, nobody wants to type you. It is a privilege, not a right. Some people like to help others, but nobody wants to help an asshat.


3) Yes, your type is compatible with your SO. Every type is compatible with every type, even 2 people of the same type. If everything is fine, good for you, ride the wave! If you are insecure, fix it, get over it, or break up. If your partner is insecure, fix it, let them get over it, or break up. There is nothing that says conflicts happen because of MBTI types. However, each type has a love language, which can be confusing to certain types, but if you were developed enough as your specific type to get in a relationship with this person, you are developed enough to stay in a relationship with this person.


4) You cannot "change" types. Perceived type can be altered, but not changed, and even if, it is usually after a traumatic event. This usually is due to a mental disorder, such as PTSD, or a serious phobia, maybe anxiety or bipolar. I would not say any of you have any of these unless diagnosed by a medical professional, due to the fact that many people these days in colleges seem to self diagnose themselves with mental disorders for benefit or pity. An example of personality alteration would be an EXXX that went to war, formed anxiety, and now acts like an introvert due to agoraphobia (anxiety to leave one's house or dwelling). Even if you didn't act like your type as a little kid, your functions were not as developed as they are now, so you were probably still the same type.


[removed]Pretty torn between the two. Have identified as ISTP 9w8 for a while but a recent breakup has highlighted my love of people, control, and doing fun shit constantly, with necessary breaks of course. Please ask me questions because I want to know myself better and get back into the game.Im pretty positive on my type but I wanna see if you folks agree with what I think.Type me..?

1). What do you yearn for in life? Why?

Happiness. Like the feeling when yiu wake up on a Sunday of a three day weekend, slap on your favorite shirt, and roll into town knowing youbare gonna do somethin exciting (not staying home and jerking off). Power, I want control, access to things to get myself on the radar, but I don't want to be seen doing it. Happy and presentable outside, but practical and powerful when things go south.


2). Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.

English teacher was talking shit about me. In front of the cameras rolling on the school TV network completely live, I pied her in the face and made sure it got all in her hair. She had a hair appointment in an hour, and lost her college ring cleaning pie out of her hair. 


3). What makes you feel inferior?

When the people I love ignore me, or choose someone else over me. 

Also when a group of people rains hell on me and there is not much I can do, and one to back me up


4). What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pros/cons, how you feel about it, etc.)

I think alot about what other people would do. What would Wolverine do in this situation? I do look at most pros and cons and weigh them out, eliminate stuff that isn't really applicable, see how it affects everyone else, and then seeing how it affects me. I also see how it affects people I don't like, see if I can roll some bowling balls at those pinheads.

5). When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?

My emphasis is usually on the point I am trying to make. I have control over the outcome, sure, but if I check off all the points on a school project and knock that sucker off my to-do list, as long as it is to the specifications, it is an A+ in my eyes. If I get an 85, I'll be sure to see what is wrong and argue in my defense.


6). Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?

I remember when I was a little kid playing pokemon games on my nintendo handhelds. Pretty nostalgic about that and pokemon music (I listen to it sometimes, its nice.)

I like driving my car really fast. Drifting and doing donuts in trucks. Sneaking out of school during off periods to get food for me and my friends. Love road trips and driving with friends.

I love to ski. Where I live now there is a lack of snow to ski on, but I remember it fondly. I take up drone flying now, its fun.



7). When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural to you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc.)

Hands on I suppose. Memorizing too. If I can learn something by seeing it, thats even better. 



8). How organized do you think of yourself as?

Disorganized. It seems organized to me, but I am always told to clean my room, clean my car, etc.



9). How do you judge new ideas? Do you try to understand the principles behind them to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?

I see if it makes sense. Someone handed me a pamphlet on why you should go vegan. Yeah sure, its sad the cute little cow has to die, but meat is protein, and I like steak. 

If you want me to round up my lunch bill to the nearest dollar to support firemen and first responders, sure I will. They could end up saving my life. If it makes sense for me or people close to me, then bam.



10). Do you find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?

I like belonging to a group. Having people like brothers and sisters to you, its a good feeling, it is beneficial. But if everything is going fine, I start getting a little bored. I end up stirring short term nonsense like pranks, or also buying stuff to experiment and play with (like a new 600 dollar GTX 1080), etc.



11). Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?

I prefer one on one. You can be more easily turned against when you are in a group, and having a personal connection with someone reflects your chemistry better and thus puts you more into the group, or increases your likelyhood of being in the group. Alot of people think I am manipulative, but I don't think I am as good as they think I am. I generally think before I speak, but I sometimes speak before I think. 


12). Do you jump into action right away, or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Do actions speak more than words?

I like action more than talking about it. But sometimes I get caught in a loop talking about it because I am busy, stressed, or just lazy. I think if you look at how I act on a big scale you can definitely see my wants and intentions, I don't think it is too difficult. But with analyzing other people, I have a hard time. I am not too aware sometimes, and things can fly right over my head when I experience them for the first or 2nd time. On the 3rd time though, I can figure it out assess it right. My dad always called me "absent-minded professor" because I forgot to do things sometimes, mostly under stress. I can be clumsy, but only under a lot of stress.


13). It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favorite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?

Tired, stressed, busy, lazy - stay home

Awake, bored, sitting at my desk - go



14). How do you act when you're stressed out?

I get super irritable. If you talk to me about "hey we gotta do ____", I involuntarily get mad and wonder what the other person is thinking about how much time I have to do that.

In general, I hole myself up in my room and try to figure out a solution. When everything is fine, generally ok for now, the lights under my bed (I have LED lights under my bed) get set to blue. On stressed, angry, sad, depressed, or rage mode, they turn green. I'll often make revenge plans and never carry them out, but think about what I could do to people if more problems arise, it helps ne calm down. I also look in the mirror and think of comebacks, insults, responses, etc. to say to people when people become a problem. I will also talk shit, spread lies, and persuade people into doing things to go against people I don't like.

When I am depressed I alternate between angry music and "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head" by BJ Thomas.



15). What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?

When other dudes think they deserve respect when they don't do anything in life. (Getting a welding GED and think they are hot shit and that everyone should quiet down when they step in the house). Like go fuck yourself, prick.

If someobe for example, slaps you in the face out of nowhere. Then, you slap them back for it. Then, they slap you for slapping them. Makes me wanna kill em.

When people try being "intelligent". Being poor and thinking you are hot shit. Not doing anything with your life and taking it out on people that are aggressive/competitive with grades/work. Fighting for things you have no right to. Tattletales. "Nice guys finish last". Cancerous fanbases of games and tv shows.



16). Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?

I like telling jokes, stories, puns, etc. Im a real dad-joker if you are willing to laugh with me.



17). What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?

Fine arts. Painting, classical music. Im not too into it. Could care less about theoretical stuff.



18). How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?

Some kind of maverick ready to do anything. Super blunt and willing to say anything. I have gotten "psychopath" a few times. Some people say my smile makes me look evil or devious. Also everyone thinks I am a hacker.

I think a lot more about what I do and say than what they think. My facial expressions play a big role, especially my eyebrows, you can see em, and when I am sad I go blank and monotone. When I am feeling angry or vengeful, listen carefully to what I am saying, because I use a lot of wordplay and will quite literally spell it out for you if you have time to decode my little hints and messages. Not a hacker actually, but I have some pretty nifty tricks for working with stuff. 

My friends would never know that my confidence is where it is. They probably think I am the most confident person on the planet, I can take any sort of massive punch and be rolling again good as new within a few weeks. But sometimes if you act it well enough, people believe it. I pray alot about when I do bad things, I never feel good about it. I am very afraid of heights and having bad breath. Fear of bad breath is why I brush my teeth so often and always have gum on me. The reason I don't like my picture being taken is that my parents are facebook-aholics and would constantly take pictures of me as a kid so I have a consistent fear of that. I am very paranoid about technology, being watched and recorded, and being hacked, so I got good at tech stuff. I like backscratches and they can persuade me very easily.Could you guys maybe ask me some questions to help me figure it out? Hate making typeme posts but i need some outside opinionsAsking for a friend.From the Bitwit youtube channelHere I am, thanks for appreciating my last comments. ESTP, 18yo, AMAI think I might be one, but am not 100% sure. I am somewhere between ESTP and ISTP, I think. It would help to know what I am for sure instead of volleying back and forth every time I find new information.I see about a thousand million "INTJ"s on here that clearly act like ESFx, ENFx, ENTx, and ESTx but excuse this and continue to pollute this subreddit with flaming gabage, bad advice, and terrible ideas.

If you consider yourself an INTJ, I want you to sit 3 of your friends or coworkers down, pull up an INTJ description, and ask them nothing but "Would you say that this describes what I am like?". I guarantee you they are going to look like a confused deer, or they are going to point out similarities and dissimilarities.

If they say "no", welcome back to reality! You probably aren't an INTJ, but thats OK. This is not some race class elitism or something, one type is not better than the rest (even though INFP hate seems prevalent, every person we have here is valuable and carries experience, data, and knowledge that may help out other types with various problems). It does **not** give you reason to shit all over other types.

Even better **LOOK INTO COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS**. I know the instant gratification of pulling up pinterest memes about your perceived type may seem intriguing to you at the current moment, but take the discipline to sit down and analyze what functions you actually use.

This is about finding your type and trying to aim your guns to find your best possible success through semi-predictable people patterns. /r/MBTI is not a tumblr page, so we need to stop acting like it. 

/endrantHello. I am going through a difficult period. I am trying to learn more about the Ti-Ni loop but there seems to be very limited amounts of detailed resources that I can use to help myself. Could somebody explain in depth how this manifests and what it can feel like? I believe in this point in my life I am learning to develop my Ni and Fe, if that helps. Also I know I need to use Se to break out, which is great, although I am at a point where my responsibilities are very consuming and limit me to a "go to class, do your homework, handle your shit, get it together, and repeat" sort of period. Anyone with encyclopedic knowledge of these loops as well as shadow function manifestation, if you could please share as much info as possible you would be doing me a solid and helping me out a lot. I need to understand these things before I am able to help myself. Thank you.[removed]Istp, bill murray, bill burr, chevy chase/r/im14andthisisdeepNobody cares

Edit: fangirls gonna downvote. Hard to swallow pill: Shawn Mendes isn't in to you.Aye fuck you

Nah im jus playin hahaIts "phallus-craniumed" you dickheadI don't see why you are being downvoted. Unless someone into zodiac can prove that the month you were born results in personality traits, then its a bunch of bs.It is definitely (by nature) more ISTP than INTJ. Please look at the descriptions and do not believe the intui-bots that spam this sub with "*ohmygod* ***THATS SO ME*** "Yeah dude, for sure. I gotchu. I don't like to jump to conclusions either, but I have literally seen INTJ paraded around as the "most extroverted introvert type" "type that can think best on their feet" "type that is the most introverted" and a whole bunch of other contradictory baloney in the past week. Its best to look through the information itself, as the anecdotal "evidence" on this sub seems more like "my type is better" advertising at best.

The only way to know completely for sure is by sitting down and looking at resources, because the amount of inaccuracy is very high in here.

By logic of people in here, Gordon Ramsay, James Bond, Stalin, Steve Jobs and Kim Kardashian are INTJs, and with full potential the INTJ in its natural habitat is immune to all criticism and emotion, can levitate at least 3 feet off the ground and shoot pulsar beams out of its skull.

Tl;dr: Don't believe everything you read on the internet forum.Yes, I absolutely agree, and of course I use INTJ as a commonplace example and partly in jest. However I do think INFP and sensor prejudice is extremely prevalent and is a problem. I'd like to ask people to think of that one friend they tried to show MBTI/Jung Cognitive Functions to, and imagine them as a sensor or an INFP. Your actions and words could be the reason someone says "nah fuck that shit".The perfect storm of false typing. This is a good theoretical groundwork for how confusion can play into mistyping. Nice work.This is where people would say "*ohmygod* you are quirky **THATS SO INTJ**", but I'm no enabler.

And yes I think most people would. That is human curiousity and need for concrete definition, it is not a "type exclusive". This cannot happen because we cannot derive concrete definition from a theory.The prejudice against INFP and sensors is high around here. If people imagine them as *that* friend they can't get into MBTI, maybe they will quit the elitist circlejerk and stop giving this subreddit such a bad look.

Sorry if I worded it weird, its early morning and I haven't had any coffee.Ns are a minority, however this sub has either

1.) A high concentration of intuitives

2.) A high concentration of mistyped intuitives

Or more likely

3.) A high concentration of intuitives and mistyped intuitivesYou should seek friends that drive you and invigorate your life. 

If you suffer from anhedonia I would suggest talking to professionals.This is the sole reason I listed a family/peer review first over finding cognitive functions. If I were a mod I would have this pinned. Couldn't have worded it better myself, thank you.I am curious what would happen to someone like you (who has tested as one type several times) if you got professionally typed, in a situation where you did not know you were being typed. Someone else commented about personal bias and how that can affect outcomes. The problem is that setting up an experiment for this would be difficult to repeat and replicate results, as well as expensive. However it would be incredibly fascinating.I understand what you say about the "INTJ"s, and agree. And yes, if anyone here could get an "all-knowing" source to tell them their type, nobody would refuse. We agree on that.

The way I like to imagine cognitive functions is almost like protocols you run in your head. 

Let me try to run you through a scenario using my own professional topics that I am familar with.

I believe my primary cognitive function is Ti. I revert to Ti when nothing extreme is happening, it is there on default. I am on constant scan/observe until I see something either interesting/concerning/immediate/that I am targeting. To show you how I switch between, Ti is on scan, and I observe a man on a bench fall down. Se will kick in, I run over to quickly see what the issue is. Using Ti, I can see the man is unconscious, pale, he has blue lips, and clubbed fingertips. Ni for me immediately, and almost subconsciously tells me "*if things stay like this, the man will likely die*". Obviously the man cannot breathe, as evidenced by symptoms, but Se will kick in, as something needs to change *fast*. I will have to tell one specific person, "Call 911", the man's coat will need to be ripped open to avoid possible obstruction, and the man will require CPR for a airway obstruction, or rescue breathing/manual respiration in order to avoid major organ damage or further organ damage.

You see kinda how the functions play off each other? These are how I analyze my own actions when I am working and how I see things play out.See above comments on personal testing bias. Not denying you are INTJ, I have no objective way of knowing, but you want to eliminate all forms of bias and any other variables that could possibly think of that indicate you are INTJ before making the decision for yourself. Ne way would be to be typed by someone else. Tests are great but the accuracy of the tests is not something that can be identified and measured.

Also INTJs that think that /r/mbti is the only INTJ congregation area should check /r/intjWell then you probably might be INTJ. I don't know why they would either, but the amount of contradicting information, self-posts and karma grabs I see on here lead me to see this.Yes. The actions are similar but the thought route to get to said actions will be different.Im definitely not denying you are INTJ (even though it may have sounded that way). I actually commend the way that you have typed yourself, and with seemingly consistent results. I wish more people were like this, however it would be wrong of me to not acknowledge that everyone is different. I do agree that personalities do have a degree of elasticity over large periods of time (for examples, anyone who is interested should check out Bronfenbrenner's psychosocial theory)./r/shittymbtiJohn Kasich, but lets be real, the new world order has already decided their next puppet for US office.

Quite simple. The breeze is flowing, gently shaking it. How? If you can visualize it, zooming in grass starts as a seed, develops roots by growing, grows by mitotic cell division, cells are kept from lysing by cell walls, semi-permeable membranes beneath cell walls allow for nutrient and water absorption to keep the cell alive through integrated passage proteins, the membranes are made of cholesterol which is a lipid (type of fat), and proteins are made of long chains of amino acids. Amino acids are peptones, carbons, nitrogens, and lipids are long carbon chains bound to hydrogens on every side. These form because of electrical forces called electronegativity which can predict likelyhood of bond formation. These atoms form electronegativity and thus their own electrochemical properties by the number of and shape of electrons surrounding each atom, which creates a charge. Charge is also balanced by the number of protons in the nucleus of each atom. 

This is what thinking with Ti is like. 24/7. Thinking how this system works, how it interacts with this system, and forming explanations until you have this massive model that connects topics from microbiology, biology, chemistry, physics, and more into a framework. You can not turn it off. And what can you do with it? Most of the time, *absolutely nothing*. 

But sometimes its useful when your dumb friend does some stupid shit like drinking while on his ADHD medicine, and nobody can figure out why he is passed out. Who knows, you might even save a life.

Ti is always processing things in real time. Why does this happen? How does this happen, what could cause this, what evidence do I have to work with here? This is constantly running through my head, and this is the reason why I'm pretty quiet.Of which only 3% of self-proclaimed INTJs have because the rest can't trade mbti pinterest memes for actual researchI got ESTP and INTP before I came to the conclusion of ISTP. From hearing from others, it weights intuition heavier in the population making some people believe they are N when they are S, and vice versa. Also the "-A" and "-T" is fluttery bullshit. And then dichotomies, which are just dumb, unless you're a facebook mom who sells candles on etsy and think it's a 'really intelligent and official test'! Seriously just take the official MBTI (or a fumctions test online) or research cognitive functions, save yourself the hassle.This is the way to do it. Send them snaps throughout the day and eventually ask "when ya wanna hang out next?"

If they say "idk" they're probably making excuses.

I think about what is the next best move.
I cannot stop moving.ESFP"Don't make me have to tell you again old man!"You raise the rule 3, but im only discriminating against people who aren't intj and think they are. And no, you can't change who you are, but you can stop pretending to be someone you're clearly not.

Also this post is older than Mr Krabs' mattress, how did you find this?No.Dad: ISFJ  Mom: INFP  Brother: ENFJ

Growing up I felt like the black sheepDont be such an elitist. No type is best over any, all excel in different areas. Be rationalYour humor was obviously unsuccessful.Funny you bring up Sherlock as he is also the posterchild of all the elitist INTJs. Are you hiding something, /u/ejvyaa ?Thats actually fucking hilariousLiterally kept the material dark background

I get unbelievable amounts of shit for it
It's a function that you're confident in, but don't care about using for its own sake.Ti doms are just trying to figure things out all the time.  The world is full of mysteries and clues, and we just want to solve the puzzle.INTP:  I got ENFJ as my ideal partner.  Surprise!INTP

I like the idea of ENFJs, but the ones I know are manipulative.  So maybe ESFJ or INFJ?  Idk.At the risk of sounding pretentious: if you don't understand it, you likely aren't an N type.

Edit: That's not saying sensors can't understand, I'm just saying that intuitives *live and breathe* this process, and it wouldn't make sense for an intuitive to not understand.Exactly what I'm saying.  It's not like I'm actively diverting attention away from the real world in order to reach these esoteric truths (which as an Ne dom, they aren't a lot of the time), it's just like I'm noticing hints and clues that spark some kind of unconscious flood of ideas.  It's more like these things are presented to me.My ENFJ roommate is absolutely obsessed with Smash Bros Melee, if that counts.But the function itself is focused on it.Hence your miscomprehension.  It's like a magic eye poster.  You can focus on the image, but your eyes are necessarily unfocused for it to work.But if you understood what it meant, then why does it matter?WexI do, but most ENTPs probably aren't this way.I'd say Te is more predictable than Si.If Te strives to optimize every situation it is in, then in its eyes there is only *one* best way to approach any given situation (i.e. The approach that will maximize returns).  The only trouble lies in figuring out what returns it is trying to maximize in any given situation.

Si derives its conclusions from subjective factors that you aren't privy to (in most cases).  So even if there are two situations that you deem similar and would predict a specific Si user to behave the same in, there's a chance that there could be some kind of subjective innervation inherent in one of these situations that you weren't aware of that delineates the two.  Si is about details, and if they spot a detail that you didn't see, then they will respond in a way that you don't expect.  So I guess if you understood the whole of an Si user's life experiences you could call them predictable, but you couldn't from any practical standpoint.I don't think it's quite that easy.  If watching Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom taught me anything I think you need to eat the hearts of your fallen enemies to gain their powers.  Harambe did nothing wrong!And vice versaThe way I understand it, Ne tries to understand the way the world works, and Ni tries to understand the way the world develops.  Ne sees patterns and connections and says to itself "here is what I can do with it" and Ni sees patterns and connections and says "here's where this is heading".

Think about how they interact with their respective judging functions:  Ne pairs with Ji and Ni pairs with Je.  Ji is focused on principles that always work, and Ne tries to find out what these are through inferences it makes.  Je is focused on find the most effective principles to apply so that the world develops according to the Ni user's perceptions.  Ni (with Se) is predictive for the purpose of practicality where Ne (with Si) is exploratory for the purpose of understanding its experience.Take notes.  Make predictions when you first meet people, and then check them later.  If you were right, awesome.  If not, adjust your criteria.Dammit Flux, don't make me reconsider my type *again*.The ENFJ will manipulate someone else into doing it for them.Tripping makes everyone an N dom for a little bit lol.I've never been able to nail down my type for more than a week or so, but I think INTJ is more likely than INFJ, tbh.  

From my understanding, Feeling and emotions are only loosely correlated.  To me, Feeling is more closely related to ethics, morality, and some kind of standard of acceptability (with its source being either internal or external depending on the function's attitude).  The reason I think I might be an INTJ (over INFJ at least) is because I tend to do what I think is best, versus what might be the most acceptable universally.  Originally, I thought this might be inferior Fe, but now I think it might be some kind of Ni-Fi combo.  Plus, my brother is an INFJ, and I don't think we're *that* similar.  He gets worn out very quickly by being around people (I do too, but not as quickly) and he's not quite as perceptive in the moment as I am, but he's much better at saying the right thing and being in the right place at the right time (even if I'm better at predicting events).  Plus, what are the odds that two male INFJs (literally the rarest type) are brothers lol?

What makes you point to INFJ? Is it that INTPs and INFJs share judging functions?To me, Ti is about integrating what you learn into who you are.  In action it looks focused and confident (in both INTPs and ISTPs), and it's prone to short stops in speech when we gather our thoughts, but other than that, it doesn't show much on the outside.  We use lots of "if-else" language to express our ideas, and we're always interested in how things work/fit together.  We're the guys who love fixing, solving problems, inventing, and most importantly *learning*.  For example, I've just started reading and watching videos about boxing to see if I could pick up a few tricks even though I never plan on actually getting into a fight.  I love learning strategies for doing things and seeing how I can apply them to other parts of my life.  Since we naturally break down tasks and problems, it's fun to see the similarities between different tasks.Why's that?Yeah, their Ti gives their Pi structure.  Our Pi just gives us a safe place to put our Ti structures.Feeling is not emotion.  Feeling is where you draw your values from.Nope.  They aren't related.  Like I said, feeling = values.  Feeling != emotions.  Introverted feelers use a universal standard of ethics that they define themselves and extroverted feelers use adaptive ethics to navigate specific situations.  Read Jung's Psychological Types for more info.

To me, it sounds like INTJ doesn't actually know about how this works.Welcome to the ISTP masterrace.ISTP: literally Ancient Sparta.  What are you trying to say here?  Sure, there are emotional feeling types, but that's not what this system describes.  If you want to isolate someone's type using emotionality as metric you will likely be mislead.

And I don't know where the ethics vs. morality thing came from; Jung speaks in terms of ethics (interpersonal relations) regarding feeling types, and I did also.I'm not redefining emotionality, I'm clarifying what it means to be a feeler.

If a feeler finds better tools, it means they've grown.  They've, at that point, reached a stage in their maturity where not all of their decisions are value based.  The point of being a feeling dominant is that that is your primary tool in most situations.

The feeling you are talking "in-depth" with your friends about is the colloquial definition of feeling, not this type of feeling.  

Of course Jung is not the end-all-be-all of typology, but this is his work that we're using to define people's motivations.  As a dominant Ti user, Jung understands that his system uses purely *subjective logic* to define people's motivations.  There's no "Ni gene", only behaviors and reasoning that we can collectively address as Ni.  His definition of F leaves out emotionality as a metric. Colloquial "feeling" is strictly emotions i.e. "This makes me feel sad."  Typology's feeling is what I describe.

Jung's interpretations are limited because they are generalizing and strictly qualitative.  The point of typology is to create categories of cognition, not define it perfectly.  If we were trying to do that we'd use neurological terms.

But how strong is that correlation?  It can and often is misleading.  As a Ti dominant, I still have emotions and strong ones at that.  That doesn't make me any less of a thinker because they aren't related.  I also know some feeling dominant types who aren't super emotional, and that doesn't make them any less Feeler.

I guess I'm wrong then.  Good stuff.Maybe it's a Ti thing? I do that too.NiSome people say xNxPs have trouble, but I struggled with mine for a while too and I'm an ISTP.  Introverts may be harder to type.A lot of times, people say that they don't want people to be sad at their funeral.  I take that to heart and use humor and fond memories to cope.Boredom mostly.  If I'm stagnant for too long I go nuts.**What aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type?**  Pretty much all of it;  I'm riddled with contradictions.  The only thing I know for sure is that Si is not in my top two functions. 

**What do you yearn for most in life. Why?**  At this point? Some kind of idea of who I am in the eyes of others so that I might connect with them better.  Everyone gets impressions of other people, but I really want to know what type of impression I leave.  It's not even that I have poor self-awareness (people compliment me on it all the time), but that doesn't mean I understand who I am completely.  I have a bunch of long term goals I hope to fulfill also, but I won't bore you guys with the details.

**What makes you feel inferior?** I feel like I'm always speaking a different language from everyone else.  I have these ideas, but most of the time people aren't interested or don't understand them.  I'm told how smart I am all the time, but that doesn't really settle the fear that I might actually just be crazy.

**What plays a role in how you make decisions?**  I try to take all factors into account.  Long term effects, short term effects, the people my decision would affect, feasibility of my decision, if my decision is moral (i.e. would it be okay if everybody did this?), all that jazz.  I make practical and social decisions quicker than most people because I'm pretty in-tune with my environment, but if you ask me for my personal opinion on something my mind goes to so many places at once that I tend to freeze up.  There are so many different perspectives you can take on anything, why would you force me to pick one?

**When working on a project what is normally your emphasis?**  I'm definitely more result oriented.  When someone (including myself) gives me a project, its parameters and the solution just naturally form in my mind without much effort.

**How organized are you?** My mind is very organized.  I keep checklists, important dates, plans, and everything similar on the backburner almost always.  You'd never know it from my physical space though (my apartment is a disaster).

**Describe a time when you had fun.**  Oh boy, an opinion question.  To me, most things are fun.  I can have fun reading fantasy books, doing math, getting fucked up at a party, enjoying a quiet afternoon with some close friends, playing video games, planning for possible ventures I might pursue in the future, going on road trips, arguing with people, just sitting and thinking, enjoying my favorite foods, camping and outdoorsy stuff, you name it.  I don't show it on my face, but I think I have a joie de vivre that most people don't.

**How do you judge new ideas?**  Every thought that runs through my brain gets a mini-"trial and error" simulation.  I create little microcosms and see how these ideas stand up to scrutiny based on what I understand about them.  

**You find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?** Depends on the context.  In a working environment and with family, the second one.  With friends and new people, the first one.

**How do you act when stressed out?**  Depends on what I'm stressed out about.  If I'm stressed about some kind of relationship issue, I'll focus too hard on what I'm doing wrong and become insecure.  If it's a practical problem, then I'll jump up immediately and solve it by any means necessary (I've been told I can get scary when something is standing in the way of getting what I want).

**What makes you not like someone?**  Dismissiveness.  Fuck people who knock what they can't understand.  When someone calls my idea or proposal stupid, I want to know why they think it's stupid so that I might ignore similarly stupid ideas.  

**What makes you like someone?** Genuine kindness.  I can tell pretty quickly who is genuinely kind and who puts on a happy face to get people to like them.  The latter is vapid because you'll just end up getting back what you put in.  I also like someone who will let me talk about my interests and doesn't vie for a chance to speak.  I'm a pretty quiet dude, so when someone wants to listen to me, it's a big plus.

**What do you find attractive?**  I really like a girl who will get flirty with me without any sort of prompting by me.  I find that kind of confidence super attractive.  I also like it when she's smart and self-directed, but isn't too stiff to let loose and drop some acid with me.  I like it when she doesn't get stressed out easily, but doesn't let her problems go by the wayside (and if she asks me for help, I can jump in and save the day).  At the end of the day, though, I rely on the incommunicable impression that you get when you've been around a person for long enough (first impressions don't do it for me).  If she resonates with me, that's my cue to make something happen.Are there any subreddits that are overwhelmingly inhabited by a single type other than that type's subreddit?

For example, /r/outside has a lot of STPs.They are *not* related.  This problem seems to pop up a lot around here so I thought I'd clarify: feeling is a value based decision making function.  

Extroverted feeling draws its ethics from what is deemed appropriate or acceptable by those around it.  Contrary  to what most people think, Fe dominants can be stoic and impersonal if that's what it's community prizes.  Fe strives for perfection in communication so that it may structure its environment in a more harmonizing or discordant way (depending on what the Fe user thinks is necessary at the time).  Like Te, it uses its knowledge selectively and adaptively to obtain desired results in the real world.

Fi tries to find a universal ethical standard which it attempts to abide and uphold without forcing it on others.  The same way Ti wants to create a perfect system of internalized knowledge for dealing with and exploring its environment, Fi wants to create a perfect code of ethics that it can remain true to when dealing with and exploring its environment.

Out of the 3 women I've ever had feelings for, each was an xxFJ. ISFJ, ENFJ, INFJ. I'm an ISTP. All the women I've ever fallen for had Fe somewhere in their function stack. Usually primary or auxiliary. I'm probably subconsciously trying to make up for my inferior Fe. (ISTP for those who can't see the flair)Can confirm; I swear like a goddamned sailor when not focusing on being civil. -ISTPThey share the same cognitive functions but in a different order, plus they have the same internal structure of Ti &amp;amp; Ni (ISTP Ti-Ni, INFJ Ni-Ti). It helps them understand each other. Or at least that's my (ISTP) experience with one of my best friends (INFJ).

Edit: Of course, this is assuming the two of them ever come out of their respective shells enough to relate to each other in the first place. Same.Whatever happens, happens. Sure it'd suck to go before I got to do all the shit I wanna do but you almost never know when it comes. So I don't worry about it. 

What happens after death typically involves dirt or perhaps an oven. I would read that if it weren't so eye-bleed inducing. The concept of paragraphs exists for a reason.

O 69%

C 21%

E 7%

A 19%

N 26%

This is what Watson told me based on my Twitter. N should be higher (it always is on actual Big 5 tests) but it's probably low cuz I don't share my neuroticism online. Other than that they match up.

EDIT: After rereading Watson's description for "Emotional Range" I realize it's simultaneously more and less accurate than I thought. Yeah my emotions are stable and I'm not as easily upset. However, my moods are pretty much stuck at low always, which which is a lot closer to Big 5's original "Neuroticism" than Watson realizes. 
I don't understand, how come INTJ's can't pursue arts? Every INTJ will be different, so it's kind of ignorant to say "Oh, she has this type, so she must like these things!" Personality type doesn't completely apply to interests.I really like it.Slightly, yes. This is surprisingly accurate for me.Specialist (ROI-P)I agree with this theory.
Funny enough, as a blonde ISTP forest green is my favorite color and the one I wear the most.  Like, when you think of XXXX what colors pops in your mind? 
I think most of ISTP prefer musics without lyrics (at least I do). But this is one of the few song that I do like the lyrics and kinda send an "ISTP" message.

What kind of ISTP are you????

I just assume that every excuse a ENFJ tell me is just a lie now. I don't know if you have seen the recent post in /r/AskReddit about [starterpacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/54fhxi/what_starter_pack_stereotype_is_incredibly/).

The idea is simple, using prejuices and stereotypes, build an image that represent some of the different types in the MBTI personalities.

ISTP's aren't that person.You can have alternate accounts linked to the same email though.I mostly:

- pay attention to the music

- vocals are generally an 'instrument' before a voice (I can genuinely listen to a song and not hear the lyrics) A good example to me would be like how vocals are used in Animal Collective or Shpongle.

- when I pay attention to lyrics I generally read them rather than listen to them

- prefer instrumental tracks (I hate when a song is ruined because you don't like/agree with the lyrics)

edit: just some spelling errorsMagic the Gathering I think, it's a card game.Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Polvo,  NoMeansNo, Explosions in the Sky. I could go on, pretty similar taste here too. 

I really like a lot of ambient, jazz, and some hip hop/beats kind of stuff too. Portico Quartet, Caribou, Bonobo, Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Bluetech etc. Brian Eno's Music for Airports is one of my favorite albums of all time for example.I find myself sighing and shaking my head a lot.

I suppose I'm not a terrible person, within the context at least.I don't like having to split my focus between reading and watching a film so I prefer no subtitles. I can't stand watching many things that have been dubbed over though so if the film/show is in a different language I'll sacrifice ease of watching and put the subtitles on.I don't think I've ever had this many tabs open before. When I'm done with a tab I close it, no sense in wasting space or memory for something I'm not actively looking at or doing. If I ever have more than 5 tabs running it's likely because I have several pages setup as a queue of sorts.That angel would betray you for anything out of the garbage.

Then it's usually just cramming things out of sight somewhere I'll remember to look at when I need to grab what I need. It'll start organised and devolve into chaos over time. Yet somehow I always know where everything is, until someone else decides to grab something which typically leaves me with raised blood pressure lol.It's a weird thing, I can get into it when I feel compelled but if it's something expected it immediately becomes something I dread.Loners aren't lonely people. Lonely people aren't loners.Not listening to anything right now but the last song I was listening to was [If you want me to stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdorgC9qUkI) -Sly and the Family Stone.Punk rock? No. In my experience it is raw expression that is rather straight forward and emotionally driven. Black Flag, Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Descendants, Op Ivy, Dead Kennedys, even Bad Religion (Greg is sarcastic and not just some troll, what songs has he written that are intentionally misleading?). I could list off too many names in punk/hardcore but the one thing they have is a sincere and strong ideology in regards to what they believe. Punk is in and of itself concise, ideological and abrasive.I've been "social-distancing" since January, corona just gives me a valid reason for why I'm not hanging out with anyone.Anyone who calls themselves a narcissist is an idiot not worth the time or energy. Absolutely useless whether joking or not.A paper cut isn't deep.Shit, I thought they were talking about ketamine.We like to fix things, don't mean we're good at it.Why do I feel so violated?Very John Baizley, apparently he's an IxFP. I don't know I don't really go to far into typing.But what counts as thinking? Does this? BRB gonna go play some videogames.
I think the ESTP you quoted would say that because he is an *extraverted* sensor first and foremost, not just because of sensing in general. Even though I'm ISTP, I often have similar differences with ESTPs and ESFPs because I'm an introverted thinker first, so that same abstract/concrete disconnect is there.&gt;"We're all equal! You're really good at washing dishes, and I'm good a philosophy!"

This is perfect.It's just a bunch of teens jerking off about snapchat and doctor who or whateverThe part about skipping over details and just taking out the relevant pieces of info is something I do too. The details vs abstraction is a Te vs Ti thing (same for every extraverted/introverted function pair).That Se -&gt; Ni description is pretty good. I have to nitpick and say that I have plenty of concrete memories like any human being, but I get what you're saying.I was actually thinking of that scene when I wrote this post B-)The same reason all of us don't do stuff. Laziness!&gt;The biggest thing that steers me away from ISTP is that I live in my head first, and the real world second. I like repetitive or simple physical activities because it lets me zone out and think about whatever I feel like thinking about.

This is exactly what separates ISTPs from ESTPs, so ISTP is still a possibility for you. We're still introverted thinkers before anything else.Personally, I love beating people up and stealing their money.It might be introverted thinking. Here's an excerpt from Carl Jung's description of Ti:

&gt;For this kind of thinking facts are of secondary importance; what, apparently, is of absolutely paramount importance is the development and presentation of the subjective idea, that primordial symbolical image standing more or less darkly before the inner vision. Its aim, therefore, is never concerned with an intellectual reconstruction of concrete actuality, but with the shaping of that dim image into a resplendent idea. Its desire is to reach reality; its goal is to see how external facts fit into, and fulfil, the framework of the idea; its actual creative power is proved by the fact that this thinking can also create that idea which, though not present in the external facts, is yet the most suitable, abstract expression of them. Its task is accomplished when the idea it has fashioned seems to emerge so inevitably from the external facts that they actually prove its validity.Glad you said this, it's the perfect way to describe why that place is so annoying.Many articles about this stuff seem to discuss extreme cases. For "normal" Ti, adjusting the mental model to accommodate new data requires some energy, but it's not going to dramatically break a person. r/entjRick's definitely ESTPTotally would, brahLol @ acting like that doorslam bullshit is some serious special thing. Most of the time people don't even realize the INFJ stopped talking to them.They get DOORSLAMMEDBill and Ted, from Bill and Ted's Excellent AdventureI relate a lot to this too. I think one of the distinctions between us and the Ni-dominant INxJs is the part about "working through it" and "until I reach a conclusion" -- the analysis and conclusions are the Ti and Fi doing their thing, since those are rational/judging (you could maybe call them "concluding") functions.A flattering thought, but I don't think ISTPs could claim to be the only, or the best. At the very least, you would have to include INTPs. They're both of the same Ti clade, both equally Ti. And Fi is as equally abstracting and analyzing of a function as Ti, just with a focus on different subject matters. 

Fi is something like moral philosophy or aesthetic analysis, while Ti might do something like economic analysis or evolutionary theories. Fi might ask "why is this considered good?", and Ti might ask "why is this considered correct?", but they both analyze. So at the very least, you need to include all four IxxP types as "analytical".

Furthermore, depending on how broad of a definition you use for analysis, you could make a case for any function or group of functions being analytical, so I would be hesitant to proclaim any as the "best".Probably Ni. You tend to see a concrete situation such as the girl on Facebook, and then abstract that into a general thought or image, such as "good girls use Tinder too". The connection between a girl who smiles to make the group feel good and the concept of a person who doesn't need to be part of a group -- that's another example of Ni drawing a universal mental image from specific circumstances.

Ne is an extraverted function, so it's more concerned with external reality. All the examples you mentioned involve some kind of takeaway that exists in your own mind, which is what introverted functions do.

Introverted = abstracting = "draw away from" (which is what abstract means in Latin)Do they seriously use "openness to experience" as their basis for S vs. N? That's disappointing.The type of woman who is interested in MBTI, and actually feels it's significant enough to remember their type and talk about it on dates, will usually identify with the INFJ label.We could definitely use some links to some Jung resources in the sidebar. I think if more people read the source material directly, we could get a lot of fresh perspectives.Great, another infographic to make 20 year old business majors act like pricks.ISTPs and INTPs are more similar to each other than ISTJs and INTJs, if that helps any. Both of the IxTPs share introverted thinking as the primary mode of engaging the world, whereas introverted sensing and introverted intuition are two different animals.The short answer is "it's just some shit somebody made up".I also agree with the other posters saying that ESFJs actually do have some future orientation. Their perception of the world is through Si-Ne, and Ne is a function that is generally aware of possibilities and developments in the outside world. I sometimes think that the Si/Ne crowd are often clean and organized because their Ne makes them think about the possibilities of *not* being clean and organized -- you might miss your flight because you can't find your hat, or your kitchen will become a breeding ground for bacteria if you leave food out.

Anecdotally, I live with an ESFJ and an ENFJ. The ESFJ has a healthy concern for where her career is going and what steps she needs to take in the future. The ENFJ smokes weed and loves astrology and tarot cards, the kind of universal archetype stuff that Ni loves.Technically yes. But the weird twisty hierarchy of "shadow functions" where the 7th is somehow, for some reason, weaker than the 8th, is based on literally nothing.You seem pretty tenseEveryone cuts people out of their lives, but only the people who use the INFJ label are narcissistic enough to have a silly little nickname for itI wouldn't be sad if that policy were changed. Type Me threads don't ruin my day, but it's also not fun to see a lot of them at once.Fi is a pretty guarded function, according to Jung. "Still waters run deep"I think a lot of the INTPs online are just mistyped ISTPs. But since we have way more socially inept Ti people going against the crowd under the INTP label, it's the INTPs that get most of the focus.

A lot of ISTPs are out there clumsily navigating social situations and missing emotional cues, but they're calling themselves INTPs while they're doing it.Obviously there's no way I can be certain, but the main reason is that most ISTP descriptions are generally shallow, and really don't even describe an introverted thinker. They seem to describe a quiet extraverted sensor, so most Ti primaries won't see themselves in the description, and will more likely choose INTP. The INTP profiles usually have at least some element of "Ti primary" in them.

Most mainstream MBTI literature seems to overlook the fact that ISTPs are introverted thinkers to the exact same degree as INTPs, so there really isn't even a true ISTP description out there. The closest I can get is "read Jung's profile of introverted thinking, and then read what he wrote about extraverted sensing, and blend them together with Ti being dominant".

But yea, the type of person that I believe to be ISTP is a Ti-dominant and Fe-inferior goofball just like their INTP counterpart. But since both IxTPs will default to the INTP description, the INTPs get the awkward reputation. Everyone thinks the ISTPs are out there riding motorcycles and being cool, but really they're just posting on r/INTP without realizing they could belong in r/ISTPThis still begs the question of why I should consider Myers' and Briggs' changes as "improvements", rather than unnecessary distortions and steps in the wrong direction. Te also makes better followers.I think Mitsubishi Fukushima (an anime character I made up) is obviously an INTJ, because he's smarter than everyone else and always knows what his rivals are going to do next.INTPs are bad at managing relationships because they'll prioritize intellectual purity over just enjoying what other people are enjoying (Ti-Fe, so same goes for ISTPs). INTJs are bad at managing relationships because they're literally the Time Cube guy.I think of him as an unrealistically intelligent ISTJ superhero who could never exist in real lifeTime moves at a regular speed for me. I'm often late for things, but I'm totally aware of it when I'm doing it.

Maybe Se-dominants are sharp dressers, but as an Se-auxiliary, I'm definitely not. I've bought a minimum of shirts and pants with the goal of not looking like an idiot, as opposed to trying to look great. I'm the type of guy who would wear the exact same thing every day if I could get away with it. When Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs do it, they get praised as efficient geniuses, but since I'm not a tech billionaire, people would probably just think I was autistic.

The sensor/intuitive split is closer to 50/50, and a lot of the intuitives here are just mistyped sensors. I wouldn't be surprised if half of the ENTP posters are just whacky ESTJs who've had too much adderall.It's almost as magical as ENFP-ISTJ.Are you smoking a bunch of weed? Semi-serious questionYou just have to believe in yourself.Sometimes I think about how every animal I eat is technically my distant cousin.The mainstream ISTP description is a video game character, not a real person. Functions are the only way to determine if you’re ISTP.

The reason you can relate to the INTP descriptions is because they at least describe an *introverted thinker*, albeit just one variation of the multiple kinds of introverted thinkers who exist. The ISTP profiles describe a quarter of a human being who likes to go snowboarding and change motor oil or whatever the fuck.You sound like an introverted thinker, so you’re either INTP or ISTP.YepHello thereAccording to the functions, very different from INFPs. I tend to get along with INFPs though. Both types tend to be independent thinkers. When I’m with them I can usually enjoy the mutual mystery.The issue is that other people respond, upvote, and keep the front page full of garbage. People affect other people, believe it or not.Abstract mental images that don’t correspond to physical reality, but unify multiple threads of symbolic reality into unified images.

“A boot stomping on a human face forever” is a mental image that represents the tyrannical government in George Orwell’s 1984. The government is characterized by surveillance cameras, torture, prisons, language control, and constant brainwashing — not literal boots on literal human faces (unless you’re getting beaten by a prison guard wearing boots, but that’s a coincidence). It’s a symbolic representation of existence under such a government. Everyone can understand this because everyone has Ni.

A person with dominant Ni will generally have more of these kinds of images going through their mind compared to others, and has a brain adept at perceiving these images in great depth and detail.I personally think that the majority of r/intj posters are extroverted thinkers (dominant Te) who lack a certain manic social energy that the self-identified ENTJs have. I believe this because social extroversion is different from cognitive extroversion, and most INTJs tend to greatly emphasize how logical, factual, and reality-based they are — all of those are Thinking (whether it’s Te or Ti).

Ni-dominants are rare, and they are often *crazy*. Ni’s are the people who believe in magical yoga healing crystals, or will corner you at a party and start ranting about the Illuminati.Pretty good write-up. You’ve done a good job of contrasting how introversion and extroversion affect perception.I’m having trouble understanding your criticism. Does a desire need an explanation for its existence? Desires and agendas are just natural cognitive phenomena for any intelligent animals.I’m down like a clown Charlie BrownThis looks like a lot of words for no purpose in particular, to be honest. It’s good to see you have a lot of thoughts bouncing around your head though.I think it’s great.Hyperactive vs. inattentive, which could maybe apply to every extroverted/introverted pair.What do these pluses and minuses mean?Thanks, that doesn’t help at allI just want some links to Carl Jung’s writings in the sidebar. You know, the guy whose ideas are the basis for all this shit.I’ve never gone around exposing fake psychics or anything like that, but I have a low tolerance for people who aren’t genuine. And frustratingly, I seem to pick up on “fake” people faster than most of my friends, who end up thinking I’m just being an asshole until a few days/weeks/months later (however long it takes them to discover for themselves that someone’s personality is a bullshit facade).Ti is totally about autism and conspiracy theories, but that post is otherwise correct.I'm ISTP, and in general I think the ISTP sub and other local corners of the internet are pretty decent. There are enough people who identify as ISTP to generate some discussions (the subreddit isn't a ghost town like some of the other sensor subs), but there also isn't an overwhelming amount of noise and stupidity. 

The only downside is that a lot of discussions seem kind of dry, and it wouldn't hurt for the ISTPs to loosen up a bit. We could use a bit more fun and pizzaz. Not too much, but just a little extra.

I'd like to hear from other types about what you like and dislike about your subreddit and larger online community.Thinking and feeling conflict with one another just like sensing and intuition, but we just gloss over that fact. It also seems like the community tacitly assumes a nearly equal split between T and F, but we're supposed to accept that only 20% of the world are wonderful misunderstood intuitives. It all seems really arbitrary.

Edit: Just to elaborate with an example, I'm talking about stuff like the theories about how amazing ENFP/INTJ or ENTP/INFJ pairings can be, but an ENFP/ISTJ couple might not work as well. It's as if love can conquer any T/F divide, but N/S is just too much. 

2nd edit: I think the population split between S/N is close to 50/50, rather than 80/20. I don't have any proof, but hey, neither does anyone else.
I'm certainly very punctual ;)S types can still find it interesting, they'd just prefer to use it for its real life, practical applications than N types I'd wager. For example I simply find it fun to try and type my friends.http://www.celebritytypes.com/infj.phpI'd like to see one of these for ISTPs and INTPs I rarely get angry at people at all but video games and other things malfunctioning drives me crazy. When Call of Duty lags I have a tendency to scream profanities &gt;Psychopaths, narcissists and so on who don't care about other people usually test as 100% T.

You got a source for that? They're definitely more T but a lot will have something that drives them to actually do things. That's the hidden/lowkey F.[Butters can do the talking](https://i.imgur.com/yBoieTw.jpg)The Big Five is more valid 

(but MBTI is more fun).Obviously bullshit.. but since we're playing along I'd swap INTJ and ENFJ

that's because he's an ISFJjust based on your responses to people. I don't think you're an ISTPthey're functions related to the subject. naturally have "selfish" tendencies lol, sorry. i don't think I even read past the titlei've always loved tim and ericcould be somewhat true, though i know STJ's, NFJ's, NTPs, NFPs, and NTJ's who found certain tim and eric skits just as funny.Dad: INFP

Me: ISTPHe's a definite strong Ni user. I was surprised to see him typed as ENTJ, but I can see it. Doesn't fit the stereotype of a Te dom. 

I haven't listened to him recently, but I first guess was INxJ leaning toward INFJ. Guess I was wrong.not turning my headthat's easy. INFPINFP's...not even onceu wot&gt;but if to hypothetical weird stuff

i.e nonsense that doesn't go anywhere&gt; Pretending to be offering information that contributes to the discussion when really they just want you to think a certain way about them (that they're smart, or cool, or worldly)

having music on distracts you from really learning what you're trying to learn. there have been studies on it that I'm not going to look up, so you'll have to take my word for it.their function order is N T F S, but they're still quite differentdont talk to me or my wife's son ever againthey're istps flipped upside downtruenihilism ISTP*Have you watched any other videos with Mcafee?

Saying only X are capable of Y is silly. I type him as ISTPI don't like Doug Stanhope. 

well, I say ISTP for Mcafee. 
terrible surveyWhat ever label you want to put on it, I've seen from experience that it has a lot of truth. It's not like it tries to describe personality. It's just a framework for cognition. teeth clenched apologies dont want to sound like a dick or nothing but you talk like a fag and shits all retardeddon't have one because i'm not a man childx% sexual. what does that even mean?i exited out immediately estjabout tree fiddyyesyour comment, but I didn't put too much thought into iton the right side. under mbti and unsubscribe. next to your username.i think your ntp is actually stpYes, I thought he was an ENFJ, but leaned toward ENTJ. same auxiliary and all that. I was sure he didn't use Ne/Sihe's not enfpprobably not mbti / jung theory though.

i was watching joe rogan podcast and he barely even remembered the letters. 

So "knowing yourself" doesn't mean you have an inherit understanding of MBTI, and understanding MBTI doesn't mean you understand every facet of one's personality.i didn't downvote you. I see no Ne at all. I'm set on thati quite like him. i don't agree with everything he says though"Captivated"

Because I can't listen to what he says and agree with it. I have to be entranced and hypnotized. 

I like a combatant of the left that promotes a victim culture. The SJW, trans-movement, race baiting nonsense. 

Don't agree? You're a bigot!

This is why we have Trump, by the way. People are sick of this mentality shoved down their throat. The safe spaces, obesity is beautiful, ect. 

Again, there's a lot of what he says that I disagree with, but I'm able to set that aside and not label him as you have.
YOU'RE A FUCKING WHITE MALE!!!!!

gotta love reddit downvotes. really promotes discussion.
Disagree. He's an Se user with inferior Fi
I have him as an Se userYea I agree with ESFP now. I had him as ENTJkek this
Ti / Ni loops happen for an ISTP when we don't get outside and do stuff. We process the same information over and over again until we're depressed. Stimulating Se is the way out, but for some reason, even if we know this to be true, something keeps us from actually doing it.i do. he was a lot smarter than people gave him credit for. had a lot of insight into the types&gt;Fi users are more genuine, in a sense

All such sweeping generalizations. Really silly. Sad!


Please, if you're at a point where MBTI is setting limits for yourself, just stop. take a break. [nothing](http://imgur.com/dpy6oNg)it means youre dumbdumbHank Green is an INTP.

you are confirmed for infpwutWhat type do you think he is?

[removed][removed]
I'll give it a try! Just shoot me some information!For the Fe v Ti

Does he seek harmony in the outside world, or organize his thoughts to an objective standard?
Think about how he thinks, not how he behaves... How does he legitimize his actions.
In many situations there are many ways of getting to a particular behavior... how he gets to that behavior is the part we are considering. 
Because he knows himself best, he could very well be an INFP.  For Fi we have...

&gt;This type is difficult to understand because so little appears
on the surface. According to Jung, the expression "Still waters
run deep" applies to such persons.90 To the extent that they
are one-sided, they will seem to have no feeling and no
thoughts at all. This is easily misunderstood as coldness or indifference on the one hand, and stupidity on the other.

&gt;Jung describes the aim of introverted feeling as "not to adjust
itself to the object, but to subordinate it in an unconscious
effort to realize the underlying images"

page 75 http://www.innercitybooks.net/pdf/books/personalitytypes.pdfWhy are they struggling?  What can I do to alleviate the tension?The types are merely preference.  We can exhibit all types.  The idea may be to develop and integrate a full range of personality, or be flexible and respect differences.

Thinking as I type here, I think that the variety of personality types create a sense of balance as well try to integrate ourselves into the larger human group.
How do you guys know what type your friends or acquaintances are? Do you casually go up to them and ask "hey take this test i need to know what type you are"?  
Im seriously curiousHow can i learn more and start typing people and myself on my own? Is that even possible for every type? Im an ISTP, if i can trust the 2 tests i did. I would like to know if its accurate and i would love to type my friends.
Close friend of mine is an INFP and she likes to join in on little projects I'm doing which is enjoyable for both of us.

Sometimes she gets really prideful, which can be annoying but nothing too serious.

While I typically throw caution to the wind she typically tries to hold me back to and make sure I don't hurt myself, which has its pros and cons. 

Overall: pretty cool in my opinion Mike from Breaking Bad
Fuck off.You need to put age too. Just type vs salary isn't very good for data because you could have 100 entps who are 18 say the lowest, and 100 estps who are 50 say 100,000k.

With this survey there are too many uncontrolled variables.I dunno man, I laugh at everything. Even -- true story, when I hear someone famous died. It's just a thing.I don't drink. Too much money, too much work.Figured we should get a sensor in here. I don't play many video games anymore, way too busy. But I'll usually choose one and stick with it. Like engineer for tf2, Maya for borderlands 2, etc. I only really like to play games with others anymore, solo games are boring now for some reason.Nah, she's too much of an idiot for that.

It would be nice if there were permanent links for each of the pages and browser history support.It's _much_ better. Thanks!ISTP - JavaScript is my favorite, and Python would probably come next. Closure is also fun but I don't have much experience with it.
i don't need alcohol to be an idiotwell first off i'm pretty shitty at this entire typing thing, so i'll probably be going off of how well i can relate to certain people as opposed to trying to base it entirely off of studying their functions because 1. i haven't studied functions in depth and 2. that's difficult to do with celebrities. currently i'm working on that with fictional characters.

i don't know of many famous female istp's, but i definitely agree with the scarlett johansson typing and kristen stewart. she wears her istp right on her face. 

as for fictional istp's a few i can name off the top of my head are gogo from big hero 6, catwoman, tris from divergent (i hate that series with a passion but she's definitely istp), and katniss everdeen in the movies struck me as an istp as well. i will tell you that i've seen kate austen from lost typed as istp and i personally think that's bullshit.i tried basketball in middle school because i was taller than everyone, so they assumed i would be good and so did i. it was a small town too so a load of pressure was put on us from the beginning due to those other small town rivalries. 

but yeah we lost every game and got to hear old people screaming and cursing at us in the audience each time. so no, i don't really hold an interest in sports anymorei tend to treat a romantic relationship like a friendship. i really struggle with showing affection, even the simple stuff like saying 'i love you' every once in a while. mostly i just love to tease and do stuff with them. which isn't any different from my friendships. 

also commitment is definitely something i have a hard time with. i have a lot of plans and i'm worried that getting married will screw those up.infp - i know two infp's. one of them hates me and the other is my best friend. it's difficult to generalize them because of that since they seem so different to me, but they both act kind of distant and withdraw a lot into doing their own thing. they both seem to love music. but my friend is hilarious and one of the most comforting people i know

infj - i find them to be very interesting to talk to. always clever and bright and open to talking about things we disagree on without letting sensitivities to get in the way

enfj - i've only known one enfj and that did not go well. he was WAY too sensitive and most of our time was spent fighting.

enfp - overwhelmingly warm and friendly people. idk how you guys find the energy

intj - it's cool when they open up to you about their interests because they're always very knowledgeable. they ramble like nobody's business and all you have to do is smile and nod, but i don't mind it

entj - i've never had any run-ins with an entj but they sound pretty badass

entp - a few that i've met are hard to be around (not so much because of their entp-ness) but others are very fun to be around and helpful. they always seem to know what they're doing

intp - i see you guys all over reddit and i've never seen a dumb comment from any of you. but for some reason whenever they ask a question i feel like it's being used for a gigantic scientific survey or some shit

esfj - my grandpa was an esfj and he was the best guy i've ever known and ever will meet i think. and i'm not biased because he was my grandpa. he was just a class dude. i don't know any others though

esfp - not sure i could ever be serious friends with one, but they all seem to have some kind of talent that they're just amazing at. 

isfj - some of the shyest and most anxious people i've met are isfj's but they will not rest until you have what you need. they never stop serving you when you're in their home. i know it's a stereotype, but they're just so good at serving others

isfp - they're so hard to spot so i'm not sure how many i've known. they honestly perplex me. but they all seem friendly and popular even if they don't try

estj - i've never met an estj who hasn't had their shit together. i like their straight to business attitude and skills in leadership

estp - funnest people to be around by far. my estp friend isn't afraid of anything and doesn't give a fuck what people think of her as long as she's having fun. my best times were spent with her

istj - very set in their ways. they hate deviating from routine and EVERYTHING has to be planned. my mom's an istj and i don't know how many times i've had to tell her to just relax. i love their sense of humor though

istp - cool

and yeah, i've struggled with being true to myself and trying to be something i'm not just to fit in. i was a tomboy ever since i was born and i didn't care until i hit junior high. i cut my hair short and this rumor went around that i was a lesbian (in a christian school).

so after that i started caking on makeup and really getting into fashion. i started trying to change my more masculine mannerisms and my deep voice. but now i'm completely comfortable with myself and i don't care what people think of me anymore.

kept my hair short too ;)imagine ginnifer goodwin with the face of sylvester stalloneyesi don't believe i've come across an intp irl, but i do tend to see a lot of you guys fulfilling that stereotype. but i think it's pretty cool. i would really be interested in having an intp as a friend. i think it could be interesting to see how that would play out. you guys just seem really cool and i can't wait to finally find one in the outside world 😅well you do a good job of faking it1. i've never had the pleasure of meeting an intp face to face, but judging from your type descriptions and your internet presence, you seem like pretty cool people. out of all the types, i think an intp is the type i would most want to be friends with. can't explain why, i'd just be interested to see how that would play out

2. ti - i've noticed that i tend to rationalize everything that i see or hear. i can analyze a differing opinion, compare it to other things i've seen or heard and after a while i can kind of see where they're coming from, even if i still disagree. there's other ways, but noticing this was my first indicator that i'm ti dominant. oh, and i've gotten into the habit of asking myself a million questions a day and writing them down so i can look it up or figure it out later

se - this is simple. i love to workout and hike. any opportunity i have to experience something new i jump into without hesitation.

ni - i do live mostly in the moment, but i find myself mapping out my future a lot career wise. i've already got a detailed plan worked out that i'm still internally tweaking as i learn new things about how the world works. i'm well adept at predicting how most situations will go down too.

fe - the only time my fe comes out is when i'm backed into a corner or when a very very touchy spot is prodded at. it's like my entire personality changes for a second. i start to spill out things that i normally would tell no one and i rant about things that really shouldn't bother me. me: istp

mom: istj

dad: enfpi recommend checking out the individual functions for istp's instead of basing it on the stereotypes. the type descriptions are a framework based on the functions, but it doesn't always apply to an istp.

i'm without a doubt an istp, but i could give a shit about mechanics. i hate sports. but i know for a fact that i'm an istp because i know i rely heavily on Ti.1. I get along pretty easily with almost everybody I meet and if I tried I would probably have quite a bit of friends. But I'm picky and have a very strong sense of loyalty, so I prefer only a few friends. I don't quite have the energy to have any more than that. If I did then I would have a lot of half-assed friendships instead of a few really good ones.

2. I consider myself more of a big picture sort of person. I'm aware of the details and I can handle them, but it's important for me to know what the details lead to ultimately. If that makes sense.

3. I was raised in a religious household, so a lot of my morals have been sort of built into me. But because of who I am, I see that it comes from a degree of practicality as well. More often than not, my moral decisions are made through logic instead of falling back to a set of rules.

4. Very. I've never had a problem with a deadline as far as I can remember although I tend to save things for the last moment. I rarely get stressed about those kinds of things.1. New places only make me uncomfortable if I'm surrounded by unfamiliar people. A family reunion puts me off more than going to another country for the first time.

2. I like facts better. Theories confuse me.

3. Truth. I just find it more respectful to be honest with people instead of catering to their feelings. In the long run, it does them more good.

4. Not at all!why the hell noti started watching this recently because there's nothing left for me to watch on netflix. the earlier episodes gave me this odd impulse in my legs to run and never stop until i'm horribly mangled in a ravine.

but hey i'm on season 2 now and a last resort actually turned out to be a pretty good show. 

anyways yeah i'm curious to see everybody's typings for the characters. i've seen a few that i don't really understand the reasoning for (such as bellamy as istp) so if you could explain your reasoning for a few that are less than obvious that would be greatI've been convinced I'm ISTP for a while, but now I'm unsure.

So.

Ask me things.
Make me analyze myself.
HAVE AT ME!
I intended to include my cognitive functions results in the original post - Ne - Se = Ti - Ni - Fe

which types me as ENTP, yet I don't necessarily resonate with ENTP's characteristic of following an idea to the end for its own sake. Also, I tend to mirror ISTP's characteristic to take what works and combine those to aid in your craft/skill. I am in my head a lot, like a dominant Ti, but what comes out of me can be random and never dull.

In The 16 Personality Types: Descriptions for Self-Discovery  by Dr. Linda Berens, ENTP is described as someone who enjoys learning how others live their lives, which I find myself doing a lot. When I talk to people, I tend to ask personal questions to get to know them and build a profile of them so I'll know how to deal with them in the future.

I also took that 16 Personalities test. Long test with ambiguous questions. I don't fully trust those kinds of sites, however. It's pretty much the result of astrology and cognitive functions mixed together - not much as reliable as cognitive functions, though more plausible than astrology.There are more types other than the 16 - it's called Big 5 personality.

http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2013/04/the-difference-between-the-extroverted-and-introverted-functions/You might want to read up on negativistic PD.ENTP - PapyrusTert Fe seeks interaction with people and discussing ideas. Inferior is like an owl, just observing and showing a degree of compliance when instructed to perform a task.This says nothing about one's type.ENFJ is my guess. My ENFJ acquaintance likes to consume material and ask questions about it, like the ones you ask (how did they come up with the idea? etc), though that alone is NOT how I reached my conclusion.Fighting injustices in the world would be pretty solid start.They ARE horoscopes. And they're not even all the same in terms of how they grade your results. Really unreliable, but it's actually pretty reliable the more the person taking the test is new to this whole thing.

Actually, I think that the more you familiarize yourself with this, the more you begin to see discrepancies between the typical descriptions of the profiles and your way of life. Thus begins a seemingly endless spiral of mistyping and typing and mistyping and typing until you go nuts and end up in depression plauged by identity disorder.Spot on.. they're freaking boring and tedious and predictable. 

still love em.

to a certain point.Thanks!Arctic, got it. Thanks for reading!Thanks!Oh I know it's an awesome field. I'll check it out. Thanks!I've gotten ENTJ before. Thanks for reading!Thanks!steve jobs is mistyped as entp because of his type 7 (he's istp).ISTP, ISFJsLOL WHAT?Were you drunk when you posted this? You probably are, sick fuck. Q_QDescribe him.Man, when I read the title I knew immediately what this was going to be about.

I have a coworker who was recently hired. When I introduced myself to them during lunch, I typed them as an ENTP after spending a few lunch dates with them, but something told me that wasn't enough. I just had to find out, and I went far - I gave them a pretty short but accurate test, and voila - INFJ! 

My theory is that INFJs are one of the most talkative 'introverted' types, most likely due to a Judging function dominating their function stack, followed by Fe.Your Te could apply to Si/Se. You need to improve your description of Te.

"How can I organize such and plan such to achieve a goal?"

Upvote if you agree, downvote and comment if you disagree.With alcohol, I become damn psychopathic. I seek fights and arguments with anyone I see and perceive as a threat. I let loose and let my animalistic nature take over.I love beer.What's your enneagram type?Why do you think people are hesitant to give out compliments in video games? Why so much toxicitiy?Can this be possible, where you test Ne-Ti on a cognitive functions test but the classic MBTI descriptions of ISTP (realistic, independent, can be cold, aloof) fits you better overall, or you test as ISTP in one of those pop personality tests? It's my understanding that the Ti-Fe function axis can look similar even when combined with Se/Ne, since Se/Ne are merely objectively processing functions, so that could cause some confusion. Just because someone looks/talks like an ISTP doesn't mean she's ISTP, a very common yet misinformed method of typing people. It would make more sense if we could either:

1. 'Illegalize' the old classical MBTI analytics and replace with cognitive functions.

2. Make a finer distinction between MBTI and cognitive functions, even allowing for its own separate domain of knowledge and field.

3. Just nuke the world and be done with this nonsense bullshit.

Would you attest to the existence of a person who is functionally ENFJ but outputs the image of an ISFJ? who is functionally ISFP but on the test comes out to be ENFP? 

Maybe enneagram plays a role in this mess?We have types that are energized by following whatever physical impulses come their way (Se) or jumping from an idea to another (Ne), or regarding Te, organizing your life and following through with your plans. 

But I'm wondering which type becomes energized by the following ways:

-reading informative/educational material, such as how-to's (like a new skill)

-being exposed to a different and unique perspective of the world

-discovering hidden secrets (such as obtaining copies of banned written material for curiosity)

-obtaining new applicable knowledge/solution (i.e., ah-ha, now I know what to do!)

-very specific but perhaps helpful example: reading up on an article about psychology of war and thinking about how the future would like after Generation Y &amp; Z (the generations that grew up with Facebook/Instagram/selfies) takes over the world, and how wars would start (are the motivations the same as before, or different)

I just want to know what my type is (strongly debating between ENTP and ISTP) and any feedback on this could be of huge help, even though the relationship between this thread and my goal might not make sense; let's just say my brain works in special ways. Maybe some can gain some benefit from this discussion.

Thank you!But maybe I'm wrong, and maybe that made you click and now you're here. I really just wanted to talk to you about myself and hope that you would be able to come up with your guess on my type. I spent a lot of time and care in creating this post. Any feedback would be valued.

Let's begin with the most talked about one- parties.

* I don't have a solid stance on parties. There are parties where I'll enjoy and stay til the sun rises, and those where I'll be one of the first to leave. In my experience, I found that I enjoy parties with a smaller group of around 10~15 people, most of whom I personally know. With large parties (30+ people), I get social anxiety, but with a drink or two in my system and with lots of interesting and willing people to talk to, I will manage. I get energy out of making a solid presentation of myself and gathering information, facts, and the thought-processes about the people I'm conversing with. I feel better after a conversation that went well. Yet most of the time, I'm not quite at ease in public. It's just a matter of how well you can deal with it yourself.

* Communication is easy and natural for me. I'm able to clearly articulate my thoughts and ideas as well as enjoy breaking down complex concepts into simple layman terms. Friends constantly reach out to me for advice/proofreading when they're working on their graduate school essays. Small talk is a skill, a skill I've learned but not quite yet mastered. There are factors that seem to have slowed my progress down, such as today's reliance on textual communication. I am actually VERY bad at texting, which played a huge factor in the downfalls of my past relationships. My womanizing friend constantly tells me to use emoticons while texting her. I tried for a while and decided that it's best to keep emoticons at minimal, if not never. The reason for this is because I find it slightly uncomfortable in revealing my emotions and feelings, and I'd rather keep it neutral and gray. So, I'd much rather communicate in-person, as I'm adept at reading body language and facial cues to really know what the person's thinking. Body language doesn't lie, but making wild guesses during text conversations can lead to fatal disasters. Phone communication is also good. It keeps each other on our toes and doesn't give us infinite time to come up with the perfect reply to every reply. It's there; it's real and raw. No smartass answers, and best of all, once the conversation is over, it's gone.

* Regarding life(style), I take things as they come with limited devotion to planning and following-through. Planning my weekend out is pretty relaxing and chill during the planning phase, but I'm the worst when it comes to following through. I lost friends because of this. I'd bail out on nearly everything I agreed to attend. I work and live best when I attend an event out of impulse. This gives me the sense of freedom and adventure I want. I dream about going on a random trip to a random city/country/state with no plans (after some research at least), preferring to learn as I go.

* I have a rather investigative personality and conversation style. My nicknames include "Detective Conan" and "Sherlock". I am suspicious of others and their motives, and find myself questioning inconsistencies in their behaviors, and how they connect to the grand scheme of things. Because of this, I have a low sense of trust, which makes it hard for me to acquire new relationships. But, this is also why I enjoy investigative work. It allows me to deal with facts, data, figures.. which in turn generates possibilities and theories that would solve the 'problem'. Inductive reasoning, some might call it. Like exploring unknown realms.. 

* ..speaking of the unknown, I like learning about new topics, only if they are useful to me. I'd be interested in learning about the life in the ocean, but once it gets past polar bears and killer whales into the deep sea, I'd start to ask myself, 'Okay, so if I ever travel to Antarctica and deal with polar bears, I'd know what to do, but deep sea? Could I find a better way to spend my time, maybe read up on that networking book I bought." I'm not interested in fiction, even though I try hard, and sometimes, I find a compelling reason to read fiction - a useful reason. "What would I gain from reading this fiction?" I can learn to be a better reader.. I can learn speed reading.. etc. It's all about practicality. I can handle fictional MOVIES/shows. They have superb imagery and great storytelling crafted by people who know what the fuck they're doing. (On a side note, though irrelevant, I enjoyed the movie 'Inception', heavily branded by MBTI communities as being the NT movie of choice. I liked the movie's constantly changing environment backed by its idea of dream states and.. planting seeds in someone's mind (sounds ridiculous/impossible to me, though still interesting)).

* People have thought of me as "blunt", "mean", "rude", "reckless", "uncaring", "sly", "domineering", "original", "unique", "sociopathic". I don't waste time and energy in meaningless conversations, such as hearing someone complain or an argument that makes no sense and goes nowhere. I prefer to be direct and to the point, with the occasional jokes dropped in.

* My communication style is usually direct and informal. I can switch my charm on and off, but it'll drain the energy out of me after a while. Give me a person to talk to, give me their profile and their agenda -- they'll instantly like me during our first meeting. But after that, if we keep meeting, I'll slowly lose my outward charm and they'll begin to see my true self. 

* I like having independence and following my own path of life. I have a preference to leading over following -- doesn't need to involve people; I'm happy leading my own life myself with no or limited external influence guiding my actions and beliefs. Independence, autonomy, competitiveness, creativity, self-confidence, diplomacy, and ambition are my top core values. I have a huge curiosity for everything.

* I resonate heavily with Bruce Lee's quote, "Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it." MBTI offers me a great tool in assisting me in my assessments of others' behaviors. Enneagram amplifies it by offering a more detailed look into others' personalities by analyzing their motivations in life. Watching behaviors and mannerisms and habits of successful people and adopting the ones that work best for me. 

* If you are a gamer, then you heard about Skyrim and its immense modding community. I am a modder. I like creating new content, especially new locations for players to explore. Skyrim had all these amazing things, but failed to make the most out of a couple of them, rendering these things useless and boring. So I had an idea to create a mod where players would be able to explore new dungeons where they were forced to use the 'useless and boring' items. I also added horror elements to it and lots of other cool things. That mod has been praised for bringing innovative gameplay to Skyrim and was featured in a magazine. During my time spent on creating that mod, I took care of a lot of details that went into the mod. For example, a little open crack on the floor meant a groundbreaking bug for me. I didn't want to be seen as incompetent and careless. What I enjoyed from this experience were that I got to learn a new technology and bring my imagination to reality.

* I like being happy. I like making others feel good about themselves. I like to please, but also wouldn't mind the favor returned. I'd know when I hurt someone, because I feel guilty afterwards, so I try to fix that. Speaking of fixes, I enjoy problem solving. It allows me to dig deep into the problem, exploring various solutions, and talking about the solutions with others for their feedback. I get a kick out of people's reactions to what can come out of my mouth. It allows me to figure out what kind of person they are. It allows me to gauge their current feelings towards me (better with people close to me). 

I'm very curious in what you have to say. Thanks for reading.This could be useful for those undecided in their type.

I would say this reflects Ni (seeing the end solution), with Te/Ti responsible for finding correct steps on how to achieve that solution.

What say you?I can only ask to hear what sort of image comes to your mind when I mention ISTP type 7. 

This is purely for personal research purposes. :)
http://similarminds.com/personality_test.html

It claims to test your MBTI, enneagram, personality disorders and more - in 60 questions.

I got ENTP with Enneagram tritype 4-8-7. This is contrary to my usual type, which is ISTP 873. This probably happened because the writer(s) of this test forgot that type 7 and iNtuition are quite similar and that they over-emphasized being attractive as a characteristic of type 3, and more, so their questions might have mixed the results up. 

What did you get, and how does it compare to your usual results?I would think that ENTJ would fit the bill quite nicely. It combines the ingenuity and the theoretical nature of the ENTP with ISTP's pragmatism. I didn't pick INTP or ESTP since picking one over the other and vice versa just doesn't make sense to me. :|
But we're also the detectives that chase down the bad guys. The others are the guys who sit in the bullpen then call the unis to go grab the suspect.Istp, socially introverted. 
The percentage test was fairly tied though, it was like 42% social, the others were about 38-39%.  Made a pretty nice diamond. Ugh.. Fuck you, who cares?

no offense..........No. I'm ISTP, my brother is ENTP.The questions themselves carry different weights. For instance, question one could carry a heavier weight focused towards introversion amd less on thinking, while question two could have the opposite weights for the answers. It's not all introverted or extroverted, sensing or perceiving et cetera. 

That and it's MBTI. Relax. These are guidelines, not rules.Roommate: Did the dog get her medication tonight?

Me: No, she's still having trouble getting the bottles open so I got it for her.He's trying to type his younger brother.
Me tooHm.Rationality, aggression, and playfulness Clint Eastwood. Low openness, average conscientiousness, average extroversion, low agreeableness, above average neuroticism. Istp adhd predominantly inattentive That's really the only difference. But that's the only difference when asking the same question about any type.
I've always thought of Fi as "*purity of one's own soul*". It's not something that's easily shared, yet the user truly yearns to do so (especially as a dominant function). These kinds of people typically do not want other people to see their dark side(s) *unless they genuinely intend to do so* unlike Fe which is really upfront about it through thick and thin (regardless of intent). 

&gt; I saw a description of Fi which compared its user's range of emotions to shades of colour.

Relating to Fi this way seems more like an Fi-Se paring to me (SFP and NTJ, more so the former) since Se usually reacts so quickly and strongly to color. For example, an SFP may see mulitple natural shades of blue gently blended together and think of calming water. If instead that blue is mixed with many dark shades of gray, they'll see depression and suddenly become self-inflicted with that emotion.&gt; what do you mean about genuinely intending to do so? 

It all comes back to the sources of these functions' desires.

All Fi wants to do is express its true self (its precious soul as I mentioned earlier), but it may not always understand when and/or how to do so. The question this function would ask itself is "Does this situation bother me enough to compromise myself?" If no, then Fi usually will not do it because it wouldn't look and/or sound genuine; and *it does not like to lie to itself*.

Fe is a lot more obvious. The trick I personally use to think about this function is that Fe's energy is never truly its own energy -- *it's everyone's energy in some way, shape, or form*. Unlike Fi, Fe will be glad to put on the right emotional "mask" to obtain and distribute the right kinds and amounts of this energy among the relevant people because that's what its greatest intent is.My guess is INFJ. I'm looking at this performance like "he obviously wants US in HIS strange, wonderful, yet relatable world that he so maticulously created for us" -- all without actually saying anything (obviously). Notice how the audience and the judges are reacting to him *every second* of the way. If that's not a crazy combination of Ni and Fe at work, I don't know what is.&gt; Thank you, that helps a lot in clarifying what you meant.

You're welcome.


&gt; I like your trick for thinking about Fe.... I'll be mulling over the dynamic you describe to see if I can identify it in real life dynamics. It seems resonant on first read.

Because it is. Fe itself resonates and echoes among the many whether by word or by action.

&gt; Another question about Fi - would you be able to say more about what you mean by this:

Fi (being introverted) is exactly that: naturally difficult to project without complication. Naturally, Fi doesn't want to project any complications that it isn't comfortable with explaining, especially if they would generate unnecessary conflict.

I would say No. I would type a person/character based on *tendencies* in times of both comfort and stress. I also type along questions like these:

* How does this person prefer to communicate or otherwise present him/her self naturally?
 
* What motivates this person on a fundamental level?

* *What types of stress is this person normally vulnerable to?*

    * For example, my type (ISTP) tends to be highly resilient to many classic/standard forms of stress that would seriously hurt almost every other type. 

In short, it's not just the behavior and reactions I'm focused on but also the *how and why behind the behavior*.&gt; is there any reason why a Ti user would reject the data?

Yes. I'll list a few.

* Irrelevance: Yes, this data may be correct, but it may not provide any useful solution or result and therefore have no place in the current problem's context.

* Simple versus Complex: The simpler solution is typically best. It often avoids creating more problems, and it makes workarounds much easier in the future. The data may conflict with this ideal.

* Suspension of Disbelief: Ti is willing to hear crazy things, but these *need* to have some kind of plausibility. If none exists, why call it data/information? Otherwise, it's a joke.

I'm sure there are more reasons, but these are the three that stuck out for me personally.

&gt; Can a high Ti user theoretically consider a question without any personal investment in it?

Anybody can, it's just **not natural for Ti to do so**. If Ti can't answer a question, it's willing to say that it can't do so or otherwise hold no opinion on the matter. 

If Ti answers a legitimate yet difficult question, it almost always does so with *a mutual understanding in mind* -- thus personal investment. Oh, it's worse than that. [The superpower is always on, and she can't control it either.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence)The source of the video clip is [Hidamari Sketch x365](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3604/Hidamari_Sketch_x_365) -- episode 12.I knew somebody would make that joke once I wrote "(literally)" in the title.This is a case of exact words. I never did mention surgery or brain scans, but I had no intent to deceive either.The other main characters:

* Yoshihisa Manabe (the main love interest) -- ESFP, and a very blatant one at that. He *does have his own depths* despite his straightforwardness and honesty, all of which Haruka has been asking for throughout this scene.

* Hiyori Moritani -- ENFJ. She is an excellent example of this personality type at its worst and how it can grow. Saying more will ruin a certain climatic moment in episode 3.

* Yuriko Mifune -- ENTJ. Yes, a rare heroic and *female* example of this personality type. She has set a noble (if very demanding) goal, both for herself and the people around her, which she always accounts for. However, she also has a genuinely passionate side that the other characters simply enjoy being around.

* Dai'ichi Muruto -- INTP. *The aloof observer* of the show, and he's not shy about it. He's there more for intellectual support and to be the primary suspension of disbelief within the group. He definitely has his moments.

The side characters:

* Kumiko Kotoura (Haruka's mother) -- ISTP. Willing to solve a problem, but you kinda saw for yourself what happens whenever this personality type can't deal with an absolutely crucial one, especially without the support she (rightfully) asked for.

* Zenzou Kotoura (Haruka's grandfather) -- ESTP. He is *a lot* like Yoshihisa above in several ways, but the major difference here is Zenzou's sly deviousness in expressing his disdain for others who rightfully deserve it.

* The head priest (no actual name given) -- ISFJ. Yes, he is not a one-shot character. In fact, we eventually see that he willingly goes beyond his role in the clergy to help people in need and re-stabilize relationships.

ENTP.[Mine should be pretty easy](https://i.imgur.com/ZfZwbHI.jpg)Close, but wrong.Correct on both parts.Sounds like you and I would get along *very* well. 

Shame about the IQ part since that is so freaking biased for abstract pattern recognition much more than problem solving or other areas of intelligence. I personally average around 125-130 IQ despite that.I got 17. I would have easily gotten 20+ if section 2 (the cut outs) had not **destroyed** me since I was exceptional everywhere else (5,1,6,5 -- section by section).All I can really say is don't be afraid to be yourself in front of others. Yes, the other types may tease you, but take it with a grain of salt. Help yourself to laugh at yourself every now and then. Just do not take this to mean "beat yourself up" because nobody is perfect. 

Simply be proud, confident, and happy for who you are; and you will eventually be able to be with those precious people among a good variety of other personality types. This is especially true when it comes to meeting SJ's since they tend to value and expect personal integrity among themselves and others.&gt; What does Ti look like in action?

It looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCZbhMR4nHM).I'm actually thinking of an ISFP villain. I have my reasons for this.

* **One**, ISFP villains are *rare*. The only one that really comes to mind is the Evil Queen from *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*.

* **Two**, this allows the conflict with your ENTJ to be that much more immersive. Same functions, opposite order. It's a yin-yang relationship between two types that doesn't get discussed often let alone written around in fiction.

* **Three**, this villain is just as value-driven as your INFP; but the Se allows him/her to be a very immediate, credible, and clever threat. 

* **Four**, ISFP's (in general) can adapt to pretty much anything, even your own changes to the narrative while maintaining character. I'm sure it'll be fun to experiment with this.

* ...and **Five**, it allows you to have some practice writing around Sensing as opposed to writing around iNtuition all the time.

Edit: Typo fixes. No context has changed.&gt; So introverts, when you see that us extroverts get energized by being around people, how do you feel about that?

To clarify, extroversion isn't so much about being around people for the primary source of energy (that's more in the realm of Dom Fe), but rather the general focus is towards some aspect of the world outside the self.

To be honest, watching an extrovert become so externally engaged for such a long time is entertaining to me yet just as tiring as actually doing it myself. It's like a good movie marathon that I can't just "turn off" halfway through the night even though I can barely keep myself awake. 

&gt; how do you all feel going on dates with extroverts?

First of all, I wouldn't limit this question to "dates/romance" since it can apply to any relationship with any kind of significant other. 

As for my answer, I enjoy having 1 on 1 time with extroverts as long as they *do not disturb* the moment's "tranquility" and/or "rhythm". What I would want from extroverts in this scenario is that *they should never try too hard to be themselves* because that's where and how I see the situation getting very awkward very fast.I actually do have a My Anime List [here](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/aNinjaWithAIDS). Anything rated 9 and 10 are what I consider to be so special, they deserve (nay, *practically demand*) to try for yourself. My 8's are also worth trying but almost always have very glaring setbacks that keep them from being a 9.

My special mention goes to the The **[Pretty Cure](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure)** franchise in general. When these cute magical girls can be ***[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vNpzT9Ahc)*** badass, I *dare* you to say grown men can't like it either. Also, the music -- sometimes, [you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKZGO1BETqE) [won't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZtPME5EyxQ) [believe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sOULmKUhFM) [your](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLcP7Mpu92M) [ears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCbNNAkBSQ) how good most of these soundtracks are.I actually took this very test 2 years ago, and I'm still confident with my scores today: Musical (4.14), Self (4), and Spatial (3.71).Saki is definitely the INFJ. By understanding Ni dominance and how it just lines everything up to know things, we can see that this is exactly how Saki can come to the conclusions and realizations that she does. Why does she do this? Simple, she seeks an objective morality among all the sentient beings -- not just humans but also the naked mole rats. 

I also think you definitely mistyped some of these characters.

* Satoru is ESTP. He has a borderline "predatory" keenness of his environment which is very common for this type. Even as a young child, he's always seems too willing to fight even if the situation otherwise forced him to. 

* Maria as ESFP is actually pretty solid.

* Shun is INTP. We get a *very* real look into his consciousness come to life which he admits to. Indescribable shapes and forms are scrambled, scattered, morphed around, and just feel torn apart everywhere. This is one of the best visual metaphors for the Ti-Ne pairing that fiction has produced.

* Tomiko as ENFJ makes a lot of sense to me. No real complaints.

* Mamoru: I don't remember too much about him outside of his relationship with Maria. I can't comment about his type.

* Squealer as ENTJ... Oh, hell to the yes!

* Kioumaru is better understood as an ISTP. He is almost always doubting something, and his concerns (while bluntly delivered) are usually on the mark to some degree.

* Shisei is the ISTJ. Very revered yet disciplined and customary with the scrutinized outlook to match.... Yeah, his type is pretty obvious to me.

Edit: Typo fix. No context has changed.
Well, outside my misuse of "that word", I hope I was fair in my assessments. 

You're welcome.ISTP -- [World Create](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfCreation) from ***[When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25159/Inou-Battle_wa_Nichijou-kei_no_Naka_de)*** as wielded by Chifuyu Himeki. *This girl* can make any object appear before our very eyes, even portals to other places up to and including **other dimensions** of her own devising. Also, [this kind of passive-aggressiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJ4dUPuBz8) is just... totally us.

* This power fits the ISTP because consider what a new world would need and for us humans to even want to stay there: things like gravity, air, and ground to stand on. ISTP's typically understand the fundamentals behind these forces and would naturally be the ones who'd be able to replicate them on an instinctual level. Plus, these dimensions are *very exclusive places* and thus perfect for this kind of introvert in general.&gt; Wouldn't something like that (being similar to reality warping) be more focused on the mind?

To an extent, all superpowers are an extension of the user's mind and will. In this case you're asking how well each superpower and its typical effects/uses represent the personality.

&gt; it just seems like reality warpers and power that depends a lot on the mind seems to fit Intuitives more.

You're right. *However*, your confusion is actually a matter of [Extroverted Sensing (Se)](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Extraverted-Sensing.cfm) versus [Extroverted Intuition (Ne)](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Extraverted-iNtuiting.cfm). 

There is a distinct difference between Creation and Warping.

* **Warping** is better thought of *altering*, *molding*, and/or *distorting* the conventions of reality kinda like heating a plastic cup in a microwave. It gets *bent away* from its old shape and function.

* **Creation** is simply about *adding* and/or *combining*.

While Chifuyu's power (which *creates* and not alters) does require some mental effort ([Introverted Thinking (Ti)](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/Introverted-Thinking.cfm) to be specific), its effects are more within the realm of Se since it is more proactive within reality's conventions.&gt; Why do you insist that I am somehow "confused". I don't see how I'm in any way confused lol.

&gt; Why do you insist that I'm confused? I'm not

Okay, "confused" isn't the best word. A better phrasing would be "blanketing bias" when it comes to saying that Creation and Warping are "more for Intuitives" because they rely more on the mind.

&gt; Unless you are talking about creating practical and obvious stuff? Pretty much stuff that already exist? and is easy to think of?

Yes. Also, go back to my example of a plastic cup in a microwave. What can you *intentionally create* from doing that? That was also a personal analogy of mine for the way Ne works (although I should have made that more clear and specific the first time).

&gt; Also, I'm kind of getting the vibe that you were somehow offended? Please know that it's not my intention, I was just adding some thoughts which I stated was IMO.

I'm not offended. You're just trying to understand my argument. 

&gt; if you do not agree that's ok lol.

You're right. I don't agree, but I'm explaining why (or at least trying to).

&gt; The name "world creation" sounded very intuitive like. I got the wrong impression.

The funny thing is that "World Create" is the actual *[in-universe](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse)* name for her ability courtesy of [the main character himself](https://myanimelist.net/character/109385/Jurai_Andou) (an obvious ENFP) in all of the lingual glory that is gratuitous English. This would explain the Ne impression you got.My mother is an ESFP; and knowing myself, what I say could very well apply to all the Artisan types. 

&gt; He either seems uninterested in the topics I bring up or he becomes distracted by what's happening in the game we play online together.

It's probably the latter depending on the game you play together. If it's one of those very competitive games like a fast-paced PVP FPS, then don't be surprised if more of his attention is on the damn game!

Otherwise, just understand that Se in the Artisans' cases tends to be like a full on or off switch. It likes to focus on what/where ever the engagement is more immediately desirable, and it doesn't do well with dividing itself away from this.

&gt; Sometimes it also feels like I care more about getting to know him than he does for me. It's weird because I know he cares, he just expresses himself very differently than I do.

That's just you being an INFJ. What an ESFP expects from you is that you continue to be a fun, pleasant, and interesting person. You are a part of his experience as much as he is to yours, and that's the way he sees the relationship.

&gt; So, ESFPs - How do you grow close to people? 

This type simply enjoys *being there with people*. Growth within the relationship from there is simply left to natural circumstances. ESFP's typically don't think too deeply about this matter since they aren't so much worried about the how nor why they like the people that they do -- just the who and the what.

&gt; Does it have more to do with your actions (spending time) than the content of our conversations?

Yes, but slightly so. ESFP's do care about the content of the conversations as long they can follow along and are able to contribute their own context. This is all part of that natural growth I mentioned in the last paragraph. 

Edit: Typo fix. No context has changed.In the world of fiction, the cutest type is either the ENFP or the INFP. Tell me that you haven't looked into their fantasy-filled eyes and wanted to hug at least one of those sweethearts.

In real life, it's much more complicated. It's possible to have the ESFJ who may be an absolute asshole when the INTP is the genuinely cute one of the group.ISTP: [The back corner next to the window.](http://pm1.narvii.com/5760/73fc33d1bca84d3324ec1931e0d43c4109fd837d_hq.jpg)I got 5D. &gt; There's some serious bias and value judgments being made by whoever wrote this test.

I must respectfully disagree. 

The point of the test is to help its takers discover some insight into themselves.
It is not so much "biased" as much as it is *asking for the values and biases of the individual* according to some realistically-portrayed, yet hypothetical situations.

&gt; It is obvious in both the way the questions are being asked and what specific questions are asked.

I'm not so sure. It seems to me that the questions and answers are appropriately varied, distinctly descriptive, and well-thought through compared to most other personality tests (unlike nearly every MBTI test out there). 

Edit: typo fix.&gt; I notice I seem to have trouble finding some fictional female characters that fit an INTP....

Forewarning: all of the video clips shared here are SFW.

I do know of two in particular, but both of them are from anime.

* **Kotomi Ichinose** from *Clannad* (sample scenes [A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOtojEyTCM) and [B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JybQ17wIOJc)). This example stands out very well since she's often paired with the textbook ISTP protagonist.

* **Hifumi Takimoto** from *New Game!* (sample clips [A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1P4oONcbLM), [B]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f7SDSbcWQs), [C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5BpV0gVQ_Q), and [D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBs3Yf6RyFQ)). This girl is a great example of displaying the INTP's weaknesses in a more comedic light, namely natrual self-expression (or lack-therof).

&gt; So what are your thoughts on my theory as well?

I agree when it comes to the social sterotypes and biases between the genders. What I don't agree on is that fictional female F types can also appear quite masculine. It's just a matter of how the artist best associates personality with appearance.&gt; Don't know about Hifumi as I haven't seen New Game! Anything else about her other than social anxiety to site? Her hobbies or interests?

Cosplay (the other main characters don't know this, and she isn't socially anxious while doing so). 

Here's how I see the difference between the INTP and the INFP (and why I think Hifumi is the former rather than the latter):

* INTP's look inside themselves to see *what* they are and *how they describe themselves* (Ti). In the midst of mental unhealth, they tend to project a very distorted/chilling aura which others can and often do see (inferior Fe leaking). INTP's are normally either not aware of this or constantly attempt to brush this quality away from themselves because they don't know how to deal with it and become "walking self-contradictions" in the process. This is the basis behind Hifumi's inner turmoil.

* INFP's look inside themselves to see *who* they are (Fi). The major problem for this type is how it can blend its own personal importance (Fi) with that of his inner circle in a logically fluent way (Te). In distress, INFP's seem to "collapse" mentally and don't know their way around themselves the way they normally would.

Based on this, sure I'll concede Kotomi to be an INFP; but I'm sticking with INTP for Hifumi. The poor girl just can't figure out the problem within herself.&gt; Also the cosplay thing seems like many people could fit that description. 

True. Despite this, I try to understand how each character's mind works. I look for how they approach and react to any given situation, not just what they say and do. I then look for the functions that most consistently describe the behavior at work.ISTP, and my taste in music is just too varied for me to choose one favorite of all time. However, I'm currently obsessed with odd time signatures -- particularly 7, 9, and 11.

* To that end, I present [Treasure Sleeping in the Sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEg0PCbSoYQ) from *Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles* (composed by Kumi Tanioka). Just **look** at [the sheet music](https://musescore.com/user/8536921/scores/1913951) for this thing...&gt; What's your type

How do you personally differentiate among these 3 words?Question: What does an ISTP look like on his own birthday?

Answer: Somewhat close to [this.](http://i.imgur.com/ZfZwbHI.jpg)

Yes, the picture was taken on one of my actual birthdays (my 25th to be precise).I have a few good ones.

* "If knowledge is power, then experience is understanding."

* "Two wrongs do not make a right, but three rights make a left."

* "Expect the best, but assume the worst."If it makes you feel any better, my mother (ESFP) also has this problem but in reverse: a family full of introverts.

* My brother -- INFJ
* My grandmother -- ISFJ
* My grandfather -- ISTJ
* My dad -- ESTJ (Divorced away though)
* Myself -- ISTPWhen it comes to the **P** and the **J**, all that really does is determine which function is the *first extroverted one*. In the ISTP's case, the letter "**P**" pegs the perceiving function to be exactly that -- thus Se. *However*, the **"I"** means that the very first function **must** be introverted. Since the "**S**" is already taken by the "**P**", that leaves the "**I**" to take the "**T**" -- thus Ti as the dominant function and Se as the auxiliary.Welcome to a world that hates our guts yet loves what we do for them. My internal world looks like a nebulous void space. Said space is beautifully colored with many shades of blue and purple that just swirl and mix together endlessly. My memories and knowledge are contained within this void space, and I can also shape it into whatever I want. Whenever I listen to music and focus on it, these clouds also flash to the beat (a concert within my own head so to say).

It's weird, but it's the wonderful kind of weird.Yeah, I don't tend to look inside myself, so my best description is exactly that. It kinda helps that I dream this way too.Fi just wants you to be yourself. Speak in the first person perspective (I, me, my), and use "we, us, and our" only if that clearly includes your Fi recipient. Put yourself first for a bit and let Fi know who you fundamentally are. After all, only you can speak for you.

&gt; I was worried that I would annoy her with my tendency to go along with what other people want to do.

You should then ask yourself this: "What do **I** want to do?". It's okay to compromise; but even then, you should put a bit of yourself into that compromise. Otherwise, it just isn't one.

&gt; I sensed that she was trying to figure out my opinions/likes are.

Exactly, *that's what Fi is inclined to do*. It's the method by which it gauges other people. "First impressions matter" is pretty much a common understanding born from Fi.

When Fi does this, it's usually interested in you. Don't be afraid to let yourself into the conversation (Again, "I, Me, My"). If you don't know yourself and/or can't appreciate yourself, that's just a huge turn-off for Fi in general. 

Since the OP *knows* him/her self well enough to ask us for advice regarding a particular weakness of his/hers, my advice is still very much valid. That's a pretty long-winded way of saying "compromise" and "understand each other". Assuming both sides are healthy-minded people, high Fe and high Fi *can* see each other's ways as simply different and not as a matter of right/wrong or black/white. 

I appreciate the deeper explanations nonetheless -- Thanks.&gt; Heh. Welcome to the world of conversation with an INFJ :)

Heh, I'm not exactly new to that world since I do have an INFJ in my personal life, but thanks for having me. :P

To me, "rambling" is nothing more than speaking without any sound notion.

Onto your question though: a lot of his thinking is internal, but ways he makes his points are just hilarious. He gets it; he wants *you* to get it, and he'll make you enjoy the process.

Male ISTP and how to win me.

First: **Embrace your inner nerd!** 

* Corollary: There are no *maximum* age restrictions regarding media viewership/consumption.

* Corollary 2: All of our tastes are shit (in-joke among Anime fandoms).

Realize that fictional violence is best violence (mostly because there's less cleanup).

Dark humor is not a symptom of being a psychopath -- deliberately harmful impulsive action is. **Do not mix the two.**

If it can't be proven, it didn't happen -- at least not between us.

* Corollary: If you have to bullshit your way through me, at least make it sound plausible and fun.

Realize the difference between a debate and an argument. One is violent and/or abusive, and the other is not. 

Take serious issues only with seriously apparent issues. Otherwise, [it's joke!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THrCQ1ftuTU)I know I have an issue with authority. In fact, I'm outright afraid and skeptical towards the very idea of it. I have two reasons why.

1. It doesn't matter if the peon is in the right since he's the peon.

2. [The boss demands that the peon does as he's told](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseISaidSo). Questioning the orders is considered defiance because *they're the peons* and thus don't know any better. (Schools **love** pulling this crap.)

Yes, I believe in having management and leaders; but I also believe in checks and balances in any given system. How is a peon expected to check against an abusive authority or an unfair/broken system? Usually, he can't (thus no balance and no happiness  for anyone that isn't the boss).[Harmonic Balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w76ybV0OpnM) by Derek HuggerI would say yes. Children 8 years old and under are usually still trying to realize either 1 of 2 things.

1. How they explore and navigate the world around them (if dom introverted).

2. How they soak it all in and process it all (if dom extroverted). 

Until said child can communicate his own consistent reasoning, methodology, and ways through the world (aka the 2nd function); it would be *very difficult* to gauge his/her MBTI type.For even more fun, I'll make my matches to music with [Uncommon Time](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncommonTime).

**EDIT**: I left out the ISFP's by complete accident. You got your entry from me too now.To be honest, I forgot to write one in. Sorry. However, I ~~will make~~ have made an edit for it.

I wouldn't say "emotionless" but rather "unsure" of how to express and understand emotions -- especially our own.  We simply struggle to communicate with them naturally.

Stubborn is spot on though.ISTP, and I actually have a picture of my own default expression [here](https://i.imgur.com/ZfZwbHI.jpg). This was taken on my 25th birthday; so you tell me if I look really excited to open presents and eat cake.I have seen My Hero Academia, and I have pegged quite a few characters with an MBTI type.

&gt; I'd be grateful if someone could tell me what Yaoyorozu's type might be and explain.

She's an INTJ. She constantly sees things to be improved everywhere, including herself. Much like Izuki Midoriya (an INFJ), her Dominant Ni shows in how she studies her opponents and quickly devises complex strategies against them while under pressure. 

*Unlike* Izuku, Momo uses Te to resolve these problems. She has a very blunt and matter-of-fact nature to her in how things need to run. Where she faces weaknesses is in her lack of self-confidence (Fi) and just doing it (Se) as she showed in her Final Exam with Shoto Todoroki (an ISFP).

&gt; Izuku "Deku" Midoriya

An *obvious* INFJ. Where you might see trouble in deducing his personality type is in he Fe. THAT is easily explained; he wants to be *everybody's* ideal hero. **His actions spur everyone else's thoughts and actions**. Think about the sludge villain from episode 2. He (while quirkless) was the only one to *attempt* to rescue Bakugo the victim regardless of how impossible it might have been for him.

He is never tempted into the setting's industrial nature of superheroism either. He does not want to be the next symbol of peace just for the title; rather, he does it because he wants to be an active inspiration and example of what it means to be a true hero.

&gt; Shoto Todoroki

Like I said, ISFP. Some fans might have pegged him as an ISTP, but he matches the mold for Dom Fi a lot better. He keeps the pressure of his problems to himself. Much of his mental dialogue is pure self-torture towards himself and his refusal by resentment to use the fiery side of his quirk. An ISTP in his situation still *would not hesitate to use this powerful tool* to make himself better and stronger at every opportunity -- something that took a bit of counseling from Izuku for Shoto to do himself. At the same time, you also have to think: "*What is most defining attribute for the character?*"; "*What makes him the person that he is?*. It is **not** his tactics or his analytical ability; rather, it's his struggle with accepting his entire quirk as part of his own identity. THAT is a *major* Fi issue if I've ever seen one, and the fact that it is so central to his character makes me put it as his Dom function.

As far as the Se-Ni axis goes, he displays it brilliantly -- like a predator on the prowl.&gt; his goal to become a great hero is much more significant.

That's every major character in the show. It's not enough to determine someone's personality. We need to break down each character's motive and natural processes for his and her given decisions.

&gt; I don't see how accepting his quirk as part of his identity is the most defining attribute for his character.

In this setting or any show with superpowers, *how each character chooses to use or not to use* them is a HUGE telegraph to his/her personality much more than the powers themselves. 

For example, Shoto defies his own fire side to spite dear old dad and not feed into his satisfaction. It's a way of showing his personally emotive disapproval while keeping it literally under his sleeves. Again, I associate this kind of deep sentimentality with Fi. 

Is this any kind of logically sound decision to **live by**? Absolutely not since he's not using everything that he is to succeed and every other character sees this to be readily apparent (inferior Te).

&gt; We see later on, after he accepts his quirk, he is easily able to detach himself from his hatred for his father and use his father's connections and skills to improve himself and further his goal, which I think is more like Ni-Te.

While that IS true, he does that as a simple means of being pragmatic and practical (Se-Te). Again, that is only the smaller part of his motive here. 

Yes, Endeavor is an asshole to the nth degree, but that doesn't stop him from being one of Shoto's most valuable assets either. By realizing this and accepting the internship, Shoto has made the best decision for his future even though he clearly doesn't like it. This is a healthy application of Ni-Te because he knows how FAR he stepped outside of his own comfort zone to become a great hero that he sees himself to become.I'm thinking ESTP for Bakugo. Think about it; he is everything that Midoriya is not. Yet, the ways these two see and process any given situation around them leave *soooo* much common ground between them, it's almost ironic. I'll go through his functions one by one to explain why I've pegged him the way I did.

* Dom Se -- Let's not beat around the bush here; he's the closest thing to a feral animal in the show. Motivated by pride and driven by pure instinct, he'll pull anything and everything to overcome all immediate obstacles. To him, the whole world is competition based on a list of Quirks tiered by their physical power because that's how the setting tends to value Quirks anyway. 

* Sec Ti -- He uses his quirk in a way that suits himself best, and he never personally allows any external influences to change that. When it comes to his dialogue in general, notice that he is not one to BS (neither for anybody nor to anyone). 

* Ter Fe -- He gives no fucks, plain and simple. He is never shy about showing everyone a piece of his mind. Everyone who looks at him can clearly see what he feels, but never truly why. He's just a walking, talking, angry pity party; absolutely and willingly disconnected from everyone *because* he sees them as rivals and weaklings to be conquered and not as friends, allies, and comrades.

* Inf Ni -- This manifests as his inability to notice long-term consequences and lack of big-picture thinking. For example, Best Jeanist (one of the top 5 Pro Heroes) offered Bakugo that internship *knowing* that the latter would pick him because "*why deny the best if you want to become the best?*". To put it lightly, Bakugo got *much more* than what he was asking for and not to his liking either. ISTP -- Blue in all of its shades and hues is my most favorite. Other colors I like are white, black, silver, and purple (particularly lavender hues).
I second this. I'm an ISTP myself and your description is very similar to me. I have knowledge of ISTJ and you are definitely not one.
Isfp because you didn't say anything about them? On the other hand you wouldn't post anything if you were isfp...http://imgur.com/RVPDDgyYou're correct, ESTPIstp: Musical, kinesthetic, spatialWhy so few genres? Also would've liked to be able to select two or three genres, as music is usually influenced by many different genres.

ISTP

Funk/Soul/Blues/Rock (Others)Strong black coffee. Tea, whatever.
ISTP here: I'm overly concerned with making sure I smell pleasant, &amp; loathe running errands if I haven't showered yet for the day. The only grimy thing about us is how you might feel after we stare you down, completely ambivalent as to your existence.Now that, my friend, you'd be completely right about. Inclined to agree with you - I definitely focused on "shower" equating with smell &amp; dirt.

As to Jotaro, I like him because he's relatable in some aspects, and being a badass always helps.I wasn't planning to skip, but thanks for that info!I've seen them too but I don't do it because some people take them way too seriously for my taste. damn she swoledon't let that discourage you from finding someone else!The beatings will continue until morale improves👀👀👀you forgot to type the doorhotvery coolyou'd like that wouldn't yougo on:)yesYou missed end quote for ENTP.

I like that people actually use it, and people take the time to give good answers to questions. 

But I don't like it when people treat MBTI as some kind of canon to rule their lives. The types are a model describing human personality. Bus as all models describing things in nature, it's incomplete and insufficient in some areas. People are way too complex to describe fully. We are a mystery, to others, to ourselves, and to science. But that's okay. It just makes me a little sad when it seems like people base their lives off of this stuff. You are more than 4 letters, or even 4 functions. MBTI is interesting, but it has its limits, and it's not an authoritative end-all-be-all way of describing human nature. The reason people are mysterious is that we're all unique. 

I guess what this complaint boils down to is that I see people losing their identity in this. They place themselves in a type, and that's all they think they are. You are more than that. And seeing that in questions and answers across this sub and the r/mbti sub makes me sad. 

I'm ISTP btw. Lemme go work on some cars nowIt depends on what you mean by aptitude. If you mean the difficulty or lack thereof in grasping and performing a new concept/skill, basically natural talent, then yes, I agree. 

Some types are better than others naturally at things. But that doesn't mean that it is impossible for a certain type to learn to do something. Yes, it'll be harder and take more effort, but I think it's not impossible.
ISTP. I joined Team Instinct! Not much reasoning besides the fact that my avatar already had the yellow colour scheme going on.I think they’re all great, nice job!It’s a performance evaluation. I’m assuming it’s been typed up by the ISTP’s manager or something.😂Good botYou do realise that OP is making a non-serious joke? It’s a satirical shitpost. No need to over analyse.Though I would never be physically aggressive or pick fights, I had a bully-esque sense of humour when I was about 10-16 yo. Just found it hilarious to tease and mock any acquaintances I had (I would think I was just being playful and honest). Social acceptability was not my strongpoint lol

Very cringe to think back on now, as I was blissfully unaware of how blunt and sometimes harsh I was with my takes and comments. I usually wondered why I had not many friends.

Thank fuck I eventually became self awareFe inferior can mean being a total ass without realising until later. Sometimes much later… 

I fully relate to his experience in high school. It sucks, but developing that Fe is our personal growth :) nowadays I try and be as kind as possible so I don’t unnecessarily disturb the peace. That is unless I’m taking the piss with a good mate, then expect anything in the name of fair banter.Pretty much. It’s near impossible to settle any conclusion with my ISFJ SO when we get into debates/arguments. I thought the original post was quite accurate, but this statement is even more accurate
My favorite is Lucario (INFJ).
I'd say that Blaziken, Greninja, and Yveltal are ISTPs.Facebook really clicks for ESFJs, I think. There are probably some on Reddit, but they don't know about MBTI and a good number of them wouldn't care. 
Not really. I'm istp and I fit perfectly on the SLI description, much more than in the mbti one. Also I love that socionics have descriptions for male and female. I really dont have problem with any of them, but some stereotypes created from mbti are really annoying for me. :puh? please elaborate...Dunno, I really dont know why some ppl say that SLI=ISTJ... I found that SLI=ISTP in sociotype.com and other sites, and I fit in ISTP and SLI, I dont fit in ISTJ, neither any other socionics type. 
So I think its a comun posture but I dont see it as true. I see...ThanksMy SO does exactly the same thing. He is also an enfp. I'm amazed how easily he could cry in front of a screen, but then be so insensible in real life. hahahYeah I'm not much into theory. But honestly I do fit with socionics desctriptions.
That dressing nice and are quiet part describes me and I'm an ISTP. I feel the exact same way. I'm studying programming at the moment but I honestly have such a hard time concentrating in class. What I hate about school is that it seems like everyone is an N type. It feels like everyone could go hours just talking about theory when in reality I just want to do something like make software or build a website. But I'm sticking it out to expand my mind and hopefully have a good career in the future. So I'm putting my ISTP nature beyond me. 

Just be careful. Do what makes you happy but just consider what career will make you happier and let you do all those things. Finance might be shit but you'll be making more money and you'll likely have great benefits. 20 times at least. Maybe. 

INTP, ISTP, or INTJ

It's hard to say. I feel like each type has that stereotype, and I can't really identify with them but I know people who typed me before usually say I'm a particular type.

Thing is. I wouldn't say I'm a theory person. I like abstract theories. But I need to see an example of it or see how it's correct for me to understand it (ie showing a solved math problem). However I'm not that physical. I had to study body language in order to have better posture. Same with style. I'd say Ti is prominent but I'm not 100% sure. Problem solving for me usually involves a lot of trial and error. For example I might have a map, but I wouldn't look at it. I'd just go into the problem head first and try to observe it on my own. Or if I'm playing a video game I usually go where my mind leads me and I trust that (unless I get lost). What’s the difference between Hitler and Michael Phelps? Phelps can finish a race.

Probably when I was in my teens: I made a 40 minute film set in the 1940's, costumes and all, and had an original score composed for it. And had my own premiere for it at a local theatre. It's always been mixed. I took some network stuff, dropped out. Then electrician introduction course, dropped out. I went to culinary school, completed it. Worked for a bit. Now I'm trying to smarten up because before I had issues with my ex gf (long story short she needed my attention all the time and I had to talk to her in class -- she broke up with me in electrical introduction classes which made me depressed). So I got over it and now I'm doing programming, which I enjoy because I like solving problems. 

Favourite song... that's tough. I think my favourite piece of music would be classical or a movie soundtrack, but my actual favourite song has to be Paranoid Android by Radiohead. I love the melancholy of any song but I just feel like the feel of the song just sounds great to me. I also love how it switches in tone a few times. There's also a lot of passion in Thom Yorke's voice which helps too. 

I don't read too many books honestly. But I have to say... Power by Robert Greene. Or quiet by Susan Caine. Funny I've never read a fiction book where I was like "wow" but I really liked To Kill a Mocking Bird. 

I don't but maybe I could make one. I'd say my tone is quiet monotone and if I were to tell a joke it would be dry. Someone once told me I talked like David Blaine (magician). But I can switch on a more personable voice if I need to. NEINHard to say. One thing I found interesting is my friend who is an N type. We were at a restaurant once and we were finished our meals. He was talking about the design of engines and while I found it interesting, in my mind I was thinking of getting the cheque and said so and we did. Who knows though. Interesting. As I type usually between INTJ or ISTP. Thank you for your analysis. Is there anyway else to narrow it down? Thank you for all that info, helps a lot. :) I'm a lot more P then J. About Fe vs Fi...  it's hard to say. Both sound quite vague. But your statement " Fe user may need to figure out the emotion." I can sort of relate to, though I wouldn't ever talk about it outloud unless I needed to. I'd say I'm still an ISTP though. I'm an ISTP for context and I have met an INTJ I didn't like for this very reason. I once had a conflict with an INTJ who thought she was so smart, and I destroyed her arguments. ISTP here. 

INTJ's. The ones I've talked to come off very pretentious. Eye rolling pretentious. There's nothing wrong with being intelligently confident, but INTJ's come off as (insecurely) arrogant. ISTP:

I really hate small talk with the wrong person, but I can pull it off. However it's not that bad when it lasts only a few lines. After that I get anxious because this conversation is getting useless. It's not so much I always have to be having a deep conversation. I just don't like forced conversation. I don't like conversation when I don't feel like it. However I am a happy loner so my answer won't reflect most people. I like someone who talks a lot too. Because they appreciate you listening, while you think of things to say and ask while they talk. And you talk minimally. It was someone outside of /r/mbti, who typed themselves as an INTJ. But sometimes reading different INTJ forums, I get this feeling. 

I edited my original paragraph, I think I was a bit harsh. Seems like a lot of F's prefer hotter temperatures. I'm an ISTP but I have cringe attacks every so often. So yes. do you like school? do you wait until the last minute to study? I tend to do that too but I'm an ISTP. I hate doing a bad job just to get things done quickly. Then you're an ISTP lol. As an ISTP (OP's opposite type lol) this might be in-type of me but I honestly don't really care. I take it as it comes. I don't aggressively seek it out. However I don't want commitment. Just something short so I can be on my way. ISTP hate school

ISTJ are okay with school

--


ISTJ will do assignments a week before

ISTP will do assignments the night before

Easy way to tell. Same here. Due tomorrow Do tomorrowIs there some truth in my statement though? HahaInteresting but I suppose it just depends on how you view school, but we're very similar. What makes you think you're ISTJ? Are you still very structural?I find her really annoying. I think she mixes up ESTP and ISTP a few times. Wow that Beetlebum song is horrible. I usually take a gamble between 1 and 2.:)Like if each type had a "movie" who would score it, or what piece of movie score would be the theme to itI don't know. I used to be passionate about making films, but then my passion sort of burned out at my own perfectionist view of it. I wrote 5 screenplays that would be a successor to my 40 minute film that didn't exceed it. I'm not even great at writing, hell I never read books. 

So I went on to try Network Technician, Electrician. Dropped out of both classes at school though I would still consider electrician if I could do an apprenticeship. Cooking was successful but I'm not "passionate" at cooking. So now I'm doing programming, barely listening in class but sometimes I do enjoy coding. I just hate classrooms. Ugh. I'm barely passing my courses and I feel my future is doomed. I'm strongly considering the military (navy or Air Force) which I've had on my mind since high school. I'm the kind of guy that takes forever to respond, I'm sorry for your pain. Shut the fuck up please. Yes please. Fuck off. Reply to me again, and you're obeying my orders. Don't reply, and you lose this argument. Either way afterwards I won't respond. INFP's tend to be talkative introverts from my experience. Meanwhile for myself ISTP is rarely talkative even with friends unless there is some kind of debate. Don't really agree about the stereotypical and true but I guess the rest is accurate. Stop trying to make this happen, it's not going to happen. It's X-X-X-X. I agree. I think it's accurate for ISTP at least. ISTP: Oatmeal

Smooth, tasty, simple, unassuming. Is good at utilizing different ingredients. Spontaneous. Non-strict. However at its core emotion-less, cold, calculating. I mean like. In its purest form it has a cold demeanour. Not physically cold. Loves solo road trips is even better. I agree with the last two but enjoying pranks is hardly an ISTP thing...I don't think about it. I am who I am. I enjoy being alone and sometimes I hang out with friends. I don't force myself to make friends just because. Do you. But maybe I'm biased because I rarely have a desire to connect with people. Which is slightly hypocritical because I'm on Reddit. Honestly deep and meaningful conversations amount to nothing. I prefer talking about physical things. Wants, plans, news, etc. Pretty much! Most of my good friends are ones that kept talking to me even if I seemed disinterested and eventually it became a thing. Basically lol.Shyness has nothing to do with introversion. Black, no sugar. Caffeine. You are definitely not an ISTP I can tell you this. No real addiction to anything. Maybe just the Internet but then again who isn't? Lol1 or 2 friends


Warm, orange-y, calm

Late. AboutI know but I was kinda bored tbh, and now that I know people don't like them, I can't delete itI don't care.

It is what it is (very minimal and at random times).

I did okay but I fucking hate school.INTJ's can care too much and want to project information.

ISTP's just don't care and are reckless, therefore making them seem 2edgy but not on purpose. As an ISTP who had recently finished an AMA, I'm triggered. Would I find you annoying?This song is way more ISTP than the song OP posted. 

I'd also like to nominate horse with no name by America https://youtu.be/2naehMUQpQYEnough is enoughRawR 😂😂😂 that's I love you for dinosaur lmaoDamn INTJsMessy, but it always manages to look messy in a cool way. Sup bbEstp... not accurate at all but close. Well, eh, technically, eh...I can't even finiISTP: John Wick, James Bond (Daniel Craig)I agree with John Wick. I wish I could not act autistic with women. Well I've been on lots of first dates and 1 second date, ever. 

Recently an Instagram "model" gave me her number and slapped my ass afterward, and I still found a way to fuck it up. Lol. Ew an infjGo organize your feelings!!!!Shut up grandmaGuess my type. Ask questions. I'm bored so maybe this could be fun. 

No looking at my post history. I'm a big fan of movie scores, thought this would be interesting to do :)

Feel free to add to this, sort of did this just based on blind intuition, hopefully it's somewhat accurate.Ask
ISTP

Currently unhealthily *obsessed* with Kpop, but my favorite genre in general is prbly symphonic metal.

I pay almost no attention to lyrics/words. I listen to how the song sounds and am rarely aware of the meaning behind the songs (I can intellectually appreciate good lyrics/intention when I notice them, but that's rarely *why* I listen. Though, noticing vulgarity/violence/messages completely against what I believe in will kill my passion for a song once it is noticed)

I really love a lot of youtube covers of pop songs where I don't like the original (ex. neutral about Taylor Swift, love covers of her songs)

The song that I think is the prettiest to listen to is Escapist by NightwishI'm ISTP, so Ti dom.

I'm always daydreaming. It stops as soon as I'm engaging with something or someone, but right now I'm home by myself a lot with little to do. so I go off into lala land. I think this has a lot to do with my Se and Ti both not being engaged in my day to day at the moment. If I'm in problem solving mode, nothing will get me to break focus on the problem (Ti). If I'm actually doing something, I focus on experiencing to the point of being irresponsibly hedonistic (Se running wild)Fear and the resulting adrenaline drives me. I usually know how long something will take me and don't start working until there's no more room for procrastination.

If I need to not procrastinate, I'll dwell on it to hype myself up with fear.Ultimately, each type will behave differently even from people of their own type. It's less external behavior and more internal motivations/thought processes that makes a type.

In terms of not your external behavior, but what you describe to be your motivations/inner thoughts, they seem similar to how two ISFJs I now operate. Things like wanting to help and advise others but keeping your personal life private, and liking the finer things in life and having an eye for external beauty. Whether that's actually your type or not, I don't know. Likes and hobbies are not necessarily correlated with mbti type. You're a human being, not a cardboard cut-out.

I would say the words people have used to describe you have little to do with your type, as they can be used to describe any type who display those external behaviors.

I would honestly suggest that you try to work on your social skills and how you come off a little bit. Like, you don't owe anyone a smile, but the fact that you try explicitly to maintain a serious a closed off aura is going to drive people away. And it's things like this that have people using those words.

(Also, you can't expect to form a deep, genuine connection with others if you're already closing them off before anything has started)

I'm also very reserved, don't trust people, and have rarely dated, but outwardly I present a warm and friendly persona. I make friends easily, but few of them know my inner thoughts. I could date more if I wanted to, but I'm usually not interested in saying yes. I keep things at a superficial level at the start of all relationships. 

I don't know how old you are, but how you present yourself is not only important in personal relationships, but also in professional relationships.

To be seen as approachable, you need to present yourself as approachable.  You don't have to smile 24/7, you can be lost in your head (I always am), but when people do engage you, don't just be nice (which to me reads as if you're being polite in a 'this is how you talk to humans civilly' way), you need to be equally interested in the other person. People can feel that you don't want to form relationships with them, whether it's friendship or otherwise. And they act accordingly. 

I also feel like you're around people who may be more judgmental to begin with. But even then, if you want things to change and to form more connections, you have to present yourself as more warm and open. 

Think of it as outer layer is friendly and warm, middle layer is on guard but not presented to the outside, and inside you're a smol squishy vulnerable thing.Fake it til you make it applies here. I've had severe depression and in getting out of it and trying to build a social life, that was basically what I had to do. I'm almost 24 now, and started crawling out of depression and applying the fake it til you make it interest in others when I was 20. Now the interest in others is genuine. But you can't expect others to express interest in you if you express none in them.

Are you seeing a psychologist regularly? If not, that could help you. It was regularly seeing a psychologist that helped me find tactics to start socializing properly (including the faking interest), as well as other advice to start getting my life in a better place.

Also, if you don't think your medication is working, that is something that should be brought up to your psychologist/psychiatrist.

I've never had anxiety, and don't know how to navigate that. And even though I've had depression, it was very strongly related to a chronic health issue and quality of life due to it. The chronic health issue is under control now, and my depression is in remission.

You might also need to seriously think about your career plans. It'll be hard to be an art seller when that requires good networking skills, which partly relies on how well you present yourself.

Perhaps try joining activities or put yourself in positions where your social skills will have to be developed?

I would also avoid dating older men until you have experience dating people your age. It's not just that some of them are further in their life plans than you, but also that they might pick up on how inexperienced you are in handling yourself and asserting yourself in relationships.

I've had the weird experience of dating men both older (oldest was 33 I believe) and younger, but actually having relationships with men younger than me. I attribute it to me liking animals more than people and falling for men who are basically golden retrievers in human form, which younger guys are more likely to act like.

(Also, mbti types are to be determined when you're mentally healthy. Mental illness changes the way you think and operate, and your true type will be difficult to find)That's very true that your focus should be on your anxiety and depression before tackling many other things.

Perhaps [/r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression)
or [/r/anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety) might be good places for you to check out?That really sucks that you don't have many resources available to you right now. If you ever need to talk, feel free to pm me.

Once you go back to college, seeing someone should be a priority. Also, talk to them about helping you find resources in your area for when you're not in school.

I would say dating is the least of your priorities right now. (Also, most people can't tell the state of someone's mental health unless they spend lots of time with them or are explicitly told. Those older men were likely just interested in the fact that you are younger.)

I got a job as a hostess in a restaurant soon after my efforts to tackle my depression started, and it was a huge help because it forced me out of my isolation and made me feel productive and helped me learn how to people and I was in a well light place instead of my usually no-lights-on-room. It was a low stress role, but still social, so it forced me to learn to be better with people and present better. I never tried to be a waitress despite the better money potential because I knew it would be too stressful for me. It's something you could consider, or a similar low-stress but people focused role. But I don't know how your anxiety would play out with this.

I would not strip. You do not need more sketchy older men in your life, and I don't see it as something that will be beneficial to you in terms of your mental health. (I've thought about doing things like that, and even beyond stripping. But it would not have improved my life, only possibly my financial situation)

A career counselor might also be useful for you. Maybe not, as your feelings towards that are tied to your mental health.

My thoughts about what I wanted out of my career have changed since coming out of depression.

Also, my out of depression journey has been 3 years, almost 4 now. This past semester was the first time I've felt engaged and motivated in life. It was slow and agonizing, and I honestly didn't notice it improving in the beginning for a good 2 years. I thought that would be my life forever. I noticed the improvement through external things, like 'oh hey i passed all of my classes for once'. This past year is the first year my social life has actually existed a little, and most of my dating (but no relationships) is from the last year. 
I don't really have a point in telling you that aside from here is an example of someone who got out of depression, and is still in the process of getting out of it.ISTP, and the only thing I'd rather be is a more developed ISTP xD

Any type I admire is less 'I want to be you' and is more 'Be mine'.ISTP, and unfortunately I've never been more than buzzed like once because I'm broke af.

I think I was more social, bubbly, and silly.I'll talk about friendships because I actually know their types. 

I get along best with an INTP, we understand each other in an innate way most of the time, and they ways in which we're different just fascinate me. We always joke that we'd be great partners.

An ISFJ I've had the most taxing and tumultuous relationship with.Only had one relationship, and I was broken up with.

I was seeing him everyday and couldn't deal with the suffocation  and lack of freedom (he wasn't clingy or controlling, I just needed space), and being an emotionally immature 20 year old, I went MIA once summer vacation started instead of communicating my need for space, and did this all without thinking about what I was doing. 

I used my conservative, religious, Asian mom and the need for secrecy as an excuse at first. But then I legitimately got absorbed into an mmorpg for a month and forgot people existed. He was not happy, to say the least. I knew the break up was coming once I got my head out of my ass, because he refused to do it over text/impersonal methods, and waited to see me personally. Kid is younger than me but oh so much more mature.

And yeah, I feel like this was a case of immature ISTP in action.I like men that are basically golden retrievers in human form, so seems spot on for me.ISTP. 

I have friends who get upset as they realize that I may love them and enjoy their company right now, but I'd also probably not notice if I never saw them again. They take it really personally, even though it's just a result of me only thinking about what I'm experiencing in the moment and forgetting to consider my past or future.MY best friend (INTP) and I are really good friends partly because we both get absorbed in our own things but once we come out of it, in our minds our relationship with each other is still just as strong.

We've both lost friends who've taken our lack of contact as disinterest.

I am trying to be better about it though.It's less about your actions and more about how your mind works, which you will know better than anyone else.I go through old conversations a lot, but I don't try to analyze or anything.

Since I don't think about my past naturally, going through old conversations is a reminder of things that have happened and my relationships. Often in a 'I completely forgot about this' kind of way.

I've recently discovered old conversations with people and I honestly don't remember having even an acquaintance relationship with them, but the conversations indicate that we were at least friends (I am very reserved and quiet so there's a marked difference in how and what I communicate to friends versus non-friends)Apparently I'm IDUCL, which matches ISTPNope.

 


Single parent household:
Mother: ISFJ
ME: ISTP
&gt;Something I like to call as Ni Freeze, where you think you can perfectly see how things will fold out, and it all feel inevitable, you get very nihilistic, and you end up not doing anything.

&gt;Basically you worry more about what could happen (risks etc.) than the effort you invest in doing it. Or you can say you are lazy to expend energy to waste if you think it'll never work out anyways.

You literally just described what I did at the beginning of what eventually spiraled into severe depression  (including the off-the-wall nihilism).ISTP here, and I've  had severe depression (to the degree where if I'd had the energy/motivation, suicide may have been a thing). 

It's been a few years of me crawling out of it and this past year has been the first in which I seemed to be really engaged with life, rather than just wishing I was.

I'd say I completely lost touch with my Se and Fe, which would be my auxiliary and inferior functions. As for how I spiraled into it, I think it was my Ti and Ni suddenly becoming the best of friends. So my dominant function was still my dominant, but was being copiloted by my tertiary Ni instead of its trusty Se pal.

So with how I was and assuming other types have a parallel path/process to depression, I'd say losing touch with your auxiliary is more likely, and with your tertiary taking over as copilot.

Also, being "more extroverted, adventurous, curious, excitable, enthusiastic" are just signs of being engaged with life again, really.  I was none of those things in depression, but am more of those things now. Still an ISTP though.I've never studied beyond high school chemistry, but I did extremely well just because I understood mathematics/algebra, and keeping the two side equal for chemical reactions.

Also, setting things on fire.What you described is something most people experience. Scents/smells evoke memories in most people simply because of how the brain physically processes smells.I'm outgoing, and introverted.

Shy is not exclusive to introverts, and it is far from a defining feature.
Outgoing is not exclusive for extroverts, and again, not a defining feature.

When I'm out with people, I'm 'on' and really engaged. People describe me as bubbly and outgoing. However, I can only socialize for a few hours, and then I need days of recovery, being by myself 'recharging'. So ultimately, i am more reserved because by and large I have limited energy to be social. 

The defining feature for both is how they get their energy. 

Introverts get energy from being by themselves, and get drained in social situations. Extroverts gain energy by being around other people, and get drained when they're by themselves.

While this also describes the types, the I vs E refers specifically to the dominant function in a type. E - function oriented toward external world. i - function oriented toward internal world.I don't know who gets along best with what type.
I'll just describe my relationships.

I'm ISTP.
My bbf is an INTP. Love her to pieces, and we get along great. I'm fascinated by her Ne.

My mother and another close friend are both ISFJs. I love them both but they can easily bore/irritate me.

The guys I've been attracted to whose types I know are ENFJ and ESFP. Puppies in human form basically.ISTP.
I have no idea what my body language conveys, ever. I used to be unable to process /acknowledge my feelings, but I'm getting better and recognizing them.

As for reading other people, I'd say I have a decent grasp of reading them. I get better at it the more I socialize. I don't overtly analyze anything though. I just try to recognize signs of how the conversation is going and if they feel comfortable.

As for emoticons, I use them often enough because it helps convey additional tone/meaning.ISTP - Computer Science

My bff is INTP and she double majored in Music and Math, and got education certificationsShyness is a form of social anxiety/nervousness.

Being introverted doesn't mean that. Someone can be extroverted, and be shy. That is, they enjoy being around other people and get energized by it, but they are apprehensive about social interactions.

Someone can be introverted, they are drained by social interactions, but be confident and engaged. 

Also, being drained by social interactions does not mean they don't enjoy it (unless they have no energy for it). Humans are social creatures, and need to socialize. Just in varying degrees.

I come off as extroverted, because when I'm around people I'm fully engaged with them. I also can only stand social interaction for maybe 5 hours a week and spend the rest of the week by myself. Hell, I've gone months without interacting with a soul besides cashiers.

You can't necessarily tell until you spend a lot of time with people. People that are closer to me know that I have limited social energy and will shut down after a period of time. They get to see the reserved and quiet side of me because they spend more time with me. People I just met see me as social and outgoing.

You can't necessarily tell, because that is an inner process. Yes, the general trend will likely be the extroverts are more outgoing. But many introverts are social and outgoing *when they are in social situations*. They will then spend time by themselves to recharge (and therefore no one's around to see them in that state). I spend hours at home reading, drawing, internet-ing, video gaming. 

Also, introversion and extroversion is not a dichotomy. It's more of a spectrum. You can be really super introverted, or you can be introverted but closer to the middle, vice versa, and anywhere in between.

And again, this introversion/extroversion is different from mbti functions, though related.

Also, I'm introverted, but the people I'm attracted to tend to be very extroverted chatter boxes. It works because they keep the conversation/excitement going and I help the chill them heck out.
And because they are very social, they can go off with their friends while I'm by myself doing whatever I want. And since they're often engaged in various social outings, I can piggyback on those outings  (because one problem with my introverted friends is that we're always good at staying inside chilling and are bad at organizing get togethers where we're doing something out with people)I've mostly gotten ISTP, sometimes gotten INTP (during a time where I was not mentally okay so there's that).

ISTP resonates with me completely, and lol I don't got no Ne. I think having an INTP best friend affected things xD

But yeah, because ISTP is an accurate model for myself, I've been able to use it to better understand why I've done things/not done things, and try to improve/optimize me.

Also, INTP has inferior Fe and your descriptions of your emotions reminded me of this http://cognitive-exper-ti-se.tumblr.com/post/146429462793/what-she-says-im-fine-what-she-really-means-my

FWIW, i used to repress my emotions all the time because I was always just like "?????" to their existence, and I also have inferior Fe. Now I kind of just let them exist and be expressed and pay them little mind because the "????" hasn't really changed.

Bonus: http://sensa-tion.tumblr.com/post/147888328022/fe-in-all-four-positionsHe's explicitly set his boundaries, please respect them. 

It might serve you both well for you guys to stay apart for a few months and let the emotions simmer down before resuming a friendship.I'm an ISTP, and when I'm active I'm not in my head but am rather enjoying the physical sensations and thrills (or am actively trying to learn a physical skill, like dancing). I'm also a cautious thrill-seeker, but that's the nature of being a Ti-dom I'd think (or maybe it's Ti-Ni future thinking).

Actually, the more repetitive the physical activity, the less interested I tend to be because I'll get bored by it. (The only reason I enjoy walking right now is because of Pokemon Go and friends and dog walking to entertain me as I walk the sterile suburbs)I'm an ISTP and my best friend is an INTP.

I despise research and analysis beyond the superficial. I'd much rather just do a thing and figure it out as I go along, reading only when necessary. She thrives in research and analysis, often to the point of never doing a thing.

I'm also the one that actively pushes her to go out and explore with me, because I need new sensations and experiences. She likes physical activity where she can still be in her head. She gives me interesting new ideas and expands my perspective (though often it's just eccentric/how-do-you-come-up-with-this-stuff ideas, idk how much my perspective is actually being expanded as opposed to just landing in a separate unrelated universe entirely).I'd say it is correct in being a simplified model that relates Ne/Se to a single aspect of how it's used. but I'd amend Ne to wanting to think through it (versus thinking of it).

One of the differences between me, an ISTP, and my INTP best friend is that I always just want to go do the thing and be done, whereas she wants to think through it thoroughly, often to the point of not doing anything until pushed.I have no opinion or feelings in regards to extroverts being extroverts, besides simple understanding of 'oh that's how you work that is not how I work"

In terms of relationships, the person's extroversion or introversion doesn't have as much of an influence as does their respect and empathy for me and our compatibility.

I've had extroverted people who did not respect my need for and like of solitary time and activities and they tried to change me and treated me like I was something to be fixed. I don't care for them.
I've had other extroverted friends who were like "Oh cool, have your time, but make sure to make time for us too because we want to hang out," and I get along swimmingly with them. For the extroverts I do get along with, sometimes they need a lot of attention. Thankfully, they have enough distractions from other sources that I do not have to give them constant attention..

Besides that basic level of understanding and respect, there's not much to say for dating. Sometimes I prefer extroverts because they keep the conversations going and help me engage the world more (because I can too easily just stay in my head all day). Sometimes, introverts are too quiet for the date to amount to anything. (With friendships, I have no preference tbh, as the relationship being organic usually means there's no pressure to engage/entertain and be entertained)I need alone time to be happy. It recharges me. It relaxes me. It lets me decompress. 

If I'm forced to do stuff when I need alone time, I stop caring. I stop caring about the activity, and if there's a person forcing me to do the stuff, I stop caring about them. I just don't have the energy or mental capacity to handle it, I get overwhelmed, and I shut down (and will likely be trying to find a way to remove the source that's taking away my me time, whether it's an activity or a person). Without alone time, I can't reach a state where I care again. It's how I can "bounce back like it's nothing". If I didn't get it, I wouldn't be bouncing back. I would just be in a perpetual state of not giving a fuck (which has happened. I don't like it because it doesn't help relationships, but if I have no fucks to give, then I have no fucks to give).

How quickly I respond to messages is usually a good gauge of how well I'm doing. The less alone time I have, the more likely I will be to just not acknowledge messages. Usually due to lack of energy/care, rarely due to resentment but that can be a reason too. If I respond fairly quickly, then I'm getting adequate amounts of me time. The past two weeks, for example, I've been responding fairly immediately to all communication, but that's because every day I get a few hours just to me. The week before that I was hounded by work, and then had a house full of people demanding attention, and getting no time to myself. Any texts/emails that got responses from me were only getting them if the conversations were more necessary (e.g., my mom texting me about bills that needed to be paid). Otherwise, I just didn't care.

I don't know if you can necessarily understand it, besides just accepting that we need it. And finding ways to occupy your time when she's not available. ISTP.

I don't watch anime/cartoons much nowadays because life gets in the way, but I'll try to list the ones I do remember as favorites.

*Stein's Gate*

*Guilty Crown*

*Avatar: The Last Airbender*

*Attack on Titan*

*Danganronpa*

*Claymore*


As for Death Note and Full Metal Alchemist, the manga for both are my favorites but I've yet to see their anime.ISTP.

My bff is an INTP, and a few other people who I really adore/respect and was able to type are ESFP, ENFJ, and INTJI've never excused someone's behavior. It's helped me *understand* both my behavior (from understanding/recognizing the motivations) and other people's behavior, especially when it deviates from mine because I can understand their differing perspective that leads them to a behavior. And it has given me a frame of reference to improve/develop myself because I have a better understanding of the root (motivations) of the behavior.

But if I find a behavior to be troublesome or bothersome, I do not excuse it just because I understand where it's coming from. Depending on the person/situation, I either communicate the issue (without mbti terms), or I decrease contact so I don't have to have the bothersome behavior in my life. If it's problematic behavior in me, I try to be cognizant of it and improve.Yay! My bff is an INTP.I think the difference between male and female ISTPs probably has a lot to due with gendered socialization. ISTP.

Extroverted type: ENTP/ENFP/ENFJ ^(I'm indecisive okay)

Introverted Type: INTJ  
^I'm^already^the^best^typeINTPA leopard may not be able to change its spots, but thankfully as humans with higher intelligence one can be cognizant of and modify behavior, especially when the motivations are understood (both for the behavior and the reasons to consider modifying it).

If something someone does is truly problematic, I think it's a disservice to them to not communicate the issue if you can. It takes away the opportunity for them to look at themselves critically, and is also assuming that they more of are a basic animal with no higher intelligence.I have a fascination with Ne/Ni. 

My bff is an INTP so I've been plenty exposed to her Ne and am always amazed and perplexed by it. And I may have Ni, but besides being prominent for the joyous Ti-Ni loop adventure, it's still poorly developed.

Basically, I'd want to be an N type to understand it.An individual thing. The reasoning behind it would be cognitive function, but still unlikely to point to only a single function.

I smile a lot, but it's to appear warm and friendly (or to pretend I'm engaged with the person when I'm not)ISTP.

The cool badass aura. I wish I had it, but I don't.

I'm warm and friendly to strangers/acquaintances; it's close friends that get hit with aloofness because I know they won't take it personally/I'm not trying to use them for networking.I also don't trust others well; that's part of why I am the way I am. The friendliness and warmth is very one-dimensional tbh. It's sort of a shell around me that happens to be welcoming in nature.

With friends I have no need to be only friendly. I can be however I want, whether it's quiet or bubbly or sarcastic or going into dad mode (not nurturing enough for mom mode even though I'm a girl) because a few can be really stupid sometimes. If you're not a friend and decide to do something really stupid, I'll prbly smile, with some side-eye, and let you unless there are serious consequences.

So it's less that I'm *more* friendly to strangers/acquaintances, and more that I'm *only* friendly and little else.I guess I'm too close to myself to see it xDI agree with your assessment of ISTPs and INTPs.

You've described the difference between me and my INTP best friend! And also her problem of never knowing what to pursue because she wants to do *all* the things.You find it odd that I show only a single, un-threatening aspect of my personality to strangers, whereas friends get to see the unfiltered 3 dimensional whole of me, from the most pleasant to the most brash?Tertiary Fe: Joey from Friends*Ti* - "How does this work and why does this work?? Wait is this really relevant to anything why am I looking this up ... I am too lazy to take this apart ... let's find something else that requires less effort and is maybe more relevant to life"

*Se* - I'm a little too present-oriented, it's made me kind of hedonistic. I'm trying to work on my lack of foresight in favor of present enjoyments, I'm also easily bored if my physical senses aren't being engaged fairly regularly, but this can be easily satisfied by just going on a walk. I also like adrenaline rushes (from roller coasters and such). I'm an introvert and am friends with lots of introverts, but I'm having a problem of needing to go out and wanting to explore and all of my friends are happy to never do that.

*Ni* - wtf is dis how dis werk (Besides the Ti-Ni loop because that was hella unappreciated)

*Fe* - I fair really well in social situations. I read people well and having a bubbly but blasé attitude seems to make me well-liked. Being a girl probably helps. I've also been drawn to a few feeling types specifically so I can understand and emulate their sympathy/empathy cuz on my own I can't do shit (Ti plays a part in this). I've been doing this for a few years in response to the period where I had completely shut down my Fe and was overly cold and detached,yielding many complaints from loved ones.I'm fairly certain there's a misunderstanding in our communication. My questions were to understand your view.

I don't trust strangers. I only trust friends, so in that regards our views don't contradict each other.

I think my words were interpreted to mean that I am kinder to and care more about strangers than friends. Strangers get superficial, no investment, friendliness. Friends get depth and honesty and care and empathy and the full range of personality, which can include indifference as I see no need to hide that from friends.ISTP.

I can't say I have a favorite due to my very limited exposure. Java is the language I know best.There's a difference between choosing to learn about it of your own accord and having someone push you to it.No, I just meant that could be a reason for you to be obsessed, choosing to learn it of your own accord, versus her friends who had someone else introduce them and convince them.Nope.

I'm pretty "don't touch me" in my everyday life. I only crave touch in a very specific kind of relationship. Introversion can't be truly judged based on how you act in social situations, because you'll be in social mode and often you'll be using your extroverted functions (in your case, Ne&amp;Fe) more.

My bff is an INTP. She's also super loud (she's a singer, has a booming voice) and hyper when with friends and her Ne is coming up with fascinating ideas and shit. 

She can also happily spend months without interacting with people. She's not an introvert because she's social when in social situations, she's an introvert because she gets exhausted after socializing and is more than satisfied in solitary activities (usually using Ti-Ne), and will prefer the alone time.

When I'm interacting with people, many think I'm extroverted just because I'm bubbly and yeah, in social mode. But I can also spend weeks just by myself doing whatever, and get irritated real quick if I socialize past my limits.I have no idea. Anyone I'm close to likes me, and anyone who is not in that list I don't interact with enough to know one way or another, and sure as heck wouldn't know their type.

I'm tempted to say I don't like ISFJs, but that's only because my mother is one and attempts to dictate my life, and is overly concerned with others' perception of us. But I have a really good friend who's an ISFJ and I adore her. She leaves me alone though, so that's why she's cool.

I think I'm supposed to not like N types, but my bff is an INTP and I think she's better than everything and everyone. And I always enjoyed listening to an ENTP classmate play devil's advocate. (common denominator between all of us is Ti though, so I may not be a fan of Ne combined with another filter. Who knows.)I think it's the Ti-Ne.

I lean more towards "just do it", given a bit of thinking it through. I either quickly think myself out of the action, or will just do it if I haven't talked myself out of it. If I keep thinking about it, I'll likely get bored and move on to something else, which I feel is more Ti-SeFacebook profile analysis thinks I'm INFP (lololol orientation of all functions are reversed and in the exact opposite order in stack).

Can't be bothered with the text version.&gt;What do you consider yourself in a religious sense: 

Atheist/Agnostic. 

&gt;Are you Gnostic or Agnostic: 

Agnostic

&gt;What are the reasons for you being Atheist/Agnostic: 

I don't believe in any higher powers/deities but also know and accept that I literally cannot *know* because the whole thing is by nature intangible, and also I just don't care. It is just the word that describes my belief, or lack thereof. Apatheism might be be more accurate actually. Meh.

&gt;Is religion important to you: 

Nope.

&gt;Have you ever changed your belief in your life: 

Nope.

&gt;Why did you change your belief, what led to you to it: 

N/A

&gt;Have you ever argued for your religion or against: 

Nope.

&gt;If you do argue what arguments to you tend to stick too: 

N/A.

&gt;How do you feel about religion: 

It's there. A tool/idea. Helps provide a sense of peace/purpose/community for some. The people wielding the beliefs are of greater consequence than the belief itself, in most cases. It is very much something that would have never occurred to me if family/society hadn't exposed me to the idea. Even then I can't be bothered to care.  My family's Muslim, but as a kid I saw the practice of the religion just as tasks or a social function I was expected to participate in. And the ideas were basically storytime to me.I had the "I'm a robot" mindset, but that was when I was a teenager who had very little understanding/grip of emotions (and had health/stress issues where I was too overwhelmed by the physical state of perpetual pain to even touch on any mental stuff).

As I've matured I've gotten a better understanding/grip on emotions, as well as seeing the value in them instead of just seeing them as inherently and inanely irrational, and have dropped the "I'm a robot" mindset. Granted, all of that was only possible *after* the health/stress problems improved significantly and I had the mental capacity to develop.Si will not inherently and blindly oppose change. They may be more comfortable with the familiar and traditions and what they know, but that doesn't preclude them from welcoming change.

Also, she engages in the world and other people with Fe, so it's easier to see than Si.I often listen to music just to enjoy the sounds. I often get irritated with non-instrumental songs because I'll think all the instruments are perfect and the vocals are getting in the way of me listening to the music.

Granted, I think this might be because I stopped listening to lyrics in songs when i was a kid because I would often dislike a song I enjoyed listening. If there are vocals in songs, I tend to like them if it's a foreign language (German, Finnish, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Hindi, and Arabic are ones I enjoy a lot)My mother is an ISFJ and will forever remember things. She doesn't do much about it, aside from vent every now and then.

It just means if her view of you has been marred, you'll have to move mountains for her to trust/respect you again.I think a lot of people don't realize that without finding the reason behind why terrible things happen, you can't even hope to change it. 

I mean, if they care so much about how it's horrible, i would think they'd want it to change. For things to change, the cause needs to be known. But many just want to talk about how horrible it is, and then move on.I've done similar shit, but being in the same room as someone willingly and sharing a hotel room counts as quality time for me. 

Granted, I wasn't messaging other people and was just watching stupid shit and showing her share-worthy stuff if I came across any, and she was doing the same.Intrapersonal Intelligence.

I dunno. I didn't love some of the answer options, and it's such a short quiz....Same. When I had depression, I could only deal with my bff who's an INTP, and online tests liked to give me INTP then (now they like to give me ISTP, ESTP, or ISFP).Ne in the dom/aux position is the function I can usually recognize easily because it goes off in a million perspectives and dumps out ALL the ideas.

I tend to be fascinated with Ne when it's filtered with Ti (I can listen to my INTP friend and ENTP classmate for hours). 

I tend to get irritated when it's filtered with Fi, because though it's fascinating it's concerned with a realm I don't care much about (I get bored of my INFP friend's musings really easily).Ambition, Rationality, and Orderliness.

I'm a Slytherin for a reason =D

Not sure I agree with the orderliness, unless I fit the last sentence of "but your desire for order is a good one when it is focused where it is needed and when you’re okay with a bit of mess", since I'm ok with a good deal of mess.

Was hoping for Independence or Playfulness &gt;.&lt;Neediness *and* Independence!1) Sure? I mean, a lot of factors go into why you're interested in the things you are interested in. I love drawing and singing, partly because I enjoy trying to master the technical aspect of both, and also aesthetically pleasing things make me happy.

2) That's me all the way. Well, almost. I don't tend to be offensive. Except with close friends. Who don't care anyways. But I do put effort into my interactions with other people, because otherwise it wouldn't really happen and I'd likely be more aloof and obtuse than not. I think it stems from Fe being an inferior function. I put effort into it specifically because it's my weakness. 

I recognize the importance of my relationships and building good rapport with people, but it's not my natural tendency tbh and people often confuse me as do emotions, both my own and others'.  A few of my closest friends are hella people-oriented and I try to learn from them. I've noticed I'm drawn to Fe doms too, specifically ENFJs (whose function stack is the reverse of mine :O).I've always found that ironic, because my INTP best friend and I work together so well specifically because we have a very similar way of approaching and understanding things in life but she's the idea provider and I'm the let's actually go do stuff person. She explores all the different possibilities I couldn't ever come up with and I keep her grounded.

(also, pros of inferior Fe, both of us can go hermit mode at any time for however long and it doesn't affect our relationship)I have once, and it was definitely built over time. But I fell super hard. I prefer a stable committed relationship, because if I choose a person then it'd decisive and final, but I like the relationship to have a fun, go-with-the-flow atmosphere. He verbally expressed his affection for me often, and I verbally expressed affection for him never/in a round-about way in response to his.

i don't fall in love easily, as evidenced by the single occurrence of it. My subconscious just doesn't find many people worthy paying attention to.Hell if I know xD

Some traits in common I think they have are: energetic, puppy-like enthusiasm, emotionally/socially intelligent, deliberate in how they behave even if it seems completely random.

It's easier for me to tell you why most people can't hold my attention for long: I'm usually more engaged and interested by something I'm reading, or doing, or by my own mind. 

My favorite person in the world is my bff, and she always keeps me on my toes. I love the way she thinks and she always keeps me engaged, and she enthusiastically joins me when I drag her out for fun. The last part is important because often when I do find someone intellectually stimulating, they aren't equally stimulating in terms of  wanting to do and experience things, and vice versa.I like ENFJs a lot, though they can be a bit much sometimes. 

The ones who can give me my space with confidence and ease are my favorites. I get irritated by the ones who are overbearing, and would rather admire them from afar. 

People are my weakness so I'm fascinated by how ENFJs navigate peopleHappy birthday~
ISTP - Questioner.Music without lyrics, at a lower volume. Lyrics distract me, including foreign languages.

I need to have some level of background noise. Or background stuff happening. I prefer studying in a room with windows or where there's background movement rather than in a place with complete silence and lack of things happening. I'll actually get fidgety and more distracted with less things going on. I'm having a problem with a work area right now because the room is basically sterile (no windows, minimal furniture/stuff, almost no other people/movement), and it actually distracts me. 

Honestly, my favorite place to work is outside, but I can't because of wind messing with papers, sunlight reflecting on screens, and lack of outlets. 

Anyway, I prefer listening to Lindsey Stirling, David Garrett, some classical songs, and lots of actions movie/video game soundtracks. The more boring the task is, the more I prefer epic background music.

When i was in school, I'd have a different set of songs for each class, so that I would associate a certain set of songs with a certain subject and would be reminded of the subject/information when I heard the song outside of explicit study time.I also have a habit of going poof for periods of time, and it's not personal; I just need space/time.

You need to talk to your SO about your needs/feelings, and that you respect her need for space but it can also upset you just because your needs are a little different. So you'd appreciate it if she kept you in the loop and respected your need for a bit of more consistent attention.

The people I care about will get a bit of contact/attention from me even when I don't want to just because I understand that it is important to them and I care. Of course, if they didn't respect my need for space, I also wouldn't care to be considerate of their needs.&gt; American hand-egg

I'm about to piss off some of my friends with this fun gem.My two best friend's are INTP and ISFJ, and they're such specifically because I love their company and we get along swimmingly. 

INTP and I are on the same wavelength while balancing each other out with my groundedness and her eccentricity. 

ISFJ and I have similar interests, and while we have different values and perspectives, we don't clash with each other because we accept our differences. We also communicate directly. (I don't get along with my ISFJ mother though because communicating directly and saying what she means and meaning what she says is not her strong suit. But also the parent-child, overbearing, no concept of me-not-actually-being-an-extension-of-her attitude plays a much larger role. I'd say it's unrelated to type and more a nature of being in a dynamic with imbalanced power (parent-child), and her being south Asian and me being American so cultural differences in how family and independence, especially in regards to women, works)

I can't say I've noticed any particular pattern in regards to types among my social circles. Maturity,communication, and social culture/background plays more of a part.I was really confused for a second because I misread Easilydo as Easydildo.Depends on who it is/the situation. If you're close to me,  I'll tell you that I'm not in the mood to talk. If I can get out of the situation easily, I'll do so. If I can't and you're not someone I'm close to, I'll smile and nod while zoning out. If it's my mom I just zone out.So the reason I got into mbti was because learning about ISTP resonated with me so much, and gave me an understanding of myself that I needed, as well as articulating things I knew but didn't know how to pinpoint. 

It gave me a simple framework for how I work, thus giving me the tools to be aware of why I do things and start optimizing and improving myself. (Also, I was in the middle of my journey out of depression, so learning about the Ti-Ni loop helped, and I seeked out ways to engage my Se and Fe even though all I really wanted to do was be a hermit in a dark room)

It also gave me the perspective to truly understand that people think differently and to respect that and work with it.Romantic refers to how you behave with others, specifically in a romantic context.

Lovable refers to how others see you, in any relationship context.

I am basing this just on what the words mean, since the meaning in the infographic could be different.Te (Extroverted Thinking) (35%)

based on your results your type is likely - istpISTP.

I'm terrified. Brexit had a spike of hate crimes following it. I'm scared for my family and friends with this validating all the xenophobic, homophobic, racist, sexist people who voted a likewise man in. Just like after Brexit, those people will stop being shy now.I don't watch news. I do, however, have all Muslim family, and mostly non-white or LGBTQ+ friends who have experienced harassment and death threats already and legitimately fear it getting worse, not by the state, but by civilians who are egged on by Trump encouraging their persecution. Yes. Silly tests got me ISTP/INTP usually. 

Eventually I got curious and looked into mbti more deeply and ISTP resonated with me, specifically in giving me the words and framework to articulate how I think. That framework has helped a lot in understanding myself and optimizing myself, but also to better understand other people.

 MBTI was when I truly understood that others actually think and understand things differently and their ways of thinking are just as valid (rather than me being obstinate in believing others are irrational, or feeling stupid in comparison to my INTP bff because I can never explore ideas like she can). That understanding has helped me improve how I interact and communicate with others.&gt;How are you able to fully adopt, follow, take seriously an externally devised model that someone else came up with?

Because I know that there is no such thing as a correct model. Some models are just more accurate than others. I simply take whatever parts of the model offer useful ideas and don't bother too much with the other details.I've definitely done that a lot. Funnily my INTP has lots of thoughts about lots of things so she contributes a lot to the opinions I formI don't think it's necessarily related to functions. I generally prefer to be left alone, mostly because by the time I finish processing it'll be forever later, or my anger is driven by many unrelated factors and is focusing unfairly on something but I know that. If someone pushes me to tell them, I'll explode at them.My bff and platonic soulmate is an INTP.

From a less anecdotal standpoint and more theoretical stand point, no clue.Visual: 81.25%
Auditory: 31.25%
Kinesthetic: 31.25% 

Was expecting higher kinesthetic to be honest.Huh, the desired objectives and actual problems are pretty accurate for meI mean, if it's fiction, I generally have no problem just enjoying it and taking it for what it is.

It's when I encounter beliefs/opinions/media claiming to represent reality where I'll be like "uh huh, sure, if you say so"For the most part, yes. I'm pretty confident and always trying to improve and am proud of myself.

Recently though, I'm finding that being so reserved and not being that good at affection/touch or many other social things as an ISTP woman is a disadvantage in dating. Another thing to learn, but soft skills are difficult to work with.Not necessarily programming. I'm ISTP and into programming (career wise at least) , but my INTP bff is into music, music theory, and math.

Wanting to master cars would also be Ti. It's not what you do, but why.I feel like Ti is more "How does a box work?"Ti cares more about getting a deeper understanding of how something works. Knowing what something is doesn't necessarily give you that deep understanding of how it works, and thus how it can be manipulated.

Or, if "what s a box" is taken more philosophically, Ti doesn't care too much about the theory. It cares about the "this is the concrete way it works and how it can be taken apart and put back together, maybe even put back together in new ways".

"What is a box" doesn't seem to capture the entirety of Ti, at least based on my understanding of it. It's either too shallow (literal what is) or too deep in a different direction (philosophical what is).I'm ISTP.

The ones whose types I'm aware of are ENFP and ENFJ. I absolutely adore the ENFP and he's so much fun, and the ENFJ is also fun but his rigidity is a bit annoying but also might be something I need. And programming can fund whatever nonsense we get into
Thank you for answering me.
And I think you may be right, I'll explore ISTJ for a while.
Thanks again.Thanks.
I made some research.
How could i know whether im ISTJ or ISTP.
Some traits? Habits? 
I'm really sorry to bother you with all this questions.
Does ISTj in Socionics translate to ISTP of MBTI?
Hi, thanks for reading this.
I'm sorry for the wall of text,
I've been taking MBTI tests (i got "obsessed" with it) lately, and I just got confused regarding my type.
So far my results have been (in order): INTP, ISTP, INTJ, ESTJ, ISTJ, INFP.
I can identify my behavior with almost all of them in some aspects, but I know MBTI is more about the cognitive processes.
(English is not my native language, so I apologize for any mistake)

My results in Keys have been: ESTJ, ISTJ, ISFP and a possible ISTP.

based on your results your type is likely - unclear

And for the questionnaire:

**Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.**

16-year-old, male.
I was depressed recently (5 months ago), but it doesn't matter anymore.

**You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favourite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?**


My thoughts would be:
I hope it can be fixed, What if we don't make it? We can go to another one , but what if we can't do that?
I always knew this car was pure trash.

As for my reactions, I would be angry and annoyed.
If no one is to blame, I hold the car responsible. (even if it sounds ridiculous)
I get told to relax. 
I try to be part of the solution, by looking things on my phone.
Go somewhere to listen to music and wait.
Think about how am I going to get to the concert.


**You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the afterparty that was announced (and assure you they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do?**


I would prefer not going to the party. 
if I stay, maybe try to convince them that it may not be a good idea.
if I go, I stick with the people I know (if I notice I hold them back or they make me uncomfortable, I'll go to another place of the party),I wouldn't drink or anything related, and check what the driver is doing from time to time, to ensure my security.


**On the drive back, your friends are talking. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward reaction? What do you outwardly say?**

Inwards: Such an idiot, how can someone be so stupid?

Outwards: I'll tell them why they're wrong. If they continue with their stupidity, ill ask them why they're right, and proceed to teach them with facts about the subject, ask them things about it.
If they continue to dismiss all that, I'll tell them they are being stupid and ignorant (they're probably drunk), while I proceed to end the conversation.
All of this is only in the case is an important belief or a basic truth, if it's not I'll use fewer insults or ignore it.


**What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, and habits?**


Well, it would be surprising ( and maybe exciting/interesting )
But I think I would be able to keep my "cool" at the moment. (maybe not)
Later, maybe I could learn something.
I would think, What really happened? How does it affect me?
Maybe try to change to benefit me.


**What are some of your most important values? How did you come about determining them? How can they change?**


I don think I hold a lot of values.
I have my own "moral compass". (even as a child)
It's a complicated and perhaps empty system.
I have a "strong sense" of personal "justice".
If someone does something to me, I'll consider doing te same to them. (if the offense is small, ill carry it out)
I value Intelligence, competence.
I want to be right and  I can be really competitive ( but normally I'm uninterested).
I don't like to lose but I can cope with it. 
( I like to win at whatever cost necessary)


**What about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else?
If you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be? Why?**


I don't know how "unique" I am, but most of the time I don't try to fit in.
I'm creative, I can think of really different solutions when I want (if they work is a different subject)
I'm "smart" but lazy, and I don't have a lot of motivation.
My efficiency and lack of emotions. ( i have  them but only for myself, I have some anger issues or sudden depression every  now and then).

What would I change?

My fear of Failure.
I'll never get somewhere in life if I don't get rid of this.


**How do you treat hunches or gut feelings? In what situations are they most often triggered?**


Maybe when I'm "nervous", but I don't listen to them most of the time.


**What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?**


Energize:

Solitude energizes me.
Music energizes me.
I tend to get up and walk around the house while listening (and daydream a lot)
Discussing or reading about things I like makes me feel ok.

Drain:

Social things drain me.
I always end up tired, after spending a lot of time with people ( even small groups, family )
Reading about boring things, also doing them.


**What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? Why?**


My lack of feelings/empathy.
Emotions aren't my thing.
It has affected two "possible" relationships. (  to be honest, I never cared in the first place).
Or how I don't care about someone's emotional problems ( or other problems in general )
I tend to fake my emotions a lot If I cry in a social event or another thing, it's because I'm expected to cry.

My fear of failure and of not being good enough to succeed.

Feel free to ask anything (habits,behavior,etc.) if it helps with my typing.
Thanks.


Fuck you. 

There's your example. I'm an ISTP. Thought my flair would show up.Well, he was smart enough to not end up dead with all the enemies he makes. 
ENFP.  You talk almost entirely about people and how you affect them.  This is Ne mixed with Fi.  If Ti tries to figure out how a system works, Fi figures out what the system means (i.e.  "I do these things for these results for this reason" is a Te-Fi slanted thought structure, as opposed to "This thing works this way, so I should respond this way" which is Ti-Fe.)I'm an ISTP and my older brother is an INFJ, so I think I can help you out:

So, I lead with Ti, and he leads with Ni.  I find it much easier to communicate my ideas than he does, and my ideas are generally more structured even if they're less comprehensive.

This isn't necessarily an ISTP thing or an INFJ thing, but he's much more of a worrywart than I am because I think I'm more adaptable than he is due to my secondary Se and his inferior Se.  I handle change better for the most part, and he becomes overwhelmed more easily than I do.  On the flip side, he is better about planning for things, and I roughly estimate my plans more often than he does.

Unfortunately for me, I'm much more detached than he is, and he is generally more likable, even though (I think) we're both pretty interesting people.  We've both only ever had a few friends at a time, but I've always been more of a loner than him.  I'm more likely to have more loosely connected friends and he's more likely to have a few really tight friends.

I think I come off as more masculine than he does (although, I'm not sure where the impression comes from... I see myself as a dorky guy).  My brother is much more of an old soul than I am.

That said, I'm way more impulsive than he is and I don't tire out as quickly in intense environments.  I love being at concerts, parties, and generally adventuring (but my city sucks for that :/).  Even if we're just hanging out at home when we come home for break, he can get tired out just being around the family (me too, I'll admit).

We're both in college.  I'm studying Computer Science/Statistics and he's studying Economics.  Both are fairly structured disciplines, but Economics definitely is more human oriented than what I'm going into (artificial intelligence).

Yep.  So that's my analysis.  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.This is not Ni.Undifferentiated.  (49% trinitarian, 51% quaternarian) Hyde from That 70's ShowThese are all myths...It depends... How much funding do they have? Where are they starting it? What's their idea? How do they plan to market their idea?  Is manufacturing a problem?  What happens if your startup goes tits up?

(Note: I don't think the answer to your question has anything to do with MBTI.)I think the IxxJs should be called the "Regulators".  ISxJs have a tendency to impose order in order to preserve their cultivated values (ISFJs) or pragmatic means (in the case of ISTJs) while INxJs try to regulate theirs and others lives according to an internally perceived optimal sequence of events in order to arrive at the best possible future (i.e. Ni feeding Se guided by a Je function).

In this sense,  IxxJs are similar to ExxJs in that they try to impose order, but they're different in that they are trying to impose order for the sake of a worldview and not for its own sake.They don't.  When you notice an STP using Te, it's because that actually is Te.  Due to the way their functions are stacked, STPs either have Te as their fifth (ignoring) function (ISTPs) or their sixth (demonstrative) function (ESTPs).  What this means is that these types have strong Te but it's unvalued, so they'll use it pretty often, but not for its own sake.  They'd rather be perfecting a skill with Ti.

Another interesting point is since STPs have strong and unvalued Te they have weak and unvalued Fi, so their Fi almost never has any weight in their cognition (similar to your Te).  This means that Te is almost completely unrepressed in STPs (moreso in the ESTP since it isn't repressed by their dominant Se unlike ISTPs who repress theirs with Ti).  This means that when you talk to an ESTP, they should look more like Se-T types than SeTi types, and ISTPs should look like Ti-S types rather than Ti-Se types.  Similarly, INFJs would be Ni-F types.No, it just means that you'll use Fe to make decisions much more often than Te and you'll usually get annoyed by people who make Te decisions.Looks good dude!  The only thing is that there seems to be a little bit of Ne spillage into your description of Ti which is okay because no functions work in a vacuum, but ISTPs and ESTPs use Ti a little differently.  Essentially, our Se gives us confidence in the details that we observe in the world (more so in ESTPs than ISTPs), so while I do like to play devil's advocate because I like to play around with logic, we essentially believe how we see things working in real time without poking around too too much.  

For example, I was sitting in my systems programming class yesterday, and while I was trying to understand memory storage I didn't really feel the need to try to tear it apart like an Ne user would.  Instead, it got shot to my shot to my Ni and I just sort of understood it.

Still though, you did an excellent job; I would love to see more from you.What's the weirdest thing that you've done out of boredom?Was it worth it though?  I'm asking for a friend.INFP, I think.  They were really new to the system and tried to type me based on the dichotomies.You're retarded.  Not because you can't express yourself accurately, but because you think too hard about it and care too much.  The people you want to be around are people who get you and people you can learn from comfortably.Yep.  Depression was the worst.  My Se was wanting, and my Ni said "but why?" to which Ti said "no real reason" and Fe chimed in "and everyone hates you too".  So in a sense, I became a fucked up INFJ for a while.Are you sure he's an ENTP?  They are literally defined by their openness to new ideas.It would mean if a person does not have the trait that defines the type, they would not be that type.  I'll admit I was hyperbolizing a bit (as does everyone who uses the word "literally" nowadays), but high Ne users are famous for entertaining multiple perspectives without settling on one.  Plus I think it'd be silly for any modern NT type to be that homophobic (I mean, I have no problem with gay people, I just think NTs have the least reason to have a problem with them).Is formal homophobia a thing lol? I imagine two British guys dressed to the nines sipping their gin and tonics saying shit like:

"Good evening my good sir!"

"And a good evening it could be! If only it weren't for those flamboyant gays all about!"

"Toot toot! I wholeheartedly concur!"Mr. Pink from Reservoir Dogs is one of my favorite characters, he's an ENTP.

Also, the guy from One Punch Man (can't remember his name), is an INTP.Don't apologize, I was just trying to make a joke :DWhen I take it it usually says that I'm primarily ESTP but possibly ENTP or ISTP.  I'll take in a minute and post the results.

By focusing on the strongest configuration of cognitive processes, your pattern of responses most closely matches individuals of this type: ESTP

   Lead (Dominant) Process
   Extraverted Sensing (Se): Immersing in the present context. Responding naturally to everything tangible you detect through your senses. Checking with what your gut instincts say. Testing limits and take risks for big rewards.

 Support (Auxilliary) Process
    Introverted Thinking (Ti): Gaining leverage (influence) using a framework. Detaching to study a situation from different angles and fit it to a theory, framework or principle. Checking for accuracy. Using leverage to solve the problem.

If these cognitive processes don't fit well then consider these types: ISTP, or ENTJ.

So based on this (in order of strength) I get Ti, Se/Ni, Te, Fe, Ne, Fi, Si which is pretty much exactly how I think it should be.

Interestingly, my temperament is Theorist and secondarily Improviser which I also identify with.
It depends how involved I am, but I can get pretty damn talkative if someone catches my attention.Technically yes, but based on socionics, both of you should have fairly toxic relationships.   Essentially, it says that your relationship should be distant and uncomfortable because you share no common ground to communicate on due to your top two functions (i.e. your worldview [Ni/Si] and the way you choose to act on your environment [Fe/Te]) which are totally opposite.

That being said, if your relationship is working: that's fantastic!  I would recommend ignoring type dynamics because in the end, your type is only how you process information and nothing more.

[Btw, here's your what socionics says about Super-Ego relationships.](http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Super-ego_relations)  Bruh...I have no idea why you're being downvoted.  You're completely correct. No.  No MBTI master races for me.  I won't indulge this.His work strikes me as powerfully Si.  Instead of trying to convey reality as is like inferior Se would, Tarkovsky chooses to amplify specific sensory stimulus in order to convey strong emotional messages.  I would type him ISFJ based on his work.So what? Variances from the norm does not make any one super-powered or whatever.  It just makes them unique.  Not all INTJs are prophets, not all ISTPs are athletic gods, not all ENFJs are charismatic powerhouses.  Humans are humans.Hobbies: I played music (bass guitar), I was on my high school swim team, I was in math club and science club, I liked video games a lot, and I smoked a lot of weed.

Grades:  Pretty awesome.  I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA

Friends:  Ehhh... I had a few, but I didn't like them much, and I was too big of a pothead for the people I liked. Ce la vie.

Future Plans:  None at that point.  I got good grades and did my extra-curriculars so that I could set myself up for what I wanted when the time came.  In a sense, I'm still doing that.

Family life: Too personal, sorry.

Reputation:  Smart, introverted, asshole aka the typical immature ISTP.

I never really got into trouble.  I was too good at covering my tracks. 3:)

I don't really believe in enneagram, but I think my enneagram is either 7w8 or 5w4.  My tritype is 573 and my instinctual variant is Sx/SoYeah.  I think it's better when there's imagery attached.

"Did you see [redacted political candidate] during the debate?  They were literally grasping at straws!"He's directly addressing the premise of the post (i.e. the types' superpowers), which he disagrees with.  Tell me that's not relevant.  Sure, he's not pandering to the premise of the post (i.e. the types have superpowers), but that doesn't mean his ideas about it are less relevant than a person who agrees that the types have superpowers.  

Plus, OP wasn't talking about shared traits, he's speaking in plain and well defined English in his explanation of the initial question.  If anything, your comment is irrelevant because it doesn't address the topic or a derivative topic because you've twisted his words; should I downvote you?

Side note:  reading through the responses, it's striking me odd that the people who got "evil" alignments have overall better stats.  Just an observation.It's not, really, as long as the unlikable characters do something that contributes to the message the writers were trying to get across.  If the characters are likable, there doesn't have to be a meaning.  If there's meaning, the characters don't have to be likable.Um... probably cigarettes.  You don't get fucked up, you get to chill out and take a break from whatever you're doing for a minute, and some of the best friendships and conversations I've ever had were forged over a cig.  In some ways, it's very similar to having sex, the exception being that you can do it with a guy without being gay.I don't know any Fe users who would do this; it seems... inappropriate.Ne dominants approach the world by connecting the ideas in it.  It sees the possibilities and then which ones are good or bad, and it acts on it (Te).

Fi dominants primarily sense what's good and bad, and once they find these principles they use Ne to abstract these ideas into general principles to see what is globally good or bad.  It then stores these to use later.

INFPs are far more passive than ENFPs, kind of like how ISFPs are more passive than ESFPs.ENTJ for 5, 6 and 8; ISTP for the rest.I don't like it that much, and it makes you look like either a dork or a dirtbag in most settings, but it's certainly healthier.  I have nothing against people who do, but it's not my cup of tea.Recently in the field of physics, scientists began to discard the use of particles as a way to understand the underlying structure of the universe and are now claiming that everything exhibits field-like behavior and all matter and energy are just propagations in those fields.  So, in a sense, we are all just ripples in the same medium.

To me, it seems odd that science is reaching a conclusion that most philosophies (Buddhism for example) and religions (such as the Christian belief that we are all a part of God and God is everywhere) found millenniums ago.
 
Why do you think it's the case that so many different schools of thought have arrived at the same conclusion, that we are all one, independently of each other?  Is it because it's true or is it because humans are hardwired to understand things that way?  What do you think about the notion that the universe is one continuous entity, including yourself, everyone, and everything that has ever existed?I don't really have any sources other than a few physics books, youtube videos about physics, and my understanding of religion.  This is entirely my own, and I was wondering about people's thoughts on it.Obviously, but the general, big idea is the same.  That's why I questioned the underlying intuition.

Every knowledgable devout christian I've talked to about it believes that.  And even then, when you see people speak about it, you can see the original message which has been obfuscated over years of manipulation.  Besides, I was using them as an example, I wasn't going to list every belief system that holds these ideas, you pedantic fuck.Ava- INFJ

I liked it a lot.I haven't thought about it that way, but I agree.  1. Chaotic Good (think non-racist Walt Kowalski from Gran Torino in terms of morality)

2. True Neutral (possibly chaotic neutral?)

3. Chaotic Neutral might be fun.  The few times I've ever played DnD I always pissed off my party as chaotic neutral (i.e. Destroying important quest items for fun and the like).Whoever wrote this can fight me.  I'm living life, living well, and loving it.Talents:  I've always been good at math, and I'm pretty good at programming (C/C++).  I also recently learned that I'm really good at trivia.

Hobbies:  I play bass, but I'm not in a band.  I like chess also, but I don't really care enough to learn strategy outside of openings.  I also like to troll my friends Ti style.The complicated rugby weirdo who's an overly caring bitch?  Pretty close except I'm not complicated, I don't play rugby, I'm not a weirdo, and I'm not an overly caring bitch.I used to be like that up through high school, but I don't do it much any more.  ISTP.Pretty much never.

Smoked pot with my friends, but that was about it.ISTP Computer Science/Statistics student at my university.  I'll probably end up being some kind of software engineer, but I'd love to design machine learning algorithms for studying economic trends and  possibly become a professor at some point.  I also think it'd be cool to, at some point, be a consultant for software firms.  All I know is that I can do some cool shit with my degree and make a little bit of cash doing it.ESFJTi types try to remove themselves from their judgements to be accurate; Fi types try to involve themselves in their judgements to true to be sincere.  You can't be involved and removed at the same time on a level that's that personal.Ooh, this is a fun one :)

1.  Ti is my natural mode of functioning so a lot of it is effortless to me and I don't notice it a lot of the time, but I do see where my thoughts differ from others pretty often.  I ask a lot of questions (most of which aren't voiced because I know how to troubleshoot for answers).  Whenever I get really involved in a task, I sort of see past whatever's going on in front of me and I try to look at the cogs that turn the (figurative) machine I'm observing.  Everything really is the sum of it's parts and if you look hard enough, you can see all the little parts falling into place.

2.  I'll start with the innocuous ones first.

Alcohol- Ti becomes my platform for conversation.  When I'm drunk, I'm a huge troll and an asshole and I like to piss people off by arguing logic, but inside I still know it's a game and I can still recognize when I'm being misleading or I'm flat-out making shit up.  I tell my victims what's going on when I do this, because there's nothing more dangerous than someone who believes the bullshit I tell them haha.

Weed- Ti becomes subconscious.  I don't focus on it, but it's still there.  Most of the time when I'm high, I just don't want to be with people because they make me anxious, and I'd rather be playing video games by myself.  When I'm high, my Ti shreds *everything* to bits, and I become depersonalized pretty easily.

Adderall- Mmmmm :)  Ti overdrive.  I'm a coder, so I love doing my projects when I'm stimulated.  Everything works well and it comes super easy.  I hate working with others though.  I speak too quickly and densely, and often my friends will bring up every solution that I've *already fucking told them I shot down.*  So I put in earbuds and let the inspiration fly.  Good shit, all around.

LSD-  When you look at a work of art, you usually try to figure out what the artist was trying to convey, or maybe how they felt when they designed it.  When I look at a piece of art, I think about the brushstrokes and techniques and where the art form may have arisen from.  Now imagine that reality is a singular work of art.  There goes my Ti.  Every bit of info becomes highly relevant.

Mushrooms are similar to LSD, but it's more "feely".

I've done some other stuff too, but not extensively enough to make a note of.For fun.It's okay.  I can't really keep up, but I can follow it and I think it can be funny when I'm not trying to be productive.I don't know what you mean.

Why am I not ESTP?  I'm a Ti dominant through and through, my man.

Why am I not you specifically? Beats me.I like to, but I don't play that often.Two words: sex appeal.1. Not easily, but I can do it.

2.  It depends.  Some things really get to me, some things don't.

3.  When I'm by myself, yes.  When I'm with people, not as much.  There's too much information at once to think about it.I like them.  Fi is kinda weird to me, but I have one really good friend who's an ISFP, and one of my best friends is an INFP.Around friends I'm really extroverted.  Around new people, not so much.

I really like being around people, but they tire me the fuck out.  I hate holding extended conversations.

I'm much sillier than a lot of ISTPs, but I blame it on being around 2 ENTPs and an ESTJ for 90% of my awake time.Cars are cool, but I don't really care about them as much as some other things.  I care more about what I can use them to do (sounds Te, but it's really not).

Se sees things clearly as they actually are, as opposed to Ne which sees how things relate to other things.  Ti+Se means I get a feel for almost everything I do very quickly.  The key to being a good Se user is to expose yourself to everything you can so your intuition for new things improve.

I don't think I know any INTPs, tbh.I like being like this.  Why are you like this?No, because I love you too.And?Oh my god, I'm the exact fucking same.  Howdy neighbor?I actually just answered this in another thread.

I'm a Computer Science/Statistics student at my university.  I'll probably end up being some kind of software engineer, but I'd love to design machine learning algorithms for studying economic trends and  possibly become a professor at some point.  I also think it'd be cool to, at some point, be a consultant for software firms.  All I know is that I can do some cool shit with my degree and make a little bit of cash doing it.Not really? Depends on the contextWhich ones?Same :DI smoke cigarettes, but I think my mom would disown me if I bought a motorcycle.I try not to think about it.If they mention something I'm interested in, and I can get a few words in about it, that's all I need.Idk, I don't know any.We met through classes, but we're designing a video game together now.I give people a lot of leeway at first because they don't know me, but people who I've gotten past the awkward initial stage with need to know how to not intrude on my space.  

I live the way I like to, and I hate being criticized for things I've thought long and hard about.  I also don't like it when people ask too much of me without any kind of reciprocation.  I hate when people don't listen before they respond to what I'm saying; I'd rather talk to a fucking brick.  Don't get all preachy on me either.  It grates my bones.

Essentially, treat me the way you want me to treat you.  Treat me kindly, honestly, and generously, and I'll give you the shirt off my back.  Treat me like shit, and I'll treat you like shit.1. I'm 21.

2.  I'd say so, but I can't really remember a time a failed super hard at anything (maybe dating lol).Flip all your letters, and there's your answerINxJ, I'd think.Sometimes, but definitely not around new people.Is that all?

Your lame use of stereotypes hardly scratches the surface of each type, and I hardly think you understand how the types behave outside of some cheap descriptions you read online.  If this is your definition of "not holding back" roasting, I'd be surprised if you haven't gotten food poisoning from your own cooking.  Good luck next time, kiddo, and take some notes before you try to roast us.So I can't roast a roaster now?Did you do this because I did this?I don't know enough ISTPs to know if it's just me, but I also have the ENTP smirk and my friends call me out on it all the time.I just go with what other people tell me, and from people's reactions, apparently my sense of self was (is?) pretty skewed (at least socially).

It's hard to pin yourself down because you (and everyone around you) are constantly in flux; people are generally *very* adaptive until they get older, I've learned.  In order to get a sense of yourself, you need to be able to really pay attention to how people react to the things you say and do, as well as the way you indulge in your interests on your own time.  Don't get too caught up in this, however.  You can get trapped in your head (god knows I did).  I've found that it's easier (and more fun) to just do the things you like and not care about the way it affects your perception of yourself.  Just do good, be good, and feel good, and you'll be figuring out what being *you* is sooner than later.I guess my counter-roast was a failure.  *Shrugs*That's essentially how I view the function stack.  Instead of being a Te-Si or Ti-Se type, I think of it as a TSNF type with a preference for extroversion.  Both types have strong Te, Ti, Si, and Se, but an ISTP is more concerned with Ti than Te.  That's to be expected.  There's a reason they say your dominant function is the most "differentiated".Can you give me examples?ENTJ had me rolling0_0

This is why I thought I was an ISTP, but INFJ actually makes sense now.No.  For me, what I create is largely for other people.  If it's art, it's so that I can communicate a message.  If what I deliver is more pragmatic, it's so I can provide for people I care about.  Recognition is overrated; influence is underrated.INFJ-  Oral-aggressive.I think INFPINFJ-  I got VOE-M.  The description sounds really accurate.Context is everything.  How do you apply your rationality and emotionality?Every test says I'm an ENTP.  WtfI like my coffee hot and black, but I will drink it cold.  Lukewarm is disgusting though.I get very outgoing and whatever I'm feeling seems to gush out like a firehose.  If I'm angry, I'll fight.  If I'm happy, I'll be hugging on everyone and dancing.  If someone asks my opinion on something, I'll be the idiot yelling and gesticulating passionately about something that doesn't really matter.  Letting loose and seeing just how far I can go is almost too much fun. ISTP-&gt; AccurateI've been starting to think I'm a mistyped INFJ, which could easily be the case because I'm a 21 year old male computer programmer.  How can I be sure this is/isn't the case?  I understand the function model very well, but while other people type me ISTP/INTP, I rereading some of the stuff I've wrote/posted, I think my Fe is pretty strong, and I think it may be my 2nd function.
Me: ISTP
Mom: ENFJ (Pretty sure)
Dad: ISTJ
Younger sister: INTJ
Younger Brother: EXFP (He's only seven but I think more S than N)Writing mostly, but also playing sports.
