Where can I find it? 

Thanks for your answers.Do you know a good place to learn more about the cognitive functions? 

Thanks for answering :)
I've been told more than a few times I am a very blunt person. Something I'm trying to work on but tip toeing round issues so other people dont get upset is a giant pain in the ass to me. Rules are there to keep the idiots in line.

I feel as though if youre smart enough to see that then youre smart enough to know when the rules can be broken. but I like small talk :(unfortunately?&gt; ESTPs

no you

seriously though its mostly because I cant be bothered to write out massive replies. whichever one can follow through with long projects like coursework and long winded, slow burning things. It's been my Achilles heel as long as I can remember.I only think enough to get the answer. After that I dont see what else there is to think about?I dont get what I'm doing wrong by being here lol. Feels like I missed a memo everyone else got.&gt; Exploring the world's most dangerous ecosystems. But on a bus with old folks.

whew calm down satan.cool. I dont think Ive ever had visuals to go along with my thoughts. so im an engineer by trade and I can visualise parts I design really well but running through scenarios visually in my head has never happened. I guess yeah my thoughts are just words, I dont really visualise them unless Im deliberately imagining stuff. god are we really this easy to stereotype. literally every estp thing I read on here is stuff I've done, am doing or will be doing in the future. yeah fps are like crack to me. love it when I kill someone online as that means i'm better than they are. 

I will say that gta 5 is the only story mode I've completed in the last 10 years though.nice try OP, but na.I've only done the test once and got estp which describes me to a T. This is targeted at all the asshats who cant answer the questions right and want to see themselves as dark and moody but after a little bit of reading they realise theyre the complete opposite. Watched Ferris Buellers Day Off yesterday and this movie is basically a day in the life of an ESTP. 

How about you?jesus dude leave some pussy for the rest of us.being estp is more than partying. from what you described here he's not really using Se that much. I dont think he's estp.im not good enough to make that call.yeah I can relate.truth üòépopcorn tastes good.oh lol i thought this was only me. i just do some of it anyway. its only illegal if you get caught.it is. 

source: my life.üòÇfucking hell I want to spend a minute in your mind to see how you came to that conclusion.I was sure I could only handle a minute.üòé

but unironically.nice, ive never seen 'how ESTPs feel' put so well.god the people on this sub are so lame.2enlightened4mefucking hell üòÇ

even got the looks down to a t.notice how the extrovert is happier üòèI really enjoy a good aesthetic. Can be clothes, architecture, a picture. Anything that just looks 'right' is very satisfying to me.

but yes, usually I can tell what people are like based on how they dress.I shit you not I fall asleep way easier when Im a passenger in a car or on a train or plane or something.its funny though becasue some people cant fall asleep on those things. I cant for the life of me see how they manage to stay awake.

I think its my shitty superpower. makes vehicle journeys go mega fast and you end up more refreshed at the end.Freedom means everything to me. Im trying to reach FIRE at some point in the future (before proper retirement age obviously...)I aint reading all that \*skims to estp* 

&gt; NUMBER 8:: ESTP - I know that not a single ESTP made it this far in this post and jesus fuck, that's depressing.

aw you sonovabitch üòÇshe is 100% ENFP. I lived with one and she said she loves getting into heated arguments just for fun ü§®infp/entpexplore would be better than create imo.estp, timid but brave. u wot?&gt;but now I feel much wiser and I am leaving this sub.

too bad you're not wise enough to realise it wasnt this subs fault all along üôÑlol xNTP always going off somewhere youre not quite sure.looool\&gt;saying sorry to the them

but yeah ive learnt that most people just want sympathy so I give it despite it being completely hollow and insincere. I also dont give a shit about helping them about their lives either unless they ask specifically for advice.\&gt;implying infj girls dont just sit inside watching netflix all day.no way, if someone suggested we go to every mcdonalds in the uk i'd laugh them out the room. what a waste of time (IMO)....fuck you're right.drop him, i've known a couple ENFPs now and theyre 'fun' (in a kind of shit way) for about 5 minutes before you realise thats their only setting. Also they cant stand to not be the centre of attention.never heard of a satyr before but its surprisingly on point, even down to the permanent erection.babyna, we know exactly the reaction its gonna get, we just do it anyway, for the lols.it might be a poor use, but its not unskilled use.ok, just letting you know.whoever put ESTP there has no idea what theyre talking about.that comfy SP aesthetic üëåyup, its nice down there. having a beer in a sheltered courtyard on a warm summer evening, bliss.you have no idea about ESTPs. youve been wrong twice now.
The two on the survey are nothing too complicated, they're only talking about what you look for in a romantic partner and your hobbies and interests.I'm not sure what the worst is. I do a lot of bad things. I used to bully people a lot when I was in school. I have a lot of stories from doing that.  
The most morally wrong thing in recent memory at least was I had a friend I liked, but I was getting bored of her and took advantage of her. She was the easiest sort of person to use, I think she was INFJ and really thought with her feelings. She was extremely generous and saw me as one of her closest friends, I spoke to her a while longer to get more out of her, got help paying for a laptop then stopped speaking to her. I think I made her permanently a lot more suspicious of people and a lot less generous of a person and I hear she's doing really bad since then.  
I think I've been a bit emotionally abusive to my girlfriend before but I think I mostly treat her pretty well, trying my hardest to be good to her now at least since I'm self-aware and it's rare I'm bad now. I cheated on her once too, since there was a boy who was really beneficial to me and I strung along for a bit for that reason. She also cheated on me once, but was horribly guilty and it was a one time thing and I forgave her, so not really nearly as bad or any justification for me doing that. Never told her since I want to be faithful now and she couldn't handle that, especially since boys gross her out so much.  
One time I got mad at my brother when I was a bit younger and tried to beat him up or choke him a bit, but it didn't work out since I'm a 5'5" girl and he's 5 years older than me and way bigger, so he basically just grabbed my arm and stopped me. Lol, I am diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, why do you think sociopaths are suffering? No one with ASPD would care about a study like this or that we're looked down upon either really, it's not like it's something anyone will ever know or figure out unless you tell them (and there's no reason to ever tell people that).  
I'm not very surprised by the survey, I think it's interesting and I participated.
Then they're probably either an INFP or ISFJ? AMIRITE? AMIRITE?I don't know. I just find that I can't really tell the difference between INFJ and ISFJ. At least without knowing them VERY well. Plus, both of those types are not necessarily the most 'objective'. INFP or ENFP if I *had* to choose one. Yeah. I found it fascinating for a while too.

I definitely do have an 'internal monologue' going if I'm not *doing* anything. If I'm listening to music, I would say that most of the time I'm listening to music and that's it. Sometimes whatever I'm feeling leads to thoughts about something else. 

While writing a test it's usually just remembering what I learned and using that somehow. There's not much thought there. If I don't know how to do something I don't know how. I know that I don't know quite easily. A lot of the times, in the case of written exams, if you have the fundamental knowledge you can figure out from that.

I don't know. I always assumed people felt the same way as me but then I had a conversation with an INTP friend who shared your fascination. They were so interested that I didn't have an 'internal monologue'. 

Se-Ti feels like I know what I know, and I know what I don't know. It feels like a machine that, although almost certainly faulty, takes input and applies output in the most simple way possible.  I think this is an S vs N thing though. Maybe it's a Ti thing? I don't know. Your fascination has spawned confusion for me. 

Input (Se) =&gt; Judging According to set of personal logical 'beliefs' (Ti) =&gt; What is the output in the form of? Behavior? 

S tends to be more from point A to B, where N is a lot more free in a sense. At least that's what people say. 

&gt;God, I understand that it is just the normal thinking process for you, so you are likely very confused about why I am having a mink freak-out, but this completely changes my perception of some people I know. I need to think this through!!! haha

No, I getcha! I really am interested to hear how you see the world. It just kind of feels like the ENFP I know talks past me. I can really only speak from experience with the one I know. INFPs are similar. I definitely see where the 'ego-centric' stereotype comes from. 

All small talk is forced, but with ENFP/INFP it feels especially so.


On top of that huge generalization, I feel like ENFP/INFP are the types most likely to get offended or be uncomfortable with the joking around that good small-talk entails. 


[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/404z9k/infjs_covert_narcissists/) is another post in /r/infj talking about the same thing.

Of course there's a lot of defense of the INFJ in the INFJ subreddit. That's no surprise. 

It seems that the traditional narcissist knows that they may be narcissistic. How about the covert narcissist? Is it possible that a good majority of INFJs(in particular) display these narcissistic traits but believe they are completely and thoroughly altruistic? 

I want to read even tangential thoughts to this. 

Are INFJs a more likely candidate to be a covert narcissist? 

&gt;Covert narcissism is anything but INxJ's.

Why?

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

From [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/communication-success/201601/7-signs-covert-introvert-narcissist) it appears that the typical INFJ is one 'checkmark' away from having all 7 signs. The one I am referring to is 
&gt;3. Lack of Empathy .

How does one prove they have empathy?

I just don't like generalizing in cases like this in which it seems so subjective. I have a vague grasp of what I think.

When does small talk become normal talk? Is it when we discuss interests? Is it when we emotionally become vulnerable? 

Small talk ceases being small (to me) once we get past talking about me being in school, or my job, or the weather. :(Why is that?Thank you for the response! I appreciate it.

&gt;Fi tends to be imo a much deeper and richer inner world with several layers and dimensions. Because fi is internal, the 'truth' is found internally as well. Often instead of sampling the external, they can end up trapped unknowingly in the reality they created. This includes holding false ideas with little objection thus giving birth to some issues down the road unintentionally.

Do you think Ti can fall into the same traps? It is subjective like Fi./u/Kbnation has reached Lvl 99 Small Talk.

I would tend to agree. Although I think I look more like a kid with ADHD in some situations. 

Do you find yourself being all over the place if you're talking to someone who is just giving you anything? I think that only addresses one aspect of narcissism though. 

&gt;They tend to be affronted by any signs of real or perceived slights, and handle criticism poorly. In the face of negative feedback, some introvert narcissists will defend with an increased sense of superior smugness and dismissal (fight), while others will respond with sullen withdraw (flight).

This is how 'highly sensitive' is described in [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/communication-success/201601/7-signs-covert-introvert-narcissist) link. 

Please note that I have an even smaller experience with INFJs in real life, but a lot of the traits that seem to be typical in an INFJ seem to align with covert narcissism-- which I found interesting. I had only thought about this, because the INFJ I know is quite narcissistic.

&gt;Maybe if you're describing a baby INFJ.

This is a comment from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/404z9k/infjs_covert_narcissists/cys6aw5) thread. 

I didn't read it all but as I skimmed it seemed that the possibility that an INFJ had a higher likelihood didn't seem to even have a chance. This in itself is quite odd.

I'm not declaring one way or another, I just think it might be something to think about. 

On the flip side, I can easily, and unabashedly say that thought patterns that ESTPs tend to have can lead to narcissistic tendencies. My experience with myself, and what I understand to be the scope of MBTI, and the ESTP type, leads me to believe that there is at least *some* overlap.

Back to my experience with the INFJ I know, they seem very selfish. They fit almost all the 'check marks' at least from that link. 

How do I know they have empathy? It doesn't seem like it. If they have empathy but the rest of the symptoms, are they then a narcissist? I don't know.

I think the 'save the world', 'special snowflake', grandiose seems very narcissistic. Having a skewed view on your importance in the world seems to be a core thing for narcissism. 

Ni-Fe has a hard time, I think being narcissistic, but what about Ni-Ti? 

Also, I really don't know what I think. I'm just throwing out ideas to be shot down by the **amazing people of this subreddit**. That goes to my question of, when does small talk become not small talk? Where's the line, in your opinion?&gt;I think these 7 signs are unhealthy behaviors of any person, regardless of mbti type. 

I agree. There is a fine line between saying, "All INFJs are narcissists" and "All narcissists are INFJs". I'm not even meaning to say the latter, however. 

I would like to explore the possiblity that INFJs display more (covert) narcissistic tendencies than any other type. Then I would like to explore the possibility that this increases risk of becoming a narcissist. So I guess my questions to you are: 

1. Is it possible to become a narcissist? Or are we born as narcissists?

2. Do covert narcissists and INFJs share a lot of the same tendencies? From where I'm standing, it appears so.

3. What does this (your answer to question 2) mean?

&gt;If you spot these behaviors in a person, you shouldn't think "wow must be a XXXX" and should instead think "that individual is displaying some narcissistic traits".

I don't. In my experience with one person I believe to be an INFJ, someone else pointed out to me that they sounded narcissistic as I was explaining interactions I had with the INFJ. I hadn't entertained the possibility before. As I looked, it seemed to me that the INFJ's personal traits were narcissistic, but they also shared a lot of these behaviors with the INFJ type in general. I know MBTI is not behaviorist, but it got me thinking.

Counterpoint: I know another INFJ(possibly ISFJ) that, at this point doesn't seem narcissistic. 

Does this mean I believe that all narcissists are either INFJ or ESTP? No. I am just curious what the meaning is that a lot of typical INFJ behaviors seem to outline covert narcissism.

Hmm. Thank you for presenting this idea of the Si-dom. Also, what does HSP mean?

&gt;Most people don't have any idea what an INJ is, so to stick with what people describe about them is to throw yourself into a pit of stupidity. None of those traits apply to me, and I'm 99.9% sure that they don't apply to any other INJs, but actually apply to those who think that they are INJs because they feel misunderstood or special, which is utter bullshit.

Same. I have no idea. 

Then, what about "Covert Narcissism and the ISFJ"? Does this hold more ground than INFJ?

A lot of my thoughts/curiosity is spawning from a narcissistic INFJ/ISFJ (who fucking knows) that I have interacted with. With my very limited understanding of Si vs Ni (even after countless threads and questions), it's possible that this person is ISFJ. Then that would lead to the same thread, and the same questions but wondering about the ISFJ.

To be honest, ISFJ and INFJ still look the same to me. The "misunderstood special person" aspect of narcissism seems to resonate in me more with an INFJ than the ISFJ, but really, it's still up in the air. 

&gt;But if somebody is walking around waving the "I'm an empath" flag then that person is most likely not one.

Funnily enough, this seems to be an INFJ thing. INFJs 'feel too deeply'. Thoughts? 

Also, I've been told that I come across angry in my writing. I'm not,  nor am I offended. I'm just curious. So, I'm sorry if I'm coming across excessively harsh.Funnily enough, as you posted this. Another poster in a branch of this comment tree also brought the idea that covert narcissism could also be an Si thing.

&gt;I really do not think that feeling like a special snowflake or thinking the world revolves around them is an Ni fixation at all.

This is just my ISFJ vs INFJ shit all over again. 

Do you believe this to be a more Si fixation then?

So then ISFJs are more likely to be covert narcissists? 

&gt;If you think about what Si is, Ni is the opposite; 

This is the difficulty I'm having, hah. 

I guess take all my thoughts, and all the articles thoughts, and move them towards the ISFJ.

What if most INFJs are actually ISFJs? I would be curious to know where that 1% statistic came from, to be honest. It fascinates me that it seems that a lot of INFJs are probably actually ISFJs. 

Si-Ti is more narcissistic than Ni-Ti, I guess, is what people seem to be saying.Good point. I'll stop reading about the INFJ from the self-perceptions of INFJs-that-are-actually-ISFJ then. 

I just don't get it /u/ThisWontDo :( .  &gt;Didn't mean to shoot you down. Pretty sure and had a professional psychologist work with mbti/ agree, I'm under INFJ. So maybe I can help.

I honestly love harsh criticism. It puts the ball in my court, so to speak. 

&gt;Actually encountered two INFJs who fell into this weird overlap. Here is again, my two cents. I like to think (you probably do too) as mbti, like a frame but the picture itself is unique to the individual. So though a lot of behaviors, thought patterns tend to be consistent the colours/textures differ. They especially differ if the individuals have a mental disturbance.

**Very well said. Thank you for this analogy.**

&gt;(my friends say I'm being a shithead, so I'll stop)

Huh? What are you talking about?

&gt;Fe is not always this harmonizing thing.

Exactly right!

And no, you make sense. Thank you for sharing those experiences! I speak and understand in experiences. I don't extrapolate them to everything, but I definitely hold a lot more weight in them than others seem to.

Thanks for sharing! I appreciate more input being added!

I think we're all broken machines to some extent. Some more than others. 
&gt;People's opinions are hard to change. 

I don't know if I agree with that. I am certainly looking for validation, or for someone to provide an alternative to my beliefs on this. I'm looking for my opinion to be changed. 

I've already been validated on the belief that this person I know has narcissistic tendencies. They are ISFJ or INFJ. This is where this curiosity of this idea spawned. I'm looking to see if there is correlation. Then I'm looking to investigate that further to see if there is a dependence. Correlation between these two things would be interesting in itself. 

It's a little hard when we say MBTI can't do certain things because it would be uncomfortable. Take it to the limit and see if it stands for itself.

&gt;This makes me think you're more looking for details that would prove or disprove causation, which can be dangerous territory. I'm trying to suggest that what you're observing may purely be association, and your sample size might be biased.

It is biased, I haven't tried to hide that. MBTI would never be the cause. MBTI would always be the effect. This is an important thing to note. 

"Would narcissists be more likely to type as INFJs?"

is the next logical step then.

Or at this point, after reading some of the comments in the thread:

"Would narcissists be more likely to type as ISFJs?"What is empathy?

Is a narcissist someone who does not have empathy? Or someone who chooses to not use it?

I'm not attempting to paint a whole sub group of personality as narcissists. However, what I see is a group that seems to be 'at risk'. 

As someone has brought up, Si-Ti is a lot more narcissistic and 'at risk' than Ni-Ti. Thoughts on this?

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your thoughts! You've given me something to think about.
They are the only person I know is typed correctly besides myself. 

&gt;Then take out the Te stuff and put Fe there. 

B-b--but... how?

&gt;Got it, I misinterpreted your meaning in that case, as did many other people in this thread I think based on your original posts which is why people may be getting offended that the covert narcissist label is being associated with INFJs, ISFJs, INFPs, etc.

Oh god, people are onto me. 

I mean, **INFJs are LITERALLY Hitler**.

&gt;I think it's an interesting question to ask theoretically, but the presence of bias basically invalidates any conclusions you can draw. And since every person on this thread has biases of his or her own based on their own sample sizes, all the evidence that you would receive validating or refuting your argument would need to be taken with a grain of salt. It's like if you were trying to do a Cochrane meta-analysis of a research question, and all of your studies are poor and biased. The meta-analysis wouldn't tell you very much.

Good point. However, we all know the real reason for this. The sweet sweet karma. &gt;Anyways OP

Hey that's me!
&gt;I mean, I have a whole lot of criticisms about INFJs that I would be happy to share.

**[Official] INFJ Bashing Comment Chain**

***What then is deeper? Can you tell me how they are different?

I really, really, really don't know the difference.

ENFP/INFP from my limited understanding.

I guess I could see an ESTP doing it too more out of a selfish desire to prove myself. ISTPs too then, I guess would have the same possibility.

Like you said though, it's really hard to pin behaviors to types. 
I usually have earphones in. So many times people think its a matter of avoiding people. It's not. I *really* like my music.  I like small talk since it charges me up for a low emotional investment.

Why is small talk uncomfortable for you? Does it feel fake? What else does it feel like? 

&gt;He will be insulted if his romantic interest gives him his title without question, and bored if the fight is too easily won. He, like the Pseudo-Aggressor and the Challenger, is questing to find his equal. Someone he can play his almost sadistic games with without "breaking."

Damn. Us ESTPs are cool af.

I'll never live up to the badassery of the ESTP.I can see ISFJ which has been suggested. Could you state your case for ISFP or INTJ?

I think a lot of the issue is that I only know internet INFJs and ISFJs. I have a very confused view of IXXJs in general. They make no sense. ;)Or potatoes. Very cute, cuddly, awkward potatoes.Thoughts?

Didn't you hear? We're pinning it on ISFJs actually.
Yes.

I think this is how we should type people from now on TBH. It's so much easier to get people into their quadrant than it is to find a specific order of the functions since it can vary so wildly between people.

After the quadrant is determined, E vs I is a pretty obvious thing for even the least self-aware people. Then that would leave two 'opposite' types. I.e. INFJ vs ISTP. (If you had determined you were Beta quadrant). Between those two, it's likely very easy to pick one.ISFPs see beauty in everything..? Is that a stereotype?
&gt;Ti/Fe wants to feel correctly and think independently.

&gt;Te/Fi wants to think correctly and feel independently.

-/u/BlueOtterSocks


A similar, concise statement for Se/Ni vs Ne/Si would be helpful as well. Any ideas?We have a lot of INTPs. They can do it for us. ;) Pretty sure those are both 100% true 100% of the time.

Except for:

&gt;They also love ~~sports~~ everything, its usually the only thing they are good at.
This stereotype comes from the small scope of MBTI. 

What I mean, is that when considered, we often try to isolate each function or 'letter' and understand what that does, and then put it back together. Why are we assuming linearity for the human mind?

We can consider the functions isolated as that to try and get a clearer picture, but in an actual human being Se works in conjunction with Ni. It may not be preferred, it might be repressed completely-- but there's always some aspect of Ni present.

It works the same way for N-types. An INFJ has Ni-Se, they might heavily prefer Ni, but Se is still a 'part' of them.

The stereotype exists because it is somewhat true. I think the problem is that we assume that the 'lofty' are more valuable-- which is arrogant in itself. We assume that the big, grandiose, and abstract are more valuable but I think that's bullshit. The concrete, real, "small" are just as valuable, and when we lose sight of that that's when we fail. 

Assuming that someone doesn't have depth because they aren't as comfortable with abstract, intuitive is not a fair conclusion to make. 

&gt;They don't ponder random things (in theory) and they can only process what's right in front of them. Not trying to push the stereotype but as an Ne Dom, when I talk to a sensor, I feel like they're missing something.

Why do all intuitives have their heads up their asses. They think about irrelevant things and can't see what's right in front of them. Not trying to push the stereotype but as an Se Dom, when I talk to an intuit, I feel like they're missing something, I can tell that they are maybe a little lost with my indepth communication style.

Yes, it's the same for both sides.



I think this is probably the best answer. 

Just as sensors aren't fully comfortable using their N function, Intuitives are the same way about their sensing function. 

I think what makes this stereotype harmful is that it assumes value. What makes 'bigger' better? Or what makes abstract better? 
Do you know any ISFJs? How do you differ from them?Thanks for replying!

One thing:

5-6 other INFJs? And none of them are undercover ISFJs? ;)

For sure. 

The Ti in the 3rd slot is pretty brutal. I can see Ni-Ti being a bitch, but others have brought up the idea about Si-Ti which seems evem more trapping than Ni-Ti. 
Is that the rule though?

I was reading an article on a study that found that narcissists tended to recognize the narcissistic traits within themselves. I mean, 'regular' ESTP narcisssists (hah).  

Where's the border, is my question? How does a psychiatrist clinically diagnose someone besides looking at what they do/say?

I suppose brain scans may start to become more common, but at the moment, (correct me if I'm wrong) aren't many psychological personality disorders not evident in these?See this is where it seems to get muddled. 

Having empathy, and choosing to empathize are different things. Hell, even in MBTI we assume that there's a *preference* made in T over F, or F over T. 

If someone, semi-consciously makes a choice to not empathize, why would this not become a pattern? 

I guess, what my question is, is:

Are narcissists born narcissistic? If not, how are they made narcissistic besides the choices of themselves and the people around them in childhood?
  &gt;MBTI is about normal diverse patterns of information processing.

I agree.

&gt;Personality Disorder: a deeply ingrained and maladaptive pattern of behavior of a specified kind, typically manifest by the time one reaches adolescence and causing long-term difficulties in personal relationships or in functioning in society.

With that, I hope it's clear that I agree that INFJs aren't narcissists because being an INFJ presupposes a normality about the subject whereas NPD is strictly abnormal.

A child who develops Si will naturally either find a preference for an auxiliary function Te or Fe. This is Jung's whole deal. Under some trauma/stress, let's say they develop a preference for another introverted function Ti. Whether their MBTI is ingrained, or just a natural preference in the psyche, this person will now have covert narcissistic tendencies.

Say they never had a chance to effectively 'learn' Te or Fe but rather found themselves preferring Ti. Their stack is Si-Ti-Xx-Xx.

Can we say this person is a narcissist? Or is narcissism outside of the scope that the Jungian symbols provide (Ti, Te, Si, Se, etc)?

So I realize that I now agree that an ISFJ =/= narcissist, could they not become one if they *somehow* began to prefer Ti &gt; Fe? I don't think preferences in MBTI are likely to change, but I think it's possible. 

Agree? Disagree? Thoughts? Sorry about the rambling. 

Well said! This helps me understand inferior Se vs inferior Ne better.&gt;The IxxJ temperament is very distinct IMO and being Pi-dom does have this very strange quality to it.

I'll say.

EJ, EP, IP, IJ.. What is this categorization of the types called?Thanks for sharing despite the potential risk. I didn't mean to be inflammatory, well not completely. 

&gt;(Great, speaking about how something bothers me, combined with my flair, is going to label me a covert narcissist.)

Of course not. Sometimes riling people up is a good way to get responses and good discussion going.

&gt;Also worthy of note - the INFJ subreddit has a seemingly-high overlap with the RBN subreddit.

That is actually SUPER SUPER fascinating. I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4m1eit/covert_narcissism_and_the_infj/d3t9yjw) that I would like you to let me know your thoughts on. 

I am interested in understanding the relation of MBTI to EVERYTHING with personality not just what seems to connect at the moment. I want to try to put the MBTI key into the hole and try and turn it in every door. I think that's pretty typical ESTP--- but I think it's also valuable to not just reject ideas because they are unconventional(also typical ESTP/INFJ).

Important thing to note again here, is that I realize that MBTI necessarily excludes personality disorders-- as of 10 minutes ago. I had known that before, but now I can 'apply' it to my understanding of myself/MBTI/viewoftheworld/etc.=( Yeah. It's a fascinating categorization to make.

I can easily perceive a "kinship" or "understanding" between myself and ENTP, ESFP, and ENFP but it's extremely hard to describe. 



Can we do all the types as animals?I'm really an INFJ at heart though. 

Aren't we all? Isn't that the true meaning of MBTI? &lt;3A lot more formally, and business-like.&gt;Is there a good way for me to figure this out? How should I go about this?


Try this:

1. Read this post [here](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra) and determine what quadra you are in. 

2. Choose the two T preference types since you seem to be sure on that.

3. Now look at the last week, are you an introvert or extrovert? Was it a normal week?

Boom. Done.

Edit: If you consider what you want to be, how you tend to be in groups you'll be able to figure out your quadra pretty quickly and decisively. The group behavior tends to be really helpful.  The reason I think that this method will work better than going function-by-function is that it looks at the personality as a whole rather than attempting to separate the inseparable(the functions).

Edit2: Also, on that first link, there were links to [this](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/117-Quadra-Progression-by-Gilly) and [this](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/115-Quadra-Progression-by-dolphin). These are a little bit more concise if you have a clear idea of who you are. They are the Quadra Progression, the first is by Gilly, the second by dolphin.#\#freethenippleWho's that?ESTP or ISTP?Damn I love drama.Are you 100% on the INTJ thing?

&gt;I was psychologically and emotionally abused by the psychologist there, who did nothing to fix my problem

I'm sorry that happened to you. =(.

Are you new here too? Or were you around for this drama from before?

I think it's fun. Are you bubbly?Hi! Thanks for the post! I read it all, and TBH I've never been good at this stuff. 

Can you try something for me? What I want to try and do is help you type yourself better. Self-identification is *always* better than someone telling you your type.

**Firstly**, go [here](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/117-Quadra-Progression-by-Gilly) and [here](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra). Take a quick read over some of the traits of the four quadrants. You should be able to identify, to some certainty what quadrant you're in. Note that socionics is based upon the same theory as MBTI. I personally think socionics has some issues with it, but the splitting up into four quadrants is something done right. Take a sec to find out your quadrant based upon some of the things you read. 

You can either have Se-Ni or Ne-Si *and* Ti-Fe or Te-Fi. This is in accordance with MBTI as well. It splits you into for groups.

For me, I read some of the blurbs in the second link, and I quickly identify Se/Ni within myself. I can quickly tell that Ne/Si or Si/Ne are not in my 'stack'(my preferred thinking). I continue to read and Fe-Ti resonates. There are descriptions under 'Alpha' and 'Beta' because they share that axis. I identify with both of them. Only Beta quadrant contains my other axis. I have Se-Ni and Ti-Fe. This places me in the beta quadrant.

**Next**, you can either feel free to post your quadrant here if you have some certainty, and people will likely be able to place you. You might also be able to look at the 4 types and immediately figure out.

For example, I can pick the Beta quadrant quite easily. This gives me ESTp, ISTj, ENFj, INFp. These are converted to MBTI (just due to a notation convention within socionics) to ESTP, ISTP, ENFJ, INFJ. Immediately. I can rule out the F-preference types. It's not that I don't feel. It's just not preferred. That leaves ESTP, ISTP. 

For me, I am hyper-extraverted. It's not hard for me to choose. For you it sounds like it might be. Note that this agrees with modern psychologies view on extroversion/introversion. MBTI takes a continuum of potential extraversion and takes what may be a slight preference, and makes it binary.

Please give this process a shot. Feel free to keep asking questions. If determining your quadra is too difficult, let me know. I've known my type for a long while-- I would like to see if this is helpful or just confusing.

***

About the quadra: They are just the groups of four that share the same functions in different orders. The similarities between the quadra are the most fundamental in theory. Example: I have in my stack (as you can see on the side bar) Se-Ti-Fe-Ni. The other types in the 'Beta' quadrant will have these functions. However, there are certain set of rules Carl Jung put forth into the ordering of the stack in healthy people. They are the stack has to alternate between extraverted and introverted. As well, the stack has to either go J-P-P-J or P-J-J-P. J being a judging function (i.e. Fe, Fi, Te, Ti) and P being perceiving (Se, Si, Ne, Ni). You don't need a full understanding of the functions to use the quadrants to type yourself since we are using the differences between Fe-Ti and Fi-Te to do it. There's no point of taking all the functions individually in my opinion-- at least when typing.Are you 'fun'?So that leaves ENTJ, INTJ, ESFP, ISFP.

You seem sure on the F-preference and extraversion.

ESFP perhaps?&gt;*This is not a drama thread*.

Okay.&gt;Do you often feel necessity or addiction to music, just to chill out or go on a feel trip?

I assume this is the post you're responding too..

Follow up question:

What genre do you find yourself listening to most frequently?Honestly, there is no right answer to this. 

The 'best' answer would be whatever type can 'mirror' the best. The type that can give you what you want to see in someone. I feel like this won't typically be extroverts since I feel like we are much more easily defined on limited interaction.

So probably an introvert. 

IXXP types are a lot more caricatured than IXXJ, usually. What I mean is that IXXP types are weird, and thus less generally attractive to everyone. IXXPs are less mysterious, and thus less open to interpretation.

INFJs are typicaly known for 'personality mirrior'-- or at least that's what the internet would have me believe.

INFJ: Ni-Fe-Ti-Se
INTJ: Ni-Te-Fi-Se
ISFJ: Si-Fe-Ti-Ne
ISTJ: Si-Te-Fi-Ne

INTJs tend to be a certain way which I think has less general appeal.  I like them, but if I was trying to guess for a whole bunch of people probably less likely. I think it has to do with Te being much more of a turn-off if not balanced with Fi.

Also, being a man or a woman changes what's generally attractive. I think the F types are more likely to be attractive for women, and the T types for men.

For a man: ISTJ/INTJ
For a woman: ISFJ/INFJ

If we assume that sensors are in much higher numbers, and that people like like-minded people we can then say ISTJ and ISFJ. However, I think there is a lot of allure to someone so different form yourself. Then it would be INTJ and INFJ.

Of course this is just for fun because it's *kind of* an unreasonable question. 

Thoughts?

***

And for me personally, I don't know even. I think that it takes a lot of observation to accurately determine an IXXJ type. I definitely can say that I'm attracted to introverted people over extroverted people in general. Plus Te is a real turn off for me. Ti-Fe is preferred heavily over Te/Fi.If we're talking about attraction in a non-romantic way, sure.That's how I feel I guess. It's hard to compare, obviously, but that's how I would say I see the world-- I don't know any other way..? 

Ni. Ni is hot. It seems sucky to have, like absolutely restricting. I'm glad it's at the bottom of my stack but it's very attractive for others to have. 

Also, I don't know, I sort of feel like I'm wandering aimlessly through life. I feel like Ni/Si connect very much to 'meaning' (or perhaps(Ne/Ni??). So I think that's why I feel kind of purposeless. Life is a distraction from the inevitability of death.

Someone has also used the word 'personal harmony' and I can definitely attest to having very little of that. I kind of want it, but I mean, I don't know. 

So I don't really like Ni. I'm curious about it though.

***

Se probably wins still then. Since it's great. Se-Ti or Ti-Se are the best, that's probably biased.

I agree! Well said.Thanks! This is very helpful. It doesn't remove the mystery but I can understand Ni within myself a lot better.

I think the difficulty comes when I'm supposed to believe that a person using N as a dominant function. This seems absolutely absurd. I do not understand how someone could function like that. I suppose it's because I only have my own intuition as a benchmark to compare to which is.. lacking.


I like how you manage to bring the Ni into it. I think it may be easier to separate F from T than it is to separate the already nebulous perceiving functions. 

You managed to describe Se and it's relation to Ni. I find it interesting to consider how Se cannot be without Ni, but how they remain *preferences*. 

&gt;Idk I always think Ni perception is like play between the mirages that you perceive exist and brief moment of touchdown with real Se signs, where you validate that 'no, you're not totally delusional'.

Can you explain what you mean by this?That first paragraph sounds terrifying! I couldn't imagine such a 'reality'. 

Any Ni dom want to input on this? /u/thiswontdo?


Hi! Thanks for the reply. I don't know if you saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mtguu/what_is_intuition/d3yaklb?context=3) post but it amazes me. 

Reading some of these descriptions make me feel like I'm missing out on the wonderful world of intuition. In light of this, I find myself that I enjoy Ni humour as you describe it the most.

I actually don't care for Se humour.I would tend to agree with you. I can make anything work, except a relationship with an INFP. They just.... Really.... Frustrate... Me...I don't know.  All the functions are different and they are just in the worst order. 

Generalizing wouldn't do it justice. I can imagine a well-developed, mature INFP would only be of no interest. Unfortunately, Fi-Ne is aggravating. Those are my 7th and 8th functions and I can feel it. 

***

**Anti-INFP Rant Ahead**

It's so hard to explain aside from Fi makes me angry, and Ne is the worst out of the four perceiving. If you have any specific inquiries, I can answer out of my own experience. I know at least 2 INFPs and they both think they are INFJs after a quick skim over MBTI and the dichotomies. Fi seems to be self-righteous and close-minded ironically. Where I like to challenge myself and all that I believe in daily-- as stress-inducing as it is, Fi seems to be concerned with self. It seems to be concerned with self in such a close minded way, and ignorant of what is *really* happening. Ne with an Fi is just pure speculation, speculation that suits selfish desires. Fi-Si is perhaps the most subjective (in the worst way possible) out of any functions. 

Te low in the stack is rigid. Since it's unrefined it seems that I have to follow the rules or I'm oppressing the INFP. 16 year old INFPs are the SJWs that reddit seems to be filled with. I admire the passion behind it, but the problem is when you refuse to account for nuance of a situation because you're bad at thinking and sensing. What ends up happening is a narrative ends up being created, and no matter what the situation the INFP will attempt to fit everything neatly into that narrative (Te). This last sentence *has* happened to me, I *am* typing out of a place of anger, sue me. Funnily enough, it was actually an ENFP and INFP that did this to my disadvantage. At least with the ENFP, they seem to be able to admit they are wrong-- although this specific ENFP is older and 'wiser'.

I would love to have a more nuanced view of the INFP and Fi. Please change my view.

***



You'd think I hate the 2 INFPs I know, but they are my closest friends sort of. I just, can't even sometimes.

It's just a completely different understanding. I need a buffer person, like an INFJ or INTJ.

I am amazed and frustrated by the INFPs thinking they are INFJs too. To me, it's very clear. To me, one will enrage me and the other will confuse me. INFJs, in my experience, are *very* similar to ESTPs. Well, duh, same functions, but it's clear! And it's great! INFJs are willing to often go the extra mile like ESTPs. Rules are simply a 'recommendation'. They will take it to the limit like ESTPs, or at least go to the limit with ESTPs. INFPs seem to be the type that imposes the limits on ideas. 

Of course, this degenerated into a rant. I guess to anyone who reads this: **please change my views.**Hey thanks for showing me this guy!

The Pierce Presents series is actually the most helpful thing out there.Yes. 

I think the type that has the most stereotypes which makes it the most undefined, the INFJ, has a lot of those stereotypes due to ISFJ and INFP mistypes.

There are a lot of traits that these three types tend to share, so it's understandable that they would be mistyped. However, I think there is such a large number of them that a lot of the stereotypes of INFJ are ISFJ/INFP tendencies.

Hell, I think the 'doorslam', which is perhaps the most popular INFJ thing is, at the very least is shared with INFP and ISFJ. 

***

Playing off what you said, if you google 'ENTP-INFJ' you'll find countless threads of ENTP men trying to seduce INFJ women, this is still a mirage relationship in socionics, which has some appeal-- but I would wager that a high portion of ENTP-INFJ relationships are ENTP-ISFJ(which is duality).

Also, keep in mind that it's safe to assume mistyping in any type. That being said, IXXJ types seem to be a lot more mistyped-- or at least introverts. So when you switch INTJ to ISTJ I can agree that there's a non-negligible amount of ENFP-ISTJ relationships, but ENFP and ESFP are also fairly difficult to confuse since Ne loooks SOOOO different than Se. It probably still happens, but much less than INFPs as INFJs.I'm sorry :(. 

I don't mean to cause hurt but it's sort of inevitable if I was going to be honest about my experiences with INFPs.

I think you're probably right-- I was putting it all on INFPs when it's very possibly and likely other types like ENFPs and ESFPs. 

As for the second point, Fi clashes with my childish Fe. Specifically, I feel limited and restricted in an abstract way by INFPs, and less so by ENFPs.

Make a thread like, "/r/mbti What do you hate about INFPS?" Sure people will attribute things that are personal to types, but this could be a series. The next one could be "/r/mbti What do you hate about ESTPs"? Or maybe a title, "I'm an INFP, roast me!"-- I think this would make it more generally enjoyable as people would attempt to inject humour. I can't really do it though because people know I'm an ESTP. I could post the ESTP one.&gt;My partner proposed that a majority of ENFPs trying to woo INTJs are actually ESFJs (they very often mistype as ENFPs)

Really, hmm. Can you explain that? My mother is an ESFJ, and I have a few friends who I suspect to be ESFJ. However, I don't feel knowledgeable enough about the type and the functions and how they work together.

The semi-duality as with INTJ-ESTP is hot. There's something *very* alluring about someone who has your inferior function as their dominant. It's there for INFJs too, but honestly, I think the clashing otherwise between INTJ and ESTP gives it a very different feel than the duality relation. No preference. I find myself able to get my tone into text fairly well. I tend to add punctuation, which may not always be syntactically or grammatically correct, always retains my tone. It seems that the majority of people I know hate text conversations, however.

I was always under the impression that phone conversations didn't happen. Do people call people still? Maybe no one's calling me. I feel like I'm at the beginning of the no-phone generation ('94). I know I'm at the last year of what's considered to be Gen Y. I know that for Gen Z phone calls are less common though.  Goddamn. What am I supposed to say to that? Your own self awareness makes me love INFPs. It's awesome.

I don't hate INFPs because that's unfair to hate a type of person but I definitely believe there is a large communication barrier between ESTPs and INFPs. I don't think this exists because of MBTI but rather, MBTI explains it.

To me, ENFPs and INFPs alike seem to miss what's really important. There's a vision, and an ability to make everything about that vision but I feel like it would have a tendency to miss what's right in front of you. 

I don't know. 

The description of Ni sounds like what it felt like on LSD. :]I think even the auxiliary function is pretty resilient to being fatigued as well. I think it's because we necessarily need a JP pair. 

If that's true, then Ti would be inf. or tert. Leaving:

INFJ/ISFJ (Tert Ti), ENFJ/ESFJ(inf Ti).

@OP, I've come out of a time in which I was wrapped up in my Fe, which often would spiral down into the control of Fe-Ni. Exhausting year for sure. That experience has helped me realize that I *do indeed* need to allow my Se to carry me. It's very possible that you are indeed an INTP, but your weak Ni is doing a number on you. Getting into the hold of Ni is like thought loops but without being drug induced.Only did it once, and it was alone. 

That was some hell to be honest. Glad I did it, but I've been in the Ni grip before, but on the drug it was impossible to distract myself. 

I wouldn't have said it was a bad trip because I definitely feel like I learned at least a little bit about myself.  Not planning on doing it again though, forced me to think about stuff at least.

I'm interested in the K-hole though. I don't know if I'll eventually get to that. 

Pretty done with recreational drugs already. Nootropics is where it's at. Functionality is key. So legal stims tend to provide the buzz to do what I need to.

All that to say, Ni sucks. Fuck Ni grip. Ketamine. Dissociation is the name of the game lol. 

And honestly I don't know anything about anything I had assumed shrooms were about the same as LSD. Now I'm reading that apparently LSD is more intense. So no, out of my limited experience I haven't had a bad trip I don't think. 

If you read on ESTP in the grip it's actually funny how intense it is. Sometimes it's played down but it really really feels like the world is ended. There's a deep impending doom in the grip of Ni. I'm talking without drugs or anything. The world becomes distorted. There's no "body load" to Ni grip but just thinking back to the mental state provides a stark contrast to me at my best.

I've found that once Ni grabs you it's really hard to get out of it by yourself. 

I want to grow ephedra, apparently ephedrine is a pretty clean stim. 

Apparently shrooms are easy to grow? But I have no need for psychedelics to be honest. LSD had been on my bucket list for at least a third of my life and I saw an opportunity.That's so sad. =(&gt;Did you start experimenting with drugs while in your grip? That's when I partook.

Yeah actually haha. I much more enjoy the idea of nootropics though. 

Edit: And yeah, I was messaging with someone else on this forum, and INFJ who had mentioned that they were growing their own shrooms. Which I thought was sooooo cool. ESTPs and uppers go together like cookies and milk, or chocolate and peanut butter, salt and pepper, tom and jerry.
I mean, in general your thinking just completely changes. It feels completely orthogonal to what you normally are.

If you're just doing it for the visuals/bodyload it's a bad idea. There's so many better 'recreational' things. Hell, LSD isn't 'recreational' from what I've experienced/read. At one point I just lost myself, I think it was ego death. It was okay. 

Honestly, I generally enjoy my state of mind sober. I know I sound like a loser, but I like having awareness plus like small stat boosts with nootropics and mild stimulants.  Hell, if I wanted to feel the self-induced psychosis that LSD was again, I'll just not sleep. It's free XD. 

I'd be willing to bet that LSD is a lot more 'fun' with a group of people to keep you in touch with reality. You just your grip on whats real completely. I scoffed at that when I was researching prior to it, but it's really true. 

And yeah, Ni on overload would accurately depict the thought process. Very easy to lose yourself inside your mind. As an ESTP, I can't condone that =P.

I was actually quite fearful of triggering some latent schizophrenia. I have a relative who has it. As I was coming up, the first thing I noticed was a feeling resembling a feeling I used to get as a teenager-- a feeling in which the world begins to fade away. As a child/pre-teen I had it quite frequently and the come-up was so reminiscent of it. Derealization of a sort. Fi would do it because they think it's right. Subjective. It's selfish in a sense-- I don't mean this negatively, but I think by it's very nature it's required to be selfish.

Fe would do it because it's "objectively" right. By objectively, I don't necessarily mean it's a higher moral standard, just that it's right based upon the external values an environment has set.

Drawing from Te(which honestly amazes me), what's right is often externally set. What's smart(right/correct) is not a matter for opinion. Obviously, again, not a value judgment. 

Consider a person that only had Te/Fe. What would such a person be like? Even with introverted perception, what would they be?  I ask this because I think it's important to look at Fi/Fe within the context of Fi-Te and Fe-Ti since they are required to balance each other out. It's like if you have an equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, the variables are in relation to each other, I can't ask you "well what's x=?" It just makes no sense.  Sorry to bring math into it. 

To give it another shot at your question, I'm not actually sure. This is a very good question! I'm excited to read other's answers.

Your thought experiments are interesting. I like at least the suggestion of Fe being more willing to put others' needs first-- Fe being more sacrificial. Whether or not that's true is another thought.  How do you think this then draws to Ti vs Te?

I also don't think it would be "no big deal". I just think it would be an immediate, albeit irrational response. I think Fi would need backup from Te to motivate it? I'm not sure how Ti fits into this.

Sorry for the rambling.

&gt;Se - I'm bored. If you don't hurry up, I'm running in there. dies in a hilarious 1v5 while tunnel-visioned on one enemy

U fkin wot m8, I'm plat 3. Would be challenjour if it wasn't for all these scrubs!!Debating stuff in their head is ENTP/INTP material. They seem fairly extraverted so probably ENTP.

ESTP has a hard time finding a use for that kind of thinking constantly. It's necessarily about the concrete, so exploring and unpacking the Ti framework is only done if there is a concrete reason usually. Ni prompting it is unlikely. Fe can though, but that's not what I'm getting from this person.
Reads like ENTP.

Keep in mind it's hard to decipher fully if you're an I or E. So either ENTP or INTP.With that function order, ENFP

Considering all the functions. Tuink about it this way: their values are solely internal. This person is the most subjective, self-involved person. Logic is individualized, as is sentiment, they likely believe that nothing's right nor wrong on a moral basis not a logical one. 

What's confusing is Se/Ne. If you were to ignore Se, this person could be someone who functions roughly like a person. They would look like an extremely, unbearable ENFP most of the time-- that's the closest thing. Considering Se makes it confusing because Ne naturally opposes Se. So to prefer external perception like that is a little harder to explain. I don't have a strong enough grasp to even guess.

Anyone have any ideas what a dual Pe type would look like?It can't happen, but surely you can imagine a person that would have that? I can't because I'm an ESTP =P.Context: I believe I know this person's type already. However, best guesses from /r/mbti would be interesting to see. 

So /r/mbti, type them if you can.This person is an INTJ. I'm 95% sure on that. 

I'm very likely biased when I look at the text and pull out Te-Fi from it. 

I believe she is INTJ. Although I've recently been considering the possibility of ISTJ since I really *still* don't have a good grasp on Ni vs Si (just look at my post history lol). 

Pretty sure INTJ though. 

I just wanted to see what this text would appear as.Typing people over text is hard, typing people over quotes is even harder. I'm quite certain of INTJ. Some of the behavior with this person could be interpreted in many ways. However there are a few things that always stick out.

Their individualized sentiment bothers the hell out of me. It completely irritates me. It is compared to how I've experienced INFPs, but for INTJ Fi is 'childish'. This is quite aggravating. 

To me, after many interactions this person clearly has Te/Fi. The disconnect between me and this person is quite apparent on this level.

I feel like we actually hate each other a lot of the time. However, the draw that's there can only be described as the dom/inf duality.  I feel very much like this relationship characterizes semi-duality (in socionics) VERY VERY well. 

SJ's are Si right? As an Ne dom, how do your relations with Si doms tend to be like?

For me, I have very little natural draw towards Si/Ne types and Ne/Si types unless there is substantial connection with interests/values.Your reasons for being an INFJ are pretty irrelevant. 

INFJs think they are logical. I mean, I guess, sort of. Compared to T-preference types no. I mean, I think I'm a nice, enjoyable friendly person-- doesn't mean this is reality.

The other three can be ENFJ things as well. 

Do you want to be an INFJ? Because you'll find that everyone on the internet wants to be an INFJ. 

*** 

Can you take a quick look at [this](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra)? Just read through the different pairings, Se-Ni vs Si-Ne, and Fe-Ti vs Fi-Te and place yourself in a quadra. 

You should be able to strongly relate to the quadra you choose. I suspect it will likely be beta since you seem certain on ENFJ/INFJ-- but consider other quadras too. 

The quadras are grouped into which types have the same functions. In my opinion, it seems to be a lot more definitive than types themselves. Anyways, give that a shot and let us know!

***

Also, A lot of the reasons you could be an ENFJ also align with things that INFJs do.  Just looking at it now, you seem like an ENFJ but I would really love if you could look through the quadras.It sounds like you had a good idea thinking you were an ENFJ then. I've found that fitting into a quadrant is a lot 'more snug' than trying to fit into a type. The quadrant is a bigger box, so to speak. The types are often too connotative.

Consider what others have to say, however, but just remember that self-identification is the most accurate, especially online. If any of your friends are into MBTI they could type you as well.The real question is, should i buy Overwatch?I got a tie. I skipped a bunch. 

It was quite easy to tell what the questions were asking but I agree that it could be helpful.

The list of descriptions are nice because it's easier for some people to be like, "that's totally Me in group situations" or not.

Answering the quiz requires a fair bit of self awareness that I know I don't have.The functions are discrete but describe things on a continuum.

You can't say a preference is 80%, there's no way to determine how much something is preferred over another in this case.

Creating neural  pathways by using logic-- whether subjective or objective (Te vs Ti whatever that means in this case) should strengthen those pathways, and enable better use of it right? Okay everyone, let's consider this:

Twins are born, by age 10 you can tell their cognitive preferences. John is beginning to form the preference Ti-Ne, while Tom is beginning to prefer Fi-Ne. 

John is interested in space. He is sometimes a little more distant-- but not anymore than a normal boy should be. He enjoys to think of possibilities outside of this world.

Tom is more of a humanitarian. He also considers the possibilities for his life, but instead of becoming an astronaut he would like to provide a significant contribution to end world hunger.

They are now 18, just out of high school. Due to their preferences which they understood, and were very clear while young, John knew he had to get perfect grades in Science and Math courses. He  went to space camp. He took a logic course his high school offered and excelled.

Tom was focused more on the social sciences, and putting his efforts to the help of people by volunteering at many places. A soup kitchen, an old folks home, and a big brother program to help underprivileged children.

***

At this point, who would be considered more intelligent? Does this make them more 'intelligent'? Of course not, we haven't defined it in this example.

Who has a better chance of becoming a scientist? 

Who is better at thinking in an explicitly logical way? 

Who is more likely to understand the implications on decisions on human life, and their value? It may not be fair to say John doesn't care, but it's pretty obvious if John started working on a project that harmed many many people, his irrational sentiment-- which is in the inferior slot, would produce a much less 'advanced' response than Tom. It's not fair to say that Tom can't draw valid, logical conclusions, but he sure as hell won't necessarily prefer to do it, nor will he be good at it. 

I would tend to agree with OP on their view of the 'liberal' idea that, "anyone can be anything regardless of types". This is typically pretty opposing to the ESTP thought, I think. Although, many things can be achieved by will power, and choice, we are limited first and foremost by our own abilities/desires. MBTI doesn't create this restrictions, but I think it seems to accurately describe them.

I'm more than willing to be wrong on this, but I would begin to agree with OP. There is *a lot of nuance to it* but the jist of it is that I would trust an INTP with my math homework more than an INFP. This is because of circumstances, preferences already made, and ability.

&gt;If that were true you would see no feelers who had interest in programming or math. 

/u/Vixen_Lucina. Although MBTI takes away a lot of information with its attempts to discretize, this is how approximations work. It's unfair to say that proves anything. I think unless you can  prove that Feeler preference types consistently have the same interest in math as thinker preference types it's kind of meaningless as an example. We aren't considering the possibilities as a 0 or a 1 anymore. 

10 INFPs age 30 and 10 INTPs age 30 together in a room. Same demographic, all middle class, pretty much  the same childhood. Wanna guess what their professions are? I guarantee you would almost certainly find a pattern. **People following predictable patterns doesn't remove value from human life.**

As far as emotional expression, as with the rest of it, it's complex and nuanced. There's more to it than, 'Feelers are emotionally equipped' and 'thinkers are emotionally clueless'.

However, until there is a developing preference for the secondary judgment I'd be willing to say that its more or less a true-ish statement. The reason for *more or less* or *true-ish* is that MBTI isn't describing a discrete system and I'm taking into account that-- *hey, I know some ESTPs that aren't emotionally underdeveloped. Hey I know some ESTPs that don't have anger problems. It's not me, but I know some.*

Edit: Also, I don't know how I got to defending OP. I don't really know what I think, but I like to entertain the idea of it and think about it.INFJs first and foremost perceive and INFPs make value 'decisions'. It's really hard to take Fi apart from Ne in the INFP case, and very hard to take Ni apart from the Fe.

I like to think of the attitude (i vs e) as a subjective vs external thing. So in the INFP case, they highly prefer to judge things based upon their subjective sentiment. This is their first and foremost. They often quite naturally think about themselves in others' shoes. Fi just naturally comes to them, that's how their mind formed. Nothing good, nor nothing bad about it-- it just is. Since it's subjective, their values are mostly individualized and personal. There's no overarching 'shoulds' and 'should nots' regarding sentiment that aren't derived from Te. 

INFPs are typically seen as against discrimination because that's what they do. The dominant function comes naturally, and in their world, they are making constant value judgments on things, and how they fit into it. Where the morality comes from, who knows? Fi, in theory lines what they perceive from Ne with their own personal set of values. They value people, because they are people. Things are valued because they can understand the impact in relation to themselves and can more easily put themselves in someone else's shoes. 

**Any Fi user want to verify this?**

In the Fe case, again, I don't know where the morality comes from, but as an INFJ what feels right/wrong comes externally, and often applies externally. Things *should* be a certain way. Everyone *should* love their neighbors. You extravert it, and it's much less a personally held belief than it is a fact of life -- especially since it's in the Aux slot. Where these values derive from, who knows but Fe means that you'll still value people, harmony more heavily than pure 'what makes the most sense'. 

**You can also be against discrimination, but it comes out of a completely different place than Fi.**Are the sad faces part of the text? =(I think their type *indicates* a certain one because of these things, and that the psyche is more fluid than perhaps is put on. This is a personal opinion. 

If I knew nothing else about these people, and I had a group of 5 INTPs and 5 INFPs that could do my physics homework, I would choose the INTPs. One of two of them might be 'strictly dumber' than all the other INFPs, but I would still take that bet that INTPs would be more capable after 20 years of their T-preference.

&gt;So, Tom here prefers Fi-Ne. John is Ti-Ne. If Tom had shown an interest in space and got perfect grades in science and math courses, would you trust him with your math homework more than John who was a normal b student who didn't know what he wanted to do with his life yet?

See, the thought experiment I had was already bordering on disinteresting for me. This has crossed the line of what is reasonably knowable. Type's are discrete, people aren't. I'm willing to say that the 'average' INTP is more equipped to do my math homework than the 'average' INFP.

Probably Tom in this case. Counter question: Neither of them has placed chess before, who will pick it up faster?

If I just knew type probably John still. However, this 'social ability' example doesn't give anything either way. 


It's a distinction I make but I think  a very important one nonetheless: MBTI only describes what's already there. Albeit, very very crudely, I think it's relatively accurate.

And I agree with you. Have you seen a video of a per photon shot through a diffraction grating? I can't find it, but basically they shoot a photon through a diffraction grating or only a couple onto a screen. Although the photon can theoretically fall anywhere, after a while you'll see that many packets form the fringes/interference pattern we know and love. I think this is how we need to consider MBTI/types. Except with a lot more hand-waving and less math.

Edit: [Here](http://people.ku.edu/~matt915/projects/papers/QuantumInterference.pdf) is a paper on it. I'm trying to find the GIF/video. It's *REALLY REALLY* cool.Hah! You're great. 

I think most people, myself included assumed this was an angry ENTP lol. I'm sorry. =(

Listen to this song, it's great. [Fakin' It - Kaskade &amp; Felix Cartal](https://soundcloud.com/felixcartal/kaskade-felix-cartal-fakin-it)http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png

&gt;Sure, go ahead I would too. That's not how this works though. No one is saying "INTPs are worse at physics than INFPs are", people are saying "INFPs can be good at physics as well". Stereotypes aren't a good way of typing because people can do other things than what their type "allows" them to. You are never in a situation where you only know type. It's never type first, then figure out the person.

And I'm saying it doesn't matter, and you're wrong. I am diametrically opposed to your view that "it's too simplistic". Stop trying to make it complex. You need to realize that fully characterizing the human mind is impossible and getting 'good enough' is a fine way of looking at it.

Who's more equipped to do my math homework? The average INTP or the average INFP. By average I mean every person to every exist. 

&gt;Why "Probably"? There is no doubt that Tom would be the better choice.

What do you mean "why probably"? A calculator is better at math than a label maker.

All I know is that I tend to have very easy, enjoyable interactions with fellow Se types.

&lt;3Less angry, but I thought of a person on this sub who is an INFJ who has an undergrad in computer science. Not 'typically' what you'd expect, but okay. Can we draw the conclusion that T-types *don't* prefer taking the scientific path more often? Of course not. 

What I don't understand is where your objection is coming from with even the idea of the possibility. What it seems to me, even before I knew for sure you identified as INFP-- was some sort of offense to your person. That some undefined line was crossed. 

I don't think putting people in boxes, even tiny boxes reduces the value of a human life, or someones individuality. I don't think the intrinsic value of a person is from the complexity of the person. 

It really feels like splitting hairs. MBTI doesn't predict nor describe people in individual environments. 

&gt;Beta quadra types prefer situations where the power structure and hierarchy is clearly defined according to consistent rules where ambiguities are minimized.
Beta quadra types are more confident analysing realistic characteristics of situations, people, and objects, rather than alternative and could-it-be scenarios.
Beta quadra types are inclined to attribute to a new acquaintance traits that they have previously observed in other individuals belonging to the same group as they see the new acquaintance as belonging to 

This is where I'm at. 

&gt;I'm just looking for consistency.

Te at work, boys ;). Just this whole thing, drenched in inf. Te. I'm not saying that to discredit you, or to invalidate-- I'm saying that to look for validation on that claim itself. 

I'm gonna say we're going to have to agree to disagree. 

Did you lie about being an INFP? Because that would throw a wrench in this and expose a bias I have. That would deeply fascinate me.

&gt;The average INTP. Does that mean that the average INFP cannot do you're homework? These are not good indicators of typing T vs. F.

**Did I say that the average INFP couldn't???? I CAREFULLY CHOSE MY WORDS-- 'equipped' is a key word.**

I upvoted you, even though I literally hate you right now, internet stranger-- I appreciate being challenged.. Even if I literally *can't even*.


***

ESTP-INFP  everyone. /bow



Care to elaborate?Yeah, exactly. Where that morality comes from is much larger than the scope of MBTI or this thread haha.

Thanks for the input! =D&gt;Lol, I've never seen something I've disagreed less with.

Why? I am directly challenging you on this judgment, make no mistake. 

&gt;By saying T does this and F does this, you will have multiple mistypes.

No you won't. What you're doing is disconnecting the person from their actions. We do that already, when someone comes onto the subreddit and says "I do this, I do that". Using the stereotypes to predict is overstepping. However, using them to type, although not preferable, is still useful.

&gt;These Ti-Fe types...always assuming I'm taking things personally. Can't a person just argue because they think you're wrong?

I was just saying what it seemed like. I trust you in that you say you're not taking things personally. For me, however, I am getting quite agitated with this 'discussion'. 

=([Love Is All I Got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_SqHT2cjKU)&gt;The average INTP. That doesnt mean that the average INFP cannot do your homework now does it? Therefore, these are not good indicators of typing T vs. F.

No that doesn't follow. 

&gt;If only.

I still love you, as much as I absolutely despise you right now.

&gt;Aw, I appreciate that. But I'm stubborn so here's the rest of what I have to say: You seem to have a lot of "feeeeelings" towards me right now, while I'm perfectly fine. Maybe I'm a T and you're an F...(or maybe this is situational and not enough to type someone, but you don't agree with that so...ESFP and INTP it is I guess :P)

It's very possible I am projecting some of the INFPs I know onto you. Or it's also possible that I'm right and you're wrong ;). 

I do have a lot of Fe-eelings towards you. I wish I didn't. I appreciate this distinction being made.I'm the opposite. I love to agitate people. Is this because I'm an ESTP-INFP? Or is this because we are who we are an MBTI describes it sort of accurately?Awe what a nice thing for you to say!!I guess I'm just trying to highlight the probabilistic nature of the universe and the foolishness to assume otherwise with MBTI types.

And you're probably right actually, but it seems people don't understand probability without some grand example. 

The human mind is of greater complexity than the mechanics of the universe. I'm not assuming an anthropocentric view but rather attempting to state this as a matter of fact.

Using our complexity as a reason to say an approximation like MBTI is invalid is unfair. It's also unfair to say that no one has a cognitive advantage at certain tasks.

I'm saying that to not acknowledge advantages and disadvantages of different types in this crazy messed up world is dishonest and wrong.No one here knows much more than anyone else just keep that in mind. 

You'll also notice a lot of Ti types like me who will act like they know everything. Please challenge things if they seem wrong. 

Personally, I want MBTI to represent real life so I can actually apply the things I learn. If my internal framework is off, I want to be able to amend it to represent how things are. Se-Ti at work. You'll also notice that I'll tend to be more open about declaring things *as is* because that's how I see things. I think this might be Se.

I'm not sure about your question, however. Ne is annoying, but if the interfacing is done in Ti it's fine, I've found for me. INTPs, ENTPs-- great. It's nice getting a new angle on something.

INFPs offer a new angle but something about Fi tends to really drive me crazy. I mean it is predicted in socionics. What other types are considered weird, for clarification?
Aren't the basic, probabilistic mechanics applicable to the quantum scale within the mind? We can predict/understand one particle, one element, one 'piece'. How many of those pieces make up one mind? **The most complex system you can come up with in simulation pales in comparison to the human mind.** Perhaps when quantum computing becomes viable, we can come up with simulations that rival the complexity of the mind, who knows. 

I'm not some smart person either. The only thing I've managed to learn in my schooling so far is that we really know *soooooo* very little about the universe. I mean the universe as a whole, but then the laws that govern everything we are, too. This is Ni talking for sure, but I think this is why I love my physics classes because I am just filled with so much wonder. Although an ESTP physicist/mathematician does sound kind of dissonant though haha, I actually have chosen an engineering discipline. 

Edit: [Computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory) seems relevant here. I know nothing about anything =(


Quote comes to mind,

&gt;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.

&gt;Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry.

&gt;It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.

&gt;If I could explain it to the average person, I wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize.

&gt;**I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.**


It's like that paradox you see when people start to get more muscular/fit. You start getting so much farther away from the goal. It's like that with knowledge/understanding it seems too.

&gt;I am sure types have their advantages, but there are slim on the scale of more fundamental things like intelligence, IQ, memory, etc... like if an INTP has IQ of a 100, and a ESFP IQ of 130, who will be better at grasping mathematical concepts?

Take the IQ of all North American INTPs, average it. Take the average IQ of all North American ESFPs, average it. Which is higher? Are they the same? I'm not saying types cause this, I'm saying that they describe it. 

&gt;I think if there was a probability distribution of jobs types work in, all S and N would fall in mostly 9 to 5 desk jobs despite the type. They're still Ss and Ns with different stacks, but most people just don't have possibilities/qualities and circumstances especially to be benchmark examples, I'm not saying this snobbishly because I'm part of that pack. Cognitive perception can give you an advantage of course, saying being a certain type will propel you further (unless all the other major factors are there) is raising pointless expectations. How many ENTPs come around that think they're destined for some greatness, because wow Ne is so ideas friendly?

When I think of a type, I try not to refer to a specific individual. Often times, my idea of that type is based on someone I know, but I keep it in my mind that the type is much more nebulous than this person. I think in terms of THE INFP, or THE INTP. So I agree with you in saying that theres a lot of people in 9-5 desk jobs. I also agree that ability is more than type. 

What I wanna say in response to that is that type is still non-negligible in a lot of this. I think there is the ability to predict to *some* accuracy with MBTI/socionics.  

&gt;Cognitive perception can give you an advantage of course, saying being a certain type will propel you further (unless all the other major factors are there) is raising pointless expectations.

I want to be proven that it's pointless. This is Se vs Ne right here.

Forcing people into careers based upon MBTI is dumb, *suggesting* careers based on it is not. 

Why are you doing this to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &gt;=(That's cool. I'm gonna read that instead of doing work. :DI like you. Thank you for this reply!I'm lost. What are we talking about? =(Wow someone's angry.That's my secret, Cap. I'm always angry.Do you think on first glance, INFPs can *tend* to appear 'warm'? 
I enjoy reading other Se users perspectives because it always seems like you guys just get me. 

Se represent! &lt;3Hey, thanks for the thing, sort of.

I think it's important to note that the functions are preferences. They are almost certainly only semi-consciously chosen.

What else is important to note is that Se-Ti directly opposes Fi-Ne. This means, that semi-consciously, I have chosen Se-Ti, so in my mind Se-Ti is better. It's the 'right' way to think. Even if I can intellectually know that there may be multiple ways. Fi-Ne still feels wrong. It grinds against my core. It's running an uphill battle to try and convince me otherwise at this point to be honest. 

What's *not* an uphill run, is trying to stop perpetuation of certain  views on INFP that may not be accurate to real life.

That being said, I do think Ti is just as bad. At least with the stubborn, I'm-always-right INTPs is that I at least know how to appeal to one of them, as they do with me. Even if we see things completely differently, we can at least discuss(see: argue) on the same plane. This luxury isn't there for the INFP-ESTP dynamic.

So thank you for drawing that parallel-- because it's 100% true that Ti is just as stubborn as Fi. Introverted functions can lend to that. The perceiving ones too. 

&gt;So, how can this issue be fixed? I'll tell you what's worked for me. The thing about Fi-doms is that we really like when you validate the parts of our arguments that ARE correct, and really emphasize where we're right.

Yes. Good point! I'm not just saying that. This is something that I've learned the hard way the past year. Thing is, this is *extremely* difficult. It may not sound difficult but I would imagine that if I were to ask 100 ESTPs the answer would be similar: "Why?". What it feels like is sacrificing authenticity, it feels irrelevant, or maybe that's just me. Even so, that's seems like such an Fi-thing to expect me to do that. Fi is literally my lowest preference-- it's 8th.  

I think that's where Fe is needed to counterbalance Ti. As such, Te needs to counterbalance Fi. 

All that to say, I agree. Even though I get angry even just thinking about my interactions with INFPs I know, I agree with your assessment. So thank you for sharing! =D

***

On another note, it's not just an Fi thing. It's a Ji thing. Sometimes I think it may be a Ji-Ne thing. There's a lot of flak for the general bias against sensors on the internet-- so maybe that's why I feel able to type this (cue the pitchforks): Ji-Ne / Ne-Ji seems to have its head up it's own ass. 

*** 

Anyways, I'm rambling at this point, but I'd like to address the Fe-Fi. I think that having Fe in the 'child' slot makes it that much more inflammatory. I have a child-like grasp on Fe as a function. Thoughts?

***

Also, as I type this, I have to ask. Are you a dominant Fi user? Because it seems like your reply is drenched in Fi-based assumptions. I know you can't really help it, but there's something deep inside of me that just feels annoyed to the very core haha.

I really do appreciate being challenged in this way, and forced to try and consider a new perspective.

&gt;Again, it might feel annoying to have to "cater" to us. Maybe that's the very reason why you dislike us - we're needy, and require certain things...but so does every other type! I'd challenge you to ask that same question about your own type. Where might people have difficulty catering to YOU? Why might people clash with YOUR type? As an example, I used to have an ESFP boyfriend. He had Fi so we were on the same wavelength with that, but his Se sometimes drove me up a wall because we always had to be doing SOMETHING and being stimulated by something. I simply didn't have the energy for it, and I would get too tired, which made me grumpy. I just couldn't put up with it all the time. I loved him and his energy and I appreciated him for who he was, but the things he needed didn't match up with the things I could give him. He dated someone else (who I think is probably ISFP) and they were much better for each other, and that's amazing.
If you still want to buy into stereotypes, you can use those stereotypes to help you get out of your own head. Ask yourself, "why exactly do these stereotypes exist?" The actual answers to this question might surprise you. In the end, the whole "T's like math and F's don't!" debate is largely uninteresting, and it's not a nuanced view. People like what they like. Sure, interests often have a correlation with type. But the MORE interesting conversation (from my point of view), is WHY people like certain things. Even within the same career, there are differing answers. For instance, I know an ESTP photographer. She loves photography because she appreciates how hands-on and in the moment it is, how well she can compose the photos, etc. She learns in a tactile manner, and therefore has a great feel for what a "great photo" involves. She loves the use of the camera itself. I know an INFP photographer, as well, who prefers to capture the unique personalities involved in each photo, who enjoys the collaborative effort between the subject and the photographer. She loves bringing out the best in each subject, and photography is just one medium where she's able to do this, and she's skilled in this area. Totally opposite in personality, totally different in motivation, but same result. That's cool as hell, in my opinion, and it's what gives their work flavor. Same can be said about any career - I know an ENFP who is AMAZING at chemistry, and wants to eventually go to med school so she can help people using the skills she has. I also know an ESTJ who wants to go to med school because he appreciates the idea of being a doctor, and he values the structure that it takes to become a doctor. Their type determines the WHY, not the WHAT.

I cannot respond to these two paragraphs calmly. It seems to be based on a faulty assumption that I can't pinpoint-- which is my issue. It's not a matter of simply disagreeing, but it feels like you don't 'get' it. I'm sorry that I can't provide anymore than that. 

Overall, thank you for the post even though you lost me at the end there. 


&gt;If any of it sounds like basic reasoning it's because they're basic psychological functions, literally abstract concepts that divide up our conscious experience.

Sentence of the year.
Again, thanks for the reply. I really do appreciate it. For honesty's sake I should mention that I do have a bias against INFPs(if that wasn't already apparent), as 3 out of 3 INFPs are probably the most hypocritical people I know. There is an air of fakeness that I can't seem to shake in my mind associated with the type.

I realize this is unfair to imprint onto 'The INFP' (as a type) but even if I acknowledge it, it's likely that I can't shake the hurt, frustration, anger I've experienced-- enough to have an unbiased response. &lt;3Hi! 

Did you see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4nakrz/stereotypesmy_unpopular_opinion/d42ofh0) post?


&gt;Now with mbti, I'm sure if the system means anything, you can certainly find different distributions of certain qualities among different mbti types. 

He explains what I was trying to say in a different, better way.

&gt;At some point you can just get a shock of "wait, don't all people do that?". 

All you weirdos not using the *objectively best* function, Se. ^^the ^^^bait ^^^^has ^^^^^been ^^^^^^setWhich type is the cuddliest then?
Do you and your ESTP not get along? :(Not INFJs??? ;)No I don' think so. Why INTJ though?I know my INTJ well-ish. I've hugged it before. It's definitely sweet, initially I thought it was cold. You may have a point then.

Rank the types from most cuddly to least cuddly!Haha, might as well be but no she's a she.

I don't think I've heard that before-- about INFJs are cold.

Does that not make you a bitch though? 

There's no way thinkers are more cuddly than feelers. That's a generalization I cannot get behind. 
I feel like inferior Feelers are probably the cuddliest followed by teritary.

It's just something to get through the shell and get them vulnerable and weak and soft. So yeah, I guess you're right, INFJs are the worst, Ti/Se is literally the least cuddly probably.

Here goes the first version of this.

INF FE : INTP / ISTP

INF FI: INTJ / ISTJ

TERT FE: ESTP / ENTP

TERT FI: ESTJ / ENTJ

Since I'm lazy I don't want to think about bottom 8.

Top 8(+1) here we go.

1. INTJ
2. INTP
3. ESTP
4. ISTP
5. ISTJ
6. ENTP
7. ENTJ
8. ESTJ
9. INFJ


This is a completely arbitrary list. V1.0



What does that mean? Is unhealthy  a judgment made in your own cognitive framework?


Edit: also, what does manipulative mean? Same I think this is more likely Fi and Fe related.

Fi will not want to sacrifice their own comfort for the overall well being. Especially if they are 'fine'. 

Also Fe+Se is a very aggressively emotional combo. I think it's a beta quadrant thing to always want to address the elephant at all costs. With ISTP/ESTP doing it with the least tact. 

In my experience, I had a problem with someone that perpetually didn't want to address problems. As such, how am I supposed to discuss a clear issue in communication? The person was an INFP. It was clear that their subjective values were not getting occasionally offset by Te. It's not fair to just blame Fi as a function. 

Edit: Also, I think Ti with low Fe could fall victim to this just as easily. Maybe not just as easily but I've definitely encountered an INTP who actively avoided conflict out of a sense of duty. They valued Fe but their idea of it was to sacrifice their own discomfort completely. 

Contrasted with my INTJ friend who has said, "I just hate it when people are so nice. Like, I mean, it's great to be nice, but when you sacrifice yourself and you can't stand up for what you think is when it's gone too far." She was quote visibly aggravated talking about this. 

I haven't encountered an ISTP to do the same, but I suspect this was because the INTP was young ish.

It's a similar type of thing but for different reasons. With this INTP, avoiding discomfort was out of a misguided belief that that's what must be done-- self sacrifice, whereas high Fi low Te seemed to be more about, "I don't think that therefore it doesn't matter". Please note that although this sounds particular to Fi(mostly because of the frequent Fi bashing) it's very common to both Ji functions. 

Perhaps when you only have a very active/used Ji/Pe is when you get the "I'm right you're wrong" feeling.

With Pe/Ji, at least in myself, the feeling is more of a twisting to fit kind of thing. For extraverted perceiving types , maybe the annoying phase comes when the third Je comes, haha. I have no idea.Yup, I think a lot of the 'problems' we see that cause us to type people presumptively are just low stack development issues.

I would almost certainly have been typed as a F type this past year to a couple people I know. Except I wasn't good at it. There needs to be a comfort in your Dom-aux type-- well there is for anyone 20+. 

The natural 'development' involves balancing your psyche, according to Jung(if I recall). I mean, that's what's presumed by the 'rules' of functions. 

***

So yeah, personal harmony of the concrete, Si, will often involve the past because of how it works. And as one learns to do that, I'm sure there's probably a lot of bumps along the way.

I definitely can speak to inferior Ni and the hell that it is. There is no peace. I can imagine inferior Si is similar focussing on what is rather than what could be. 

Have you had experience with Si grip?  Love youGood point actually. 

Thoughts on my comments for the OP?Interesting. What changed?

Reason I ask is that most people generally say that your dominant function feels invisible.

I thought I was INTP for the longest time because I recognized Ti. I wanted to be an INTP because I was relatively shy and they seemed so cool. It was only after looking at my tertiary and even inferior before I realized what Se was like. 

As well, I had *noticed* Ti. This is what gave me a second thought initially. Since it wasn't as smooth as I had read it being. 

Reading what people of your type have to say and talking to others is one of the best metrics I think. There's an ease of understanding and communication. Although values may not always line up, it's pretty helpful to type. That's some savage shot right there.

Keep on meme-ingWrong. I want to bang them. So they are almost CERTAINLY INFJ.Honestly this sounds crazy. It sounds made up. Amidst all the INFJ dick-sucking you are doing God's work, son.

What type is your mother?No I'm saying that it's a nice change of pace. Since most things on INFJs are pretty positive on this forum.

Why can't they leave each other?How do I find my tri type?People that give up easily, on anything.

I think this stems to a very Trump-esque view of 'losers'. I don't like losers.

Being a quitter is a big part of being a loser. 

Neglecting your agency in a circumstance is also something that reveals a loser.

Get this straight: I *don't* believe hard work is the key to everything. Some people get dealt some really shitty cards.

Connected: neglecting the moment. We only have the present. I understand some types are future-focussed but think about it. We only have the present ever. The moment we are currently existing within is the only thing we are guaranteed. This isn't as much of a dealbreaker/maker since I find joy in helping people experience a moment. 

Being a loser is the opposite to a "can-do" attitude. The opposite to persistence. We all have our faults and flaws but quitting is not one I can take.  


So INFPs! ;) /s=(This is our thing right? I like having things with people.

=)It's funny because /u/Kbnation has an accent Can I be an ESTP/INTP/INFJ/ISTJ hybrid type? I say this because I like to spend time alone crying, think about space, organize files, and get plastered and harass women.I don't get what you're saying and whether or not I should be angry/butthurt.I like you guys.J-Just... It's a meme. Dude. Be cool.That sounds terrible.That's interesting. What type are you?What kind of stuff do you do? I don't get it. I generally like to believe the best in people. I generally tend to think that most people are pretty nice. 

When I think about it more, I can't think of anyone that I just think is an irredeemably terrible person. Since I can't spot the asshole, am I the asshole?!!? How do I know? 

Why do people suck? Maybe I'm just a terrible person and I don't even know it :/Is sarcasm a good sign? I'm pretty sure this person I'm thinking of is an INTJ.

I mean we do stuff together but I'm never really sure if they like me or not. I've tended to believe that them just acknowledging my presence is a pretty good Sign.More than Ne infs?Why's that do you think?You weren't planning on going anywhere??? Right??? Don't leave me and my now apparent abandonment issues.What does POLR mean??????111??

Also what antics??? No such thing.Except that's what science is doing now. I mean there is luckily a lot of push back in some areas-- but we are approaching a time of 'scientism'. Where science tries to proceed without philosophy. It's one thing to abandon religion as a means for understanding science, but we're at a time where we sacrifice critical thought for whatever pop culture says. 

Hell, I'd be willing to say that that's what always happened but with the internet age it's a much more unified problem.

I don't just mean this as a defense for MBTI but as an internet issue in general. Fuck, look at Bill Nye. He could say he shits diamonds and people would believe him if he said it in his condescending-ass tone. In my opinion, scientific 'leaders' shouldn't shouldn't be pop culture icons.

Their literature should speak for itself. They should encourage a deeper understanding of the current scientific thought on a subject without saying that everyone else is stupid. Being right doesn't mean you have to make someone else wrong. It means that someone else *is* wrong, but sometimes being a dick doesn't help.

Encouraging critical thought is probably the most important thing in 'science' in my opinion, for progress to be made into the next century-- what do I know though. We need to constantly be taking our models of the universe and all inside it and comparing and picking apart.

Great minds think alike and fools seldom differ.

Did you already answer this to me? I forget if I had asked before.

Thanks for answering again, if so.&gt; But ESTPs do not do it because the screams echo in the **hollowness of their soul** and they can pretend that the abyss is responding to them, no ‚Äì the ESTPs do it because they think it‚Äôs fun.

Same. 

&gt;INFJs often want to change the world, but what they don‚Äôt realize is that they, themselves, need to change. The INFJ animal is a badger. Badgers are dumb. Badgers won‚Äôt fucking let go if they bite you, much like an INFJ. INFJs are prone to biting people, the freaks.

I don't know. Badgers are pretty sweet.

&gt;These people give you gifts and need help. The ISFJ animal is a leech, or anything disgusting and creepy, really.

The author had a bad experience with a leech looks like. Ah the [ol' Jungaroo](https://www.reddit.com/r/hitmanimals/comments/4o1sy7/hitcrow_targeting_a_runner/d49zv6y?context=3).

Hold my cognitive functions, I'm going in!Wait did you just reply to yourself?Because I don't trust any of you.Is there enough truth for it to hurt though?Yeah you sound like them. I've definitely heard the 'on' thing. While us Beta's would consider that foolish and inauthentic. 

I would tend to perceive the sarcasm and the frequent time spent as friendly. However, sometimes I second guess myself. 

And the arguing thing is nice to know. Definitely had some pretty heated arguments. The moth-to-flame socionics semi-dual description seems pretty true.

Do you have any close ESTP friends?[This](http://www.typologycentral.com/forums/the-sp-arthouse-esfp-isfp-estp-istp-/14443-official-hates-isfps-thread.html) is what came up when I searched, "isfps suck". 

It's official, ISFPs are the best ~~class~~ type.Where's ESTP?NO. 

=(Yes. If ESTPs aren't repressing it it's terrible since it really is super childish. Fe is such an annoying function in the third slot.Broad generalizations are what betas live for.What you're an ISTP now? 

That explains why you're such a dick. ;)Gonna miss you, fam.He realized that he actually hates everyone. Pretty standard, really.Where do you feel ESTPs place, and why?

I'm curious of your experience with all the other types as well-- or if you can conceptualize what they'd be like that work... If you're into that sort of thing.Every waking moment that I can that I'm not a) talking to someone b) consuming some other form of media that would interfere (i.e. movie, video game with important sound cues (Overwatch, anyone?)

I mostly use spotify to find what I like. My 'range' is anything under the EDM umbrella but I gravitate towards house and future house in particular. I used to like more electro sounding stuff but now I definitely like having some lyrics and some soul -- more pop-y stuff.

I listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOHKulM-gF0) at least once a day. I get new favourites and I'll listen to them 7+ times a day until they wear out. If I still like them after and they still have 'meaning' to me they take the place as one of the greats.

Future house most recently. Stuff that sounds pretty similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wxi3TajoJOc). I'll fully admit that most of the drops sound almost exactly the same for my recent stuff.

I feel like any NF will gravitate toward folk stuff, underground 'you wouldn't have heard of it' stuff. Our SPs are the EDM listeners. SJs will like more pop, top 40 stuff, or more of the bigger folk. NTs listen to 'whatever' because they are soulless and don't understand the beauty of music.awwww, did someone hurt lil Fi-dom's feels? go into your safespace and cry about it


Okay, now that we got that out of the way. I don't really know what the purpose of this is? 

**I mean, I suspect it's just to vent-- and I getcha. I'll let you know that I do value it either way! I think good discussions can come from vulnerability. Heck, I think the only meaningful discussions come when there's two-sided vulnerability.**  

What we, as a community, need to start doing is stop taking functions individually. They always, always, always need to be considered in the context of the whole type, and/or the perception/judging axis. I think it's often important to either take a function as a JP pair--- so Fi-Ne in your case or to look at the JJ or PP pairs, like in the quadra.

As far as,

&gt;I keep running into a bias against xxFP types. I'll admit I might be taking this too personally, but I'm honestly getting sick of it. Yeah, I'm "offended" by it. Why are people so dead-set on undervaluing others? I'm always hearing "Fi this" or "Fi that" and the only ones who are down to defend it are xxFP types themselves. Even ones with lower Fi (not in the first two spots) say that they just try to cut it out of their thought process because it's useless/self-absorbed/etc.

I would disagree. I really only see XNFPs bothering to defend themselves, and in fact a majority seem to identify as INFPs. This might be incorrect, and I'm willing to corrected on this, however just off hand that's what it seems like.  My personal opinion is that XSFPs seem to recognize who they are a little bit more accurate to reality than XNFPs. I don't believe this is an emotional judgment, for the record. 

I do think Fi is self-absorbed. I also do think Ti is self-absorbed. Here's my opinion of all the functions:

Fi: whiny, vindictive, self-absorbed
Ti: condescending, know-it-all, self-absorbed
Fe: Annoying, weak, dumb
Te: Rigid, boring, impersonal

I don't know. Thoughts on this? I'm just kind of matching your rambling with mine. &lt;3

&gt;I don't want to call anyone an asshole, but for the amount of work I (and so many other sweet, kind Fi doms) put into understanding other people, I really don't think the flak we get is deserved.

Fair enough. What do you think we could do to help INFPs/ENFPs be more understood in general? How can I shift my point of view?

&gt; They are so dead-set on self-love, even when the outside world is trying to bring them down.

As a childish Fe user, I would tend to not believe in self-love. To me, in my mind, I have a hard time differentiating between that and selfishness. Could you, or another more advanced Fe user explain the difference? 

&gt;Some of my best friends have been Fi doms/auxes. And they are FANTASTIC, loving individuals. They are so dead-set on self-love, even when the outside world is trying to bring them down. They are so understanding and accepting of others, especially when the other people come at them with a genuine attitude. Their sensitivity can get in the way but it's also an amazing quality to have, particularly in close relationships - the depth of conversation and connection that Fi users can foster is remarkable.

The angry, lonely, jaded, person that I am makes me question: who do you think you are? What makes you(or any INFP) more genuine than me? what makes you more accepting and understanding? I am being inflammatory now, but why does it seem like all INFPs are like this?

Of course, I don't really mean that. I recently met two ISFPs. The only thing I can say for sure is that they care. Perhaps Fi has a more natural tendency to care since it's out of self rather than externally based. Which, in my opinion, is a great quality to have.

I don't know what the point of my post is either. Perhaps to rile you up. 

**Either way, I like to make it known because I know you'll receive it-- I appreciate the post nonetheless :D. Content like this, no matter how much 'content' there is, no matter how I feel about Fi, or the INFPs I know, is something that makes this subreddit feel like a true community. So, thanks!**

Who trolls you? What do you mean?




I feel you. I am an Se dom and surrounded by non-Se types. When an environment is dominated by non-Betas, as a beta, I feel pretty lonely.  Starts to feel like people think I'm stupid or something and that I'm always stating the obvious. 

=(  /u/hamfree77 That's Fe's ultimate goal though amirite? If I'm sad, so must everyone be.INTP -&gt; ENTP -&gt; ESTPHey, it's you! And why not? =(


I think that's good.  How old are you, if I may ask?

The fact that you have come to the conclusion consciously and actively that you admire Fe is a sign of 'development' of it-- whatever that means.

I think practically, observing a high Fe stack user would be the only way to improve. 

Also, realize that you SHOULD feel uncomfortable when using it. That's how this stuff works.

I don't really 'get MBTI' sometimes. It's cognitive preferences. So like, each function is a cognitive process. I don't know.&gt;you can start with the fake it til you make it thing.

How so?Yup. Exactly. Cognitive functions aren't just something we're good at. They are symbols for how we think. They are symbols for our thought processes, and a good chunk of who we are.The difference between Fe in Tert. and aux, everyone!What's this?

I'm not sure if this is a sarcastic post. 

I upvoted because I'm not sure. 

Things like 

&gt;But I think it's rather beautiful since we intertwine raw emotions and imagination in its most natural state.

Seem to really be some gr8 b8 m8. Damn. This. Is. Brutal.

"I like to see bad people fail". Yup. Se low in stack can tend to be pretty impulsive in a really bad way. ENFJs are a lot more excitable I think because of this.

The ESFJs I've known haven't been less emotional, but a lot more steady. To be fair, something being 'natural' doesn't make it necessarily right. What do you mean?You're going to have to give me something more. Who are you talking about? It's me right? I don't really get what you're saying still. It was more of an observation. I wasn't disagreeing but rather pointing out-- especially since it's common, that an appeal to nature should be proven to have some value here. 

Attraction is a complex thing and appealing to nature seems to ignore a LOT of societal pressures that I would argue have a much larger impact than instinct. 

It just doesn't seem like the best reason that being shallow is valid.  All this is besides the point too, since the comment I was replying to was more about SFJs, NFs not deserving/needing physical beauty. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, though.

I think to the original reply to the OP, I would disagree with their statement that being shallow is not negative-- or even not needing justification. 

Then OP replied and said it does which I agree with, but the natural argument seems weak.  I don't disagree though.Well said!! Good post peppermint-kiss :Dhttp://i.imgur.com/9H7xfUY.jpg&gt;Just have value, bring stability, and don't create chaos.

Something something you're an ISTJ.What do you think OP?&gt; current personality and outlook more than ENFP currently does.

You're an ENFP. Sorry bro. /s

*** 

To add on because otherwise I'm just a filthy shitposter. 

I don't think types 'evolve'. I think that most of the time, when people see themselves changing--- it's simply a development of the non-dominant functions. 

There was a post somewhere which an INTP had explained this. There were some videos as well. I believe these comments were on the videos. 
 But we know that with that inferior Se INTJs really do want the excitement and chaos. ;)Subconscious is strictly incorrect if we're gonna get into this.

Semi-conscious is a much more accurate term.

Okay, honey? ;)I think it's fine. I think that Ni vs Ne works in a similar way because a lot of this has to do with the nature of extraverted vs introverted attitudes.Because I wasn't actually asserting that they weren't an INTJ. 

thatsthejoke.jpg

We can agree to agree then. ;) ;) ;) ;)Being in the the present isn't the same as being present. Being present requires external awareness. Se/Ne are this external awareness. Ni/Si are internal awareness. 

They are apart from one another. Being internally aware is not traditionally  considered "being in the moment" but I would agree with your argument that you still technically are.What do you mean by explode?ESTP.

Dark, suspensful, action, psychological thrillers. I like a certain morbidity but I don't care for the horror genre. 

Mindfuck movies.

Off the top of my head, favourite movies: Inception, Interstellar, Dark Knight, The Informant, The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, City of God, American Psycho, The Machinist, Oceans 13(or whatever the casino one was.)

I definitely am partial to Christopher Nolan, Matt Damon, Christian Bale. I really liked the Dark Knight Rises despite others' reviews.

I don't really care for things like the Avengers. I want to question my existence or something after I'm done watching. I like getting mindfucked.

TV Shows. Breaking Bad(duh). However I like comedies a lot more and more light-hearted stuff. Seinfeld and How I  Met Your Mother up there, but I didn't care for Friends. Always Sunny. Silicon Valley. I'm pretty unoriginal, I know. 

I actively dislike drama in TV shows at this point I think. I don't think I would care for HIMYM if it was on TV a lot now.Savage memeing, fam. #blazeit420noscopeAyyylmaoNo.Are we mindfucking right now?Hot. I liked curb. Thanks for reminding me of it!!! I didn't really care for Kimmy Schmidt though, wasn't too funny when I saw it. Otherwise, I'll definitely look out for the brink and you me and the apocalypse. We seem to have a similar taste.

Are any of those dramas cop shows? I don't care for dramas unless they're cop shows. So good. Life? It was on a while ago, had Damien Lewis. Clever cop show.  &gt;The more emotions for me to feel tortured over and feed off of the better.

Basically sums it up.

I guess I don't really care for needless, non-realistic drama. I mean it's somewhat realistic since there are people that exist like that-- but for the most part everyone in dramas seems like an idiot.Yes. It's you. Wow. 

That comment is a greatest hits comment of /r/MBTI.People like what?What country did you do schooling in?There's a lot of speculation in this thread. I'm not willing to throw mine into the mix. I'm just here to say that there was a comment that 'derived' the functions from some clever thought. It was an argument very clearly out of Ti but very satisfactory for me. Does anyone know who that was? I think it was an INTP.

As far as considering the cognitive functions it's sooooooooo important to remember they symbolize the psyche. Their discrete parts only now can be shown to appear discretely in the brain but that's not where their value is(at least not currently). So as a tip for this thread, and just understanding them in general, I've found it helpful to consider them on their axes and as push-pull in relation to each other. 

The push-pull thing begins to model how they act in real life. ISFJ off his rocker apparently.

I personally like him. He's an entertainer. He's playing a part. 

Same with Taylor Swift except I think less people are getting fooled by Kanye. With Swift, we have a whole generation that think she's as authentic as she comes across. She's a human Barbie doll. Not just in looks either. She's a persona that we consume. 

Same with Kanye. He's an actor. Kim K played the game and won. That's what they all doing. 

Although with Bieber I begin to question whether or not his shits real or not. Then I look at the cute kid turned bad boy turned good Christian angle. It's a script.

Life is scripted fam, it's all over #inferiorNi.

http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2015/09/why-kanye-west-is-isfj/Give me an example from someone on this sub. I need entertainment.

Also, are you an INTP? I need to know for further research regarding /u/quiteafewfireflies  comment.INTPs are funny too because of the one INTP I know. I just imagine them all as awkward potatoes. It has less to do with actual content though.
The more important question is which type are the dankest memers??Now subbed to /r/me_irl and /r/blackpeopletwitter. Hilarious shit.

Advice animals... not so much.Wow this sub has all the bots.Wow. Why not at least mention who they are! I think the people who submit good content like that should be recognized! Otherwise everyone will just think /r/mbti has turned into ESTP shitposts with me and /u/kbnation .Probably. Who Knows. ESTPS suck.Typical INFP ;)Fair enough. However acknowledging someone doesn't take away from someone else. Nor is it unfair to not acknowledge someone else. 

Dear Diary,

Today /u/trippin_daisies noticed me. It's a good thing too because I was about to give up on winning her heart. Now that I know this I will send my positive thoughts to make her love me. Because that's all we can do really. Is just think positively and hope that she notices me. Maybe I deserve to be ignored. Maybe all my shitposting is reason to block and ignore my shitposts. Sometimes I think it might be but today is the day where I was validated. 

One day I will be king of /r/mbti. All types will bow to me. I will be a gracious and merciful King. All types will live happily under my rule. All types except for the INFPs. I will banish all INFPs to /r/infj where they belong. I will choose an INFJ as my queen. Oh diary, if only. One day.

No one appreciates me for me. I feel like no one sees the real me. I make all these deeply insightful and enlightened and euphoric statements but they all laugh. I feel like I shield others from the darkness inside of me. The emptiness would swallow them whole. The black hole that is my heart. Woe is me to bear this burden. I feel like ESTPs have it the roughest. We are always the smartest, funniest, most attractive people and that makes everyone else jealous of us and hate us. I wish I could be an INFJ. No one would be jealous of my greatness then. 

She totally ignored me today. She was working on some stupid thing, but I said her name like four times. Then when she finally asked what the problem was it was too late. Then she pretended like she didn't know what she did. Ugh. I hate that. Except she's the hottest girl in school and I'm the hottest guy so we TOTALLY belong together. It's like a fairy tale. 

Sometime's /r/MBTI feels lonely. We have INTPs and INFJs and INTJs and ESTPs, but where are the real people? The salt-of-the-earth types who stick by you no matter what. The ones that do your taxes for you. The ISTJs and ESTJs and ESFJs.

Sometimes the world knocks you down but you gotta get back up. You gotta tell fear to go fuck itself. Fear has nothing to say! You are in control of your own life. Except for pretty much everything.

Well, I guess then we aren't in control of anything. Even our attitude towards stuff is barely within our grasp. Aren't the beliefs we have a product of the initial conditions before us? Why are my choices my own and not the result of others? I'm sure it's not black and white, but my beliefs in people and everyone are heavily influenced by other things. What is free will? It's an illusion. I am literally too euphoric right now. 

Back to /u/trippin_daisies. They are so insightful. I feel like they see the real me. I should play it cool and act all non-chalant. People don't say it but they like ambiguity. They like the chase. I gotta act like I don't care. As soon as you act like you care you give over control to that person. There's weakness. No one likes weakness. You gotta be the alpha. Eventually I'm going to be king of /r/mbti. Or president, or mod or wahtever the position is called. 

I'm the most successful person to run for president. Nobody's been more successful than me. I have the best words. I am the smartest. I'm gonna build a wall to keep all those Fi types out. Gonna do what the people of /r/mbti want. I build the best walls. I build the best comments. People always tell me, "Flux, you build the best comments." Just ask anybody!  I am the best.

People always read my comments. Except, diary do I believe that? Does my deep fear of not being heard cause me to lie to myself? Maybe no one reads my comments. Maybe no one hears my insightful, enlightened, euhphoric words. I am the best, but does everyone know it? How can I make everyone know it. I always give 100%. If my 100% isn't good enough I just wanna die. I just want people to tell me I'm garbage. I hate when people beat aroudn teh bush. The yshould just tell me I'm garbage. That's when I ask what would Donald Trump do? Then I remember his very beautiful daughter and have to look up images of her. Wow. If my daughter was that beautiful. She's ugly though. She's gonna have a rough life. Definitely the ugliest 3 year old I've ever seen. I don't wanna be one of those people that puts their ugly daughter in a pageant. Everyone knows she's ugly and gonna be ugly so they give her prizes while shes still relatively not ugly but that 'cute feature' turns into a weird looking uggo later in life. It's really terrible.

What if beauty standards shift tomorrow? What if the Taylor Swift look wasn't considered the most attractive. My imaginary daughter would be ugly still thought because she's kind of a jerk. It's really terrible. 

Today was a good day diary. I managed to write many words that were almost compeltely non-sensical gibberish and I hope I wasted at least one persons time. I mean they didn't have to read the whole thing just a snippet and thats good enough for me. I can die now. 



Also, who dumps on me often?I know nothing of the internet drama. I don't think there's anyone on this sub that has frustrated me. I certainly hope there hasn't been anyone I've frustrated more than a useful discussion warrants.

I had some interactions in which I used very broad strokes in discussing Fi. Some INFPs responded and I would say there was some good useful interaction there between us! 

There is definitely something to say regarding smaller subreddits like this. Even having some anonymity now, there is a large difference between this sub and a larger sub in which people don't recognize each other. There's something about social psychology or some shit in there.

And I agree, /u/jermofo does deliver the goods. I had referenced a post they made that really stuck with me and they had noticed that I was talking about them but didn't know. I thought that was fun. 

Oh god no I'm sorry. No. Sorry. I'm joking. *Do* you get it?  I was just writing as much gibberish as I could. 

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 


Oh yeah, I didn't mind Hannibal. It was a 'thing' for me and an INTJ friend.

As far as David Cross and Tina Fey in Kimmy Schmidt-- I might have to give it another chance. However, I was born in the mid-90s and so the references are pretty over my head. There's no nostalgia to appeal to. 

There's definitely something to sharing a dom function with someone.  My relationships with other ESXPs have tended to be extremely natural and easy.

&gt;wanting to feel special.

Isn't that everyone in the world?INFPs do too, it's usually not super positive though =( Otherwise definitely INFJ, INTP, INTJ.Yeah. I literally do nothing all day except refresh this subreddit. I'm only a little bit proud. 

I think there's a lot more discussion of INXX types however. ENTJs probably discussed the least. I think so because that's what I see..?One time I googled doggy melons because I thought it was a reference.What's wrong with the function axes? Also what's wrong with the idea of a push-pull type of architecture? 

You certainly lack tertiary and inferior. This is without considering attitudes. As in, since I'm an ESTP I lack F and N. I simply prefer to be express F and N as Fe/Ni. I agree with you on making a point of that.

What I'm confused about is why you cannot agree with the idea of the typing using the functional axes. Your objection seems kind of orthogonal to the idea of them. 

The axes may not 'exist' in a way but by taking advantage of the pattern that is formed we can use them to categorize much more easily. The quadras do exactly this. We split the types on new goalposts that we define. What's your issue with this?

Do you disagree with the accuracy of the quadra? Or how each axis manifests itself?  

I'm of the opinion that the quadra take a very intangible model and explicitly lay it out in real world behavioural cues. This is extremely important.

Edit: It's like complex numbers. They don't exist. It's just a logical trick to help understand the world.People actually read that comment. I tried to make it so long that people wouldn't look at it. 
/u/madsweet, /u/recycledstardust, thoughts? 

Personally, I've **never** heard anyone say that. I've definitely witnessed the attitude. I don't know how much it connects to Fi though. 

I feel like this "aren't like the other girls" thing is actually for T pref types.

My friends ex-GF is probably the only person I can see saying something like this. She's got a mental illness and she's crazy. She has BPD but that's not why I say she's crazy. I would guess that she's an ESTP just because how we interact. I like her a lot but some of the things she's done have been a little crazy. She is definitely pretty insecure. I can totally relate still in that.  Most of her actions, afaik do not directly result from her illness. Hell, even knowing some of the shit she's pulled on my buddy-- and I'm talking some manipulative shit I still really like her and actually get her. The Se-Se connection is real.

That to say, I don't think it's necessarily Fi connect as much as it is tert. F and maybe inf F. connected. ENTP, ESTP, ISTJ, INTJ for tert.  INTP, ISTP, ESTJ, ENTJ for inferior.Haha. I'm gonna get an earful but yeah it also does seem like a very INFJ thing to do now that you mention it.

Maybe there's something  to a misplaced pride in or tertiary function. I can see that in myself sometimes.I've definitely had a conversation with close INTP, INTJ and ISTP friends that all recognized their diminished emotional availability compared to the cultural standard for women. The INTJ and ISTP are both done with it in a sort of "fuck everyone else" attitude. The INTP is much more distraught at their lacking. I think that distinction is a much more personal thing, however.

They all realize their distinction from the cultural standard but not in a "special snowflake" kind of way.

I definitely haven't seen an NF woman that doesn't fit the cultural standard like NT women. I think ST women are in a similar boat as NTs but they can blend in better.

Of course I don't have too much to say personally on the standard for women besides what I can say without actually experiencing it.Aww! That means so much to me that you wouldn't read it. =)Sorry, I'm misunderstanding.

Can you rephrase the question?I want to meet INFJs. Ni is fascinating. I know an INTJ fairly well. I'm 90% sure they are INTJ. I feel like I have what I need. 

I've known only one or two people who might be INFJs. I don't know though. The fact that they are apparently typically pretty private people makes me only want to meet some of them more. 

What I perceive to be Ni tends to intrigue me very very deeply. So I'm having a hard time differentiating other intrigue with what I'm getting from Ni. 

Si tends to do it too, but the interest quickly fades because I *get* the person-- at least enough.

Ne intrigues me very deeply too. A lot of the time it just annoys me though. I think this is typical of the 8th function...? Maybe..? 

So yeah. INFJs. Some more ISTPs because they are fun to do stuff with . More ESTPs because they get me. More extraverts in my life in general would be quite nice. People that ~~always~~ usually want to hang out are awesome no matter the type.Wow, also means a lot. I was at least a little worried that some people would take that incoherent babble even semi-seriously. &gt;(showers with accolades)

That's the dream!&gt;Ne dom or aux people are the verbal shitposters

~~Oh shit. Relentless.~~ Savage af.

&gt;ESTPs, from my experience, tend to be the meme brigade who beat dead horses. It's less focused on new unique stuff, and more focused on emphasizing a specific scenario's memeage.

Same.
~~Is "What do you think about theories that relate to?" a coherent sentence in your version of English?~~

~~What's the need for the parentheses? Have I been using them wrong this entire time?~~

~~I thought I shitposted but you definitely have me beat. Instead of being an asshat, you could have answered a genuine question and been the slightest bit helpful.~~

Edit: As I was going to downvote all your comments because I'm petty, I realized that I should actually read your comments because then when you noticed what I was doing I could reply with, "I just think all your ideas are stupid" and be speaking from the heart. However, I got to

&gt;I agree with this- at least at this point in my life or heck, any point. There's something inorganic, I feel about going on dates. Lots of expectations that cloud who the person really is.

And I agreed with it, and so I gave up. It was a **rollercoaster of emotion**, I hated you but then I realized I *am* you or some shit. 

So thanks for the opportunity.I hope it's not too personal to ask but could you explain the dynamic? And what makes it so great?Yeah, I am super interested in duality. I really want an INFJ best friend. I envision it being like really good buddy cop show.I think you're an INFJ, too!

Although that might just be me liking the idea of you as an INFJ.Well I would love to be able to do that but it was deleted..... Typical INFJ. All of the above. Plus you forgot the option that "you felt you over shared."

That's something that has seemed to happen in the INFJ sub. 

Im subscribed to INFJ, ENFJ, INTJ because they have a lot more activity than ESTP. Plus I still don't understand Ni to the extent I would like to.
&lt;3Hammer what on themselves? I'm pretty lost when I read this. 

My experience of Ti is that if I get stuck Ti-Ni anything is possible. I feel like I can convince myself of anything. There is a strong need for Fe values otherwise it's a very short path from regular ESTP to evil ESTP caricature. 

Edit: Also congratulations on being a redditor for two years! Or perhaps it should be condolences. ;)Are INTJs nerds? geeks? 

Also you brought up an interesting point on function pairs that look like other functions. As in Si-Te -&gt; Ti. Or below, Se-Ti -&gt; Te. 

What dom/aux pair can look like Ni? Si? Or do you think that it's only with J functions.  I like the idea of 'distilling' or 'transforming' the dom/aux symbols we have. I guess the transforms would be based upon a purely behavioral and surface-level perspective. I think that could be a helpful tool maybe. 

Or maybe I'm crazy.

I'm envisioning a fancy infographic.
What do you think you are?

Just the sheer annoyance I get from this post probably means Ne in either dom or aux -- I kid.

What is it that makes you think you might be an introvert? Are you completely on the fence? 

This reads like an ENTP to me. I skimmed a couple comments as well, definitely seems like Ti. Also I don't know how Fi is experienced, but Ti is **THE** mental gymnastics function-- which is what it seems you're doing.

I have often felt like I've been a feeler because of my feelings, and how they were coming out more often. Tertiary slot feelings are childish. I think this is the best way to describe it. Would you say that you're 'childish' emotionally? 

***

As far as SJs, they a'ight.  I think it's unfair to look at anyone and assume they have got it all together. 

Are you getting gripped by Si? Are there any ENFPs or ENTPs out there that can describe their experience in the grip of Si?

Exactly yeah. Hammering *does* describe it fairly accurately. 

There is a pretty discrete difference between Sensing and Intuition still. When I look at N preference types, it seems like nothing *is*. Comparing that to myself and other S pref. types, S types tend say something *is* until it *isn't*. It just seems like we don't often acknowledge that distinction. Does that make sense? Does that seem accurate? Thoughts?

I guess I realized I just have thought of Ne as another type of Se when in reality Ne doms think quite differently. Si seems more familiar than Ne.

Se-Ti is more of that 'hammering' into shape. Ti-Ni is a wormhole down to the deepest crevice of my soul. My very existence is called into question. Ni is a helluva drug.
&gt;Then I go home wanting to murder myself for sharing so much.

What's the reasoning behind this, if I may ask? It seems like it seems like an INFJ thing to feel bad for oversharing. I really just *don't get it.* What does that feel like to overshare? Is it fear?Is that how you see us?  Thanks for helping me understand! I think I'm getting it. It also seems to make a lot of sense. 

/u/doggymelons can you relate?&gt;impression that Fi and Fe are less about actual emotions and more about value and moral-based judgement.

Correct. The term emotions is definitely not the most accurate word, but F in a Tert. slot definitely still manifests itself as an emotionally childish person due to the repressed moral-based/people-based judgments. 

So yes what you're saying makes perfect sense-- and I agree. They come from Ni-Fe but Ti tries to enforce them I think? 

I think the childish Ti seems to result in a very hardline stance on things that aren't necessarily based out of empirical logic or proven facts but rather Ni-Fe. Any sort of inconsistency is seen as overwhelmingly opposed to Ti. Regular Ti users seem to value that consistency but it's a lot more refined and nuanced and smoothened by the gritty, rough real world. Where in INFJs, ISFJs it looks like a stubbornness in the face of Te.

The same thing has happened in me, in which things are a certain way, but I have a desire to 'enforce' through Fe. 

Edit: the way tertiary functions manifest is my favourite thing. It connects deeply with POLR as well. What's your type? I tend to find their stubbornness cute since I find myself fairly able to disarm them. 

Something something ESTP charm Tertiary Thinking definitely seems to be pretty damn stubborn. 

Tert Ti / POLR Te is really up there for that. 

I don't know how many people say INFPs ~~are~~ tend to be more stubborn  than INFJs because I think it's super unlikely. Although in my experience INFJs can be more stubborn on meaningless things. Where as INFPs seem to resist things with a little bit more nuance. Probably because Fi is your dominant vs Ti being their tert.

Why did you think you were an INTP? And what is the key factor that made you think you're an ISTP instead?

And what I'm thinking is ISTP, although I really have no idea. You seem a lot coarser around the edges than I would perceive an INTP but less all over the place as well.

Your reasoning seems to be point A-&gt; point B which is more Se than Ne. Ne can seem to include information that tends to seem extraneous to me.

The question on others' perception of you seems to be quite ISTP-esque.

All that to say, if you think you're an ISTP you're probably an ISTP. Not because thinking makes it so but because you know yourself better than anyone here could.You INFJs always having to be different. ;) 

So sure, you can be a chocolate croissant.Why do you think that you're not extraverted?

I definitely can see ENFP more than INFP as I read this. Leading with Pe vs Ji can make a huge difference. I'm not sure where it fits in Jung's framework, but you can be 'less extraverted', if that makes sense. 

*** 

To anyone, I'm actually curious now how the nature of extraversion/introversion fits into the jungian framework. In that one 'paper' the author claims that MBTI claims E/I should be a bimodal distribution which seems to be a strawman. However, I am now quite curious how the E/I spectrum fits into the functions. Is it just a balancing act of J vs P  and E vs I  between dominant and auxiliary?**BETA! BETA! BETA!** 

**HOO HOO HOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Gamma =&gt; bossy

Beta =&gt; Love the hardest

Delta =&gt; calculators

Alpha =&gt; annoying
**BETA! BETA! BETA!** 

**HOO HOO HOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!**oy bass cint&gt;Huh. INTPs are considered alpha by some model? I'll take it. Take that, ETJs! We're the bosses now.

Hah. Poor INTPs. 

Lets discuss this: What is *objectively* the best quadrant? I say Betas, because we have the only types anyone cares about:

ESTPs =&gt; The skilled, funny, good looking winners in life + Donald J Trump

ISTPs =&gt; the mechanics

INFJ =&gt; The gods

ENFJ =&gt; /u/peppermint-kiss

***

What would you do without a mechanic? All your stuff wouldn't work properly if you got someone like an INTP, or even worse an ENTP to work on it! &gt;All your lies.

Now do the beta quadrant!!!! &lt;3I appreciate all the symbolism-- my Ni speaks to me. You somehow made something so stupid something meaningful.
This is sidebar material imo! Same. Perhaps the inferior Ni screaming out..?Who says that and why?Yeah. As a child I was obnoxious, loud, annoying and hyper-active. I remember finishing my work before other students and going to play in my teachers play corner and being as loud as humanly possible. 


I also became very reclusive during my teenage years. I played mmorpgs and stayed up way too late. I didn't get enough sleep and had too much caffeine. I stunted my physical growth and probably my social growth by not really being around people or wanting to. During my teenage years my mom was confused because I used to be so outgoing and fearless as a child. She would remind me of this frequently. Thanks mom.


Now I'd say I also have the Se energy and a general 'presence' that others acknowledge. If I get too wired or excited or tired I can become pretty obnoxious again. However once I realize that my excitement/anxiety is caused by the occasional shitload of caffeine I can try to keep the craziness down. People have often asked me if I have ADHD. It's a nice way of telling someone to shut the fuck up.&gt;ADHD thing when I was a teenager too.

Yeah fuck those boring Si's :(&gt;Speaking for my friend who got a lot of hate on his last post.

Can you show me anyone getting a lot of hate in this sub?

I generally feel like we're pretty civil here. If there's any issues with others it seems to be pretty restrained. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention?

If someone disagrees with you it's not hateful. 

#\#MAKEMBTIGREATAGAINWhy aren't you fan of socionics?Oh so 'friend' not friend. Gotcha.maybeFirst of all, isn't MBTI just the dichotomies? Correct me if I'm wrong. If so, it seems disingenuous to say that MBTI says anything about the functions.

Apart from that, I'm not sure if it's ever okay to simplify Se into 'living in the moment, pleasure-seeking, aesthetics'. I'm not sure if that's how you were trying to come across.

I guess that would mean finding a definitive declaration of the MBTI view on functions vs the view on functions in socionics models. I'm not too sure what sort of literature exists for each.

I think the general knowledge that floats around this subreddit is fairly broad. The model is much less clearly defined as well because everyone has different views on everything. This is what happens when MBTI is a quasi-science (not pseudo). It falls under 'quasi-science' because it's *SO* vague in nature. 

I'm not sure if I agree with the tumblr posts assessments.

Just looking at [this](http://www.socionics.com/prof/infp.htm) description of the INFp I see many many similarities. Many similarities and TBDs. Socionics is very specific while the Jungian framework itself is very nebulous and non-specific. I think we generally try to remain fairly non-specific in this sub too. 

Did I miss something, maybe? Because the INFp and INFJ still look to be the same to me.I left it *very* open ended for a reason. I didn't attempt to define anything because 1) I'm lazy 2) I'm not all that knowledgable 3) I wanted to give room for people to give me their thoughts.

I don't know what Jung's description is. Where would I find that?

I'm looking for how types are different, but I would also care to know if there are any major discrepancies in the functions either. /u/tmz-exclusive  has mentioned functional differences and I would like to explore that further.

Thank you for asking for clarification! It helps others contribute to the discussion more as well I think. 

Hmm, interesting thoughts!

I took a quick look over the Se description. What are your main objections with it? Why do you think it takes some of MBTI Te with it? What *is* MBTI Se?

This description for Se seems much more sharp, but remains accurate to my experiences. 

&gt;As for the website you linked me, I don't know if typing people according to their genes and physical appearance is a good idea...

I would agree with you there.  Although, the ESTP one is spot on for me. The facial features certainly crosses a border I'm not willing to cross.

&gt;ESTps are never afraid to show others that they did not understand or do not know something and therefore never hesitate ask people to repeat or to specify what they said.

They got that right. 

&gt;I really wonder why Fe subtype INFJ sounds so... not inferior Se to me though? Inferior Se means repressing having fun in more blunt words.

I don't know what you're getting at here.

Edit: Whats subtype referring to in socionics?Yes, yes it is.Is Pepsi okay?So then, what do these discrepancies mean on how I should interpret the functions? *Does* it mean anything? 
Well done! As someone who can't tell the difference between an INFJ and ISFJ what is the best way for me to figure someone else out in that regard? What do I look for? What do I ask? &gt;Now this Is just for fun guys

...

&gt;just for fun guys

We don't do that here.Honestly, I want to give understanding this a chance but I have no clue what you're saying. I don't mean to be rude. 

I'm just a simple ESTP. Give me some IKEA furniture and I can do that. Give me a set of rules, sure. Give me a list of options to choose from-- GREAT! I can give my best guess. However, I have no clue what is happening here. Can OP or anyone please descend from the intuitive plane of thinking to explain things on the lowly sensor plane of understanding?

*** 

Here's what I have: MBTI =&gt; Aura =&gt; Our destiny.  That the I/E swap is the sister personality type-- or is it just INFP/ENFP? No people that read auras will see the same colours? What's an aura? I had assumed this was a metaphor.. or symbolism? Do you mean a 'physical' aura? Please halp.

Digging deeper: How do you two have the same aura? Do groups of people have auras? Do you think that Auras are just MBTI groupings? 

Why do you think INFP?

Se - "Just do it!" Lol fuck the lines. I do what I want.I've yet to be 100% that I've met one ever. My opinion is that they don't exist in real life, only on the internet.AllegedlyHey! This is a really cool idea! I definitely enjoy seeing the other responses as well.

I couldn't not choose ISTP for the mechanic though. I've failed all you guys.
For years I thought I was an INTP. I really like having the clearly defined structure-- in the behavior aspect. As terrible as it sounds, I like knowing who I am, and my best role in a group. 

Except there came a point when I clearly wasn't introverted. I took a long thought about it, I googled stuff and figured out by the functions that I was ESTP. Then I came here fascinated by how accurate it seemed when I was actually typed right.

Then there's me.

 http://i.imgur.com/D5rPtNI.jpg Don't stick us ESTPs with those crazies!How does that work?
How is that forgiving then? I'm so confused!Okay well, *hypothetically speaking*, if I had a friend that had an INFJ hate them, what wins? the INFJ doorslam or the ESTP will?

Edit: the friend is also ESTPGunnysack?

What if they are an 'unhealthy' INFJ? What do you do with a nutter like that?How do you break that thinking in someone?I mean how do you get ~~yourself~~ a friend out of the INFJs mental trash can.I hate to make someone not like me, but people are kinda right here. 

&gt;from my point of view that's literally declaring disloyalty/saying "I don't value you as my brother" to my face

How is this the case? Either way, if you feel like that, have you told him this? It's not fair to expect him to do that for you. 

&gt;Only thing that pissed me off is them trying to claim their "logic" as objective.

And that's fine. You just have to be the mature one here and not let it get to you because that's just how Ti users can be sometimes. 


Truthfully, I get the proving your loyalty thing. I like people showing me that they care about me. It really makes me not hate everyone and everything. A person, who is basically a stranger to me (a colleague with whom I just started working) is probably the most emotionally enthusiastic person I know. I'm 100% certain she's an ISFP. She's been the warmest person and nicest person to me this past year when I've been feeling pretty shitty in general. She notices when I seem different and seems to at least care in the slightest about me. All that to say, I think she's great-- and I think you're probably great and I appreciate people like you. That being said, you really gotta not take it so personally. Especially if he doesn't know that it hurts you-- which I'm not sure if you've made clear to him.

So I don't know. It sounds like you expect a lot out of your 14 year old brother, which indicates that you probably care about him a lot. So "ending the brotherhood" seems like a very rash and confusing thing to do. 

I don't know what you want me to say. Sounds pretty shitty, and it sounds like you're upset. I just encourage you to remember how great you are when you're not upset, and how great your brother is when he's not upset and just take some time to cool down.

And are you sure he's an ESFP? Because it sounds like there is a large disconnect here which I would imagine is less likely with an ESFP-ISFP.

I mean the doorslam. If an INFJ door slams you, how do you change the mind on those crazy psycho weirdos? 

This is what the forgiving but not forgetting reminds me of. Doorslamming someone but pretending you haven't.I don't know I believe that. I think you're gonna have to post pics of you with a beard or a mullet or a mustache or a leather jacket with spikes or a knife or a Bengal with a gold leash or of you killing a puppy.*Hurtful hurtful* sarcasm. Same with INTJs.&gt;It had to do with my beliefs.

Is what they were getting at I think.http://i.imgur.com/TnQRX6v.mp4


From http://www.celebritytypes.com/estp-description.php
&gt;"There is nothing impossible to him who will try."Hmm. Why ESTJs? I think INTJs are a pretty standard answer here, but I'm interested to hear what you have to say about ESTJs?
Dude! We're the same. ESTP 7w8 ~~21~~20m. I do that too. I have a hard time holding grudges like /u/mashmysmash  said I just get so warmed by people when I'm mad at them and then suddenly like them again-- they are all surprised and happy. Making up is the best feeling ever.As we've discovered that INFJs tend to also be quite stubborn. If you had doorslammed someone--- but then later realized that you were kind of an asshole, would that move you to make amends? Or would it be too difficult to overcome that Ni-Ti loop?

^^^^I ^^^^just ^^^^want ^^^^the ^^^^pain ^^^^to ^^^^go ^^^^away. =(

But.. but... but.....You do realize how crazy that sounds right? I love it. Feel free not to answer, but how old are you? Are you a guy or girl? And what has your experience been with doorslamming people?Did you to that on purpose or is that the Baader-Meinhof effect?What's more of a system? You lost me.&gt;I work with a few people and if someone comes and complains that their coffee is bad they take it way too personally, and then for the next 8 hours they will talk about how that customer is stupid and they didn't make a mistake.

Does the coworker you hate do this?

&gt;There are people who if you cross them just once they will write you off forever.

&gt;I had someone really hurt me in the past and I knew I couldn't stoop to their level and get revenge. I was so angry and there was nothing I could do. It took me almost a year to let it go.

=(. What did they do? Did you ever uncut them out? My initial curiosity has devolved into me figuring out the 'doorslam' and the fine line that is 'forgiving but not forgetting'.

&gt;I think it could apply to any type, it's just a matter of what they can't let go.

Yeah I agree. I know ESTPs may have the tendency to take things way too far just because we can. 


&gt;I think it could apply to any type, it's just a matter of what they can't let go.

Maybe. There's a lot of people saying it's INFJs or INTJs. It might be because there are a lot of INTJs and INFJs around though. Maybe it's not type related and every person is just sucky at letting stuff go. 

What'd she do?&gt;gunnysackersSo not letting it go is more of a function of Ni then it seems is what seems to be suggested?I don't smoke-- but I've always wanted to. So cool. 

Also, nicotine can potentially have nootropic effects. 

I don't know if I could ever shut someone out of my life for doing something to me. Usually all it takes is a sorry to really make me not hate someone. Like a real sorry, none of that "sorry but.." shit. 

You doorslam people? What's that like?What if ~~I~~ my friend ~~don't~~ doesn't know what ~~I~~ they did?I feel that totally. Maybe I've been an INFJ this whole time. ;)

&gt;I think this is probably enneagram related, but INxJs tend to either forget/ignore or completely ice the person out. No middle ground. 

Which enneagrams would you guess have trouble letting go the most?

I've found I have trouble caring after I go to sleep -- for most things at least. 

&gt;ISxJs tend to hold onto specific events/occurrences and never, ever forget. I've gotten laundry lists of everything I've done wrong in the past however many months (or years...) from strong Si types.

All you IXXJs are crazy. Why can't y'all be more like us ESTPs?!

Weird. :O.

Is this a language thing? Are you guys from the UK?Nah it's TPs. Ti is pretty damn funny.Why can't we all just have flairs like mine?

As in, why can't we all just be ESTPs and get along?We do pseudoscience here, but like, this is a pretty bold claim without a source.Fair enough! Thanks.Aren't you an INTJ? Damn, you must really hate yourself.We all know it's ISTPs that are the true robots though anyways, not INTPs. =)

I find that interesting. It might have been fairly weak coffee. It's fair to assume that that was at least ~300mg though.

I've been getting more sensitive to caffeine recently. Although I've consumed up to a gram at a time, anything beyond 200mg makes me appear manic.

I'm a completely obnoxious asshole. It's like my Ti goes to sleep and I force myself into a Se amplified loop with Fe.

What about alcohol? I think you should do it. Even if you're typed wrong. What's the worst that could happen

All these boring play-it-safe INTPs. Just do it!!You're totally an ESFP. Hug meh brotha!!

Edit: What type do you normally get while doing tests? PM me if you don't want others to know. Interesting. Thanks for the reply! 

Do you think being drunk while acting sober is a skill that's learned?

I remember the first time I was drunk and I just felt like my personality amplified. I feel like my drunk self is the person I wish I was more often. Taking chances, not giving a duck. If I may ask, what kind of meds?

I'm fascinated because caffeine typically does the opposite in most people. In myself it makes me much more anxious.I feel you. 

I didn't use to feel this way when I had a little bit of caffeine. I'm 21 and I have had coffee/caffeine regularly since I was 16. To be fair, I almost certainly fucked my growth due to poor sleeping from the caffeine and just general quality of life stuff. However, recently I've noticed effects like you have. 

My hands and feet get all cold and clammy. I actually take L-Theanine to quell some of the jitteriness and anxiety. It makes caffeine feel a lot better in general. This is from caffeine anhydrous tablets.

I find with coffee, all the other shit in there tends to make me a bit more mellow.

I definitely like the jitters though. Maybe it's because I'm an ESTP! What type are you?We need to follow up with more Ni doms.Go get some caffeine tablets from a nearby drugstore. It's expensive considering you can get a kilogram for like 50 dollars but you're paying for convenience. Anyways, just try it. 

You can monitor intake much easier than with coffee-- however coffee *may* have anti-depressive effects. 

Caffeine is a nootropic, plus it feels fucking great. Caffeine is like overclocking your computer but your brain-- if you do it right you won't change the lifespan at all.

And don't bother with alcohol. It's over-hyped. All about feeling good! UPPERS.

http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html is one of the ones I've seen recommended on various subs.As an INTJ, are you a fairly anxious individual?

Do you smile a lot? I know an INTJ and she always smiles in resting position otherwise she's got a serious case of RBF. She tends to look kind of tense and anxious and 'busy'. Feel free to deem this too personal, but how does the medication affect your personality? I know very little about schizophrenia but I'm definitely curious of how the medication affects you within the context of your MBTI. 
Do it. I'm your friendly neighbourhood ESTP.

And coffee is.... An acquired taste. It's like beer, you're a strange person  if you enjoy your first cup of coffee. The best you can hope for is 'okay'.

And yeah I'm telling you to drug yourself. Millions of people can't be wrong right? More importantly, you trust me don't you? We're friends right? Friends trust friends.

In all seriousness, there is something wrong with the way society treats drugs in general. The haphazard use of caffeine is indicative of that. Caffeine can really change your life just like any substance with repeated use.A Festival DJ making my own music. Fuck ghost writers. 

I definitely feel I could learn to produce. It definitely seems like one of those lottery professions-- like being an astronaut. It takes some skill but a lot of luck. I guess that's most of everything in life though.something something INFJs are magical&lt;3&gt;Flair baitThe way it should be in 'murica.Does it work the other way? 

That I'm actually an introvert who externalizes to avoid the deadness inside? 

Wallflowers? I thought ISFPs were just slightly more bearable ESFPs.Yeah. Pretty much that. Think about how weird INTJs are but then turn it up to 11. INFJs are weirdos. When someone says they are INFJ but they are a relatively 'normal' person I have a problem. 

This thought has spawned my first official weirdest type rankings GO!!!!

Oh god.. is it fatal?Are you also an E7?I'm joking. I haven't seen too much ESFP hatred, to be honest either.Do the others as well please! You've given me insight into the mind of Ni, Si and Fi doms.
Yes yes I have. They love me. I'm sure you have noticed but each of those four types are in each of the quadra.

ESFJ - Alpha

ENFJ  - Beta

ESFP - Gamma

ENFP - Delta

The easiest way at this point seems by classification of quadra. The groupings, I think, are the best behavioral indicator we have with MBTI. 

They are quite excitable, and more warm enthusiastic than ESTPs. I believe ESTPs tend to be more 'cold' enthusiastic about things. 

I think reading through the quadra would be the best way to figure their type out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucz9eV7Eh0sWhat are you...? An INTP? Geez man.No....?
So now you're a 40 year old trapped in a 40 year olds body?

And did you generally enjoy high school? Compared to the rest of life?

What type was your best friend?School was a breeze and still is. I was the "smart kid" that annoyed the smart + ambitious kids because they'd be annoyed that I would get better marks than them while not trying. I test very well. I learn how to do things fairly quickly I feel.

Not very popular. My group of friends are the kind of awkward kids.   Video games mostly.

I wasn't too close with anyone in the fairly large group. I'm pretty shit at making friends. I got closer after leaving since I went to university right after and would always skype while playing League of Legends with those guys.

Annoying I guess? It makes me feel like an ENTP because ESTPs aren't supposed to be annoying. I think I'm less annoying now. I really enjoy bothering people-- always have. Recently I have started to really want to not make my friends hate me. 

People didn't hate me or anything but I'm kind of a keep-at-arms-length type of person, I guess.  

I was the shitty non jock annoying ESTP kid. Super loud, can be obnoxious, fun person. Lazy under achiever. Wow you're Mr.(Ms??) popular. How big was the school? How long did you know this group of people? I ask because I knew the people I went to school with for 9 years (K - Grade 9) and it creates a very interesting bond--- especially in a smaller school. 

What's a close friend in your opinion? Where's that threshold?So.... Can you elaborate? How high was the window? What stopped you from defenestration?What are you like now? How much is the same, how much is different?I wonder how many ENTP/INFJ couples there actually are. Especially since ENTP/ISFJ is a dual relationship--- and ISFJs look pretty much like INFJs and always think they are INFJs. I wish I could meet an INFJ to verify. I don't know how many online INFJs are actually INFJs. I wouldn't expect more than 50% as an upper bound. What are guy INFJs like? Are they all emotionally like INFJs are supposed to be? Or emotionless like guys are supposed to be? 

I'm wondering about a friend of mine, who I could never type. But, why? I don't get it. But we all know INFJs are batshit crazy perfectionist weirdos or they could be. I feel more confused the more people write about the mystical INFJ.Fuck, marry, kill? ESTP, INFJ, INTJ.

Fuck, marry, kill? ESTP, INFJ, INTJ.

=)You know what. I think that's a fair thing to say despite the downvotes. That male INFJs are less likely to be mistyped because there's no societal pressure for a man to be an INFJ. I want to abuse benzos despite the numerous warnings on the internet not to.ESTP 

I'm mostly listening to music.  There's some head bobbing and hand waving.

So my phone, or forward. I glance at people, if they are also glancing at me I initiate eye contact and a smile. That smile feels creepy, however but I know the other person sees the intention of the smile. I look at people that may or may not be attractive and try to figure out if their face is attractive or not. It's amazing how much clothes can change someone's overall attractiveness. I will try to mimic good posture because mine is such shit. 

Sometime's I pretend like on acid or something and look at trees and shit in wonder and everything like seeing it's the first time. There's a feeling that really comes over me that is almost actual wonder. Pretending like that makes me happier too because it goes from an act to actually appreciating the world around me. So literally everything in those times.
I *really* like the switch of **sensor =&gt; tangible-oriented thinking** and **intuitive =&gt; associative thinking**. It's a lot more *tangible* and *functional*.  

As well the switches of **thinking =&gt;Task-oriented thinking** and **feeling =&gt; Social-oriented thinking** are also good.

&gt;There need to be more invesigations on this topic but for now it‚Äôs more accurate to think that the auxilary function is just T, F, S or N withount specifying whether it is Te ot Ti, etc.

Ah, here come the deviations.

It appears there is an attempt to subdivide the functions to be more descriptive.  This, in turn, appears to make the model *significantly* more complex but much more specifically accurate. Arguments can be made whether the benefit is enough. Personally, I would tend to favour a simpler model-- as the one auxiliary type suggests. 

It seems that while the dominant function is 'locked in' the auxiliary type is a much less strong preference of attitude. This doesn't disagree with my previous understanding of MBTI. MBTI simply simplifies the theory past a point and begins to degrade accuracy for simplicity. 

That being said, I still don't like the "intermediate types" ideas even if it adds more precision to the system. It seems like an necessarily complex addition even if it is truer to the source material.

&gt;The existence of fully intermediate types (like Ne-[FT], [SeNe]-T, [NeTe]-dom) is still an open question. In some cases, it is not even clear what these intermediate types mean from the point of view of Jung cognitive functions.

Also this.

**I'm of the opinion that this is sidebar material and is VERY useful for bridging the gap in MBTI / socionics-- because they're basically the same, no matter what anyone says.** Good post. Perhaps someone (maybe me) could essentially rewrite this nice and formatted in a reddit post so it *could* actually be put in the  sidebar. Also, I think then that would welcome a lot of interpretation and flow of information from some of the more articulate, knowledgeable people on this board. Basically: This is sidebar material but I'm too lazy/dumb to actually write something unpacking all these ideas.

What I'm gathering is that INFJs are "nice weirdos". Accurate in spite of how vague?

I just wanna be able to pick an INFJ out in a crowd :[

There's this girl I know and for the love of me I can't even ball park the type aside. IXXJ. She stares into the distance a shit ton. I can't read her at all. So frustrating.Yeah. Benzos are the "The Hangover" drug. They cause amnesia, and they get you more than sufficiently fucked up. Mixing with alcohol is probably the worst thing you can do too. Yet I really wanna try it. Sharks are killing machines so ISTP. Bears in the other hand are more outgoing do ESTP. Lions are more majestic and are thus ENTJ.Paris Hilton and INFJ. Whattt.

I don't know what I'm looking for, tell me what I'm looking for.Why would they want to do that? I don't understand the implication.Here we go. This is *my* kind of thread.

F/M/K

1)ISTP/ESFJ/ENTJ

2)INTP/ISFJ/ENFP

3)ESTP/INFJ/ENTP

This is a tough one because I would love to choose INTJ for both F and M over the other two. I reluctantly choose to kill ISTJ.

4)INFP/INTJ/ISTJ

5)ENFJ/ESFP/ESTJ

This is also a tough one. Sorry ISFP =(

6)ESTP/INTJ/ISFP

7)ENTP/ENFJ/ESTJ

8)ESFP/INFJ/INFP

9) INTP/ISTJ/ENTJ

10) ISTP/INTJ/ENFP

11)ENTP/ISFP/ESFJ

12) ISFJ/ESTP/INFP


Overall this was fairly easy. I think I'm pretty predictable with my choices

Is that a challenge?But INFJ is dual. Ultimate fulfillment is promised in those or something.I believe in the sanctity of socionics duality.My answers change significantly depending on who's who. If you're the INFP F or M always ;) unless you're up against /u/kbnation.That's really interesting that that's the case.

For each one I just thought of someone I thought might be the type and tried to then abstract them to the type. 

Yes they seem to resonate with me-- If I knew what the hell an INFJ was.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LdxgPYCTKEAttentive. Do you think this word would then be an 'INFJ' trait? I mean other's can obviously be attentive, but there's a couple people that I'm thinking of. I had thought they were INFJs prior to noticing how uncomfortably attentive they are. It's a nice sort of discomfort though. 

Do you think ISFJs would tend to come across as attentive?Ne - Tend to be all over the place. Hate to 'box' in a group-- but they are the brainstormers. As an Se dom, these people ~~are~~ tend to be pretty spacey. They typically bring a lot of energy, having an extraverted perception rather than an introverted one. These are big picture, idea people. Ne is associative thinking at it's finest.

Se - Control is something that comes to mind. Handling the situation. Tangible-oriented thinking. There is a desire to get a full picture like Ne, but Ne seems to seek through abstractions and going big picture. Se tends to be specifics oriented.

Ne can tend to ramble on unimportant things, and Se may overlook related ideas and deem them irrelevant and be too focused on the tangibility. This,  I think may be a sensor vs intuitive thing. Of course, *why* this is the case is a whole different thing.

One of the things I hate is how intuitive preference types always neglect the major downfalls of N-dom. Often the preference is painted as N types being big picture, creative types while S types are the small picture, uncreative types. 

At the highest, out-of-balance (by aux function) end of the spectrum, Ne will be useless and Se will be tunnel-visioned. What it seems like is Ne users tend to be hesitant to commit to an idea.

As the other poster has said, Se can come across as aggressive, 'real', straight-forward. Se is easily understood in the words that are being said. Ne users can interact in a way that n

I would never say Ne is 'more charismatic' but there is a certain non-offensiveness about Ne. 

***

I just kind of let myself go on here trying to recount my experiences with Ne/Se. I agree that the MBTI jargon often resorts to phrases that have become cliched and meaningless. I think that I tried to definitely describe the polarized situation, but you have to keep in mind that the preferences of the auxiliary and other functions *definitely* change how Ne looks. A well balanced ENTP can look *very* similar to ESTP.





That was a trick question. 

The fact that you aren't considering yourself to be another type all the time proves you're an ESTP.

Welcome to the club! /s

Seriously though, what does Se look like to you? What about other Ne users? What has your experience with Se doms vs Ne doms?One thing I've noticed about myself is that I have a strong value for the overall vision. I prefer grandiose displays, and large, overarching, ever-present meaningfulness in everything. 

That said, it doesn't mean I'm good at it. It doesn't mean that in my life I will be acting out of that deep personal desire. To oversimplify things: our dominant/auxiliary preference will be what we're 'good' at. It will be our main schtick-- our thing. 

Too often I feel like I've seen intuitives attempt to become more tangibly-oriented. It makes me uncomfortable-- specifically with poor displays of Si--- whereas poor displays of Se are somewhat endearing. The only way I can explain the latter is dom/inf duality. 

But when an Ne/Si types tries to get into it with their inferior/tert. Si it seems unnecessarily focused on the details. It seems to miss the real reality of the situation-- the relevant tangibles. 

I can only assume that when I attempt to Ni it up, I bother the shit out of Ne types as well.

So what I mean to say is that that kind of question reeks of Ne. Surely it may be possible, but what we're good at and what we want to be good at may conflict. If all of our preferences are equal, is there any preferences?

Again-- super rambly, and anecdotal. Well said. The types are poles in this system. I think there is a problem with tunneling onto a function at a time. I think the smallest chunk of this model (as well as any of the branches) that we should ever look at is the dom/aux combo. Unless we're analyzing small children(even then, I'm not sure), everyone uses dom/aux together. Boom. /thread.

Well said. 

How does that then change with order of preference? Se-Ni vs Ni-Se?Yes, I believe Se is easily typed. Although that may be because I'm an Se dom. I have trouble seeing Si from Ni. 

I think Si preference types (aux or dom) can be very very similar looking in certain situations. I think that Se-Ti can look like Si-Te. What adds personality to the situation is actually the use of Fi vs Fe and Ne vs Ni. 

I think it would be accurate to do that, yes. 

I'm truly fascinated by our Pi functions. It almost seems as if that's where we find who we are. 

I find it extremely difficult to try and pick out individual functions and understand them individually.
Nah this makes sense. Very very good job, dude.

What about Ne-Si vs Ni-Se? I think with a similar format this would be a good cheat sheet.&gt;(since i find wandering speculation without assigning weight, irritating)!

Same. Who'da thunk it? ;) Also, Ni/Se seems to be a lot more bearable than Ne/Si. I don't know why.  It's like Ni/Se is cute, and intriguing where Ne/Si is stupid. That's just me generalizing my experience. 

I feel like I've noticed Ne doms getting equally frustrated with me. 

Why is this the case? Why!!! How does it connect?!!?!?! What does this mean about the universe? 

Also, what happened to your flair? What's your type?http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra

The quadra take this into account and are more applicable than the generalizations of MBTI-- whether or not MBTI Si == Socionics Si.I'm in a very similar situation. 

My professor is an older INTP (95% on that)--- which makes me the supervisor. I definitely recognize the power dynamic when I think about it. It has resulted in me being without as much direction as I need. This was my own fault for not making my needs clear.

What has happened so that the relationships go bad? 

From my experience in both positions, there is a sense of appeasement. The one being supervised feels as if they need to appease the supervisor. Is this the experience you've had?

I can only imagine the problem, as an INFJ would be that you're not vocal enough. Try to give more verbal affirmations and acknowledgment, maybe?

I really have no idea though until you describe the dynamic a little more specifically.

As a side note, what is your field? 

Also, =(.INTJs. The power and confidence they tend to exude is addictive. 

Yeah I think I'll resonate this theory. OP seems super ISTP.

Also, when did you realize you were an ENTP? Weren't you thinking that you were ESTP, or is that my imagination?

Also, are you 100% sure they are not ESTJ? Because that is a conflicting relation with INFJ.

In the case of the supervisor/supervisee, I've found those relationships to be fairly easy to maintain. They may not be the most comfortable but they don't necessarily produce conflict.

Do they describe what the bad attitude looks like? or any specifics?

From my very vague understanding of INFJs is that when they open up, they tend to be extremely opinionated. The opinions can sometimes appear to be out of thin air. It's very clear why INFJ/ESTJ is conflicting. ESTJs tend to need an explanation and a clear thought process.

As an ESFJ I would assume that it would be quite easy to bond over Fe, as that would come fairly naturally. Perhaps the university setting forces the relationship to interact on a T basis? In that case, couldn't you just be actively, intentionally friendly? Are you a masters student or a TA for a course? Or if undergrad, is it a small course?

Actively try to reach out and be friends if it's in a more personal setting. If it's a big class, you probably just need to try to make it clear that you want to make space for others (if  they are 100% ESFJ).

If they are ESTJ it would be much more difficult to work with.&gt;I remember on the ENFP forum a bunch of people saying that it felt right to use Te, but they're under the impression that they pick and choose when they "unleash" this inner skill. 

You *had* to pick the example that would set me off. I've had experience with this and it's not fun. This ENFP I knew was in an authority position. She was somehow aimless and spacey and nebulous but at the same time extremely rigid and boxed in. The bearable nuance of Te pref. types was obliterated. Without the nuance, Te is extremely frustrating for me. Being in a position of authority this was made me unable to ignore this.

It's so hard to describe too though. I didn't like them as a person. Their personhood can be somehwat characterized by MBTI, I believe but it doesn't describe *them* in completeness. So while it would be unfair to judge all ENFPs based on this terribly frustrating person, the 'feel' of the relationship would likely carry on. There are so many variables and factors in relationships that the complexity of them cannot be fully described, obviously. 

I really liked the idea that the 16 types are the poles of the system (or zeros?). 

&gt;His humor is funny and he definitely has Fe, but the knowledge of appropriateness that you see in ExFJs isn't there at all.

Good example. I definitely was considering being an F-preference type for a while because of being in a similar situation. It isn't until something blows up that you realize that you're not as good at emotions n' shit as you think.

One of the common ones I see are ISFJs and INFJs (maybe) that think they are so 'logical'. There's a satire flow chart that references that. This belief is one that makes it *very* hard to tell the  ISFJs and INFJs apart.

What type are you? Also what does introverted Drake mean?

Everything **is** intertwined. Woah, dude.

Also, great post. I have nothing else to add, or ask clarification on. Very well said.

What has your experience been of Ni tert. users?  
&gt;though I know a few ISFJs who tend to blank face instead of smiling. INFJs either look sort of shy/detached or like, really goofy, almost over expressive.

It's these kinds of things that make me unsure on ISFJ vs INFJ again.

I know three people that are almost certainly IXFJ. They all seem so similar to me. IXFJ 1 is a girl who always seems to be thinking about something. Genuinely seems to care and be present in conversations. Very soft. I'm genuinely unsure what their opinion is on anything. Fairly expressive facially. 

IXFJ 2 is a guy who feels very much the same. We seem to be more on the same page with things. He seems to agree with me a lot more clearly. He is much less expressive. Also seems to care what I have to say.

IXFJ 3 hates my guts at the moment, but is extremely facially expressive. Very very goofy. On first impression appeared very snobby and judgmental. The most opinionated out of the three. 

They all seem to care what I have to say which is confusing. For some reason, in person, IXXJs seem unnecessarily fascinated by me. It's actually really weird. 

***

I would definitely believe that Si/Ne can appear more soft than Ni/Se. I find myself wondering whether or not anyone but Se doms are actually listening though.Those people are little bitches.I dislike Se being the physical function or being a thrill seeking function.

Se is concerned with the present context. Whatever the topic is, I need to understand it in terms of what's happening here and now. Either with me personally or with society and the world. 

Being based in, and concerned with the present context will then lead to the thrill seeking and sports and shit, and a better "presentness" but that isn't Se itself.

As for INFPs understanding of Se it's almost a non value. Doing is not a primary concern, is what I'm to believe. The relevancy to the immediate context is not important to INFPs, if I'm to believe the theory.

For Fi, I definitely hate "special snowflake" syndrome. I hate individualizing shit. I especially hate it if it appears to be ignoring the immediate context.

You mention that you go with the flow. Why? Why do you think you'd usually be down to go with the flow?Well I mean they seem similar but they have different 'feels'. If that makes sense. 

&gt;Hence why INxJs seem more ISxP and ISxJs seem more INxP.

I guess. 

&gt;you talked about in your one post

As soon as I type things they are literally gone forever from my mind. Something about yelling into the abyss or something.

I guess I'll just say they're all INFJs because they're a bunch of weirdos.

&gt;INFJs are more preachy but generally more closed off and less talkative, they're conclusion driven and utterly disinterested in anything that is judged as irrelevant. ISFJs are not as quick or likely to judge something as irrelevant and is always more cautious with dismissing or accepting anything, preferring to break things down in smaller pieces with certainty of the details rather than jumping to sweeping conclusions and risking to cherry pick the details to fit their conclusion.

 I definitely know #3 the best, then #2 then #1 of the three people I mentioned previously. #1 doesn't seem like the type of person to be preachy but I really couldn't tell from how little I feel like I know them. 


***

I guess I know what Se-dom/Ni-dom interactions are like more or less. What about Ne/Si? I would probably have to ask someone else though. 




Do they? I think "losing yourself" is everyone's Pi function.

*Why* someone loses themselves is dependant on the other functions And personal experience, I guess.

I don't find myself getting too into something too often but if I do there's no coming back. Inferior Pi is the rabbit hole.

I would imagine Si doms and Ni preferers are better at healthily immersing themselves in worlds whereas others have a greater chance of truly losing themselves, and going too far. What do you mean?

INTP: Ti-Ne-Si-Fe
INFP: Fi-Ne-Si-Te

INTPs seem to like to entertain any idea. There's no moral limits to asking why. Ti wants to know why, it wants to understand the framework and then manipulate it. "Why?" 

By pessimistic I can only assume you mean they are stressed, and perhaps 'in the grip'? Because outside of the grip, the difference is night and day. Where INTPs will tend to be clueless about atmosphere, and things like sentimentality, an INFP will have a vast understanding of it. What matters, and what's valued is how it pertains to them. Unlike the apparently selfishness we seem to attribute to Fi-- there is a great amount of nuance. 

Example: An INFJ using Ti may use it to come to the conclusion that, "I'm wrong and you're right". However a more experienced, nuanced user, like an INTP will come to a more complex, and accurate to real life understanding. 

With INFPs, you'll see an INTJ have the possibility of over-individualizing values. Sometimes things that are important and emotional to them will be overvalued in the scheme of things. It's much more binary than what an INFP would understand and judge in a situation with Fi. 

So an INFP even if 'dark' will simply be a lot more emotional-- they may not express it, but their understanding of sentimentality should be more complex than that of an INTP.  An in the grip INFP will be an obnoxious jerk that overestimates Te-based values, as well as Si perceptions.



Fot ucking spon.
That's what losers say! ;)Easy. Domination of some sort.

When my INTJ is all anal and frustrated and bossy it's actually super hot. Somehow it simultaneously bothers the shit out of me.

In a more general sense, when the baby-Se becomes evident it's a *really* cute thing. Yeah, but if you stick with it, it becomes endearing. It's about exposure with you INFJs ;)Unless that RBF is your thing.Get your heart broken.

Gotta teach your tertiary Fe a lesson.Nope never.Yes. 

There is certainly correlation. Only dumb people would reject that. However, Your type doesn't make you who you are as far as we know. Like really, Myers-Briggs Type **INDICATOR**. 

Surprised that they're wrong--- INFJ? INTP? Yeah I was just throwing out two common types and hoping you would be amazed at the guess.Not many. 

I actually googled "ESTP Characters" to jog my memory. Not many people actually resonate with me.

&gt;I heard mannequins are ESTP.

&gt;Here's a strange thought....

&gt;Jesus a ESTP?


-From [here](http://personalitycafe.com/estp-forum-doers/28862-famous-fictional-estps.html)

Jesus was totally an ESTP and I'm glad this guy gets it on PC. 

In all seriousness, I feel like Barney Stinson despite having a better childhood I feel like I can relate to the disconnect he has. He just doesn't get it in the same way I just don't get it. 

Most ESTPs in any sort of stories are just used as side characters because I think we initially look like caricatures of real people. They usually don't make it past the stage of existing as sketches. Barney, however gains a lot of depth and is much more relatable.

Archer as well. Archer because he's hilarious but he's surrounded by angry sticks-in-the-mud. 

Pretty much every other type is a stick-in-the-mud, unfortunately. Se is master race.Really hard to tell from texts. What is she like in person? 

I definitely get the INTP-vibe to be honest. I've only known one other INTP and she was a she. Very awkward and strange, one of the friendliest people I've met. She tried stupidly hard to care well since she often felt like she was not as emotionally equipped as others. That's the inferior Fe for you. Sounds like it could be the same with this girl, and with you only having a slight preference at tertiary, you don't recognize the 'roughness' of the Fe.


There's not enough information given here. The unneeded apology, in my opinion, is a low stack F thing rather than a high stack, however. It could be argued either way though. That being said, it's your opinion that she has never been rude-- which might just be your ENTP-ness. She could have thought you thought she was rude and then apologized just in case. So anythings possible. 

It's hard to type from behavior accurately as many people have said before, especially when there's very little foreshadowing to the actual motivations behind the actions.  Even if you could take a guess at her thought process it would help us. However, I'm sure if you could do it you'd be able to type her yourself. ;)Introverted perception...? Although I'm leaning towards what Komatik said.

Edit: Although it might actually be introverted judgment on second thought. I used to have that feeling a LOT in my teens when I would have been developing Ti.

Is it possible you are currently in the stage in your life in which you're developing your Ji? I'm just taking a shot in the dark here. 

For reference. Dom: 0-10, aux: 10-20, tert: 20-40(?), inferior: 40-dead.

Although I'm not sure on any of this. It's possibly all just bullshit I've made up.What type are you?

I have the same thing for a girl I know too.

I settled on ESTP. The reason was that the ESFP guy I know is a lot more sentimental in nature. His emotions are more complex at this point in time. 

I think it gets harder to type as we get older since there's less contrast.

This girl I know, at this point has coarse, simple emotions. They can often seem extreme. I resonate with it, because I've been there. Our emotions can seem over the top, but that's usually not how they are. Unless they are extreme but we don't recognize it because what the duck is self understanding.

With the ESFP I know he's a lot more competent at understanding his feeling.

Obviously it's hard to really know for sure without an explicit understanding of their reasoning.

***

Obviously for some tips, if they seem over the top with emotion, both happy and angry ask them why. If it seems small, it's possible that they're an ESTP. I think our understanding of feeling depends very much on what happens.

With ESFPs the emotions are clearly more internally defined and likely more controlled. 

And as for T, ESFP will often take what's around them externally and conform to that for what they think makes sense. They can seem to have rules for how things should be. If you ask them why, that's just the way it is(things will never be the sameüé∂üé∂). If you ask an ESTP why they think a way it'll come from self.

Good quote:

&gt;Te-Fi wants to think right and feel independently while Ti-Fe wants to feel right and think independently

Paraphrased from /u/blueottersocksHow young is young? And describe "no problem".Are you referring to yourself? 

Also the ages were just guesstimates. I'm not actually sure what you disagree with-- the ages or the idea that there tends to be a period in peoples lives where they develop certain functions. The latter would be a lot more difficult to argue. 

In fact, I don't really know what the point of specifying just INTJs was. The ranges I gave were to enclose maybe 90% of the population. Again, I haven't got my calculator with me, and it's been a year since I took a stats class.

What hearkens back to what? 
Pretty sure that's anyone but alphas. ;)Hi again!

I think it's really relative. Going down the functional stack the expressions of each of the functions become more crude. So by the relative crudeness, and coarseness. 

I've started to try and adopt a more complete functional model within my mind. You'll notice that a lot of people like to talk about the functions individually when attempting to understand someone. However, I strongly believe that you will not be able to get a good typing of someone then. Especially since we are changing in time (see: developing our functions). 

I'm of the opinion that 'perfectly' developed people are only four. As in, the limit of our personalities, at least in this model, are alpha type, beta, gamma and delta. However, each of the four types in the quadra start from different initial conditions. 

So I think typing has to start from a point of the perception vs judgment axis. When considering someones type, they are coming from a point in life that may be 'ahead' or 'behind' your personal development. When I look at another ESTP who is more 'developed' than me, I think they would appear to be typing as who knows what. *They would look like an ESTP but they clearly are more 'feely' so maybe ESFP, but they don't look like it so ENFP.* 

I'm willing to distill MBTI even further, because I think with the bigger boxes the quadra provide, we can begin to understand someone else's type much more clearly, and then understand them as a ESTP that's got a nuanced Fe rather than an ENTP because ESTPs are all dumb.



Also ENTP now? :oCan you link it? I can't find it....what? I think you're misunderstanding me.Oh. What do you type as now? 

Why is this labelled socionics? Is there an MBTI name for the types that share the same functions? You're an ISTP. 

http://i.imgur.com/IZPcV.gifInferior Se types: INFJ, INTJ
Inferior Te types: INFP, ISFP

Inferior Se looks like inaction despite wanting to take it. It looks like wanting to do and be rather than simply existing within ones own head. Se (and Ne) are about seeing the world as it is, and understanding the intricate systems that may exist. Se understands through concrete, tangible means. As such, even though the INFJ and INTJ want to understand this through what is happening, often times there may not be a very accurate picture of reality. They also may overestimate what they see or inaccurately see it. Only through failure and practice can we 'git gud' at our inferior functions. When the INFJ and INTJ refine their inferior function Se can work i conjunction with Ni to understand how they fit into the world.

Inferior Te is a crude understanding of the world and how it works. The world is a shitty place, full stop. This, is at least often the conclusion people come to. I know an ISFP, and I see this very clearly in her. All banking is evil. All of wall street is corrupt. Money is evil. Rich people are all terrible people. It's a black and white judgment on the world. It's often manifest as a negative judgment because reality is fairly negative-- however it seems to become inflated within her perception. 

Inferior Te also leads to misunderstanding logical context. As the preference is over Ti, users with high Ti can appear wrong to the point of confusion to low Te users. It may be difficult for something to be 'right' (logically) in one instance but not another. 

***

I can really only talk about Se, I feel, accurately since I'm speaking out of a place of experience. As for Te, it's hard for me to fully 'get' how people think with it since I prefer not to think that way, but Ti instead.
Sounds like an INFJ--maybe you're an INFJ?

How much do you know about the functions? What about the quadra? 

The quadra are really good to use to compare behaviorally because they basically highlight the most core differences of people whereas the types make it a little more ambiguous. 

More important question: How do you relate to each other? Does she have the same 'feel' as you? You seem to recognize a difference with this post so I suspect not.

I know that when I'm around ESTPs there's a natural connection that's made. I've realized that others tend to recognize it as well-- but then hate the person for being like themselves. With ESTPs this isn't really the case. Anyways, do you feel the same as her? Or similar but different on a core level?

A lot of this reads super INFJ-y.  I'm super surprised no one else said anything about it.

***

And to be honest, I get a little annoyed even if it's true when people point out how we're all individuals and that everyones unique and blah blah blah. ESTPs have the 'fuck special snowflake syndrome' syndrome. So that might just be that talking-- but I refuse to not at least *attempt* to apply an understanding of jungian psychology to this.  Everyone *is* unique, however, but not so complex that we can't at least 'fit a curve' (so to speak) to what we see. 
The quadra are just the four possible function combinations you can have ignoring preference order.

Alpha: ENTP, INTP, ISFJ, ESFJ
Beta: ESTP, ISTP, INFJ, ENFJ
Gamma: ENTJ, INTJ, ISFP, ESFP
Delta:  ESTJ, ISTJ, INFP, ENFP

Since we all choose(subconsciously) four preferences, and will eventually use all our functions I find it easier to consider things through a lens of the Perceiving vs Judging axis. On one axis, perceiving: Se/Ni vs Si/Ne. Choosing one or the other really simplifies things. It's easier to find all the similarities between people with Se/Ni than it is to try and note how the preferences look different.  Judging Axis: Te/Fi vs Ti/Fe.

If you look up 'quadra socionics' it'll provide a fairly good overview of how fundamentally different the quadras are while finding the fundamental similarities within them. Who woulda' thought that ESTPs and INFJs were actually similar when you got down to it.

A lot of people don't like it because they perceive it to be a socionics thing. Until MBTI makes use of this categorization, I will continue to bring it up when typing people. It's *infinitely* easier to pick 1 out of 4 with clarity than it is 1 out of 16. Plus the quadras address fundamental views on the world.

Anyways, [here](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra) is a link which does a quick overview of the four.

One of the assumptions that I've made is that others have the same ability to identify things as I do. I find looking through the list of traits for each of the quadrants, and it is **very** easy for me to put myself in the beta quadrant. Contrasting with my experience when I was first finding my type-- I partially used the dichotomies. I believed that because I was emotional that I may have mistyped myself and thought I was ESFP. I thought my emotionalness meant that I must have been a feeler.

I think the order of the functions merely shows the relative complexity and ability with each function. I don't think, however, there is always a correlation between the place in the stack and the  actual prevalence of it.  Surely, most people like to do what they are good at. Surely, there is also more discomfort with attempting to use our inferior functions it doesn't mean that if an ESTJ explodes with Fi frequently that they are not a thinker. 

Sorry. There's a bit of rambling there. 

I'm pretty unsure about the types there still. One of the things that's getting me is that INFJs tend to be weirdos. I personally like it, but I cannot deny that they may have some really strange ideas and traits about them. 

At this point in time, I would love if you could take a look at the quadra and let me know if that makes things easier (or harder..) 

Here's the link again: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-QuadraThe 'Valued Elements' and 'Subdued Elements' sections were the most helpful for me. Although the group behavior one was nice to affirm.Why not?With all questions like this, I think it's foolish to say no there isn't. I mean, there's no way I can *prove* there is, but it feels just like common sense. 

To say that the way we perceive and judge the world, and the way we deal with problems, and our values *doesn't* have an effect on opinion/taste seems foolish. I can't prove it though.

Also, to add clarification--- I don't think that all types converge to one opinion or something, I just think that ~~MBTI~~ jungian psychology, as an abstraction does a very good job and I get super annoyed with the idea that humans are so complex that we can't use even a crude model to try and predict things. 

I feel incongruous because I very much hate anthropocentric views but I truly have an anthropocentric view on life at the same time. 

Ramblings of a crazy person. ESTP, I'm basically the same. Maybe a little louder? Maybe a little more willing to annoy people? 

/u/kbnation, /u/trippin_daisies ?No I don't think I would have to be honest. It's really really hard to type anyone over text. In person, for sure. Real recognize real.

And I'll admit, I realized how much I actually skim peoples messages. So I didn't pick up on the joke instantly. I gotcha now though :D.

I like people thinking I'm dumb. I love the idea of being underestimated. It gives someone *so* much power. It makes me dangerous. 

Are you referring to anyone specifically, btw?  Also, I think if I didn't know I probably would have typed ESFP mostly because you seem to have a better emotional handle than myself-- even though I know that's not how the functions work.Top notch duality there. You gonna lock him down?

I'm ESTP and I definitely would choose ESTP again. ESTPs have the most fun. If not ESTP,  I would either wanna be INFJ or ISTP. Although probably ISTP since most of the INFJs seem to not be having a fun time :/. The whole beta quadrant is past saving.Why do you think he's an ENTJ?

I think there is along with the anti-sensor bias we see, an anti-ESTP bias. So often any ESTP who's mildly successful and more importantly *likable* is either classified as an ENTJ or an ENTP (depending on *how* successful).

Also, I don't really know how the story illustrates how people think. 

I don't think differences in strategic style can be narrowed down to a type. This kind of thing is best left to the Se/Ni vs Si/Ne, Ti/Fe vs Te/Fi categorization. 

**Most behavior cannot be narrowed down to a type. At best, we can say that a person is this quadrant or that quadrant with behavior.** This becomes more and more relevant as we develop. I assume the development comes with age / experience. That's not to say a 15 year old ESTP cannot have a firm grasp on Fe. I sure as hell didn't, but I don't see why it's impossible.

To narrow it down further requires a clear understanding of someones internal value system, and perception(their Pi and Ji). Ironically, for people like me with low Pi it may be quite difficult to actually get the required scope. 

I'm not saying he's not an ENTJ. I'm just curious how sure you are--- for the record.&gt;Of course it does. Strategic decisions and actions are the expressions of thought.

I didn't say they weren't. 

&gt;So instead of narrowing them down to a type, you narrow them down to the axises? Which are what make up the type?

Axes* 

&gt;I don't understand the logic behind this. So if types do not dictate behavior, than what is the use of MBTI? Isn't MBTI supposed to help you understand other people, and their behaviors? If theres no correlation behind behavior and MBTI type, then what is really being measured...?

Also didn't say that. It's just a lot less black and white than you seem to think it is. An undeveloped (for lack of a better word) ESTP is pretty goddamn easy to type. 

What happens when their Fe begins to not suck? They may not have the characteristic asshole 'vibe'. In fact, they may even appear nice. As well, after a while, what if they finally *get* Ni too? 

Suddenly this ESTP may start mixing in Ni perceptions and Fe judgments into the mix that are on some level of complexity/nuance. The line is now blurry between the dual case in which the development happens in an INFJ. 

And I'm gonna be honest. It actually really pisses me off that you made that assumption about what I was saying. You connected dots that weren't there. Especially I'm someone who very strongly advocates a real life, applicable understanding of this theory. It's just a matter of understanding where the boundaries are for what can or can't be done. 

The individual types can be a good start and quick comparator, but if we are to believe in these abstractions on a fundamental level I don't believe it is in good practice to type to one of the 16 rather than to the four quadra first. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø In fairness,

&gt;I'm not saying he's not an ENTJ. I'm just curious how sure you are--- for the record.

I just think there's continual pattern of typing ESTPs as ENTJs or ENTPs. I also think that the abstractions we have are so much more powerful than trying to find the best sterotype even though that can probably lead to a ~~good~~ correct typing most of the time.

Did I word it strangely? I mean, I am a little dissociated right now so it's possible that I sound like a fucking idiot. 

Are you a fresh grad?Please note that I'm more in response to the INFPs I've met in my own life, however I'm sure there may be overlap.

Anyways, as an ESTP. I can tell you the other side of this story pretty easily. 

I have zero patience for people that are presumptuous of my intent. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say-- yet these people don't seem to listen. With the couple INFPs I know, and in the ENFP I know, they seem to be the most arrogant people. Except they don't realize their inherent arrogance.

Like here,

&gt;truly accurate conclusion and deliver it humanely. 

This seems arrogant. This seems like you seem to think you know what is accurate -- or that it isn't relative most of the time. It also seems like you're sacrificing accuracy for nice feelings. 

Again, I'm mostly speaking at the INFPs I've met in real life. I think I'm able to keep it civil online because no one can see my disgust.

What it often seemed like is that I would be speaking what I think and these XNFP people seemed to not listen but instead be assuming my intent on everything. They seemed to be worried about unimportant specifics while missing the big picture. 

I'm gonna be honest, this post bothers me quite a bit too.

&gt;oversimplified bs for the sake of being mean...

Who does that? Someone being insensitive is not some trying to be mean. Someone not taking your presumptuous, judgmental bullshit is not someone being mean-- it's someone who's not gonna take your "special snowflake" bullshit. The INFPs I've known seem to think they're smarter than they think they are. They seemed to assume my intelligence, or my intentions. It seems natural and inherent to them. I think that's fine I guess but it also seemed like they couldn't handle a dose of the real world and reality and how things actually worked. 

Not accepting the "telling it like it is" because you perceived it as mean is what drives me crazy. Fuck. 

The INFPs I know, they are hypocrites. They seem incapable of recognizing they are though. There seems to be little value for authenticity. It seemed like the INFPs I know couldn't handle questions either. I could ask them why they think something and they couldn't explain it-- but they expect me to respect it and value it. I would ask a question on why they see something a certain way and it's perceived as an attack on their values. I don't like having to say, "I'm just wondering but.." or having to give a disclaimer that I'm genuinely curious *every fucking time*. 

As well, with these people, they seemed to think they were more aware than they were.

Arg. 

I think there *is* something to the natural conflict relationship between ESTP and INFP. I don't think I'll never be friends with an INFP, I just think that I realize there's some give and take where the INFPs seem to think they are always right because they say they are. 




I don't get why you're getting downvoted.

I disagree with you on the delivery being as significant as the message itself, but I think that you're entitled to your opinion.

The duality though!Yeah. Can we really keep the general reddit rule where if we disagree with someone that we don't downvote? In fact, I would think that with this kind of thread-- if someone says something and it really pisses you off, give that an upvote and a thought out response.

I hope that we can try to stay away from simplifying someone else's perspective to a stereotype too!

Thanks, everyone :)Well said! Thanks for contributing to a productive discussion.This is awkwarddddd. ;)Thanks for the response! 

I'll be honest, it's super taxing for me to actually do this.

It just seems like there is a fundamental difference between us. 

I think to sum up the jist of my response it would be something like, "Yeah, you got us pegged pretty alright, but you're wrong about it being bad."

I appreciate this,

&gt;You seem like a very levelheaded and mature ESTP. People like KBNation and his "brother" on here can't have the same types of discussions. You go out of your way to be kind, courteous, and non-confrontational and I appreciate it. Thanks for all the food for thought, sorry about the max character limit response.

I'm very glad you have noticed this.&gt;Is there another ESTP waltzing around here or was there another one who previously engaged more?

No I don't think there's many ESTPs around here. 

&gt;Do I need do less reading and sticking to lighter commentary and more engaging?

I don't understand the question.

&gt;Am I inadvertently offending people by not engaging while being cognizant of ESTP stereotypes?

Again, I don't know what you're asking here.

I don't know if these questions are rhetorical. I'm confused now, too.
It's just that with INFPs, even here, everything means something. That's my problem with it. Everythings an issue. Everythings wrong, but the INFP rarely does anything but wish the world was a different way than it is.

People that complain about the world but refuse to actually do anything about it. People that are so scoped in on one thing that they fail to realize that they are the problem in a whole bunch of other issues. 

It seems to be a pretty common thing too. INFPs seem to tend to have the wrong scope.

I do appreciate you realizing that I was deeply hurt by people that are INFPs. 

One of my INFP 'friends' was someone I thought I could share specific issues with. I was describing an issue I had with a situation in specific detail. They were a part of this. Instead of actually *fucking listening* they got offended and attacked me. This is someone I deeply trusted with this vulnerability and they attacked me because they had a pre-conceived notion of who I was. 

Same person, they accused me of being a voyeur because they had no idea what the word meant. Naturally I was offended and angered. Instead of apologizing like a normal fucking human being, they expected me to just forget about it because they didn't mean what they said. Instead of apologizing like a courteous person, they accused me of making a big deal about things. 

There were other times in which I was bringing something to them to know their thoughts and they dismissed me every time. They refused to validate the possibility of me observing something they didn't see. The whole time I thought we were cool, then all of the sudden the person tells me they aren't gonna be my friend anymore yet this person was a "love everyone" type of shitbag hypocrite that couldn't practice what they preached.

So please excuse me if it appears I'm angry out of nowhere. This person showed me no respect and didn't even *pretend* to think I knew what I was talking about. 

It seems to be a common thing though. That both INFP and ENFP types tend to not see any validity in my perspective. I can recognize validity in theirs but it doesn't go both ways. Notably, people often report that ENFPs can come across as arrogant too. I definitely have experienced it from both types.

***

I'm sorry for not specifically addressing this. As I replied to another user, it's very emotionally and mentally taxing to discuss things like this.

Funnily enough, I rarely feel this way as I can usually connect this kind of discussion to concrete, tangible aspects in my life. This time it just kind of feels like pointless discussion. Maybe one of the other ESTPs can try and address this a bit better than I.

Again, thanks for the response. Sorry I couldn't contribute more to a productive discussion.





ESTP. ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

Substance abusehahahahaha.... ahaha... ha... ha... =(  /u/hamfree77 &gt; empirically groundless system

What system are you referring to? Are you somehow dissing cognitive functional theory but then upholding MBTI? R u srs?

Can you please elaborate? I'm mostly curious on your point of view at this point.&gt;ESTPs like being told no whether they realize it or not. Someone who can stand their ground, but at the same time still consider the ESTPs suggestions. Show them you do care about them, but their charm isn't going to work on you. They like the people who don't want them like and ENTP will. Act like you want them, they most likely won't be as interested, act like you don't, here they come. They want to know why their humor hasn't worked on you. Why has their charm not dazzled you? They will do everything they can to find out, and you'll enjoy the fun the ESTP will bring along with this.

:[ I don't like that you seem to know me better than I know myself.


&gt;INTJ: an INTJ will always say "intelligence matters most" but I've found that's a big lie! They like someone who will bring them into a world of something different from what they are. They like the emotional dork, they find this type of person to be something they are willing to actually call "cute". This type really does enjoy people the complete opposite of them, and the good thing about it is that it's what the INTJ will need.

Also sounds like you're trying to incite a riot or something with this one. It's true though. INTJs ~~are~~ tend to be silly like that.INFJs are the crazy that you're not supposed to stick your dick in. Hell, any sort of vulnerability you show is only giving them more ammo. 

I kid. Sort of. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Too fucking awesome.Yes =(

Edit: Need a more mature ESTP like /u/trippin_daisies Oh okay. I didn't want to participate in this *anyways*.What's your husband like?According to whom?

I would say that most people would support a cog function pairing like a duality or even semi duality.

That would be then an ISTP for duality and ISFP for semi duality. 

Edit: Mistakes were made. Semi dual for ENFJ = INTP. I think I would tend to agree with you if I had to choose between, "they do" or "they don't".

I worry though that either or is an over-simplification. 

I think there's a tendency to ignore what MBTI can tell us, assuming that both people are typed correctly. There is certainly a lot more to be said than most people would be willing to let MBTI type say.

It's not a predictor of relationship success probability rather than it is a predictor of innate understanding--- which is then easily related to the success of a relationship.

What do you think about duality and semi-duality? Not according to  socionics, no. 

INFP and ENFJ is one of the worst ones I think according to socionics. It's a 'contrary' relation.

Unless that wasn't what you're saying-- because  to be honest, your reply is worded in a confusing manner.I have definitely seen those MBTI compatibility charts which are glorified letter matching. Trying to build an applicable theory on top of the dichotomies is *very* shallow. 

I think generally they say that the middle two letters should match and the outsides shouldn't. That leaves me with ISTJ. While I get along with ISTJs there's certainly less attraction and understanding than a dual or semi-dual.

There's something deeply and intricately attractive about someone who uses your inferior function. Have you experienced this with ISFPs or ISTPs? 

Oops, made a mistake it's INTPs and ISTPs that are dual and semi dual. Ti then vs your Fe. Have you experienced this? Although I suspect it might be significantly less intriguing for a J function than it is for me. I'm not sure.



Would you say you have high expectations?

What three traits do you look for the most?Teasing is one of those things that should have been included in the ESTP description too, tbh. I find myself getting lost in nostalgia. Except it's not the nice warm feeling, well sometimes it is, but thinking about the past always leads me to regretting things and missing people. Happy feelings I felt become things I'll never experience again. =(

So naturally I try to not think about things.Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

To be the most empathetic, they would have to be the most capable of sharing/understanding someone else's feelings?

What function, or function group, in this theory enables us to feel empathy? Is it even within the scope of the cognitive functions? Is it characterized in our Ji or Pi? I don't even know where to start.

I'll just say no, because I don't know many INFJs and the one I do know isn't a very empathetic person.

I know it's an MBTI online culture thing to say that INFJs are the most empathetic type but I'm not too sure.

Kind of a pointlessly long post to just say that I don't know.O.oGuess the answer is yes.

/thread

Edit: Your flair just changed before my very eyes.Just... What?Hey!

Some follow up questions.

Why are you an Atheist? And more importantly, why are you 'open to people's beliefs?'

Why do you think you've typed as so many different types?

Also, what's with the weird repetition?

I have an idea I think, at this point of what type you are.Hey that's me.

Also, we meet again.^^For some reason we're linked through that site to another.

http://personalitygrowth.com/why-each-myers-briggs-mbti-stereotype-is-actually-false/I don't know what to say. I just can't relate. 

It sounds like something out of a science fiction TV show. I'm pretty show Fringe had an empath in there. Great show.

I feel like I can choose to be empathetic or not, so I really can't relate. 

Also, I don't know what HSP is either?

&gt;I know I come off as cold or standoffish, but I have to. 

That's an INFJ thing, perhaps? ;)

&gt;When I go shopping at the mall I put in noise canceling headphones and blast music.

I do that too, because the world is better if you pretend you're in a music video. I can't relate to draining thing, being a very very extraverted person.

&gt;I know you are sad, I know your life sucks, but I cannot help you.

Everyone's life sucks =(

&gt;I think an ISFJ might be one of the most empathetic.

Why do you think that?

Also, sorry for the slow response. I just don't really have too much to say on this because of a lack of understanding. Not of empathy, but of how someone else understands it. ESTP - Archer.

This is my only contribution.I think that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Because it seems baseless to assert that. Does Ni reflect arrogance? Who said that?&gt; Se reflects as being a liability to everyone and everything around you.

Well that hurts me real good, right there, y'know. =(Oh yeah, that's totally an Ni thing.Fuck your Fi bullshit. We are now nemeses!Annoying.I also thought it was an apt description of high Se users. I feel like anything more is disingenuous. We just are. It's not Se that ruins my life. It's all these other shitty ass functions. ;)Yeah... And proud of it!!

/thread I don't really like to dance. Unless it's to music I like.

I've been swing dancing several times, I suck at it. I think I'm bad at it because I don't care to learn. I don't care to learn because I don't like swing music.Pretty muchYeah, I think we have to 'discover' our inferior function/tertiary function to actually find any sort of comfort in duality. 

I think ESTP/ISFJ is alright too. I mean, it's definitely an immediate and easy kinship in my experience. I guess socionics predicts that though with the mirage relation. I also hate the function clusterfuck though. 

So, for personalitypage, mine would be ISTJ? Definitely a middle ground. I don't really have anything to comment on ISTJs, hah.

One of my best friends is an ISTP. She's just kind of cold though for my liking :[.

***

What's your personal opinion? 

Aren't you an INTP or have you rediscovered yourself? What have your experiences been with each of the types you mention?

I would disagree with most of the people here. I think the general 'feel' people attribute to Fi is actually just introversion in general. So yeah, fuck all y'all introverts. 

Kidding. I think Ti doms can be just as obnoxious as Fi doms. However, I have a little bit more understanding with making Ti doms pick up what I'm putting down. 

I think Ni though is probably the most dangerous as much as I am deeply attracted to it. Something about people that use it seem very mysterious, but not only mysterious but also dangerous. Ni seems in general subversive to me.

The loops are what I'm mostly referring to. Having experienced an Ni+Ti loop in someone I know, I can assure anyone that this or the Ni+Fi loop are absolutely the worst things to encounter. It's like beating your head against a wall. Obligatory, "typical INFJ".

I agree. I very much enjoy the community of this subreddit and the general feel from it. I can refrain from tearing apart /u/madsweet and other INFPs for the sake of our friendly neighborhood INFJs like you, /u/omiocat.

Although, I do disagree with you OP in saying that using experience with someone of the same type cannot be used to understand the type as whole.

If we assume someone *is* in fact the type we ascribe to them, the general vibes someone gives and the thought pattern someone has are pretty well within the scope of ~~MBTI~~ jungian psych. So I just wanna say, no one is special. We're all shitters with terrible memes that should feel bad about ourselves for our terrible memes.

Or something. Thank *you* for sharing. Because without people like you, no one would give a fuck about each others feelings. As sarcastic as that previous comment may read, I believe feelings are an important part of the human experience. Taking into account everyone's feelings is not something a lot of us can do naturally or easily.
I was joking :[Sorry late night, wasn't picking up on it.ESTP - Engineering PhysicsIt's because you meant to choose mechanical engineer, duh.It's because I love you. I'm just an ESTP. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø What does DQ mean?INFJs and ISFJs ---- I would wager ISFJs more so.Yeah this needs to be said every time the word duality is mentioned.

I asked my ENFP used-to-be friend about ISTJs and she immediately rejected to idea. Some of the things she said were extremely harsh and presumptuous with an underlying layer of arrogance about why ISTJs aren't good enough for her.

She just steamed me up in general with what I would assume to be fairly typical  "underdeveloped" ENFP quirks. 

The idea that someone else isn't good enough for you is probably the most immediately frustrating cultural assumption about relationships. 

The duality relationships are not as immediately appealing as semi-duality.Why not both?How do you think other people see you? Is it ENFJ or INTP?
Is it possible you're an INFJ actually? Often times you'll see INFJs that have fallen in love with their Ti (tertiary/third function). The reason I say this is that there is usually more discomfort involved with being in the grip. With tertiary function there's a lot more comfort but still a less nuanced use of the function. There also seems to be a desire for proficiency in the function. 

In my case, my tertiary is Fe. The past year I definitely can look back and say that I went overboard with Fe. I overestimated at how 'good' I was at it. It's hard to explain, but I definitely thought I was doing a good job of it, but now I realize through the lens of Se-Ti (my dom/aux) that although I definitely preferred Fe for a long while, I was not very good at it. 

***Our tertiary functions can be used 'well' but not to their fullness and complexity that a dominant of that type would.***That's the dream, man. 

I really *love* the idea of duality. I'm definitely one of those people that puts too much stake in it mentally. 

I think something that would be useful if we had more knowledge and empirical data would be to compare the different duality relations in the different quadra. 

The reason I mention that is that there's a different tone of with beta duality in my mind -- as with all of them compared to each other. Of course,I am referring to the INFJ/ESTP combo. Maybe my experience with a particular INFJ has been an anomaly but there seems to be a really intense tone to this duality. A tortured love of sorts. I would suspect ISTP/ENFJ be something similar if it were to ever happen, because I think this is just a beta thing. 

I had known this INFJ for probably 3 years before hand not thinking much of them but I almost certainly have gone off the deep end with thoughts of how to 'win them back'. I know I'm crazy but I sort of like it. \#justbetathings

Do you think there's anything to this? If so, what are the *tones* of the different quadra duality relations?  What are your thoughts on semi-duality in comparison with duality relations?


If you don't mind doing it out in the open I'm sure that a lot of other people could help type you too. 

Have you read the stuff on the sidebar? About the functions, is the stuff I'm referring to mostly. The functions are pretty poorly defined since they are abstractions of different parts of the psyche. For me this was really hard to grasp at first. 

One thing you'll notice eventually is that there's a set of 'rules' that the function stacks follow. There's eight functions in total. This itself is kind of ambiguous because Fe/Fi are the same function (sort of) but expressed either outwardly or inwardly-- as with S, N and T. 

All people contain all S, N, T, and F functions. There are 4 possible combinations that then can exist if we are to have a 'balanced' person. The assumption is that you are a healthy, normal individual. Then we can say that you'll either have the Se/Ni pair or Si/Ne pair with the Fe/Ti pair or Fi/Te pair. Remember that these are just abstractions to represent parts and thought processes and patterns within the personality. 

For me, I have the Se/Ni pair and Fe/Ti pair. This has implications. Note that my opposite letter type, the INFJ also has these pairs but in a different order. 

That's the quadra right there, the four different possible function combinations.

I recommend you take a read up on this: http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra. The quadra is a concept more explicit in 'Socionics' (Russian MBTI, basically). 

Take a little bit to try and determine which quadra you're in. If the beta quadra seems like the way you think/prioritize things/act in groups, you're likely either an INFJ or ENFJ. If you're definitely not introverted you're probably an ENFJ. /u/doggymelonss and /u/peppermint-kiss  and /u/quiteafewfireflies  are INFJ, ENFJ, and INFJ and their comment history's may help you determine if the initial INFJ/ENFJ typing makes sense.

Alternatively, you may immediately realize that you're not in the beta quadrant-- in which case, definitely check up the INTP type or read through all the quadras and find which quadrant you are in.

***Note: In socionics introverted types switch their last letter. Example: INTj (in socionics) = INTP (in myers-briggs), ISFp = ISFJ, etc.*** Extraverted types don't switch, it's just a nomenclature thing.  

You need to get it out of your head that a type can't act like another. 

Any type can act like any type but any type can't think like any type. Me, an ESTP will fundamentally think differently from an ENTP even though we may come across the same, or even hit the same mental signposts.

Describe your relationship with this person for me. 

I feel like ISFJ is likely because they tend to be hard to type, because a variety of things.I think aside from certain concepts I would agree. 

I truly believe there is something to duality, and semi duality and most of the relations. However a lot of the descriptions of the other relations are too specific to be applicable.

The quadra are the only other thing I'd want to take from it. I think that they are very easily observed in the real world.

The actual functional model seems pretty irrelevant to me in either case. We are dealing with abstractions, a lot of the extra framework created is unnecessary past the understanding of the four possible combinations of functions. I think this of mbti too. Unfortunately we don't have the quadra or anything comparable.That's the wrong way to think about it.

People are 16 types because we say they are. That's how models work. Models are supposed to work mechanically. 

Think of it like this: You have 7 billion different coloured balls. You can sort them into red, blue, yellow, green, purple, orange. Every possible colour can be sorted into this. The result of any individual unique colour can be sorted into one of these categories. Is that mechanical?

Since we have underlying abstractions of the psyche that come from observation (Jung's work), rearranging, manipulating, stretching, turning these 'functions'/'information elements' is how we begin to stretch a model to explain shit that's more complex like actually understanding people's thought processes better.

It's like math. Math didn't break with the addition of negative numbers, it was just stretched to fit and help us gain an understanding of the world. You can say that negative numbers 'make sense' but you're fooling yourself.  What about imaginary numbers? Same thing happened there. 

It's about taking a system and manipulating it. 

Instead of constantly redefining the 'model', the model needs to be stretched to fit what we see until it breaks. Not the MBTI, nor socionics, but the basic rules that Jung has set up for how functions MUST interact. Trying to understand each function just granulates it to the point of incoherence.

***

I agree though with the general opinion on socionics here, however. It's weird and over specific to the point it proves itself inaccurate. I think the quadra, on the other hand, are a broad enough brush that the precision of the predictions it makes are verifiable and acceptable.

Finding the patterns between the four possible combinations of functions is more do-able, and realistic than trying to understand the push and pull of the preference of each individual function. So I think we can absolutely bin every stable person into a quadrant..

Thoughts? I agree with your qualms about socionics, I hope that was clear.
I getcha, I think.

Have you ever experienced the dom-inf duality? So either an INTJ or INFJ.  There's a sort of magnetism to Ni-doms for me. Discomfort is an indicator towards tertiary and inferior functions.

For example, Si-based understandings of the world don't make me uncomfortable. They are a non-factor, and are often confusing to me when I observe the thought processes of an ISTJ/ISFJ, but I'm not threatened in the same way that an ENFP can bother the shit out of me.

With our dominant/auxiliary functions I believe that we can often easily understand the opposing attitude (i.e. Se =&gt; Si, Fe=&gt; Fi).

I think there needs to be a holistic understanding of the functions, in that P functions cannot exist without J functions. I think that trying to understand a function separate from the system is futile.

Anyways, here's a short description of someone I work with. I'm fairly certain they are an ISFP. She is more than twice my age, and I'm still at the point where she kind of feels like my mom in a way. However, she's one of the most fun people I know. 

Fi-Se looks like a presentness that is strongly aware of what personal values are held. So what this looks like in this person, is she tends to be excitable, aware like myself, however she has a very clearly defined view of what is right and wrong. Internally she has these values and there is a clear priority for how she feels about things. 

Recently, she quit doing a team sport that she actually got me doing with her team. She has been doing it for 15 years or something like that. Someone had mentioned to her that she seemed angry about circumstances surrounding the time commitment it has been recently. She did not realize this-- I believe that this slight lack of self-awareness is due to lower stack Pi (Ni in this case). However, as soon as this was made clear she quit mid-season because of her internal value system that is clearly, and strongly defined. This is Fi-Se. 

I think Fi shows in the self-based understanding of the values, and Se perhaps in the swift, controlled, concrete action to quit.  She definitely feels a little bad, but has the resolve to understand what her own priorities and values are.

***

One of the things I'm fascinated with in Ne/Si vs Se/Ni is that Se/Ni seems more willing to declare something and then change it's mind later. One of the things that I've come to associate with a confusion about type is that Ne/Si axis or at least in the sense that anything is possible. And obviously, since everyone has both N and S functions it's not as black and white as a one-to-one function.

Funnily enough, I'm going to 100% contradict the previous paragraph and say you're an INTJ. The reason is that this reads like something my INTJ friend would write, and I cant get her voice out of my head. You could still be an INFP though since it's just a hunch. ;)

I guess to follow up can you answer these questions: 

1) What type would you want to be? Why?
2) What does Ni look like to you? Why?
3) Would people that know you describe you as 'certain'? Why?


Sorry about the rambling. Not sorry enough to edit it, but yeah...What do you mean misanthropic? I'm confused by the use here.Well, it is. No one matters. We're all garbage. From dust to dust. The remarkable are those that truly understand that they are unremarkable.

Full disclosure: I didn't read the article, as is the reddit way.Even the function tests are less accurate than actually examining your behavior.

Have you looked at the quadra? It's a socionics word but the concept is perfectly applicable to MBTI as well. It's simply finding the patterns between those that share their functions. I think trying to type yourself through this path will be more likely to lead to a correct typing.

Essentially, you have to just determine Fe/Ti or Fi/Te, and Se/Ni or Si/Ne. Then you are logically left with the four quadrant.

http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra 

Take a read through the link and think about your group behavior, ideals, ideas, thoughts and tendencies in comparison to the quadra. You should find your overall tendencies fitting snugly into one of them.

What... What do you mean?
Se/Ni is by far the most unpredictable. Ni low stack is literally the crazy person function. 

Ne is all over the place but they're not unpredictable by any means. 

So INFJs that can get themselves to do stuff or ESTPs lost inside. You lost me. 

I mean, I get what you're trying to say that the cognitive functions are like information filtering/processing. However, you lose me on this:

&gt;So in MBTI the dominant and inferior functions are opposites, and the dominant function represses the inferior. It's said that you spend almost all of your time "in a state of your dominant function", which means almost none in your inferior. This doesn't make any sense against reality. Reiterative information filters scale like crazy, if you set a chain of distortions it's going to sound absolutely fucking garbage, even with small amount of distortion this will add up and create a gigantic shift in output. If it's true that the dominant and inferior functions are opposites, and the dominant heavily represses the inferior, then an ESTP and INFJ will live in worlds completely separated from one another, in fact, they couldn't even understand one another. Take inbreeding or selective breeding as an example, in just a few reiterations (generations) you can create quite a significant difference, and this is with a tiny variation in information (mutations). This is nothing compared to the amount of reiterations that happens with information processing throughout a persons life, and there are no opposite processes in place, it's just reiterating the same process with a very low probability of failure, or distortion, involved.

I don't see your theory of information filters being applicable in the sense you think it is.

What do you think it means that a person 'contains' all these filters? As in, an ESTP has the same filters present as an INFJ. I don't understand how you then get they are completely different and should appear on different planes of understanding from each other.

One of the things I have begun to understand about the cognitive function theory is that it makes a lot more sense if you remember that tertiary and inferior are still **preferred** functions over their opposite attitude.

In your analogy, what does distortion represent? 

Something that may be a stumbling block for you or might shed some light, is the consideration that the 16 types are just the dominant poles of the filtering system. It definitely muddles up trying to manipulate the cognitive functions individually but its something worth considering. Of course, this may be a 'cognitive functions of the gaps' reasoning.

Can you explain how making the test group spend 2 weeks to find their MBTI is poisoning the well?

And I don't think anywhere anyone will say that human cognition is  largely different according to Jungian Psych.

The cognitive functions are abstract, and it's important to note that. I do not believe you'll be able to open someone's head up and say, "Oh well there's the Ni centre of the brain, right next to the Ne part". It just won't happen. Does this reduce it's value? I don't really think so.

The cognitive functions describe patterns that were observed in people. Someone took the time to look at people and try and find similarities in preference, and modes of thought.

If you wanted to look at these separate modes, you would have to find the patterns between the different quadrants(alpha, beta, delta, gamma). 

And something more of note is that sentences like,

 &gt;You might have deluded yourself into seeing black and white differences between people through selective bias, but you should know that you're susceptible to selective bias and to know better than to trust your experience when it does not align with reason or hard evidence. 

come across extremely arrogant and don't make people receptive to what you have to say-- correct or not. The people on this subreddit are arguably one of the most diverse demographics you'll find on this website. There are many smart, educated people who have found jungian psychology to make sense and prove reliable.

1. Are Ni and Se opposites? In what sense? Is water the opposite of air? In what sense? Trying to find symmetry, and anti-symmetry in a high level analysis is just as pseudo-scientific as MBTI. What makes Se and Ni opposites more than Se and Ne? 

2. Do you honestly believe that identifying your type has the potential to change it? You're also assuming a lot about the methodology regarding how they identified their types. 

3. You're just speaking gibberish with this last point or I'm high as fuck. You're trying to connect two unrelated things to draw an analogy which doesn't really hold water (badum tssh). 

I'm sorry that I'm not on the same plane of understanding as you. It really appears as faux-scientific drivel to a simple mind like mine. It's one thing to complain about the methodologies used in his study, but I think it's fairly reasonable to want an explanation that isn't just you reiterating your point. 


Thanks for sharing. It definitely might have been easier to ask ENFJs and ENTJs what it's like considering that I cannot describe Se.

That really confuses me to be honest, and it doesn't sound fun. =(

Yeah, DOWN WITH DELTA!You couldn't tell from /r/infj. =/Can you describe what that was like then? Learning to grow into your adult self?&gt;But because of the Ni-tendency to be sort of head up the ass about one's own interpretation of things, the tendency to take A LOT of mental leaps and bounds which leaves a lot of room for unknown miscommunication, and the super 'the past is in the past fuck all of this' purging.

Yeah, I see that. When Se comes out it's scary. It's fire.

&gt;Most of my relationships with the other INxJs I've come across have ended because of a lack of proper communication about needs/problems/expectations and/or ignoring that communication when it gets brought up.

Well that makes me sad. Why ignore these things?How do I accommodate Ni doms to make their lives the best they can be? How can I facilitate growth? And all that shit.Is it dissociation?&gt;For me it's like I'm watching a movie in my head except the movie is what I'm seeing/feeling/sensing etc.

Ketamine is a helluva drug.All you INFJs and INTJs are weird. How do I make you guys like me?If an Ni dom. has a hunch, and then acts on it incorrectly, what does that mean? What happens when they act impulsively and foolishly?

Both of these people I know seem to have an "fuck it, it doesn't matter anyways" attThat's like 100% ESTP right there, fam.But... you're an INTP. I definitely got this feeling from the INTP I knew for a while. I couldn't help but crowd her thoughts out. 

INTP/ESTP is less of a natural relationship than most types I'd say-- even though they can both understand eachother somewhat.Well honestly, it's hard with these kinds of things, because it's very possible that all the dialogue about Ni is connecting with your tertiary. I think this, although a rare mistype is something that can happen. 

Although, I believe that more INFJs are likely to mistype as INTPs though than the other way around. The reason is that INFJs tend to be pretty open to possibilities, subjectively (duh). And although Fe is auxiliary, it's only used for their purposes and less of *who they are* (but ironically still who they are). So sometimes, what I see is that INFPs will type as INFJs, but INFJs will type as INTPs because INFPs are 'too emotional' where INFJs admire their tertiary Ti because that's how they subjectively judge who they are and how they feel about it.

So maybe you're an INFJ? How unsure were you about your type previously? I think something that often helps me guess a type is seeing the interaction between the person and an ESTP (myself). The INFJ/ESTP one is excitement and fun, and although the ESTP doesn't change, an INTP can feel stuck, and restricted, and tired out by the Fe. With INFP, it's immediately obvious because the ESTP/INFP are on separate planes of understanding. This has been my experience with it, at least. I don't like the word unconscious because it does have an actual psychological definition and it makes you people sound unaware of your internal state. I suspect this isn't the case?

Does semi-conscious, or introspective or subconscious, or extremely subjective or private begin to explain? Because I think that the Pi function in itself is a very intimate function to a person either way. It just so happens that with Ni doms (and Si doms) that this is their first and foremost function. 

I suspect that the user(as it seems) is vividly aware of these dot connections. The connections are made in front of the user, as they become aware of their internal world and their subjective viewing of things but it's not something that is controlled or directed-- it just happens. Is this accurate? I definitely got that feeling from most of the people here, in that it just happens. It doesn't happen with force or choice. 

I find it extremely fascinating because Ni users seem to be inherently self-aware (hell even Si doms). In my case, this is extremely difficult and I find that contrast hilarious.I would prefer to avoid referring to this specific case, and choose to focus on general principles (how beta of me) but this INFJ was kind of an asshole to me for literally no reason.

Well, I mean there is a reason-- but I think it's one of those Ni-Ti loop things. There's a lot of assumptions and jumps made that aren't fair to me.

For a while I thought I really did do something, but after talking with my INTJ friend, I'm convinced that this is an internal issue with this INFJ person-- at the word of the INTJ who knows more than me. 

I think INFJs like me in general terms though. I'm a pretty likable guy I think. So yes, this person has a false understanding about me, but I don't know how much of it is based in reality.



Yeah my INTJ friend explained it like *mental puppets*. She asserted that everyone has *mental puppets* of other people and that's why this INFJ was a dick because their mental puppet was extrapolated from something I did one time. Part of me likes the idea that this INFJ once had thought I was some amazing human being but it also kind of bothers me.

 I just kind of sat there and agreed even though I don't have mental puppets.  The closest thing is perhaps their types, but even then I understand that it doesn't really give me anything except an outline of patterns that this person will tend to adhere to. The type forms around the person in a concrete objective way.

Personally, I don't like the feeling of being written off prematurely. 

What's your experience with being an INFJ throughout your life? I feel like a pattern is that a lot of INFJs are kind of jerks until they 'come into their own'--- paraphrasing someone else. Hey! Thanks for the post! It's hard to tell exactly what you are but I have a hunch!

Personally, I think that finding which 'quadrant' you exist in is much easier than picking out of 16 based on stereotypes. Picking out of 16 tends to lead to some strange restrictions. For example, I'm a pretty emotional person, but I thought I was an ESTP. This would lead me to believe that I may be an ESFP. And although I feel I have a fairly okay understanding of MBTI theory-- I would still fall into this trap.

So what I want to ask you to do is take a look at this [link](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/15-Socionics-Four-Quadra) and just look at the separate quadrants. Basically instead of looking at each individual function, or a type as whole the quadras help you find your type in terms of push/pull pairs. 

Se/Ni vs Si/Ne *and* Fe/Ti vs Fi/Te. For me, I am Se/Ni and Fe/Ti--- in the order Se-Ti-Fe-Ni. 

Anyways, take a brief read through of the quadras and the tendencies they will have. Note that INTp == INTJ (MBTI). The last letters (P/J) are switched for socionics. This is simply a nomenclature convention.  Start with the Gamma quadrant. If that doesn't fit you like a glove--- read through the others.

I know you already provided some info, but self-reflection is the most accurate typing method by far. We don't know your motivations or internal perspectives on things. If I'm understanding correctly, I would say that the Se-Ni is fairly accurate to my experience (hah). I especially like considering S/N as a unit rather than trying to dissect two very abstract parts.

Something that I think would be helpful would be then trying to observe these definitions through the lens of what behaviors come out of these. 

Also, what are your thoughts on the role preference order plays? What does Se being my dom, and Ni being my inf. function mean in the context of these definitions? To me, it seems like it seems more like a 'weighting' of preferences? 

Good post! I'm excited for some of the other thoughts brought forward in this thread.Are you John?Yeah I definitely get that sense from these two people. Us three don't work too well together but I think I get along with each of them marvellously-- like they're my favourite people.

I can't see the OP right now as I'm on mobile, but I think I mentioned somewhere that this INTJ explained the thought process this INFJ had. The INTJ laid it out clearly and explicitly and helped me understand things that weren't readily apparent. I mean, she also only has the same info I have but she was able to give a guess that seemed plausible. I had run the scenario through my mind for a long, and unhealthy amount of time and the actions taken by this INFJ were not rational. They were the choices of a crazy person. Somehow my INTJ friend was able to help me understand though. You Ni doms are crazy people, in a good way! &lt;3

Have you been close to any people that you would wager are ESTPs?I know three INFJs and then three INFPs who think they are INFJs. 

Good question!

Extroversion/Introversion definitely appears to be a continuum from what we know-- this isn't news to most people here. I am on the far end of that line. 

The deadness inside of me has made me feel more like an introvert, but alone time is seldom energizing. One of the 'in the grip' characteristics of ESTPs is the feedback loop that happens when we get all doom n' gloom, internal confusion. So I have to make note of that when I try and assess that.

At my best, I would say I'm hyper-extraverted although I don't like meeting strangers in most situations. In most situations, strangers are a mix of introverted and extraverted people. This is hard because highly introverted people seem less willing to partake in meaningful, vulnerable conversation with strangers. 

This isn't to say that I tell strangers my deepest darkest secrets, I just mean that it often feels like there is a higher likelihood that strangers are getting in and getting out in 9/10 scenarios.

At parties, it's different. Get a couple drinks in an introverted or socially uncomfortable person and people show their true selves. 

Acquaintances are different too. Complete strangers are always harder to connect with than people you've met even once.

Now the real question: Does it drain me? I would say no. Being alone in my room drains me, even though I love spending time alone. I need to spend time on my computer playing games, or just browsing reddit but it drains me at the same time. Anything outside of my house energizes me. Walking down the street surrounded by people gives me energy and enjoyment out of life if I'm listening to a good beat. Strangers, even if awkward, give me a net energy to have interacted with them.  People watching is fun. People watching with a person I care about is the dream. I hate when people ask me how I'm doing. I hate having to search myself, I hate having to figure out what's going on inside of me.

Se, I've come to realize--- as a dominant function is not about doing stuff. It's about being present and external. It's about awareness. Control only comes depending on the judgement function that follows. I feel like it's only ISTPs, ISFPs, ENTJs, ESTJs that are the constant extreme sport, need for stimulation type of people that Se always seems to be characterized as. 

Yeah. I think it's very much a natural relationship underneath the immediate apparent differences. 

/u/doggymelonss had mentioned that there was a lot of hate for ESTPs in /r/infj. I think the reason is that that sub is just a complete mix of INFPs, INTPs and INFJs. INFPs and ESTPs, I believe, has the tendency to be a very difficult relationship to maintain. INTPs and ESTPs is a little easier but still not an easy thing like pretty much *all* sensors and the ESTP. 

That's why I found it funny when a lot of the people in that sub seem to really write off the ESTP as a type completely. 


Yeah I think the 'irresponsible' thing is probably a pretty common view on ESTPs--- we're in control though. The lying kinda sucks.

The ENTP/INFJ one is one of the online MBTI culture things. Same with INTP. Although I do think the ENTP/INTP and the INFJ are more similar than the ESTP, if that makes sense? Duals are all about complementary relationships.Example of overcompensating Ti is the stubbornness you can find with INFJs and ISFJs. As with most Ti users you have to play their subjective logic game. You only have to convince them, you don't have to prove a universal principle. 

With higher level Ti users I feel most can realize the holes in their own thought process if you point it out to them, but the Pi doms with Ti tert. Are much harder to reason with, imo. There is often a lot of unseen (subjective, introverted) things they see as relevant input. To argue with a tert. Ti user on their terms is the biggest mistake you can make since their own unseen, 'invisible' world matters a LOT more than it does if you were to argue with an INTP or ISTP.


As for typing you, /u/namenna,

&gt;Im not sure what the most disappointing part is, how I feel it's undermining my intelligence/information, how it's just an unwanted interaction (When I'm looking to buy something in a store it's really not a scene I want to 'interact' with) or perhaps it's how it makes me feel like they assume that I don't know what I'm doing (I really don't like that).

Seems very Fi actually. Your reasoning seems to come from a subjective place. The fact that you seem almost unsure whether or not you should feel this way is (in my mind) a lower stack function. 

I'll give the guess that you're either an ISTJ or INTJ from this one post even though you didn't ask for it.

It's hard to know because I don't know much about ISTJs, but my experience of the one person I would ever type as that is that she--- although very easy going and open minded, has a more clear idea of what is okay, and what is internally this or that. Ni as such, can come across as a lot more unsure-- until either Te or Fe deal with it. Ni deals with abstractly perceiving self, and subjection (that means nothing to me either.)

In your post, the 

&gt;despite acknowledging that they are doing their jobs 

comes across as very very Te to me.

Of course, this whole post could be a mess of confirmation bias but I'll stick with INTJ until someone else brings up a counter-point.Yes, but in this case it appears to be an 'ethics-based' judgment which is why I mentioned Fi.Good luck.

Only thing I have to say is that **everyone needs to stop self-identifying as individual functions**. You are not just Fi. You're Fi-Te and Ne-Si and your 'individual self'.He kind of sounds a little unhealthy.

To be honest, so am I. I really like the idea of being a villain. Heath Ledger's Joker really influenced this. Being a bad guy is so much cooler and seems more fun.

Complete inner confusion is a pretty ESTP thing, I'd imagine ESFP thing too.Do you think this changes for Judging vs Perceiving functions? I am! I don't get it, but I want to. =(. I'd like Fi if it liked me :(Interesting! 

That's a really good point. Perhaps I do really need to rethink this. Fi/Ti both can have their heads up their own asses, all the subjective/introverted functions have that possibility. 

I guess I would prefer to attribute inability to ones lesser functions. I know that I have 'over-compensated' with my Fe, I've experienced ENFPs over-compensate with their Te. 

In reality, it's 100% true to say that it comes from both, because what **really is** a *cognitive function* in the real world? I have to say I don't really know. 

My experience with with Pi doms has been that they are fairly open minded. I think that having Pi as a dominant function, everyone learns to function with it-- with their Pi-Je. The world is a malleable thing according to their internal world. With Je they can shape it, yada yada yada.  With their Ji tertiary, what I see as *over-reacting* in this field is the "I'm right because I say I'm right, and I think I'm right." Comparing that with a Ji dom with their tertiary Pi--  I think the inability to *see everything* is with them. 

So I just kind of typed my thinking out, but I'll reiterate. 

Pi types will not accept external data *because* they cannot properly assess their value judgement with Ji. This comes across as stubbornness and almost a willful choice to be difficult.

I'd like to think that Ji doms are simply more unaware than Pi doms when it comes to internal matters. They can take and properly assess logical/ethical value to input, and it's accurate, and reasonable, and real-world viable. In terms of overcompensating, I have no idea how to try and characterize Ni, Si.

Do you have any more thoughts? You have made me think about this some more! Thank you! 
Well they can laugh you out of the sub but they'll never laugh you out of my heart. &lt;3Oh yeah it's just you ~~INFPs~~ INTJs. 

I mentioned it in another comment but one of the people I work closely with is an ISFP. It's a really strange thing. I'm kind of worried to joke about the wrong thing, but I really admire her as a person. It's like an introduction to Fi on my own terms of Se ;)ESTPs are the most authentic people you will meet, promise. It's because our internal confusion and values are even a mystery to us ;)Donal---- me.... 

edit: or Alexander the Great.LOL you INTPs.What type are you? 

This person in the OP sounds like they could very well be an INFP. Not everything is anti-INFP. Perhaps INFPs get their stereotypes for certain tendencies the type tends to have? You know the ones.

Same with ESTPs? ESTPs ~~are~~ tend to be shitty at a lot of things. I think ESTPs, and INFPs and all types have different traps where they can really be assholes, and obnoxious and you know what? Some of the self-righteousness from Fi doms I've experienced is kind of hard to deal with. 

I will explicitly state that I'm stating this about the individuals, and the possibility that this may be a pattern within people of the type. Just like you know probably X amount of shitty people of XXXX type. I probably know many INFPs and ENFPs that are superb people. =) 

That being said, **typing someone based on shitty behaviors is not okay,** but saying that certain shitty behaviors tend to relate to certain types is not as out there as your offence seems to suggest. 
What kind of things does he get worked up at? Why does he get worked up? 

I've seen both INFPs and INTJs get worked up -- getting excited is something that most people except you IXTPs seem to experience (jokes &lt;3). 

Why are you so sure that he's introverted if he believes he's extraverted? 

**So to answer you: Yes, it's possible.**Wow. That inferior Fe in action. You have truly ascended, my child. You are the CHOSEN ONE. To bring the Thinker and Feeler tribes together to be united!So you actually switched?

I thought you just had the flair. So you *are* an INTP though?Personally, i like the idea of using the quadras to type. There are clear, behaviourally-evident patterns that each of the quadras follow. We're going to type by behaviour anyways, why not at least try to make meaningful distinctions?

If you don't know what the quadras are, they are a socionics term for the four different groups of types that share the same function. For example, as an ESTP I share all the same preferred functions as an INFJ with the same attitudes--- just in reverse order. 

I'll be honest, I very strongly believe in the more seemingly 'rigid' socionics predictions. At least with regards to quadrant behaviour.

Anyways, it's just easier to find your similarities by quadrant and then narrow it down. How does one counteract the past is in the past Ni-Se purging?

It's actually really funny talking to my Ni people when they just expect me to let it go. Sometimes, sure. It just seems really strange to quit on things that matter to me just because the past is in the past. It's a weird perspective that 2/2 Ni doms I know seem to share.

Edit: Tfw you realize you double replied to a comment.Um. Have you met an ENTP?

I'd say ESTPs are the most easily likable type if you're not an INFP. No one hates an ESTP after just meeting them. What happens is that you slowly realize that the ESTP is a terrible person and then any N types are pretty bored and annoyed with ESTPs and *then* you hate them.

ENTPs don't have any initial draw though, in fact they can be pretty annoying if you just meet them. They come across as smart and intriguing and challenging and remain that way instead of slowly lowering your opinion of them.

Tertiary Fe, my man.

Or y'know I'm making this all up. 

ESTPs suck and we know we do, and we're proud of it.RIP this post.I'm so disappointed, I was soooo curious too. =( hehehe. As much as I would love it to be true I dunno. The beta quadra is like a band of misfits. "ESTP and the Gang". 

The beta quadra is like a road trip movie in which all these people are supposed to drive somewhere. At first we think they are all so different and we wonder how are they gonna do it. Then we realize that they're not so different after all with some heart wrenching, impassioned, angry moments between the ESTP/INFJ. The ISTP and ENFJ are just like, "what's those people's deal?" 

They never end up making it to wherever because they lose track of time when they're all doing it. It doesn't matter anyways, because the real journey was the one in our hearts. ESTP/INFJ end up together at the end of the movie, ISTP/ENFJ at the sequel. 

Great show, but guess what, these fuckers were on a delivery run for these nuclear WMDs to destroy the alpha, gamma and delta quadrants. That's the beta quadra. GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER!



Deltas. Then Gammas... Then Alphas... Then Betas. 

I feel you. Most people can be pretty real if you ask them, however. If you verbally say, "I need you to tell me if I'm annoying you because I can't tell." Sometime's with introverted people it often can feel that you're annoying them because they don't have much to say. 

Certain types are really terrible at communicating. Scratch that, certain types can *tend* to be very terrible at communicating. Not just verbally but I mean with active listening and that shit. I grew up in a school that taught active listening in grade 1 through grade 3. This was something you just did but growing up it seems not everybody learned it.

Some people don't give eye contact or *ANY* cues. Most of the time that means they don't give a fuck-- to normal people. So you trail off and look around awkwardly or do something else. Ten seconds later they're like, "What the fuck? Finish your fucking story." Once you get to know these people it's just something you know they do..

As far as the confrontational INFJ thing you'd have to ask some INFJs to be sure. I know INFPs will ghost you because they only have to be accountable to themselves and they don't feel obligated to tell you they are ignoring you now. INFJs are confusing because the doorslam is *truly* a fascinating thing to me. The doorslam seems nonsensical to me in concept. I think all-in-all INFJs tend to be *very* open-minded and open to whatever but things can 'build up' maybe? 

With ISFJs I've come to realize that they don't doorslam because that's not how you deal with people. Most people have been taught that things are a certain way. A certain way works. This plays into their internal experienced perceptions or whatever. With the INFJ it seems like it all comes from nowhere because at no point did *they* find it relevant to confront until it was too late. Ni is confusing-- /u/madsweet caught me on this.  /u/doggymelonss, /u/quiteafewfireflies am I getting this right?

**I would love if people could weigh in on how different types/quadrants would tend to deal with confrontation.** Correct me and stuff too! (Hence the mentions.)

WHAT!? 

First ISTJ to actually respond and this is all you give. No, no, no, mister! 

Where are all you ISTJs? Is there a secret club that I'm not invited to? We all love you for this. You're tearing down walls! Thanks for the response :D&gt;listen to them the first time

If only they would say this in words and not the Ni language of symbols and signs. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 


=/&gt;If you do not, I will lose all respect for you and rebel in passive aggressive ways. If you are incompetent or willfully ignorant, I will bash your skull in (not really, but I'll dream about it lol).

You're my type of person. &gt;ISTJ thoughts will resemble INFP

That's a good way to put it!I take it you're not an INTP then. 

/sWhat does the doorslam look like to you?

Because I think it's a trait purely from a high Ni-low Se dynamic. I'm a little hesitant to say that the trademarked 'doorslam' in fullness can be mimicked by ESTJs. I mean it *can* be copied, but I feel like any ESTJ is unlikely to do in in the way an INFJs Se would.TiNe does.

Edit: It was more a joke about how INTPs are computers.No that's super helpful.

Things are starting to come together. That sheds a lot of light on how Ni doms operate.





To be honest, some days the cognitive functions make a lot of sense but then other days they don't.

&gt;Singular, doom-y vision of the future 

That's Inferior Ni too for you. 

&gt;As a side note, my ESTP brother hates our ENFP cousin and nobody gets why. My mom thinks he's jealous, but when I ask him about it I get the impression that he just sees her in a completely different light than the rest of us. Rigid, self-centered, bossy. And I would shrug it off as my brother being delusional, but he's actually really perceptive about power dynamics that I usually fail to pick up :/

I think it's an interesting dynamic. I wouldn't say it's as difficult as ESTP/INFP but there are some major issues.

My experience with one ENFP is that she has her head up her own ass. She claims to be about something, but when push comes to shove her actions don't reflect that. What's even more frustrating is the apparent desire for NFPs to have authenticity, but they themselves are the least authentic and real people.

She claimed to be passionate about this, this and this but actually undermines her ideals all the time. She see's it as being 'realistic' but I see it as being a spineless, hypocrite. She also becomes rigid but has no goal in mind. Rigidity for the sake of being rigid. Bossiness for the sake of being in control, and self-centered but so unaware that she's actually the most unaware clueless person around.

I like that she 'cares' but it honestly confuses me what she thinks shes doing..

Contrasted with my ESTJ friend. I could say all the same things about him: he's bossy, rigid, controlling... Except the only thing is, is that he **gets stuff done**. His complete competence backs up any sort of things I don't like about him. It earns my respect.

The ENFP that I'm thinking of is dangerously incompentent and incapable. She has minimal skills. She undermines her own 'sentimental' qualities funnily enough. I don't have a problem with incompetent people that are nice enough, but she *always* seems to undermine her own niceness with a falseness about it.

SWEET RELEASE OF ALL THIS ANGER.


It should be salmon. &gt;Agreed. There aren't behavioral similarities, really, in quadras

I've never been so angry at anyone on the Internet. 

/u/CritSrc please stop me from doing something I'll regret.Your inferior Te is acting up.

It's not socionics or MBTI. Quadras, the word may be a socionics thing but the concept is not exclusive to it. In fact, most of the behaviours typical of quadras can be transferred into mbti. 

The quadrants are just types that share the functions. 

Really only Si vs Si elements would have to possibly change.Socionics sucks! I agree.

The idea of the quadra's are not. Although people seem to really really hate the word quadra. What word do you think we should use for MBTI? We could rewrite the quadra page in MBTI words so people wouldn't freak out.
I misspoke! I think we're on the same page with socionics. What sucks is the way it's presented as you said--- and some of the stuff which gets a little strange.

Are clubs the same as the quadra?I like those words.Your sister sounds like an ENFP to me. 

From my experience the ENFP tries to do things differently for the sake of doing things different. ENFPs like novelty for the sake of it it seems. ESFPs are a bit more into doing something because it's fun. They can look *very* similar to someone I think.

What's your type? I think knowing your type and how you two interact is very useful information.

Especially if you share a function with her you might be able to tell just from finding similarities between you two.

***

Also, you might want to take a step back. Assuming someone's dominant function from our perception of them can lead to mistyping. Our brains have a funny way of putting people in boxes and then trying to make them fit. It sounds like she's fairly extraverted from what you described. Would she agree with that assessment? Example: for the longest time I thought my one friend was an extravert-- ENTJ because she is very good at being social. However, my perspective has changed and it has made me wonder how I even thought she was an ENTJ when it's so clear she's introverted(INTJ).

Definitely want to consider her as a whole rather than just in the context of singular functions.

***

She definitely sounds like an ENFP from the description you gave but I mean, we don't know her, however.

There's definitely a couple of discord servers people have made! I'm sure you could find some with the search bar. I don't have any links to any, not just being difficult.Well honestly, reading your OP had my eyes glazed over. That happens with high N types--- often times Ne but sometimes Ni. I think you'll get a lot of responses going straight for Ni dom but I think Ni aux also works.

&gt; have a hard time communicating an idea. 

;) 

Take a read through this: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4vukiy/ni_doms_what_does_ni_feel_like/ post from a couple days ago and see if you can relate to any of these Ni doms.ESTP: PAIIIINNNNNNN, ANGER, RAGEUm. Okay. 

There's a certain condescension that seems to come with being an Ne type. It just seems like Ne users can't help it. They also seem to really hate decisions. The gibberish that comes with being an Ne type is often times too much. While everyone else is letting their ENTP acquaintance ramble on about something *so* tangential-- the ESTPs and ISTPs are the only ones willing to tell them to shut the fuck up.

 I definitely prefer Si types to Ne users at this point. They're kind of homely...? I guess? I mean, boring is a *big* word to use for a whole quarter of the types, and a majority of the population. I just feel like they like to play it safe a lot of the time. They like to play it safe with ideas as well. A lot of the time, their tertiary or inferior Ne makes them uncomfortable to innovating. I like them though because they like me. Something about Se seems to be novel to them. They like the feeling of excitement, but it's also familiar and safe still-- as it *is* just the opposite attitude. 

Ni is really really fascinating. They have issues too, but unlike with Ne there's less of a communication barrier. I can persuade Ni users-- or at least get on the same page as them. 

Se master race.

***

If I had to choose sharing J-functions or P-functions, I would *always* prefer to share perceiving functions. It's not an N or an S thing. 


edit: In all seriousness, everyone's pretty okay. I click with Se users much more easily because we get each other, but I like having variety of the people i interact with.
To add to all the other good info people have provided, I think ENFP opposite is actually ISTP. ISTJ opposite is ENFJ.I'd say on a complete guess,  later than other types develop their tertiary. All ESTPs and all ENTPs together--- I don't know, ages 21-26 probably contains the mean.Why do INFPs and ESTPs hate each other? ;) /u/madsweet 
*SOCIONICS* 

http://i.imgur.com/vPtZp3G.gifESTPs don't see everything as black and white. We understand that the world isn't black and white. It's that while we would prefer to say something is even if it isn't if it looks like it is. 

&gt;If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.

Certain types will have a problem with saying it's a duck even for the time being. 

It's a more fundamental matter of Ne-Si vs Se-Ni. The value of concrete, and experiential data. In the case of the duck, Ne types will ask the always irrelevant, *What if it...?* In which the slight change is always irrelevant to the matter at hand. 

Si types will consider what a duck has looked like in the past. 

Ni types will look at.. somehow? I have no idea.


INFPs tend to add another mix which is completely orthogonal to my values and thats --- personal sentiment/ethics/whatever-you-wanna-call-it. 

***

It just gets tiring when anyone who was bullied automatically assumes the offender was an ESTP. Although ESTPs can fit into the stereotypical jock asshole--- Se-Ti or Ti-Se is a function combination that goes with the flow. Sure, ESTPs are almost certainly the, "It's just a prank bro!" people but those aren't necessarily the same as the the 'jock' archetype.

I hate to (actually not really, no) throw another type under the buss, but the "assholes" are going to be more likely the Je types. They can't help it unfortunately, and until the Ji starts rearing it's head that's just who they are. 

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

 So that's ESTJ, ENTJ, ESFJ, ENFJ. Funnily enough, I think the introverted flips of these types are less likely to offend. There are certainly bystander types though. ESTPs, I feel like, are likely to be around for this, but the ISTP, ESTP, and less so the ESFP, ISFP, are probably the most likeable types. They are the high school archetype of the guy on the football team but is just an all around friendly person, but doesn't seem much deeper than that. 

Edit: ESTPs and ISTPs are your cool drug dealer  that maybe overstays his welcome but he's a nice guy.

/u/bombast-  be free! Tell the world how INFPs hate ESTJs and how that makes duality stupid/wrong/doesn't exist!/r/MBTI NEEDS MORE MEMES. PLEASE.&gt;Perhaps that is the case, or perhaps you will support any theory that suggests that ESTP and INFJ are the ideal pair ;)

Can you give yourself an intervention? Or is that a faux-pas?

I think the experiences with dual types generally seem to be fairly split. There are certainly some types in which it seems to be a more negative review than positive-- specifically J-dom types.

&gt;Though I am willing to accept that many of the stories of conflict between dual types come from people relying on their first impressions and not willing to give a chance to relationships that seem doomed to fail from the beginning. 

I'm not saying I know for sure, but I'm more than willing to accept this as well.

I definitely realize my own obsession with the idea of duality since it speaks to my inferior Ni about meaning and stuff, and balance, and whatever Ni is. However, the fact that duality *is* so potentially hard to get started on with someone--- that's a negative to dual relations in general.

The pairs you have are definitely more real-world, immediately-attractive combo, 

Although, personally, I would choose another ESTP over an ISFJ any day of the week. ESTP master race, represent!



Yeah, this is the theory I am more likely to subscribe to. After experiencing a close dual and semi-dual relationship I feel like I can say there is something to the dom-inf interaction. 

It's something that I would love to convince other people of but people can be set in their own mind. I realize that I may be set to believe in duality a little more than is rational, as well.What would convince you that you do complete each other? ;)

I feel like trying to persuade /r/mbti INFPs that ESTP/INFP are the perfect match would be easier than making you all throw away your prejudices against duality.

Thanks for sharing!Hah! You'll probably have to make a thread on this to convince us. I know people are pretty set that Trump is an ESTP. Y'know, because hes a jerk.I was mostly referring to the general offense people tend to have over anything socionics. 

There seems to be a strong tie between individuality/uniqueness and the apparent intrinsic value of people. So when socionics comes along and attempts to model and simplify reactions between types-- it's a personal offense.

As well, there is the claim that socionics is simply incorrect, in that it doesn't match the real-world at all. Which I haven't found to be the case. 

It was a genuine trigger warning, because I would prefer people disagree with explained reasoning than not reply at all.What is the story about? I'm ESTP.

ENTP, ESTJ, ISTJ, ISFJ roommates?

The ENTP and I got along pretty well, but I'm just kind of tired of him at the moment.

ESTJ and I are okay. I can do stuff with him, but he can be a little obnoxious and loud. Conversation is very easy with him though. In disagreements I usually don't bother. There was one time in which he asserted that I was 'less moral' (not in those words) and I snapped at him because he made a lot of assumptions.

ISTJ.  He's kind of a loser so I almost thought he was an ISFJ (due to stereotypes) but he doesn't really come across as Fe at all. He's nice enough but I really have minimal respect for him-- harsh, I know.

ISFJ guy I thought might have been INFP, ISFP, wasn't too sure. I think I'll stick with ISFJ. He's a weird fellow. Him and the ENTP are really close. 

I don't really talk with most of them anymore. Something about being at home, and around them all the time makes me not want to be around them anymore.I love you more than Socionics. I CAN CHANGE! 

&gt;Enneagram people are respectful of keeping things on topic, why can't Socionics people have the same common courtesy?

With those sweeping generalizations, and us/them mentality you're really having me doubt your INFP typing. Whispers from the Te abyss, perhaps? (My attempt to try and keep it light-hearted.)

In all seriousness, certainly this should be a topic of discussion. However, you first have to define the bounds of "MBTI". Does this include the cognitive functions? Because without that, I can guarantee that you'll cut out *at least* 50% of the population that frequents this sub.

While socionics and certain ideas play into my thoughts on Jungian Psychology as a whole, it's really hard to see where MBTI ends and socionics begins. It's cutting off branches of the same tree. Before you know it, you're cutting down half the tree.  Maybe attempting to define what is acceptable would be more reasonable, but asking people to throw away ideas regarding the same-function groupings (quadra) and a defined model of interaction --- which 'MBTI' provides no coherent alternative to, seems unfair regardless.

I also doubt that anyone comes to this subreddit with a knowledge of socionics. 

I just want to try and figure out what the people who are anti-socionics find is a reasonable compromise because I think throwing we have the potential to throw the baby out with the bath water. 

Thanks for reading, I'd like to know your thoughts on this.
We'll make our own subreddit with blackjack! and hookers!
Of the top of my head:

Bojack: ESTP

Princess Carolyn: INTJ or ENTJ

Diane Nguyen: INFP or ENFP

Mr. PeanutButter: ESFJ

Todd: INFJ..?

Sarah Lynn: ESTP


Edit: I'm not sure of any of these types, to be completely honest though.


You know what, I think these are all right except for Princess Caroline.

I think the Se you see is the ENTJ tert Se being wielded for her purposes. 

I like you. 

Also your english is fine. Very conversational, it's awesome =)I think Se users are likely to find it very quickly. Especially if they are more 'typical'. 

It's very much simple comparison between stereotypes and us-- at least initially.

Overall I feel like Introverts would all have a harder time to type themselves. Introverts and feeling types. I think a lot of the descriptions can put off some feeling dominant types especially if there is insecurity there. I'm willing to admit that this is just a random guess though and a hunch.

I just thought of my roommate whom I'm sure is an ESTJ but I think would type as an ENTJ or ENFJ because of how he sees himself.

So I'll rank what types/functions I think have the most certainty when typing.

ESTP &gt; ISTP &gt; ENTP &gt; INTP &gt; ENTJ &gt; the rest

I would say that of 'the rest' of the types, true INFJs are usually pretty certain of their type. It may take some soul-searching but  that Ti locks them in pretty hard. I feel like ISFJs, however, take a longer time to become certain-- must be the way Ni vs Si works.

Basically, Fi is confusing, Si is confusing, Ni sort of, Ne leads to uncertainty in some people when they don't look like a 'typical' XXXX. Although this is all out of my ass.

***

Side note: Was talking to an INFJ recently, and they are on this subreddit occasionally. They've seen my posts and seem to think I'm an ENTP maybe.

The vibe I got that I was just *not* an ESTP in their mind. 

Direct at anyone who cares, what do y'all think?Nice guy or "nice guy"?ENFP?

 Skeptic. 

&gt;Skeptics are just that ‚Äî skeptical. Not only do they question new information that they receive from others, but they also tend to treat their own thoughts and ideas with some suspicion. They tend to focus this critical perspective on the present, allowing their views to develop as they come across more information. Approximately 5% of the populace are Skeptics.


&gt;You are Reflective: You dislike jumping to conclusions quickly. You‚Äôre adept at reflecting on your own thoughts. When it looks like your intuitions might be leading you astray, you don‚Äôt have a problem overriding them ‚Äî instead, you take the time to re-evaluate the situation and figure out the wisest course of action.

&gt;You are Subjective: People and stories interest you more than facts and figures do; you focus on the essence of ideas over the details. Your mind is more qualitative than quantitative. This trait lets you focus on the big picture over the nitty-gritty.

&gt;You are Carefree: You tend to live in the moment. You don‚Äôt waste a lot of emotional energy fretting about the future. Instead, you focus on getting the most out of life right now.

&gt;You are Skeptical: You treat new information and ideas with caution and skepticism. Spurious arguments rarely fool or confuse you, and your beliefs are based on foundations of hard logic. You possess a fine-tuned BS detector.


&gt;Your quantitative reasoning score: 75%
Your future-based reasoning score: 56.25%
Your evidence evaluation score: 68.75%
Your cognitive awareness score: 50%

I didn't bother reading through all the text at the end. So much text.
Getting into an internal struggle against the abyss. Losing all meaning and hope. Becoming disoriented and confused. Lost in the possibility of the future and the apparent meaninglessness of all time and space. The insignificance of an individual and the futility of life itself. 

Drowning in thought and irrelevancies.

Inferior Ni is a weight that holds me down until death. All while I try to go to sleep.

#\#justNithings

I love INFPs. They are by far my favourite type. We get along so well. It's really easy to understand each other.
 
I think you should go for it! I do think he should go for it. Because fuck the rules, and fuck making smart decisions. Y0l0.The end of spring break?

Sprang break fo eva. You don't believe in grips? Or just grips being negative? I think this is the perfect time to make them fall in love with each other then. Just to prove you can.1) What is your MBTI type? **ESTP**

2) What is your gender? **Male**

3) What type(s) do you admire/respect the most? (Why?) **None because they all suck. ISTPs, I guess because they don't need people?**

4) What type(s) do you Love/adore? **INTJ, INFJ, ISTP tend to hook me, but I think anyone can in reality. It's not hard to make me love you.**

5) What type(s) are the most dateable? **Anyone.
**

6) What type(s) would you be willing/want to marry? **I liked the idea of duality for maximum potential growth, so I'd have to say INFJ-- but in reality probably anyone if it came down to it.**

7) What type(s) make wonderful friends? **People that like me. SPs, and S-types are easier and more natural for me, but I like anyone. I'll say that ESFJs seem to stand out though.**

8) What type(s) make you LAUGH? **Most types. INTPs I tend to laugh at because they are strange. INFJs similarly, but seem to love to laugh at themselves. ESTJs are probably the straight 
up funniest type-- as in they tell me jokes. I laugh at pretty much everyone and everything.**

9) What type(s) are you uncomfortable around or are hard to be congenial with? **INFPs are probably the hardest to relate to. Although INFJs can get pretty cold so that makes it hard to do that too. INTPs as well. There is some disconnect with INTPs that just highlights the fundamental differences in thought of our types.**

10) What type(s) can you not stand/dislike/respect? **ENFP is the only one that gets close to this, but I'm only thinking of one person in my life.**
It's because INFJs always follow me around and ENFPs avoid me.I've been getting that a lot recently. I feel like I have to start deleting my posts to stop from INFJs going through my stuff, hah.

Thanks though! &gt;"chase the dragon"

Only way to put it. There's a high from a song that really gets you the first time. Sometimes songs can do that more than once. Sometimes some songs can do it for a long time. Sometimes it happens after the first pass over a song, sometimes after the second or third. 

The song I've been hooked on the longest since I heard it has been probably, [Universe (Spotify Edit) - Don Diablo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOHKulM-gF0) or [Train in Vain - The Clash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Yl4ehzX-o). I love these songs and can still find great enjoyment out of it but a new song is always something special.

Especially in most of the music I listen to, it can be a big surprise. A song can be, "meh" until I start hearing the build up to the drop and then the drop is just something that makes the wait worth it.You are [literally](http://i.imgur.com/EPP1M4z.gif) the cutest. This is such an INTP thread.

I think /r/mbti would be a happier place if one of you INTPs made a thread like, "The Big Book of INTPisms" or something like that, and all the top comments were simple INTP things that happen to you. Not to laugh at but to appreciate you guys/girls. I just wanna hug all of you!!! ~~It's one of the recommended 'MBTI' combos.~~ No MBTI people believe in semi-duality :[. In socionics it's~~'mirage'~~ 'semi-duality which is one of the optimal pairings.

~~Also, one of the most common relationships I've seen discussed falls into that category: ENTP-INFJ.~~ irrelevant. 

~~For me it would be ESTP-ISFJ. It's alright.. I guess. I think these tend to be pretty common. This is just conjecture though.~~

My semi dual is ESTP-INTJ. We get along pretty well I guess. 
&gt; masochism

hawtThe memes we deserve!Wait in line, buddy!I think in theory, yes. I think that types, ignoring all individuality have the potential for a best match. 

Whether that is the dual, or shared function ordering, or opposite attitudes--- that's to be debated.

Personally I like the idea of the dual because it's the most 'balanced' but there was a thread recently that had me rethink it. I definitely really like the idea at least.

In real life, it seems that the AAAA-BABB is fairly common. I don't think we can predict everything but I definitely think there is a place for personality metrics in relationships. 

Duality pairing: ESTP-INFJ
shared function order: ESTP-ISFJ(or ESTP-ESTP)
opposite attitudes: ESTP-ISTJ

I recently heard someone tell me that the best combination for growth would in theory be the 'conflicting' one (in socionics it's name that). This one would be ESTP-INFP, INFJ-ESTJ, INTP-ESFP. 

You're gonna get a lot of answers which are going to answer the question you didn't ask because people get caught up on the real life aspect of this. 

I definitely prefer the idea of  thinking of types as the abstract class for which real people are implemented as. That's as far as my programming knowledge goes though, hah.

What do you think? Thanks for catching that!Don't see any ESTP comments so far.

ESTP - Perhaps our arrogance, or maybe even just the fact that people perceive it as that way. I think we have a pretty clear understanding of our understanding. 

Our inner world is empty. Personally, I don't know what I think about things until someone tells me, or until it's laid out in front of me. Multiple choice tests are good. 

I wouldn't even say underthinking things, but the simple lack of need for brainstorming. We find the path of least resistance, the quickest way from point A to B. As soon as we find it, we implement it. Sometimes, this can overlook other important factors. Although, I don't think this happens as often as Ne types would like to claim.

Pushing boundaries is fun but can also be bad.

I don't really know what is the weakest point of the type. It's truly hard to generalize with the lack of an online 'ESTP culture' --- aside from 'ESTPs are assholes'. 
If it's not too much to ask, mind outlining why you think they are an unhealthy relationship? Do you think the reason they are unhealthy are due to INFJ and ESTJ reasons or individual person reasons?I'm a little apprehensive on it too, however the person who explained why it's the best had me fairly convinced of it though. Maybe it's because I like the idea of a challenge.I'm excited! =)&gt;I'm the spontanious one, she does the finances etc.

As an ISTJ does!

How long have you been in a relationship with her? 

I definitely can see the cancelling/balancing out in the attitude-swap relations a lot more easily. In my mind, the duality ESTP-INFJ is a stupidly intense, clusterfuck of craziness, where the ISTJ seems significantly more grounded. Depends on the individual.

I guess ISFJ would be a different vibe as well. INTJ is a whole other mess.

I was really close with an ISTJ for a while. Sometime about having the same order function stack provides a same-page-ness unlike the other ones. I feel like the ISTJs typically will take less of the ESTPs shit than an INFJ, or ISFJ or even INTJ will. I guess it depends on a lot of things though.*must... hold back... the tears*Well said about the ESTJ.

I think a lot of behaviors people attribute to the INFP are actually a lower-stack Fi. 

In fact, when people are able to so easily saying things like, "Fi sucks, INFPs suck" I usually have to wonder if what they perceive to be Fi, or Ti or Te (or whatever) is actually the type with that in the lower stack.

I think this is especially prevalent with people we don't know as well. People that we may know in a very specific context, or a stressed context can appear a certain way. I really think stress brings out unhealthy manifestations of lower stack. Not necessarily, "in the grip" though. Thoughts? /u/peppermint-kiss, since I know you don't really like the idea of the grip but it seems that you agree that stress can bring out aspects of the lower-stack. 

To add to that, what about vulnerability? I had the thought about when we trust someone, and are vulnerable we are more willing to act out of our uncomfortable functions. What do you think on that?

The baby-XXXX in anyone is the worst most of the time anyways. The baby-ISFJ in the ENTP is kinda cute though.

Are you sure you're not just an ENFP still?

I feel like this is something an ENFP would do.I think you are still a feeler type.

I think you're are still an ENFP however. I'm willing to think it's possible to change types, but I can't believe you can choose to nor that it would happen in a few months.

I'm willing to be wrong though, if you can elaborate on how this happened. Smash or nah?What? Who told you that?Noice. 

What is this guy's reddit username? He's awesome. Is it you? 

&gt;personally

It might be better to get someone more intimidating! Can someone explain what exactly is happening?

This is such a weird thing. I'm super confused by what is happening. Any people that frequent /r/INTP know what happened? I know a couple ESFJs that always look at me like I'm literally the best. It's nice I guess. 

I think ESFJs and ESTPs can be good friends though if there are mutual interests that hold them together rather than just each other.One of my closest and best friends I've ever had is an ISTP. She lives really far away now, but we would always run together several times a week and hang out a lot. ESTPs and ISTPs are great :Dhttp://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.gifThat's no fun though.To add on, one of the things that it looks like in INFJs seems to be very rash decisions. INFJs can make very impersonal, 'logical', harsh choices. The 'doorslam' is this. The INFJ needs to deal with whatever the offense is. Instead of dealing with it in a reasonable manner and one at a time, it seems that it will build up inside the INFJs mind and then explode in a fiery display of Se-Ti. Inside it usually appears that the INFJ will attempt to surgically and logically remove emotionality/sentiment from the equation. They will make a decision to *do something* because of a fairly logical/smart reason and then that's that usually. It takes some pretty extreme stress for them to do it though. What it seems like is the cutting off of one's limb. One of the main fascinations I have with it is that they almost seem incapable of changing their mind when they get to that point-- hence the name "doorslam".

The INTJ is a lot more explicitly emotional. Normally cold, and cool, and maybe even aloof and INTJs Se is more fiery it seems. There's an internal fire, and and internal anger. Again, it'll be about doing something. In my personal case, I had an INTJ 'downgrade my friendship', after tearing me apart. 

The inferior Se can also involve what it seems a deliberate choice to make 'bad' decisions. 

&gt;impulsively doing things that go against your vision or goals for your life

I think this is the best way to say it. It's not even a matter of *choosing* to go against your goals and internal strivings. It's simply choosing to be unaware of them--- or maybe that's just my Se-Ni experience.

Quoting myself like an asshat.

The question is now: What are all the MBTI types as vehicles?
&gt;become enfp myself.

No. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!I think INFJs/INTJs could really let loose. They're likely to be the roaster that is more mean than funny. It's cute in it's own way. Yeah I just saw it in netflix. My brother told me it was boring when he saw it in theatres so I didn't bother despite the star-studded cast of some of my favourite actors.

I remember being so angry at the end of the movie. Super sad, but mostly angry. I watched this one after the wolf of wall street and I really want to get into finance now. I apologize to all Ne-Ti users for the inconvenience I have caused.TIL my moon sign is Pisces. What does this mean compared to sun sign?I agree! Yes. I think INTPs, also but in a different way.ESTP, M, 21Se, from my point of view. 

&gt;Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I‚Äôm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just, do things. The mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon‚Äôs got plans. You know, they‚Äôre schemers. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I‚Äôm not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how, pathetic, their attempts to control things really are. So, when I say, ah, come here, when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know that I‚Äôm telling the truth. 

-Joker, The Dark Knight (2016)ESTP.

Social (4.43), body movement (4),  self (2.71)Same here!Course not!

Self was 2.71 at my third highest. Social 4.43 and Body movement 4I may not be an ESTP. I think I'm just a really bad INFJ!Thank you. 

MBTI culture paints the ESTP as an idiot. It paints us as someone unwilling to critically think. I feel this is furthest from the truth.

The Se/Ne vibe may seem so similar to Ni and Si though, that I feel they confuse it. I think it's similar but distinct. Just as the two types are. 

Any person can reasonably confuse the two. ESTPs, aren't likelier to be conventionally dumber, either.  

Go us and I guess ENTPs for being different but probably equally as awesome!!!
Showing off with your 4 self. I find that I focus too much on the wording. 

Like, I'm good at learning physics and math, but do I really *enjoy* it?

With all these technicalities I tend to score lower on things then I should, maybe. Wow!!!!!! We have so much in common bb ;D&gt;133 comments

RIP /u/CrowdedHighways. ~~He~~ ~~She~~ They will be missed.FIXED!

Edit: I didn't *assume* your gender. Sorry ~~bro~~.I think selfishness is inherent to all introverted functions. FIGHT ME INTROVERTS.I love you. 

&gt;Being forced to make commitments or plans before they‚Äôre ready
Being forced to make decisions or eliminate options before they‚Äôre ready

And yes, this is probably my biggest trigger out of those.I think I'm either an ESTP with a fucked up Fe somehow, or a REALLY confused INFJ haha.

I really really connect with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4z14y1/my_estp_life_guidebook_for_estp_happiness/) that KBnation posted. I definitely feel the misplaced/misdirected Fe. I guess it's good to see that now though.ENFP?I like you. They didn't say it related to selfishness.The last letter in MBTI signifies whether or not the types first *extraverted* function is perceiving or judging.

So Ps all extravert a perceiving first(S or N). Js will have their first extraverted function be judging. For extraverts, this means that their first function is J if their last letter is J, P if their last letter is P. 

For introverts this is a distinction socionics like to make. In MBTI, an INTP is a judging type, whereas an INTp(INTJ) is a perceiving type. It can get confusing, but it also changes the focus of the systems slightly.

The first extraverted function is what we see often. It's what's readily available to others, in my experience. The Ne of an INTP is immediately obvious. The lack of 'control' their Ne may take will alert me that they may be introverted-- but it's not the first thing available.  Heavily introverted individuals, it's the 'lack of' external things that makes one recognize their introversion. As we get to understand an individual more, it changes. However, if I'm engaging small-talk with someone their first extraverted function is available whilst their introverted one is not necessarily obvious.

***

I guess I just wonder if the distinction of J's 'expecting' and P's 'offering' relates more to the dominant function or not. If it *does* have anything to do with our first outward/extraverted function, are there any patterns that can be observed?

I know OP is high and we can choose to simply ignore it, but I want to see if they're onto something.&gt;Oh yea believe it or not you probably have it.

Yup. Thanks for telling /u/brynhildra. I know an ISTP and she thinks nothing of her lone wolf, badassery. I find it so strange because it's quite clear to me and everyone else.

Yeah it's not a stereotype at all.  The stereotype is that ENFPs are woefully unaware of reality and extremely conceited-- so I mean, they're getting it partially right.

I think ENFPs can often inspire enthusiasm in others, however. LOL!

You're hilarious. 

Se users already love you. It's basically an unwritten rule. 

You also don't want tert. Fe. I think some types are better at hiding that low F stack but ESTP is not one of them. 

&gt;but a healthy ISTP has a lot of pride and self-superiority. 

That seems woefully ironic to me.No one's doing that.I mentioned this to someone else, but I would love to hear what you think.

Where does an ISTP place their pride/understanding and how does that look differently from an INTP? It seems like INTPs really care about being *smart* in the scheme of things.There you go again! Talking about yourself. 

When will anyone pay attention to *me*!?

Do you know how much pain,

&gt;Easily get distracted. Enjoy doing morally questionable things (throwing rocks at old people)and are at the same time unable to think of the consequences. Future is a mystery to them.

caused me?!

Actually. That's a pretty lame description. I want something as harsh as the INFJs got. I wanna be part of the fun too!

&gt;"*fun*"&gt;ISTJ train

Is it really a train if there's only two of you? :/I just want to be insulted like the rest of you. =(**What Talking To INFJs Is Like:**

**Me:** *How are you?*

**INFJ:** *Oh I'm great! I just got a new puppy. I named him Simon. He's a golden retriever. I was talking to my sister about whether I should get a cat or a dog, but she said that if I had the time to love the dog and care for it they are better emotional investments.*

**Me:** *Oh that's really cool! I love dogs but I don't think I could take care of one. I can barely take care of myself! (chuckles)*


**INFJ:** *Yeah he's great!*

(pause)

**INFJ:** *Oh god, I'm sorry, I'm just talking about myself way too much. How are you?*

**Me:** (confused): *Fine but I want to hear more about Simon!*

**INFJ**: *(silence)*

**Fin**

***

Don't worry about it, INFJ friends. =( You don't talk about yourselves as much as you think you do.No /thread. Just give up like ENFPs are supposed to.

Seriously though, **don't.** 

ENFPs tend to be hopeful, and vulnerable. This is a good thing in a cold world. It's likely that you tend to bring out the best in people. 

You can do whatever the hell you want. Excelling in STEM fields has little to do with how smart you are. It's just a matter of being a person who can do the job and that people don't hate.  What dent do you want to make in the world? Then do that. Seriously, it seems ridiculous to tell an ENFP this since y'all tend to be the most hopefully optimistic type.

Yes, ENFPs are good. Just as good as anyone else. [Be the change you want to see in the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW9j_3fyXiw) What are limits to an ENFP who can find the path to their goal? 

I don't know what's getting you down, but yes ENFPs are good. ENFPs are the ESTPs of the intuitives but failure doesn't make you give up. Once you know what you want, you get it, you chase it. You'll chase it until you get it and you do it with a smile. It just seems like you can't help it.

Don't be afraid of failure. The one ENFP I knew (who I honestly *really* don't like), seemed to afraid to fail. Failure is what you define it as. 

&gt;What the hell am I supposed to do, make a living off acting and curating abstract modern art?

If you want to. I guess I need to know, **what do you want to do?**

And to remind you of this,

&gt;The easiest way to restore all of my hope for humanity is to be near an ENFP.

Because as much as I almost hate the ENFP I know, I feel like she could make me change my mind after a brief conversation with her that I'll never have. 



Really? I guess I can see that. 

One of my roommates is ESTJ. He definitely irritates me in some ways. I would never say I dislike him, just than I can only stand him in smaller doses. We're similar enough to do things together but too dissimilar to have any sort of deep relationship.These are so good. I love you. Thanks for making everything great.Lady ISFP is Max, the protagonist from the game [Life is Strange](http://www.lifeisstrange.com/agegate.php).

Man ISTP is Engineer from [Team Fortress 2](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Engineer).

No clue on lady ESTP, however.Uninspired, lazy and darkly ironic, just like life.[Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh](http://i.imgur.com/kRrkfUU.gifv)What he said. I feel feelings gud.New thread tomorrow: What happened when /u/quiteafewfireflies was in 5th grade? &gt;My bride and best man are both INFPs

That sounds.... Hard.

Are they at least friends? Can INFPs be friends with each other? Is that even a possible thing to happen?Why do you think it's incorrect?What? You don't like the Fi vs Fe raging?Would you bang your ESTP friend? The real questions are asked. Sometimes Fi just seems so nonsensical though. 

Just like Ti can. Not to me, but to others.No I don't relate to that. I think it also depends in what way that happens. 

I don't have experience with either Pi (Si/Ni) function since my inferior is Ni.

I'll be honest that it sounds really *intuitive* in nature. Abstract, not readily concretely apparent. I'm certainly leaning towards Ni. As I said no experience with either, however. 

Posting mostly because I want you to guess what kind of person I am. *Pretty please?* 

If you want you could even make a new post about it where you tell everyone my deepest darkest secrets-- whatever it takes to have people pay attention to me. /s Just making it easier for them. ;)
It's official this is a Reddit mbti meme. The meme we deserve.I don't know why /u/TheG3cko  was being downvoted.

&gt;What is your opinion on the dynamic of this relationship?

It's difficult.

&gt;Do you think these types are compatible? 

Not the types. The people might be.

&gt;What are problems they may face?

They literally will hate each other at their cores. At best they will not understand each other but be bound together by individual values / circumstances. Se dominants have hard time garnering respect for Ne, and Ne doms have a hard time garnering respect for Se doms.

I mean, anything's possible but you're playing with fire here. Has an ESTP/ENFP caught your eye? 

My advice, talk to them for a little bit and you'll realize that you're too different. 

Also ESTP can look like ENTP and ENFP can look like ESFP which changes the whole dynamic.http://i.imgur.com/cxpi5MH.jpgOkay so I have reason to believe I am harmonizing. Maybe.

Thanks for linking this!You're also super nice and likeable!!! :D What's your subtype?&gt;hunch that opposite types work really well

[duality](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/138-Making-Duality-Work-Meged)

I love the idea of duality, too!I'm apparently good at conversing in person. I've had this pointed out a bunch.

I've also got that I'm enthusiastic/youthful/excitable.

The above are mostly after short conversations.

Recently people have been commenting on weight gain over the past months. These are people I've known before, obviously.

Uhm, the *first* first thing is probably my eyebrows.. I guess? I have a fairly contrasting face.

The first nonphysical is that **I talk really loudly.** I think my [highest rated Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3xkazy/what_flaw_of_yours_ended_up_benefiting_you_somehow/cy5j5ub) is some self-deprecating humour based on that. Edit: Just kidding, topped it just this week in cringepics.
&gt;caricature of confidence

Hmm. That's really interesting. What type do you think your roommate might be? &gt;every stupid thing that I think.

That's why ISTP is true master race type. 

This comment is so pointless. I recognize the irony.I don't know. It's a skill I'd like to be proficient at but I just don't have the need for it most of the time.

I don't think I've lied recently so I'm unsure.Everything I say is false.http://i.imgur.com/w8fIA.gifBut you have to note that while people can be good at different things intelligence is a pretty static characteristic of a person. It includes memory, reasoning, etc. Says who?

I had an INTJ screaming at me because we disagreed on what a date was. 

"That's not how science works! You can't just do that!" All while spouting emotion-fuelled angry nonsense.

INTJs want to believe in an objective 'right' way of thinking but somehow don't see that it's always somehow completely aligned to what they think already. Isn't that a little peculiar?


Oh damn. Love this video.

I'm gonna watch all of them. 

Also, I think after watching the video it should become fairly obvious to mistyped INFPs that they are in fact *not* INFJs. He very clearly illustrates the types here. 

In fact, the INFJ begins to look more like the ESTP in this video, I find.

Also I don't think he portrayed the INFP inaccurately either. He's pretty neutral in this. I think he was very accurate as well.Heh. ENFJ as banana is cute.It's so cute though!&gt;He does seem to over value the INFJ's use of Ti though. By the way he's emphasisng it, you'd think EXTPs and IXTJs are closet feelers.

They are! Don't tell anyone our secrets though.

To win![Subtypes are a thing!](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/515pqs/introduction_to_the_dcnh_subtype_system/)Something about the matter-of-fact-ness about the way he says it. Especially contrasted with a lot of the INFP vs INFJ stuff that happens online where everything is taken to be more subjective.To have at least one redeeming quality about myself.Nope &gt;She*

All credibility lost. RIP.I definitely would like some discussion about it. Why though?&gt;Physics + Aerospace Engineering 

What kind of physics? I assume it was physics relating to aerospace engineering-- but I just wanna make sure.

I like the idea of an Aerospace Engineer taking particle physics classes lol.I guess. I really wanna be a more cool intuitive type though! :[Addressing points:

1. Okay. Fair enough.

2. I don't really know how important they are though. One of the things I mention is my fear of my own indifference. I think deep down I really don't give a fuck-- at least I fear that. I think that's a good point for Fi but I *really* don't see Te in myself which follows from having Fi. 

3. Yeah. It's hard to concern myself with hypotheticals. I don't know why I was doubting my Se nature. 

4. Yeah for sure! I wasn't really doubting that. I'm starting to value getting away from people I don't like. Perhaps I am becoming more socially introverted than I have been previously.

I agree with you fully on the Se-Ni axis. I'm definitely considering the ESFP and ENFJ now that you mention it. I'm quite unsure because I think I'm a bit biased. 

I really appreciate your input to this post. I hope others can add their input to your post to get some more thoughts flowing. What I wrote is 100% of my thought process. I don't know how to add to that with it still being true.Why though?ENFPs are the worst. Please no. /sSomeone is super insistent that I'm not an ESTP!You're right. I'm an ESTP. I don't know why I was doubting myself.I really want to be able to interact people on a more heady.
 basis. I just have a hard time thinking 'around' a subject.

I want to be able to ask questions that make people think and talk about truly interesting things to intuitive people. 

If someone asks me something I find it extremely easy to find an answer I think is right based on what will work. I can see other sides if someone provides more info, but I can't brainstorm for the hell of it.How do I feed it? The Fe-Ni grip is something fucking terrible. I can see why I'd want to discard it.

&gt;The main downside of contraries is that they do nothing to protect each other in social settings.

What do you mean?This is one additional dichotomy. The fuck are you talking about?It's both. 

What if the person inside is unknown to the person outside??I want to believe your username but your flair is triggering me. ;)By whom?

Edit: who vs whom. Same.

Likes:

- purposeful interaction

- real, authentic-to-self people

- people attempting to read me

- people that ask for my help meaningfully(not as charity)

- admitting when you don't get it

Dislikes:

- pretentious people

- excuses

- pretending like we're 'cool'

- assuming what I mean

- people who shut down if they are offended

- telling me what to do

- being unable to apologize

***

Purposeful Interaction: I enjoy people who are very clearly interacting with me for a purpose. The purpose can be to simply get to know me, or to enjoy my company. If you're interacting with me for the sake of wanting to say something because you hate being alone in your head, you're going to have a shitty time. 

Real, Authentic-To-Self Interaction: People who are aware of their shitty behaviour. People who don't try to hide their flaws are the most amazing people. You do you.

People Attempting To Read Me: Guessing what I'm thinking while genuinely wondering my thoughts on something is *super* fun. If you can guess what I'm thinking it's even better. I get a warm fuzzy feeling when someone knows me in that way. 

People That Ask for My Help: Asking for my help based on what skills you perceive me to have. I would prefer not to be included as a token. 

Admitting When You Don't Get It: This connects to authenticity. 


***

Pretentious People: Who likes pretentious people? It doesn't make sense to come up to me and talk to me, or ask me a question and try and hide it.

Excuses: Excuses for inaction are a big part of this, as KBnation wrote already. However, almost all excuses are useless. 

Pretending Like We're Cool: I know a couple people that I'm no longer friends with. I see them semi-frequently. Nothing makes me want to tear them apart, and flip the fuck out more than their 'civility'. I'm civil to idiots, acquaintances that I don't like (however rare)-- people who betray me and then minimize me on top of that by doing this don't get my civility. The other stuff below is a pretty good guide to pissing an ESTP off.

Assuming What I mean: I said what I meant. Learn some fucking words. I don't have a large INTP vocabulary, but I have enough words that I can use them to say almost exactly what I mean. Just because *you* think this word means something else, doesn't make *me* wrong. You're a fucking idiot and I'll get a dictionary on your ass. Being right means enough to me sometimes that I'll pull out all the technicalities.

Apart from words themselves, assuming my emotions is as no-no. It really confuses me. It takes a lot of my agency away when someone attempts to read my emotions only to assume them incorrectly. I let it happen a lot with an ENFP I knew. She projected her issues onto me. At first it's confusing for me. I'll probably even agree with your assessment. For a lot of the time I can actually believe that that's what's happening in my mind. This is a way to get me to resent you once the burden you have put on me finally sinks down onto my shoulders. Fuck you. Note: There's a gigantic difference between giving me options and telling me. It's the whole 'ESTP Thing' of needing to be able to make our own choices. The ESTP's agency is our identity, I think.

People Who Shut Down If They Are Offended: I want to stab the Hugh Mungus lady. She's a fucking idiot. I get she's offended, but what the fuck. I've never had that happen to that magnitude, but *many many many many* people do this. I don't want to assign common types to do this but I think I could. I don't think it's a common INTJ thing (maybe it is..?) but one of my friends completely shuts down if someone disagrees with her. She gets angry but doesn't acknowledge her own anger yet is completely submerged in it.

I'll admit to being an asshole here. I enjoy to offend people once they get to this point. This is something I'm working on but it's an internal struggle not to try and 'win' every argument.

Telling Me What To Do: Fuck off. You're not the boss of me. 

Being Unable To Apologize: Just say sorry. It's so fucking easy. A real apology makes everything better. Even now, if the people that I would say I occasionally have feelings of hatred for were to apologize to me. As in, *really* apologize, I would be friends with them again. I would weep and instantly take them back. I think more of my 'hatred' shows when I have zero belief that these people are even able to apologize. I have zero respect for people who can't say sorry. Fuck conditional apologies. Fuck non-apologies, fuck excuses. You fucked up, own it, acknowledge my hurt, acknowledge our relationship and move on. Guaran-fucking-tee I've already done it and 100% meant it. It's not a competition, but if it was you would have lost.

***

Writing the dislikes was a challenge to stay calm.

When INFJs just want to be cold, ruthless people but everything In their nature betrays them. Literally the cutest thing.What's evilness?

I think INFJs can have pure rage in them. They can be focused on a goal for a *long* time. I feel like having an INFJ *hate* you means you're basically done.

I feel like ESTPs can get to a point of doing evil things pretty easily. However it's much more indifferent I would imagine.

ESTJs as well.

Self-justification can come pretty easy I would think for low Fi types.

 It really depends what each type determines is 'right'. ESTJs I think have the most overall potential for being ruthless.

What's evilness? You have to answer that first. Is it simply a matter of killing more people? Is it the disregard for human life? What is it?


I know an INFP who I used to be friends with. She approached me and told me she couldn't really be my friend anymore. I was definitely in the wrong.

Anyways, fast forward to recently. I asked her if we were friends and if we were cool. I asked her if I would see her still, if we could be real adult friends-- now that she's out of school and I wouldn't see her as much. She said of course.

Anyways it's been a while since that, I wanted to try and catch up with her. She gave me a flat, "Busy all week, .. yada, yada, yada."

Does she actually want to be friends again? What are your thoughts on this, as an INFP?

***

What do INFPs dislike in conversation? What ruins a previously pleasant interaction?

How do I make INFPs like me? How do I make you like me? 

If I were to sit beside you on the bus what would my first impression of you be?"You seem like the glue that holds the group together"

"You see everyone"

"You're an enigma"

"You're a good reciprocater of conversation."

"You're insightful for your age." 

1, 2, 4 are pretty obvious to myself. 3 and 5 really took me by surprise. Splitting it up like this is not getting a fully picture.

I think the tendency leans more towards 

Se doesn't like Ne but doesn't mind Si. Prefers Se, Ni.

Si doesn't like Ni but doesn't mind Se. Prefers Ni, Se.

Ne doesn't like Se but doesn't mind Ni. Prefers Ne, Si.

Ni doesn't like Si but doesn't mind Ne. Prefers Ni, Se.


Even this turns out to be fairly incorrect in reality. My project supervisor. 

I'm trying to read him constantly. He constantly seems like he's thinking about something.

He has a calm way of speaking. His tone seems completely in spite of his words. He will say something that seems like a hard ass but in the most calm, even joking tone.

The first thing he sent on Slack was some gifs. He's always joking it seems but it's not clear to anyone but me in my group.

My previous supervisor for my job was an ENTP I think. He had an irreverent way of joking. He was all over the place and is extremely entertaining. I still take a class with him.

My current supervisor seems very clearly introverted from my perception. I'm pretty sure he's a Ji type but other than that it's hard to pinpoint since he's in an authority position in an academic setting. 

I could honestly see him as an INFJ but it's hard to say.

How many in the ESTP bin?How'd you screw with him?Physical bully? Because I'm curious..?Well now I'm curious about both.
Pretty weak, but just happened recently.

I went to a party I wasn't invited to. One of the hosts hates me. 

It was more of a get-together-- like 15 people. It was pretty lame too. I knew everyone there. I was only there to make this person uncomfortable because I knew they wouldn't kick me out.

Other than that I'm a fairly nice guy, I'd like to think.Although, I was about to say that this was an ENFP starter pack. Maybe you're an ENFP!- Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother
- Sterling Archer from Archer
- Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul

Dank dreams can't melt steel memes.Maybe I should have made it more clear that I was looking for the most stereotypical/insulting responses possible. Yes I did. You think I actually want to have a real serious conversation? #ESTPI don't know. That's sounds pretty INFJ to me ;)ESTP: get high af

That's the kind of stuff I was looking for. Nothing meaningful/real.There we go, now we're getting into the INTP spirit.Yeah you're too coherent to be an INFJ.R8 8/8Wow. Too subtle for me. Both.I think you're a weird INTP/INFJ hybrid. /sNah, INTJs are just outwardly mean inwardly nice INFJs.. INFJs are outwardly nice inwardly mean INTJs.

I'm basically an expert. /s&gt;too Thinkery to be INFJ

nice.ENFT? Does it relate with neuroticism in big five?See this is why I hate ENFPs!!!! /sSame /r/INFJ is interesting. Also, /r/ESTP is empty. An extravert, fam. 

ESTP added to that group makes you guys go from borin af to FUCKING AWESOME. Also, all ISTPs/ISFJs love ESTPs. Plus the INFP/ESTP conflict could be entertaining and add meaning to your futile lives.

And INTJ makes the most sense in reality.I immediately fell for it. &lt;3 love at first sight.Maybe you (inferior) EXXJs! But as /u/snowylion  said, us EXXPs never need time alone.

In fact, don't ever let your EXXP have time alone-- this kills the EXXP.

In all seriousness, I've noticed recently that I've begun to require more alone time. I think it's a mix of the fact that I've been more busy recently though. I have to be 'on' or 'up for a lot more of the day. That being said, 'up' or 'on' is *who I am*. It just kind of feels like being burned out after a while.

It's not like I introspect either. The most introspection I do is a) on reddit, and b) talking with people.. extraspection? My 'introvert' time consists of listening to some music on spotify, replying to posts on this subreddit, reading reddit, and sleeping.

I definitely gain energy from people though. This might be the socially/functional discrepancy I've seen you make. :[

Only if it's a sensory deprivation chamber as well....

If I have to introspect-- better at least make it fun.Yes. Make a new post and ask /r/mbti to refine it further. Soon we'll have the purest MBTI we can have.What are you doing there? I'm from Edmonton. 17/21 years lived there--- well the surrounding area.Where is that first one?Turn down for what?Honestly, I was a shy weird kid in high school. I've transitioned to my true ESTP "bro" state in the past four years of college. It's great.

I don't know why anyone wouldn't wanna be a bro. Not a douche bro, just a regular bro.

Everyone likes a chill bro. Part of being a chill bro is the 'fam' and 'savage' and 'dude'. It's great.

Everything's great.ESTP, engineering physics.

I have always had a good memory, so school has been fairly easy. As such, my first year I went to classes semi frequently. In the second semester, I don't know if I was depressed or something but I would sleep probably 17 hours a day. I didn't  go to classes from January to the end of February--- even though I lived in residence.

I passed all but one course in the second semester. Second year my habits got better, as in I went to class. I still never studied.

I think this last year (my fifth/last year) might have been the first time I've studied outside of exam season. This quantum mechanics shit is hard.

I've definitely grown in my work habit, so that's good.How much do you hate yourself but don't realize it? If it's at least a 7 you're probably an ESTP.  I think they mean Ti subtype.

The subtype theory on most of the socionics websites only includes two subtypes. It has definitely been expanded to four. I think having all four allows for a more comprehensive description of a person.

Creative, dominant, harmonizing and something else.... are the names of the subtypes. So maybe INFJ was right?Don't even have to read the rest of the post--- you're an INTJ.

SP fam #1 famWhat else is on the table?What are the other types you think you might be?Was one of them ESFP?

I guess.

My observations are more internal. I associate you with one of my closer friends. 

I have thought about her type a lot--- and 3-4 mo. ago you had me convinced she was INTJ because you two sounded/read very similarly in my mind.

Attempting to separate from that, I would probably guess maybe ENTJ-- which isn't some huge jump. This is if I'm not allowed to say INTJ again. 

I remember going through your post history and getting the feeling that outwardly you tend to stand up for your views more often than others. However, despite this you seem pretty open to input. Right or wrong? Thoughts in response to these ramblings?

If someone were to meet you, and spend some time at a pub in a group of your friends what would their impression of you be? Is it accurate?It's really interesting to me to read the similarities between you and my friend. I 100% project my admiration of her onto you but you sound like a fun person. 

Teasing is the way to an ESTPs heart.

I like the contrast of the INFJ and the INTJ.  I like that you INTJs seem so harsh and prickly yet you're just a bunch of ol' softies. Whereas INFJs are the reverse of that. 

Do you have any one close that's an ISTJ? Is there really any similarity?

I don't think I know any other INTJs which bothers me!



The 'whole stack perspective' is very important I think. I'm glad to read that that was considered in this case.

It's really easy to look at a person and get lost in who they are because people can have so much more nuance than the types allow for. 

Typing off of the general *feel* of a person is pretty good when you get to experience someone in different situations I think. 

So while you could look like whatever type to some randos online, I would imagine your closer friends would be able to type you pretty easily. 

Just know that I will insultingly now add that your indecisiveness is due to your dominant Ne. Good choice! 

I'd probably try and stay within the quadra too. ISTP seems nice but I kind of like feeling unhinged. 

INFJ seems to got it all together though so maybe them. 

ENFJ would probably be the slightest change maybe. I don't know how ENFJ guys fair though.That's an interesting perspective.

Dom-Tert loops will get you stuck extraverted or introverted. Since the system is based upon the idea that balance = positive, wouldn't this be negative then? Since Dom-Tert loops are actively unbalanced?

Does the Ni-Ti loop feel nice to you? I know that my Se-Fe one isn't that fun, since people hate me much more easily.Who has it worse: ENFJ guys or INTJ girls? ;) 

It must just be the introversion that makes me think people have got it together.What types do you feel like you, and INTJ women in general attract? Doesn't just have to be MBTI types-- just anyway to see if there is any sort of pattern?

I kept thinking of Chris Pratt. I was super confused too. Then I realized you meant Rob Lowe's character.Being a 'cool girl'? You're not a cool girl already?

I just realized that I know an ENFJ and I totally misjudged her. She's awesome. Where do I meet more ENFJs? Or, I could just make the ENFJ be my friend!

How was it having your former supervisor being the same type as you? I feel like I couldn't imagine an ESTP supervisor. I don't feel like I'd like them.You're saying it like it's a bad thing! That sounds so fun. 

I don't know what offices you have worked at! 

Actually you're probably right though. My previous comment kind of had me thinking about how I have high expectations. Except I don't! I'd be an awesome boss. Dicks out!
Are you the same lawdudette?Is this a copy pasta? Or a serious thing?

/u/peppermint-kiss please I'm scared and I trust you.

Edit: also I can be violently racist or sexist if it's for the public good!The "start a cult" flashing over the sub. Or something.I don't wanna say harsh because I feel like that'd be the equivalent of saying that ISTPs are harsh. It's true a lot of the time-- but it's not really the full truth.

INFJs inside are straight-forward and clear cut in their hearts. I feel like that's the striving I see in the infj sub a lot. It really makes me see the 'anima' in action.

Where I want to be more internally connected in my emotional unhinged-ness, the INFJ seems to be working from the opposite side.

The only true opposite *is* the ESTP, but I think that the INTJ is an interesting flip around that I've got to see.  I've got to see a side of my INTJ friend no one would expect. Something about tertiary Fi is really interesting. 

One of the things that we keep coming back to is that she (the INTJ) just doesn't see why I care what other people think. I care perhaps too much, but at it's core the nature of the external 'feeling' vs her subjective, introverted feeling is what causes this distance. 

I love seeing the similarities of types in real life. It's interesting if you realize the types that share dominant functions aren't the same letter flip.

As in, IPs / EJs share their dominant with the N-S flip, and the rest are an F-T flip. 
&gt;I consider that a virtue anyway.

Of course you do, you INFJ &lt;3.

&gt;So you say INFJ's want to disconnect a bit more from their emotions.

It kind of seems that way. I think the general idea is that INFJs seem to be more acutely aware of their need for balance-- this might have something to do with the high stack Pi.


Are you a guy or girl? Were the INTP, ESTP guys or girls?fuck u m8You're absolutely right I think. The "anything is possible" attitude is really attractive. Entjs seem to have it too. They're scary though.It's pretty obvious for *most* INFJs/ISTPs. 

The ISTP I know will listen and makes it clear, and wants to help. We are close friends and she'll tell me if something is "rubbish". Otherwise I don't think she'd be openly disagreeing in some inferior-Fe fear.

INFJs can also be the same, however.

What you need to consider is their initial impression. What do they exude for people who are a little more than acquaintances? Are they warm? Are they cold? 

For example, from myself. I tend to get emotionally ~~vulnerable~~ pathetic very easily when someone asks. When someone cares, and I sense that--- I really can let go and it's not pretty. It will make me look like an ENFJ, but like a crazy one. People who meet me, and don't get the special shortcut will tend to see me as a pretty clear ESTP. 

Don't overthink it. Just ask a friend about what they think he's like.What does open-minded mean?What a beautiful table. I think this is a good chart.Inferior function is magnetic. 

If someone's not experiencing this I'd say they're mistyped. Or fooling theHey! That's me in that screenshot.Nah man. INFJs love me. If ESTPs are Overt Narcissists, does that mean INFJs are Covert Narcissists?

Title.

Specifically considering Ne/Ni vs Se/Si. How do we understand the opposite of our preferred perception?

Intuition: the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning.

Is this what we mean in MBTI? Having N as the lowest in my stack this is  *very* hard for me to understand. 

***

&gt;What appeals to me in Se (I may be way off) is it's immediacy. It's like clear cognition of what is, an untainted perception (god, don't laugh guys, I'm just very tired so this comes out like this). It's like a concrete experience of now that is so clear you can see a thread of how that now will/may unravel in the future (Ni). But what I kind of think about Se, it's that because being trumps over any should be/could be, it sees the values of it's perception (Ti/Fi) in outside things rather then constructs in it's head. So the world is fully immediate and real for it, I think? Well, maybe it's not Se, maybe it's just how I think of Se dom/aux.

This comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mobr4/which_cognitive_function_do_you_like_the_best_and/d3x2zd8) seems to accurately describe how I tend to feel on a daily basis. It may be a bit embellished but I had always assumed that others felt the same way. Do they? 

What is the Ne dom. 'experience'? What is the Ni dom. 'experience'? 

What is the Si experience?





&gt;Well, mostly I just don't spend that much time thinking about it, I just enjoy people when I'm with them and don't even think of trying to understand them more fundamentally (or whatever it's called) the rest of the time.

&gt;But primarily I work from the basis that all people are fundamentally the same, we were all children once and are all still a little confused about the world, all trying to understand it, searching for happiness and meaning, all a little lost some times, and all (some less consciously than others) trying to do what's best for those we love. It's the who we love (whether friends, family, the public, the self...) and what 'best' means to them (wealth, knowledge, happiness, God...) that is where people differ. 
So that's usually where I come from if I do bother to think about it - we're all a bit pathetic (but in a livable way) and trying our best. And only show a little tiny bit of what is going on inside to the people around us, and often different tiny bits to different people.I did not mean to use an exclamation mark.

Also, dealbreakers and dealmakers!I'd have to say INFJs. All of them are so damn cute. Although from the /r/infj sub,  it appears that they have a tendency to delete their accounts from oversharing =( .

What do you think? Can INTPs compete? What about the 3 ESTPs on this sub? Has anyone even seen an ISTJ?&gt;a Socionics INFJ has a very different flavor to them than the MBTI meaning of INFJ.

How are they different? How are they the same? I had always assumed they were the same.Is it ESTP or ENTP? Or some other type?What is your type? And what does caffeine do to your personality?

What about alcohol? Other substances?Am I imagining it, or do people have a tendency to overestimate how proficient they are at using their tertiary function? 

Personally, I definitely have. I seem to see this a lot in others, as well. 

Often, it seems that any sort of deeper nuance / understanding of the tertiary is ignored. I think that this is corroborated by reference to the tertiary function as 'childlike'.

Contrasted to the inferior in which there is clear discomfort, the tertiary function seems to be over estimated.  

Why is this the case? Any thoughts? Agree or disagree with this observation? If the quadra had nicknames like the individual types what would they be? 

&gt;notanotherinfjblog:
&gt;Like everybody else, I am surrounded by people of every tpe on a daily basis. And by being the quiet one in the corner observing and analysing people, I noticed some very similar quirks and kinds of behaviour in people of certain (healthy) types and I drew my conclusions. Now, this may not be correct or apply to everyone using these functions, so take it with a grain of salt. (And just on a sidenote, though I‚Äôm quite confident in my English, it‚Äôs not my native language. So, if some expressions seem odd, or the tenses used are weirdly jumbled and don‚Äôt make much sense, I apologise. Feel free to point out any language mistakes to me. Would be very appreciated.)
If you disagree or would like to add something else you noticed, please do.

&gt;high Ni: High Ni users tend to be very perceptive people when it comes to certain things. They usually have a piercing stare that might make you uncomfortable because it feels like they are diving deep into your soul and are analysing all your strengths and insecurities. Though I noticed that there is a difference in the stares, depending on the function Ni is accompanied by. Te may have a more penetrant quality to it as they notice the details about you. Fe may rather make it feel like they are intrigued and interested in a sense that they figure you out by analysing your mannerism and body language rather than details such as clothing. Also, high Ni users tend to stare at, or rather through, something when they are thinking. Even then it‚Äôs quite intense. To that, high Ni users tend to make little pauses in the middle of a sentence while speaking. They hardly ever fill these short periods of silence with ‚Äúuhm‚Äù. When they talk it‚Äôs always like they have prepared this speech for a very long time because it‚Äôs well thought out, when in fact, they just came up with it. And they will often avoid eye contact when they are talking. NFJs may watch you closely when you‚Äôre the one talking, but the other way round, they won‚Äôt be able to focus on what they are saying if they are looking at you at the same time, so their eyes will wander around, avoiding your face.

&gt;high Ne: High Ne users, on the other hand, often use fill words like ‚Äúuhm‚Äù frequently, many times in a row. They talk fast, but it‚Äôs like they have to bring order to their thought process while speaking, so they have to pull themselves in the direction of a single thought, it seems, which may result in almost stutter-ish words, even though they don‚Äôt actually stutter. They just repeat the first sounds at the beginning of a word or phrase. And then they speed up and squish hundreds of uhms in a little sentence. Though I mostly noticed this in auxiliary Ne, escpecially in INTPs when they are extremely excited by something. Ne-doms, especially ENTPs, may look you directly in the eye while talking and won‚Äôt break eye contact for half a minute, which is kind of irritating to be honest, but it always feels like you are just an anchor they address when they themselves are focused inwards. 

&gt;high Se: I don‚Äôt know what it is, but high Se users somehow always appear to be exactly where they want to be and like this is exactly where they belong. Even if they‚Äôre just standing at a bus stop or going grocery shopping, they are so present. Like they really belong in this world. Fascinates me every time.

&gt;high Si: Si is very difficult to notice in people, at least for me. I can‚Äôt think of any specific mannerisms. I really only notice high Si in someone when they suddenly say something like my ESFJ friend recently: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs three years ago today that we were in London. Do you remember? It was raining and we went in that little cafe and you had a blueberry muffin that looked delicious and there were crumbs all over the table and I loved the red jumper you were wearing. I really miss that moment.‚Äù (Just as a side note, I only vaguely remembered that we fled from the rain into a cafe and that I was getting a cold.) Or when they get you a special kind of cookies because they remembered you saying aeons ago that you loved those. 

&gt;high Ti: High Ti users have this typical ‚Äúlet me think‚Äù look when they are, in fact, thinking. Their eyes will wander across the room, but their focus is inwards, they probably don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre doing it. Sometimes they do this while talking. Then it‚Äôs always like they are thinking out loud or explaining something to themselves, and not directly talking to you. Paired with Ne, especially in INTPs, perhaps because of the inferior Fe, they may start explaining a thought process while they are having it, start at the beginning, pause for a second, and then suddenly jump right to the conclusion, so that you have no idea what the hell they are talking about. Also, let me tell you, as an INFJ, I ususally get a reading on everyone in the room. But IxTPs are a mystery. I can stare at them for hours and still have absolutely no clue what they are thinking about.

&gt;high Te: High Te is also a bit difficult to notice just by observing. It‚Äôs less visible in body language or speech patterns, but rather in the way they treat people. It‚Äôs not necessarily the stereotypical bossing people around, I don‚Äôt find that to be true. Just imagine following scenario: You are sitting in a class, let‚Äôs say in a tutorial and it‚Äôs not this tense teacher-student-atmosphere. You are asking the TA a question, but before the TA can answer you, the Te user sitting next to you suddenly jumps in and answers your question in front of the class. It‚Äôs rather that high Te users often naturally resume responsibilty when they think of themselves as competent enough, even if they aren‚Äôt the authority figure present.

&gt;high Fi: As a high Fe user myself, I‚Äôd like to start describing this as the fact that high Fi users actually have emotions. It sounds weird, but for me, it‚Äôs a bit irritating that some people actually have such strong emotions and know about them. Like, whether they are grumpy or cheerful or sad, the energy they give off is incredibly strong. They always appear very well composed, but when they feel good or bad, you‚Äôll notice. If they‚Äôre happy, it‚Äôs like they are invincible and nothing will ever bring them down. Also, there is a significant difference to Fe when it comes to talking about feelings. If you‚Äôre close to them, they may tell you what happened and what is going on, but they won‚Äôt describe exactly what they‚Äôre feeling. They already know. There‚Äôs no need to tell you. Concerning morality or ethics, they usually have strong convictions they believe in and if you state something that disagrees with those convictions, they are much more likely to stand up for their principles and fight you without compromise than an Fe user would.

&gt;high Fe: High Fe is probably the easiest to notice of all the functions. Just go and talk to them, tell them a story that happened to you and they will go ‚ÄúAww‚Äù, ‚ÄúOh no!‚Äù, ‚ÄúReally? I‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool‚Äù or they‚Äôll just nod or laugh at every little joke you say, not because they think it is funny, but because they will do everything to make you feel comfortable in their presence. But there is a slight difference between SFJs and NFJs that I noticed. While NFJs like to go into chamaeleon mode and try to be nice to literally everyone they meet, SFJs are also usually very nice, but their energy seems to be more concentrated on their circle of friends and family and in a stronger way, and less on a more global range as the NFJs. When you‚Äôre talking to them, they are likely to solely focus on you and direct their body at you and may even mirror your body language. If they trust you, high Fe users will tell you about their feelings, but much differently compared to Fi users. Fe users will tell you what happened and will then try to describe exactly what it is they are feeling and how this feeling feels.

My thoughts are that I really like this. I find it specific enough that I can look for these 'markers' in real life. I lifted that from here: http://mbtidatabase.tumblr.com/tagged/dominant-se Although I suspect that's a changing thing--- I'm not sure how tumblr works, to be honest.

Do we, /r/mbti think that these are accurate observations of how the different functions tend to look?[removed]What are your thoughts on texting? What kind of interaction do you believe should/can happen through this medium? What's your type? What do you think is a 'typical' view on texting for your type? Where do you think this stems from?What's it like being an Ni dom, INTJs and INFJs?

I recently had an intense exchange of emotion with a friend whom I have typed as INTJ. We were discussing some of my issues surrounding an INFJ we know. One of the things that caught me off guard (even though it shouldn't have) was the INTJ speaking of this INFJ. This INTJ told me that she cherished this INFJ person. She said she felt very similar to this INFJ and relished their ability to understand each other. It was something that I would love to peg as that dominant function kinship I have experienced with ESFPs.

I want to know how that kinship manifests in Ni doms.

Aside from generalized descriptions of what being an Ni dom is like, what has your experience been in interactions with other Ni doms?
1. Si, Ni  | Se, Ne

2. Se, Si | Ne, Ni

Are Si and Se more alike than Si and Ni? and all the different permutations of this question. In what ways?  What are you like ISTJs? How are you different from descriptions we read online? How are you the same? How do I make you like me? How do I make you dislike me?Trigger Warning: Socionics concepts. Not for ~~INFPs~~ the faint of heart.

What do we think of duality? Is it a real thing? What is some evidence for and against it?

Are certain function dualities more likely to exist in reality? I feel like I would lean towards this. I think perceiving dominant types are incredibly more likely to achieve a successful dual interaction. Thoughts on this?

**Convince me that duality is stupid!** Present something better for understanding interactions with MBTI. 


***

I feel like I've experienced enough interactions to say that there is something to using cognitive functions to understand interactions. Maybe socionics doesn't get it right, but it's not worth throwing out the idea as a whole. 


edit: Following in my predecessor's footsteps. We're doomed to repeat ourselves, fam. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/48xbk4/how_is_it_possible_that_rmbti_doesnt_understand/. RIP /u/kbnation Is... is this Si?

&gt;Have you ever looked back at the past in order to figure out what to do in the future? I know I have and sometimes it's helped me figure out where the next logical step is but sometimes there are blind spots in life that keep you questioning your ability to move forward. These blind spots sometimes keep our attention more on the past than the present and when we make the blind spot the focus, suddenly our entire field of vision is limited. This would look like if a person was only looking at their rear view mirrors while driving forward. There will obviously be danger ahead if you are only looking back. Some people look back at the good times instead of where they are in the moment or some look at the terrible past they have and believe there's no way it could get better, fearing to look forward. If our eyes are always fixed on the things of the past, then there will be inevitable danger ahead.

Shared on his facebook.Been unsure of my type recently. I'm doing my best to answer as candidly and truthfully as I can. AMA.

**First the peppermint-method, /u/peppermint-kiss.**

Q1: You and your friends are going on a road trip!
a. How you feeling?
**Excited that any of the people I know/like are going on a road trip since it doesn't seem like their style.**

b. What are you looking forward to, if anything?
**Depending on who's there, just hanging out with people, making memories with friends.**

c. What are you nervous or worried about, if anything?
**Worried that I'll bother the shit out of people who spend too much time with me.**

d. How do we prepare for this thing: what should we think about beforehand, and what should we leave to chance?
**Well, I'm thinking back when I did in fact go on a road trip. I think we planned it from day-to-day, except for the hostel. There might have been a couple things that were 'must-sees' but it felt pretty open to change. Living arrangements shouldn't be left up to chance.**

e. What kind of problems might arise, and how should we find a solution?
**I don't know. Money is usually a possible solution for most problems. Interpersonal conflicts are an exception to that. For those, alcohol, crying, yelling, and apologizing usually works. If there's a problem it should be addressed as soon as possible in a private way.**

Q2: Your friend or sibling wants you to meet their new significant other!
a. How do you feel about that, and why?
**Happy for them because good for them. Finding someone you feel that strongly about is a nice feeling.**

b. What situation(s) would make you feel most comfortable, and what would make you feel most awkward?
**I don't know what would make me feel comfortable. Anything works for that. For an awkward scenario, walking in on them doing it would be the most uncomfortable.**

c. What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally approve? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?
**Within a couple minutes if they aren't sucky. I would tell them both to their face. I get giddy when I see people I care about in a new relationship.**

d. What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally disapprove? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?
**They would really have to be an asshole to me. Just a completely nonredeemable person, in my eyes. Someone really close to me I would be more likely to feel protective of them. I don't know what would trigger me to feel as if I have to protect them, but I know of probably one person who would get that response out of me. Otherwise, I don't think I could ever *totally* disapprove.**
**The worst type of person is the person who can't apologize. If I witnessed a mediation session after she/he cheated on my friend and this person just couldn't apologize that would probably make them irredeemable in my eyes. People who conditionally apologize. I don't read people well.**

***

Question 1
Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.

**I've noticed that I am significantly more anxious when I have caffeine than I have been previously. I don't know why.**

Question 2
Click on this link: https://www.flickr.com/explore/
Look at a random photo for about 30 seconds. Copy and paste it here, and write about your impression of it.
[Image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/e_liddell/29616972795/in/explore-2016-09-11/)

**Pretty disappointed. I saw some other ones which looked cooler. This one does nothing for me. I see some headphones, not the awesome in-ear ones. Sitting on some music sheets. I can make out some parts of the words but the focus is off of them.**
**The focus is on the earbuds. I wish I could make some meaning out of it, but it really seems pretty empty of meaning to me. It's greyscale-- that's something.**

Question 3
You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favourite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?
**Fuck! Well, is it cold out? Am I going to immediately be uncomfortable? I'll be pretty bummed that I'm missing Don Diablo. I assuming I'm heading towards Toronto or Montreal. If I'm still in Canada to see him, it's significantly easier to fix this problem than in the US, I'd imagine. I'd probably just google what to do.**

**My initial thoughts are: how can I fix this problem? Does the car look like it's going to explode? My outward reactions is probably telling someone to chill the fuck out if any of the people I'm with is getting all anxious. Google is amazing.**

Question 4
You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the afterparty that was announced (and assure you they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do?
**I feel excited. I don't *really* want to be there by myself so I'd try to convince everyone to come with. I'd go to the party.**

Question 5
On the drive back, your friends are talking. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward reaction? What do you outwardly say?
**Current beliefs on what? I mean, if someone makes a claim about me that I think is false I'll fight it. I think I often try to avoid conflict because it makes me more uncomfortable than I am aware of. These aren't my thoughts but a counselor's. I can see that being accurate. Usually I'll just ignore it. If it's not a *real* issue I'll probably try and argue it deeply. Maybe, I don't know! These questions are so vague!**

Question 6
What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, and habits?
**Are we talking about religious beliefs? I don't know what I would do.**

Question 7
What are some of your most important values? How did you come about determining them? How can they change?
**Honesty, straight-forwardness, giving-a-fuck-ness, competition, enthusiasm, inclusiveness(but not needlessly so). I guess I was raised that way..? Enthusiasm is connected with giving-a-fuck-ness in my mind. I think it's important because it seems like a lot of the time things just don't matter. Maybe it's because I fear that I'm actually a person who really doesn't give a fuck. Maybe I enforce it because I fear my own indifference and the potential that nothing is meaningful. They can change very easily when other's take the time to explain to me these alternate values but also actually implement these alternate values in their own lives. If it proves fruitful(they feel good, make others feel good, have fun, logically seems to make sense and be a viable way of living) I'll consider it.**

Question 8
a) What about your personality most distinguishes you from everyone else?
**I met a guy the other day. He said I was, "a good reciprocator", to his GF(whom I knew somewhat prior to this). He went on to say how, "So many people just are lifeless in conversation.."** 

**She responded, "Yeah! He's a talker!"**

**In my head, I was like, *wtf bitch*. Out loud, "You're way more of a talker than me!"**

**So I guess it's that.** 

b) If you could change one thing about you personality, what would it be? Why?
**It would be that. Would love to be able to speak more deliberately and be in my head enough to seem like I know what I'm talking about (because I do! Sometimes!)**

**Either that, or that I don't become a pathetic loser if I have a crush on someone.**

Question 9
How do you treat hunches or gut feelings? In what situations are they most often triggered?
**I don't get those. I'll usually ask someone about it if I do have a hunch about something.**


Question 10
a) What activities energize you most?
**People enjoying my company and I theirs.**

b) What activities drain you most? Why?
**Being alone with myself and feelings,  it stresses me out. I care far too much about what people think about me. Not even all people, just like 2 people at a time. I just ruminate upon stupid thoughts. I feel like I eventually break and do something about it. Usually fails at that point.**

Question 11
What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? Why?
**Depends. In groups, a lot. I usually try to seem pretty in control. I try to get respect by impressing people in groups. If I'm chatting with someone one-on-one not much, if they ask. If it's someone I have minimal respect for I won't share anything. Who knows though? If someone cares to ask and I perceive like they are genuinely interested, I don't know if anything is repressed. At least I'm not aware of it.**

***

Anyways. Done! Feel free to ask me more things. Use as broad of brush strokes as you can. **Be insulting. Stereotype the fuck out of all the other types.**

No serious answers please..
I mostly lie for no apparent reason. It's more fun that way. Really the best is when the other person realizes that I'm lying, because I've carried on far too long, but can't figure out what I have to gain from the lie. (ESTP here)
ESTP female. Feelings are exhausting. I tend of focus on interests when meeting new people. Find out what they're good at, where they've lived, books they like, etc. You'll find common ground quicker and get interesting info. Also I used trained responses when dealing with feelings. Things like "I'm sorry that happened". "That must have been very difficult" "can I get you a drink?" "would you like to go for a walk?"... etc. It sounds cold, but it has worked for me. I have one friend who's a great big F and who understands how feeling-phobic, I am, and she's a fan of my responses because they bring her back to reality when her feelings are spinning out of control. I also tend to butt in with detailed questions about their jobs if the feelings get to be too much, like asking graphic artists about their favorite software. I'd be a terrible 'hair comber' I don't even comb my own....Plans?
Slytherin, Horned SerpentI tend to laugh at everything, I think most of the time it's just something that we notice that no one else does before something happens? That's the best way I can explain it or it's an inside joke.

For example earlier today I got froyo with my friends after shopping, the tables were full inside so I sat outside and waited for them. I was just people watching and texting when I saw a chef from a nearby restaurant taking a break and passing by. At the same time there was a pretty girl who came out from inside and sat at a table nearby, obviously he looked back to check her out and she didn't even notice and as he kept walking he ran into a pole really hard. Poor guy was rubbing his head and an elderly lady walking by asked if he was okay and he tried to look around to make sure no one saw. I didn't start laughing until he was gone but by that time my friends came out and were looking at me weird lol.It doesn't because I completely break the stereotypes for my type and my friends that have been typed break them too. When I think of a type and their stereotypes I don't take them literally, just as a possibility or worst case scenario. I didn't know INFJs were mystical until I found this subreddit a while back. I actually have several INFJ friends, I attract too many. I think they're sweet/cool but I don't see the appeal.Coffee makes me sleepy actually so I don't drink it.

Alcohol makes me more outgoing and cheerful but it takes a while to hit me.

Can't answer because I have yet to get a good grasp on INTJ personality but I'd marry ESTP.

edit: a wordCan't say my roommate is the same, she's also ISFJ and we're good friends. She doesn't understand people either but the more you go into your description she's not similar. My friend's problem is that she's really naive and doesn't understand social cues. She's always asking what or confused about things that happen, but she's really smart in school.Of course not that's why I said my roommate doesn't have the same problems as you, I'm not saying ISFJs lack social cues and are naiveIf you ask people what they've always wanted to do, most people haven't done it.I wish ESTP was more active but I wouldn't even know what to say and I don't check it often either.athletics and wanting attention, I hate sports and hate being in the spotlightOooh Leonardo DiCaprio, he's cute.I would get in trouble a lot for staying up late to read. I finally found a way to stay up with a little light to read under my blankets lol. I still got in trouble though, my mom would yell at me that I would get bad eyesight but I'm in my 20s now and have 20/20 üòÇI've always wondered the same thing but I know universities still do them as a part of aptitude tests. I know a few friends who did the test from different universities and I myself because I couldn't decide on a major.Thank you for understanding usüò≠The reason I don't come to this subreddit  although I love learning about random things is that my type is always stereotyped by the types like you. After a while it becomes annoying trying to prove that we're not all like the mold we are given and I'm not going to waste my time commenting on each post just to make a point so I'd rather let everyone be. Also I'm an ESTP
As an estp, there doesn't seem to be much out there at all for me in terms of finding like-minded people. This is probably because of the stereotypes about se doms, which lead a lot of people to mistype as entp.  Overall, I really wish there were more accurate resources out there for mistyped estps so that we could build a stronger community and keep future people from mistyping themselves.One of my best friends is another estp. He and I get along very well. We've never fought or anything. It's still somewhat of a disaster given our impulsive reckless nature, but we have a good time.intjs are ni doms too, so by this logic they would be 'different' too.1. Isfp

isfp with a really bad moral compass and severe mental illnessi can't control it anymore srryMy room is far too shameful to post, but I can describe it. The floor is not visible and there is a good six inches of stuff covering the whole ground. The smell is absolutely putrid. I can't clean in there for more than 20 minutes without having coughing fits. I havenot slept in my bed, which has no sheets or anything and is also covered in stuff, in almost three years.  If you look up hellhole in the dictionary you will see a picture of my room.I'm an ISFP 7w6. 

I participate heavily in technical theatre and the robotics program, though mostly robotics now that my theatre friends rejected me.

 My grades are around the C area due to not giving one shit. My grades depend a lot on my mental health. When I'm doing alright I get B's, but when I'm not I get D's. 

I'm the school Weird Kid, like the mentally troubled second grade boy that no one played with at recess, except I'm 16 and a girl.

I belong to the social reject squad, where everyone who no one else likes all conglomerate into one big shitshow. My friends are ESTP x2, ENFJ, ESFP, and ISTP. So lots of other SPs. Everyone thinks we're edgy, but really we're just meme dorks :)

  I don't get into trouble, but I should lol.  I don't really do Bad Things, but we do stupid things a lot, like letting people who haven't got any sort of drivers license drive us places and lying about our age to purchase tobacco products as a joke with no intention to use them. I also think I might have mild kleptomania. 

Also I sleep in every class every day, not exaggerating.I've been told that I can get really heated really quick really often. I get PISSED during just about any argument. I try to keep it bottled up during the argument and release the anger later, but sometimes I do some stupid angry shit (thanks se) like the other day I was really angry at someone and I threw a screwdriver a them and we weren't even arguing.Chaotic Neutral Elf Ranger 1st level

3. I'm fine being chaotic neutralAs a 7w6 isfp, definitely. I find my enneagram really helps show how strong my auxiliary se is, since most descriptions of isfps kind of tend to ignore se altogether. I've also got 8 in my tritype if you're into that. It shows that I am not really complacent, but more outspoken, unlike just about any isfp description you will find. Enneagram gives a whole new level to my personality that my mbti just can't express. It's like enneagram is a way of showing how you behave compared to others of your type.You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of sensing vs. intuition. 'Lack of a deeper meaning' in conversation has nothing to do with your dominant perceiving function. Plenty of intuitives are not interested in deeper conversation, and many sensors are. If there is any function that really has anything to do with it I would say it's probably Fi. You might want to consider typing your friends yourself, since the test is rather inaccurate, especially in the S/N area. By personally considering your friends types, you could avoid the misconception that deep conversation is an intuitives only thing. There are a million better ways to distinguish between the intuitive and the sensing functions.1. Is there anything that may affect the way you answer these questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illnesses, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.

 I've got ADHD and severe anxiety/borderline personality disorder. I am currently being medicated for the latter. I'm female, in my later teens. Little bit of relationship drama and seasonal depression right now too, but that shouldn't really affect stuff IMO. 
2. Click on this link: Look at the random photo for about 30 seconds. Copy and paste it here, and write about our impression of it.

HTTPS://www.flickr.com/photos/scazalet/30943223984 I appreciate the aesthetic quality of the picture with the light reflecting off the house and the consistent color scheme. It matches some of my good clothes. If I were there I'd be vibing out pretty hard.

3. You are with a group of people in a car, heading to a different town to see your favorite band/artist/musician. Suddenly, the car breaks down for an unknown reason in the middle of nowhere. What are your initial thoughts? What are your outward reactions?

  I'd be pretty panicked inwardly and outwardly, my favorite musicians and having good times with my friends both mean a LOT to me. I'd be really focused on solving the problem, but I wouldn't have any idea how to do it so I'd probably be figuring out who does know what to do so we could get it done ASAP.

4. You somehow make it to the concert. The driver wants to go to the after party that was announced (and assure our they won't drink so they can drive back later). How do you feel about this party? What do you do? 

I'm down with the party it's as simple as that. Why not if they're not gonna drink then what's the problem?

5. On the drive back, your friends are talking. A friend makes a claim that clashes with your current beliefs. What is your inward reaction? What do you outwardly say?

 I'll fight anyone about anything. I generally don't fight my friends about stuff though because my friends almost NEVER talk about anything seriously. 
                         
6. What would you do if you actually saw/experienced something that clashes with your previous beliefs, experiences, and habits?

when it comes to more scientific and factual stuff I don't really care I his go with whatever I see happen. I get really messed up when I can't understand why someone is acting a specific way so if what someone does goes against what I understand I get all withdrawed and am like ????????? Until I come up with some explanation for it.                           
 7. What are some of your most important values? How did you come about determining them? Hi can they change?

I definitely have strong values, but I haven't really taken the time to define them in mind. When something comes up I'm like Is This OK? And kinda figure it out then. I guess off the top of my head I value all sorts of intellectual freedoms. Freedom of speech and making your own decisions and all that, freedom of press, artistic freedom, etc.

8. a) what about your personality distinguishes you from everyone else? b) if you could change one thing about your personality, what would it be? Why?

a) I'm a certified Odd Person. I I'm highly individualistic and outspoken in ways that surprise other people. The things I wear, the things I say, etc. Are generally very unexpected. b) besides the whole crazy personality disorder thing, I'd generally like to be more naturally likable. People don't like talking to me even though I try to be sociable and I'd like to see that change.

10) a) what activities energize you most? b) what activities drain you the most? Why?

A)  I love love love being with my friends if anything energizes me that's it. I love going to theatre practice and I love going to robotics practice and I love social things with all of my good friends. B) school kills me energy wise. Doctor stuff kills me. Anything where I'm supposed to act a certain way is..... Too much

11. What do you repress about your outward behavior or internal thought process when around others? Why?

 I generally don't repress myself. If it is absolutely necessary, I try to tone down the impulsive random witty comments that fall out of my mouth Every few seconds. But as I said, I am VERY bad at this.
Just talk about ESTPs.We da best.Well, a certain ESFP thinks I am a piece of shit and she wishes I get in a car accident so I become disabled, because I made fun of a friend of hers that I saw on facebook. Oh well. Yeah, ENTJs and ESTPs are good together. My best friend for the last 6 years is ENTJ. Only friend I can be comfortable been myself(an asshole) with. And only person that inspires me to be better. Every other relation I have with people I see as fragile. So many times I planned to do something and just because someone told me to do it, I didn't. And makes me double angry because I can't do the thing I wanted to do anymore, and I can't blame anyone but myself. Not good. ESTP is utter shit at Fi. It is he's worst function. He is shit at it, and he doesn't care about it. Also ESTP doesn't value Ne at all. He finds it childish and annoying at best. 
And Ne - Fi are the most dominant functions of ENFP.

Basically ESTP and ENFP share no common functions that they value.
Tyler is ESTP.

Se - Tyler always talks about the grind. About overcoming difficulties and becoming the best. He isn't afraid to put himself out there.


Ti - He has said that he has systems for everything. That means that he values Ti and knows how to use it. I find it hard to believe that a Te person would buy in the Game theory.


Fe - He uses group dynamics. He created a team around him, and he knows how to manage them. He knows how to use Fe effectively to influence people and make public relations. 


Ni - Tyler always talks about a higher "power". A deeper meaning. But he is never sure of what he talks about. That is an indicator of a weak but valued Ni. He doesn't believe in god, but he seeks some kind of spiritual meaning. 


Now on weak functions.


Si ignoring - ESTPs are good at Si, but they don't value it. This means that they tend to ignore it when they are at their healthiest selves. That translates to a distancing from life's comforts, based on the believe that they make you weak and lead you astray from what you believe is important to do (Se - suffer in order to reach a higher goal/achievement.) 

As Tyler mentions in one of his videos, this is one of his favorite quotes from a book. 

"The two ways to bring you right to your masculine edge of power are austerity and challenge.

Austerity means to eliminate the comforts and cushions in your life that you have learned to
snuggle into and lose wakefulness. Take away anything that dulls your edge. No newspapers or
magazines. No TV. No candy, cookies, or sweets. No sex. No cuddling. No reading of anything at all
while you eat or sit on the toilet. Reduce working time to a necessary minimum. No movies. No conversation that isn't about truth, love, or the divine."

Te - I don't have much to add on Te because he never shows Te in his videos. (ESTPs again basically are good at using the, but they don't value it much.)

Fi as vulnerable function. - ESTPs are shit at Fi. They don't value it, they don't understand it, and they don't care for it. That leads them to be unsure about the relations they have with others, leading to a slight paranoia and a distancing from others. That is why ESTPs often don't have close friends but many people that they like to hand out (Fe). Because it is very hard for them to build strong emotional connections with people.
So that very very often translates to awkwardness when it comes to flirting, and a big frustration. Because they can't understand emotions. Leading them been scared of women on an unhealthy ESTP, or only going for ONS and sort lived relationships.

So what did Tyler did? He used his force of will (Se) and grinded the game. Researched game (Ti) seeked higher meaning (Ni) created a system to compensate for his lack of Fi (Ti) and build a network around him full of people that he inspires, in order to achieve his goals (Fe)


Ne - Basically ESTPs don't like to ponder many options and possibilities. They like to decide on what they think is beast and go with it. I think Tyler conveys that often in his videos."You scored 28. Scores above 30 indicate psychopathy."

Dodged a bullet.Nerd[Se-Fe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qFF2v8VsaA)Si is your weakest function.Sorry for replying so long after. I missed your comment.
&gt; Do you see yourself as a serious person?


I am not. But I can understand when I need to be one, and I am good at been one. But it makes me "sad" when I have to be serious for long periods of time.

When I am with "my people" I am really goofy and insensitive, and I get annoyed by people that can't read the situation and let go of their "seriousness".

But yeah, I enjoy been business-like when the situation calls for it.


ENTJs can be goofy too if you teach them. But yeah, they bend more difficult. I try to make it clear that my morals sketchy. But that doesn't mean that I don't care about causes or people. It just means that I am a strong believer that the end justifies the means. 
If I want to achieve something, whatever goes. I love Tim and Eric. If you like these guys check H3H3 on YouTube. Not a movies, but House of Cards.Probably ESTJ that one.Whenever I listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qFF2v8VsaA), ESTP comes to my mind. Ne: Lel I am so random xDDDD

Te: We hardcore now.

Si: I just don't feel it man.

Ni: Have you heard about our lord and savior Jesus Christ?

Se: I want it and I want it NOW!

Fe: I want people to be at harmony.

Fi: THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

Ti: We analyze now.

Ni domes give me the sense that they want to fix/save the world. So this came to mind. Weird.Didn't know INFJs were rockheads. Neat.It just comes to me naturally.[When I am surfing in CS GO](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9zbUcbt8QIo1dJMbmUT4N_ALuopjwYs-)

Basically yeah. Wow. This is actually my ENTJ friend without the Jesus Christ part. You are the same person. I don't know mate. I don't think i have ever met another ESTP. Most of the times i suspect someone is ESTP they turn out to be ESTJ. One the one hand I like been a special snowflake. But on the other hand i would like more people on the estp forums to talk with. 

Also, why do you think that we are easy to type? It took me half a year to type myself correctly, while i typed people around me almost spot on. Do you type them based on meme stereotypes? Rationality, sensitivity, orderliness 

Edit: i only agree with rationality. Other too don't fit. You have no idea what you are talking about. A few million to get the general idea of the population? Are you nuts? Not very well apparently. 

http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/Soc_participants.shtml 

5000 are more than enough to get less that 1% margin of error. Even that number is an overkill. Grasping at straws: the movie. 


Good job at making an entire field of study invalid just because you don't believe in it. Yes, there are many factors that reduce the quality of a study like this. Not having one million participants isn't one of them. And the fact that many studies show similar results highly validates their findings. Don't worry. This is more of a Fe thing. Eh... Are you ok? This is some lazy shit i tell you that. http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/Soc_participants.shtml 

5000 are more than enough to get less that 1% margin of error. Even that number is an overkill. Your score is 27 out of 36.
Your score is lower than 55% of all participants.

Meh, I was hopping for higher score.Exactly the same score. ESTPs unite!1) How do you act under stress?

2) What is your work experience? Which of it did you like?

3) What were you good at school?

4) Tell me a few things that you admire in people.
Ok, a few more.

1) How would a job where you would have to make contact and build relations with random people, and convince them into stuff seem to you? (i.e Sales job) Doable? Desirable? Repulsive? Hard? Exhausting?

2) You said that stress makes you fucked up. 

Do you seek people as friend that can handle stress well and learn from them, or do you seek friends that are chill, so you can create a relaxed atmosphere where you can feel at home, so you never have to deal with it?

3) What are your interests? How do you spend you time?

4) Do you ever feel paranoid or distrustful of people that are close to you? Or do you think that you know them well enough to be safe?

5) Do you keep contact with friends you don't meet in real life anymore, or do you let them fade away?


Btw, from the previous answers I would say you are INFP.Ok. I would say ENTP. Let me analyze my thought process.

&gt;1) I get fucked up. I can't take pressure. Under stress, I just want to go away from everything, lock myself in a room, (in extreme situations) I smoke, drink alcohol, listen to music. These help me think, after that, I come up with a solution to suppress the stress and the pressure, I implement my plan and voila, the reason I'm stressed is gone.

Makes me think Se vulnerable or Se Role. So puts you in (ENTP, INTP, INFP, ENFP) territory. 

&gt;The idea of working in a team of 3-5 people to solve a problem appeals to me.

Doesn't help me much. This could be anything, anyone.

&gt;Verbal subjects.

Kinda torn on that one. I mean, which ones? The value that the subject brings is important. But I would say Ne-Fe value, but not by much.

&gt;4)Knowledge, intelligence.

What this does is excludes ENFP for me. And a bit ENTP. 
And it puts me into Te seeking territory, or Ti leading. So INFP or INTP.
But it might as well be a standard answer to this question.

&gt;Not my ideal. It would be very hard for me. I feel uncomfortable when walking down the street..

This reinforces my thinking of Se vulnerable, and not Ne as leading. So still in INTP/INFP territory.

&gt; Physics, neurology, biology, physchology, "general knowledge". I spend my time by learning stuff, watcing/reading populer science materials. Thinking about some stuff and then trying to **come up with a theory on how it works**, and discussing this with others on the internet. That's generally how I spend my time.

Leaning on INTP because of that Ti valuing. But now that I think about it it could be also be Ne-Ti since you have interest in many "Ti" things.

&gt;4) This is one of my problems. I am very paranoid, I thought about seeing a psychologist, but I think it helps me think better. I can live with it, even though it really makes my life difficult.

Now this also makes me think Fi vulnerable, so ENTP, but it could be also be Fi role (INTP). A person with Fi valuing as a Leading(INFP) or Creative(ENFP) wouldn't have this problem much.

&gt;5) If they are willing to keep contact, then why not I guess. My understanding of social interactions with "fake" friends is just grabbing a beer and laughing together. When I see acquaintances, I look away and run. If I'm not able to run I say "Hi" of course.

Same as the previous one. But leaning more into INTP since you don't seam to rely on Ne to help you out in those situation. Also reinforces the idea of Se vulnerable. But on the other hand it could be Fi vulnerable, because it doesn't seem to bother you. 

&gt;My new goal is to create surveys and see the connections between some things and MBTI types.

Strong Ti valuing. I am still torn between INTP and ENTP. But ENTP makes more sense to me. Sure you have shit Se, but it seems to bother you that you do. And people don't care much about their vulnerable function. I mean, I am Fi vulnerable, and I don't care much that I don't connect well with people. On the other hand, you get that you are not well with people, but I get the feeling that you also see it in a comical way. So yeah, Fi polr. 

Tell me what you think.&gt;I think " I " because, I love my alone times, I would definetely watch some documentaries, read something on my free day. For the " P ", I don't think so. I am very organized and I've planned my whole life to the death.

This is why I never asked you, "Do you think you are an introvert or an extrover?"

I am an ESTP. The most extroverted type out there by what people say. And the longest time I tried to type myself I thought I was introverted. I thought, INTP, ISTP. Then I thought maybe ENTP because I am not "that" introverted.

Then I spent months on ENTP facebook groups believing I am ENTP. Because ENTPs sometimes blur the line of E/I.

It took me almost a year to realize what type I am. Because it took me that much to study this and really understand what each function is, and **HOW IT STACKS**. Stacking is supper important. 

&gt;I am going by the letters. My understanding = I: Introverted, P: Improvization, J: Likes planning. Correct me if this is a wrong way of thinking/typing.

This is the worst way of thinking. Things are so much more complicated. There is Te Ti Ne Ni Se Si Fe Fi and they all exist in a person, just in a different order. You just need to understand what that order means for each type and how the work with each other. Which is fucking hard. Boiling it down to  P = Improvising is retarded. Not only because it is bad practice, but also because you will never be certain about your type that way. To become 100% certain you need to be able to say "I am x Ignoring because this and this and this, and x Leading because this this and this, and x Polr because I struggle doing this and this." and it should all make sense.

Next, you told me you have social anxiety. Well, this makes things tricky. Any psychological dysfunction could make it really hard, to almost impossible to type yourself. You might be an ESTP but it would be impossible for you to think that, because "I go into panic mode when bad things happen". Which isn't very "Se Leading". And it could give you the impression of N because "well, I am more in my mind and a theoretical person." No shit you are in your mind. You have social anxiety. 

This was also the reason why I thought I was N for so long. (And because there is a N bias in MBTI and I didn't want to be lower class citizen, until I realized I can't stand most N types. But this is another topic.)

If you care about typology, I suggest you focus on Socionics. Everything is so much better explained, and if you like systems, it will make wayyyyy more sense to you. I only come to MBTI because it has more people to talk to. Also, if you are good at typing other people, intertype relations might help you solidify your type. Thats how I did it anyway.

And this is the only online test I vouch for. http://aimtoknow.com/test_beta

Just don't do it in Chrome because it will crash at the end. 
Come back to me with the results if you take it. 

And good luck with finding your type. I know, it is really frustrating.Yeah, EIE is ENFJ. I would say ISTP, but the fact that you feel uneasy with a job not been 100% safe makes me also question it a bit. Maybe ESTP? Can you also answer the other set of questions i asked the other guy? 

Also, go easy with the huge letters. No no no no! This is a huge misconception. 
This hit very close to home for me, and I am ESTP. 
&gt;4. Things that I admire - really smart, thinks outside the box, open to new ideas but still questioning.
5. Things I don't admire - Someone who says you're an idiot if you don't blindly follow a certain path.

This hit very close to home for me, and I am ESTP. 

&gt;I always follow my own path. Everything I do I try to do it by myself first. 

This has nothing to do with N mate. ESTPs and ISTPs are like that a lot. 


Ok, let me ask you this question. Do you relate with that:

"I hold strong opinions, but I am always questioning my beliefs. Been right and having a solid understanding of how the world works is one of the most important things to me. 

If a piece of evidence contradicts wish some of my beliefs, I examine it carefully, see how it fits with my strong base opinions of how the world fundamentally works. 

Does it challenge them? If yes, does it provide me with a better understanding of the world makes sense? If yes, I change my worldview in order to incorporate that information in my worldview.

If it doesn't challenge my base beliefs, but complements them, I try to see with what beliefs it classes. Do those beliefs provide a more logical explanation of the world? Do they fit in my worldview more harmonically? If not, I reevaluate things and fit that new information in my worldview."


Also: "I see the world as something static. Something I can't change. But if I dedicate myself in improving myself and getting a great understanding of the world, I will thrive in it."
If you aren't open to other people's typing why did you make a post asking to be typed? You seem to know your type. 

And 7 days is nothing mate. Took me almost a year to type myself.1. To be strong and able to rely on my physical strength. 
2. More energy
3. More confidence
4. Ballin body
5. Shows dedication and that you care about yourself to other people
6. Bitches love it
Where are my boy ESTPs?I have read astrology. I love reading about otherworldly stuff like astrology, the occult, conspiracy theories ect. I never believe them for a second, and i am actually pissed at people that do. But it is fun to suspend disbelief for a few moments when you are reading that stuff and pretend that things aren't that boring in real life. There is no irony here. There is a difference in enjoying something, and believing it. I think strongly disappointed is a better word. Maybe in Conspiracy theories that is true. Everything else was well established years ago. Told my parents "i don't take advice from poor people". Still regret it. ESTPs win once again. ESTP here. Are you hiring?Seems like ESTP ass is popular with ENTJs. What? No. I can't stand ISTJ/ESTJ/INTJs. I am always bored out of my mind around them. I mean, I admire them in certain ways, but I can't talk with them for long. I think the best types for ESTPs are INFJ/ENFJ/ENTJ/ESTP/ISTP/.

ISFPs might seem attractive to ESTPs but they don't think highly of us when they get to know us.

Why do you think that they would have things in common btw? They share no functions. Maybe you misstyped them? I had two encounters with ESTJs in the military. One solo and one ESTJ/ISTJ duo. 1st week it was fine. After that I couldn't stand them. I didn't care about what they talked about and they didn't care about what I talked about. Talking to each other was like we took turns to talk to a wall. I never had to put so much effort just to tolerate someone.

Maybe the manager was ENTJ? I feel it really easy to let loose and crack jokes around ENTJs. That is one of the reasons I love them.&gt; Talked about partying a lot and making out with girls and stuff. Most likely very popular at the school. Hard worker though, and he was a good person at heart.

None of this points at an ESTP... Literary I never met an ESTP that fitted that criteria. Party animal/Casanova/Popular crowd. I met a few ESFPs though that were the carbon copy of that. ESTPs tend to gravitate towards the the outcasts in school.

&gt;He was certainly not the type to get into the MBTI. 

funny enough, ESTPs are one of the types to find MBTI a very attractive idea.

You obviously aren't very familiar with mbti yet to understand how functions stack, and what they mean when they stack that way, and you are basing everything on meme stereotypes. I don't mean to insult you, but what you are doing is misinforming other people too. This isn't star signs. &gt;Those were explaining his individual personality/enneagram dummy. Obviously not ESTP's are like that.

&gt;I'm not an amateur at this you know?


The things you stated don't hold much gravity in enneagram typing. So maybe you are an amateur.
&gt;Lol what? This has to be a troll

&gt;LOL.

&gt;LMAO! ROFL!


I am supposed to be the troll here?Only thing I see is that you edited you comment. Also, is everything I listed white noise? Why did you list it if not for pointing at his type? I can't make sense of it.Trust me, ESTP was the last thing I wanted to be when I first got into MBTI, but I guess I am stuck with after the one year it took me to finally accept my type. Also I kinda get the idea of what person you are since you are trying to attack my type in order to get the upper hand in a discussion. So to retaliate, I don't think you are ISFP. ISFPs are kind and smart people, can't imagine a stupid cunt that uses LOL/LMAO all the time, like you, been an ISFP.

Don't try to pretend that you know what you are talking about when you are trying to define a type just by their dominant function. When people are not comfortable\unfamiliar with each other they use mostly their 3rd function. But you would have known that if you had studying MBTI in the slightest . Good luck in life. I have a feeling that you will need it a lot.



&gt;You lost this argument the moment you abandoned all common sense and rationality.

When did that happen? I am not aware of my feelings until they reach an Defcon 5 level.


I am very aware of who I am(strengths/weaknesses/behavioral pasterns) and my place among my friends and the world. Not with me they aren't.Ok, fair enough, I will give this to you. Now, how are you so sure that the guy is ESTP? This is what is important to me on this conversation. Because i tied to socialize with estj/istjs a lot and never could. And saw the same thing with a few other ESTPs i know. The fact that an estp or estj would look up to each other when they know each other on a personal level seems almost impossible to me because of experience, and because of conflicting functions. Basically i don't see estps getting along with estj/istj/infp/enfp. I am late, but thanks for having my back. You are talking like the type and the person are two different things. The type defines the person. Yes, two people might get along for a while because of similar upbringing/interests/job, but if their function use doesn't get reciprocated and built upon, the relation will end up stale and even maybe conflicting. Its a constant struggle.Sure, ESTPs can be Casanovas. I am not saying the can't. But almost all other extroverted types can fit that criteria easily. ENTJ/ESFP/ENFJ/ could easily fit the role of party animal/lady killer/popular crowd, maybe even better than ESTPs. I think that most stereotypes around ESTPs would fit ESFPs way way better. Sure I love to party, sure I love to flirt and to be around people. But I don't put too much value to it. I have met ESFPs who all they care about is just that. 

The way I see it is, ESTPs care about personal progress, ESFPs care about personal indulgence. 

Also I think the theory that there are 2 subtypes for each type is wrong and it often leads to misstypes. Well, yeah.I don't get it.glad you liked it. I hoped it would make someone laugh.I mean, what does Ni-ENTJ mean? Is it an ENTJ that values/uses more proficiently Ni over Te? Then he probably isn't and ENTJ, because that goes against everything this theory portraits. Basically you lose every structure of the theory that way, and the theory becomes redundant.

Or is it an ENTJ that still values/uses more proficiently Te over Ni, but is better at Ni over his other ENTJ peers? Then he is just a more developed ENTJ, no need for "Ni-ENTJ". That just confuses people.

With everything else you said I agree completely. I don't have anything to add to it. You managed to put words in thoughts I couldn't.I never said we weren't retarded... Haha, yeah I get it. I just love self deprecating humor.Nah, I am sure you are fine man.Such a stupid answer for such smart type. &gt;Care to elaborate

Nah, I don't.You acknowledged that you understood that I don't care to elaborate, and you are still waiting for me to elaborate. Yeah, I think I will stand by my 1st comment.It also can mean that I am not interested in going into the process of elaborating this to you.Estp. Admire ENFJs. Because type tests are accurate.

I do it too. I even copy speech patterns. It pisses me off. I don't like to do that. If I am interested in the conversation I might dominate it. If I am not, you might think that I am an introvert.

Good job bragging about stupid shit. And I wonder why people think we are retarded.&gt; People shouldn't judge a book by the fact that it smokes weed

I am not judging the fact that you smoke weed. It is 2016, who cares. But I think that it is retarded to think of it as an achievement to brag about. It is like bragging for drinking alcohol and been wasted all the time. Maybe cool in highschool, after that you just look like a manchild.&gt;It's quite obvious what your sticking point is.

It is, just not to you. 

&gt;Suck my dick, tbh. What's wrong with being a manchild?

That only low self esteem people would suck your dick. If anyone. That's the problem. 

&gt;You're just being a cunt about something that offended you. 

I don't get offended. Just irritated. 


&gt;I suggest you learn to share your toys. **Because i'm really not worried about looking childish here.** 

That is my sticking point. Thanks. I wish i wasn't. Estps have Fi Polr. Can't go lower on the Fi scale than that. Look it up. Maybe i will educate you a bit while we are at it. 

&gt;No ESTP would wish they weren't an ESTP. 

No ESTP would speak in absolutes like that. Maybe you are ESTJ. 

Change your flair please.

That was your best shot? SAD! I care what you think mate. Estp. Hate GTA. Find it boring.
Have 1200 hours in CS GO. 

Your chart is flawed.Ye. I need something skill based where I have to improve an become better, and work in a team to beat the enemies. Ranking up in CS GO feels amazing to me.

Now playing against the computers, well, the story will have to be great like in mass effect. Otherwise it doesn't do it for me.

I mean, you can only have so much fun driving around and killing npcs in GTA before it becomes boring. [Basically ESTP for me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qFF2v8VsaA)Fuck emWe ESTPs are very very protective of our people. We just don't care much about anyone else.It is not possible to be two types, no.I see some people confuse his type online. Here is his type and an explanation.

Tyler is ESTP.



Se - Tyler always talks about the grind. About overcoming difficulties and becoming the best. He isn't afraid to put himself out there.


Ti - He has said that he has systems for everything. That means that he values Ti and knows how to use it. I find it hard to believe that a Te person would buy in the Game theory.


Fe - He uses group dynamics. He created a team around him, and he knows how to manage them. He knows how to use Fe effectively to influence people and make public relations.


Ni - Tyler always talks about a higher "power". A deeper meaning. But he is never sure of what he talks about. That is an indicator of a weak but valued Ni. He doesn't believe in god, but he seeks some kind of spiritual meaning.


Now on weak functions.


Si ignoring - ESTPs are good at Si, but they don't value it. This means that they tend to ignore it when they are at their healthiest selves. That translates to a distancing from life's comforts, based on the believe that they make you weak and lead you astray from what you believe is important to do (Se - suffer in order to reach a higher goal/achievement.)


As Tyler mentions in one of his videos, this is one of his favorite quotes from a book.


"The two ways to bring you right to your masculine edge of power are austerity and challenge.
Austerity means to eliminate the comforts and cushions in your life that you have learned to snuggle into and lose wakefulness. Take away anything that dulls your edge. No newspapers or magazines. No TV. No candy, cookies, or sweets. No sex. No cuddling. No reading of anything at all while you eat or sit on the toilet. Reduce working time to a necessary minimum. No movies. No conversation that isn't about truth, love, or the divine."


Te - I don't have much to add on Te because he never shows Te in his videos. (ESTPs again basically are good at using Te, but they don't value it much.)


Fi as vulnerable function. - ESTPs are shit at Fi. They don't value it, they don't understand it, and they don't care for it. That leads them to be unsure about the relations they have with others, leading to a slight paranoia and a distancing from others. That is why ESTPs often don't have close friends but many people that they like to hang out with (Fe). Because it is very hard for them to build strong emotional connections with people. So that very very often translates to awkwardness when it comes to flirting, and a big frustration. Because they can't understand emotions. Leading them been scared of women on an unhealthy ESTP, or only going for ONS and sort lived relationships.


So what did Tyler did? He used his force of will (Se) and grinded the game. Researched game (Ti) seeked higher meaning (Ni) created a system to compensate for his lack of Fi (Ti) and build a network around him full of people that he inspires, in order to achieve his goals (Fe)


Ne - Basically ESTPs don't like to ponder many options and possibilities. They like to decide on what they think is best and go with it. I think Tyler conveys that often in his videos.
From lyrics, to music, to even video clip.

The dumb meathead stereotype or the frat party boy.

The second stereotype is "you must be awesome" people seem to either love us or hate us, why is that?
I am an ESTP... I play MOBAS like League of Legends and I always switch from character to character. Usually I play whatever guarantees me the win but exploring multiple champions (characters) is just something I can't stop myself from doing. Sometimes I find myself playing a new champion that seems cool and bring him straight into the competitive games.As an ESTP, I agree :)ESTP.
Social, Body Movement, Logic/MathI'm an ESTP and I got ESTJ, but it was close... very interesting tool! Half of my family are E and half are I types. Not much I can say for similarities... I think they are all S types except for a younger sibling of mine, we quarreled a lot. 

I'm fairly sure all of my family are F types, unlike me. It has many benefits actually, but at other times it can be a pain. Right now, [Vienna - Billy Joel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZdiXvDU4P0). I'm still a very young kid, but I feel much older listening to this song.

I also really enjoy listening to the other songs of Billy Joel.Younger Sibling (-4 years): INFP

It's tough. 
I'm currently in a relationship with an ISTJ, and it's a good match. We are really compatible since we balance eachother out on many levels. I'm the spontanious one, she does the finances etc.In 2 months it will be 6 years.

Let me just cut it short. She brings stability where I lack some, and I bring spontaniouty where she needs it.

&gt;showering

ha
Yea my buddy called me the master of small talk when we were out drinking at the weekend. This is because I get bored very quickly and start talking about real things I wanna know.

Apparently mastering small talk is like mastering breathing. You wouldn't notice the achievement.Yeah man, i'm assuming you meant difficulty when talking with someone who *isn't* giving you anything... but it depends on how bad the stand-off is.

Like if i can tell they're not intentionally being standoffish but rather they're shy to reveal detail or don't want to give hints on what they're thinking.. this is manageable. I'm very definitely talking about flirting here. And when i say manageable i just mean i won't feel uncomfortable myself.

But then there's people who have made a negative judgement. And that standoff is different. You can only win them over by giving up and (sort of) excluding them from your effort to entertain yourself.

Yeah... ADHD all the way. I get told very often that i don't have any kind of filter on the words that come out... But i understand that this is largely because i'm gauging peoples reaction to shock in order to find my "sweet spot" and potentially make a girl laugh enough so that she'll offer to suck it.

I'm a bad man.Yeah i would say that the answer to OPs question is mirrored in the socionics [romance styles](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/101-Erotic-Attitudes)

Relevant quote;

&gt; Challengers/Trophies: EIE (ENFj) IEI (INFp)

&gt; These are the types who unconsciously throw a "gauntlet" down for their opponents. They know on an almost subliminal level exactly who they are looking for, and anyone who does not fit the bill will be subjected to a rather flakey, hot-cold game of courting tag. As a result, they may appear (both to others and to themselves) rather amorphous and can take on qualities of the other romantic attitudes, depending on the situation and who they are "challenging."

&gt; They may, for example, give the victim half his aggressor, the psuedo-aggressor a little victim, the caregiver a bit of his child, etc. They react best, however, to those who do not "break" as a result of their games, but grant them a level of autonomy. Healthy examples of this type will have a sense of self-esteem, and may think of themselves as the "prize" that will be given only to the rightful owner.

I link this because OP indicated their type as INFP and it seems consistent with the "throwing a gauntlet down".

It is appropriate to consider that these trends relate to relationship forming and are not necessarily explicit to romantic relationships.

Also the ESTP is very similar;

&gt; Conquerors: SLE (ESTp) LSI (ISTj)

&gt; These are assertive types who do not flinch at their own sexuality. They will express their own desire without reservation. They are won over by direct shows of submission (only after feeling that they have earned it). He will be insulted if his romantic interest gives him his title without question, and bored if the fight is too easily won. He, like the Pseudo-Aggressor and the Challenger, is questing to find his equal. Someone he can play his almost sadistic games with without "breaking."Oh yeah it's quite important to state that! whoops! I fucked up.Preface; behavior is a bad indication of type. But i will highlight the stereotypical aspects as i see them.

&gt; I'm a generally argumentative hot head, 

ENTP. This is the **Ne-Ti devils advocate**. Do you have to believe you are correct to argue your perspective or are you happy to argue the point in exploration of accuracy?

Ne is unhappy if it cannot see another option / angle / condition and you strive toward checking the accuracy of it (with Ti) but often get distracted before reaching the principle fact.

&gt; and I act hyper, and outgoing to those who don't know me, 

ENTP. **Ne-Ti ADHD** as described above.

**Fe (tertiary)** here describes your "testing" for a reaction before feeling comfortable with new people. This is how you manage your external feeling environment and mirrors my own tertiary Fe.

&gt; and I hide behind a facade which I generally show to people I'm not very close to,

**Shadow Fi** or the interaction of **Fe-Si**. I generally don't hide behind a mask but would intentionally lie to people that i do not want closer.

&gt; but I'm actually a quite "broody" person, although I do have 'self confidence' issues

broody... this is your introverted functions; **Si, Ti**

additionally this probably doesn't work for you since **entp is Fe user**. So assuming this is the case you consider yourself broody because you will not make any progress with introspection... and therefore you think it takes you a long time to process. So if you never seem to move on when trying to process F internally it's because you need to vent. At least... this is how i am.

&gt; although I do have 'self confidence' issues, which INTJs usually don't seem to have.

That's because you have Si instead of Se and Ti-Fe instead of Fi-Te. **Fe-Ti likes external validation.** Si remembers all those times you felt shitty.

&gt; 'cause I exhibit behavioral patterns of an INTJ, especially when I'm moody or depressed, and have read somewhere that depressed ENTPs are similar to INTJs.

Behavior means nothing in mbti. It's only use is so that people don't have to read up on functions (but that means they'll most likely get everything wrong).

&gt; Then there's the issue of overthinking things, 

**Ti**

&gt; attempting to plan things through according to different scenarious 

**Ne-Ti** (mirrors Te somewhat)

&gt; and wanting to have things under control, 

Alright Hitler... *which things*? It's way more important to give a full picture and concrete example when you're talking about elements of control. Otherwise the person reading will relate to their own personal decisions.

&gt; but I'm generally very lazy.. 

Intuitive types are described this way. But **anyone can be lazy.**

&gt; And not to mention, the stacks are pretty similar: ENTP - Ne-Ti-Fe-Si INTJ - Ni-Te-Fi-Se

This is like saying ESTP and ISTJ are similar

ESTP; Se, Ti, Fe, Ni

"The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal."

ISTJ; Si, Te, Fi, Ne

"A strong ability to recognize internal physical states in themselves and others, to understand how these states are reached and how to recreate and avoid certain states. Individuals who possess Si as a base function are drawn to situations that satisfy their inner physical impressions and try to eliminate those conditions that are incongruent to their senses."**ENTP**: You are a clever, quick-witted inventor, endlessly creative with loopholes in systems of logic and always fast with a joking retort during a debate. You're a whiz-bang lawyer or a famous entrepreneur, following your amazing vision.

**ESTP**: Sex god.Why not use an existing test?I wouldn't be able to finish if she's too passed out to cum. Need sound fx.I dont do ideas. I just know what works!&gt; Why does it happen?

Obvious opportunity for ELI5 joke about the birds and bees!I just *naturally* know what works. *Naturally*.You sound too emotionally involved to get it.Somethin is full when i stop.Do you want to have a 'fuck-off'? I suggest we take it in turns. You can go first. But we'll have to hit up something common pool that we've both done before. Your mother seems to be the only choice.

Also, if your assertion of sex gods not stopping were accurate... that would imply they remain buried in the one pussy. Which most people would probably agree disqualifies that individual from god-like status. This is more like pussy whipped.

I can easily read that FFG is projecting somewhat - he's reacted quite poorly to my self confidence and really projected insecurity. This is really amusing to me! When people assert irrelevant things onto me it's really easy to let them wash off.

But it says *loads* about the other persons mental status.

I really do think you're accurate in your assessment of this personality. You can see the effect of projection as this person had assumed from teh start that i shared similar life circumstances. But i'm over a decade out of college ... so it's not even something i would feel the need to validate or correct (more opportunity to observe projected qualities of FFG and see him wind himself up).

I've met quite a few of these people online and it's fun to toy with them. I may have mentioned before that i sometimes act like a magnet for bullies... i really enjoy facing off against someone who has a problem. I'm super confident of my wit... so i tend to just engage in a play back and forth.

This FFG person got boring really quickly. Unable to throw anything witty back. I genuinely posted the thread because i wanted to humiliate this pathetic troll.

I did get the /u/dolandump2016 vibe here... And that would explain why FFG got a major boner here. Holding grudges is a very Fi thing.

The sad fact is that i'd classify this person as ESFP with ESTP envy. He's clearly not that strong with logic and is mostly reacting to his feelings.kinda stained 3 towels :(You misunderstood. That's what you're labelled as now. It's for *my* amusement dumbass.Yeah you're probably right... i just noticed that the disagreeable ESTPs seem to have weak Ti... (in other words they seem a bit Fi to me instead).

But i'm not much of a typologist. Thanks for the heads up.i'm only pudgy cos your mom keeps feeding me dat sugarlol, yeah i type a two words "sex god" joke in the original thread and you harass me like a nympho

you slut, *i only got horny cos you're riding my dick*whers your pics mang?I want to make a joke about going Ti to Ti (as in toe to toe)... but i just don't think it's funny enough.&gt; I'm only here to point out how desperate for attention you are. Oh and that you're stupid. And pudgy. And a moron. And stupid

http://i.imgur.com/icfkdIj.pngeheheheh! That put a grin on my chops.It's much more fun for us both if you ride my dick IRL, send picAnd despite the massive hypocrisy in your statement... this thread only exists because *you* sought my attention.

Doesn't bother me! I generally do whatever i want.pics or getrektThere's plenty of other threads. It's even titled hate the game not the player. If you don't care about trolls, then it's really a waste for you.

But i really enjoy it when i find someone i can be a dickhead to without feeling bad about myself. Okay. Let me indulge.Look at all these people [laughing](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mdazf/hate_the_game_not_the_player/d3uo45g) at you.

Don't try to pretend anyone here is laughing *with* you. You're very much the clown.Erm. Look at how much you project. From start to finish with our interaction every single time i stress you... you project (defence). Which makes you incredibly easy to read.

essentially "pics or gtfo" whenever i see this trollingnah, like i mentioned... her flappy loose labia wrapped around the head of my dick.Whats up with your footage? pics. Don't make me go all "zero cool" on your ass. lol.

Are you so deluded that you think you've got credibility here?FUCKING SHAME ON YOU LOLThis is almost apologetic, c'mon whers your pic? x)Well i'm not going to disagree with you there.nah it doesn't really make sense. i just wanted to make another challenge to the troll because i've nothing to lose. mods seem cool here.

plus... like... it's only reddit.Oh man. *So much projection* this dude basically told me his life story by trying to insult me... Okay that's not entirely true. Maybe other people told me some fucked up shit as well. But delusional about it. Denial. Projection. It's bad.

[RELEASE THE DRAMA LAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I502Ouk-mS0)Calling X out for Y and Z for harboring them.

It's kind of a standard drama format and i'm very sentimental about drama. It gives me that same feeling as when you're on holiday.

Anyway screw that Sp faggot. I'll make a pain of myself by seeing how far he bend over.Whats wrong with drama?

SP gotta learn that you don't bite off more than you can chew. That is all.This thread is kind like saying "i refuse to associate with the troll and will call out anyone that backs that retard".What's irrelevant about it?How does it *not* relate to mbti? Since it is a common aspect of miscommunication and mbti is about understanding how other people are different.

Do you not think it's important to consider?Well the immediate downvotes are part of the topic, wouldn't you agree?

It's quite relevant. And i consider it necessary as a part of a wider discussion. But this is not to continue my agenda. I don't dwell or hold grudges.

This *is* moving on.

Of course if the troll ever comes back then i'll play. I like playing.Thanks i'm still trying to gather some obvservations of the grip. Since i don't like to rely solely on my (reference point of 1) experiences.

There's a very interesting dynamic here is the way people interact.The scope is much wider than recent drama. Move on.Which assumption?Let me break it down for ya. Your comment dismissed the principle. Therefore you expressed disinterest. I can safely assume you're shit posting.

Benefit of the doubt; I clarified that this is not a continuation of an agenda for drama. I would like to discuss the topic.

But you're not interested in that... you're focusing on my agenda after i already expained.

What's your beef? And how does it relate to the topic?This is interesting. Thanks!

What do you thnk the implication is for personal growth of the psyche (if any)? And how common do you think the occurence (i mean how many people would experience it rather than how many times a particular individual to experience a grip)?

I'm sort of trying to work out where i stand on it being nature vs nuture.

I understand these are not particualrly reasonable (easy) question - i'm having an *inferior* day :)

I'm interested in the informed view.Thans, this is what i'm getting at!&gt; Kbnation is still being an attention seeking petty little manchild, but it's a good topic.

This gave me a boner :)I think it's really crucial to understanding other people. I mean you have to understand where you're predisposed to tripping yourself up - if you get me.

Once aware we are able to make more accurate observations.

And it's true that i see this every single day. It's such a common aspect of human nature. Especially when stress or shock is involved. This is how i know i am comparatively good at improvisation (for example) - because stress and shock are my forte.I'm not accusing anyone. Oh *wait*.... that would be you going back to the incorrect agenda again.

It's really easy to spot that. I'm estp.what type are you?

also you should understand that i am contributing on this subreddit as an example of type. that would mean you get a full sample.

i really am type 7 enneagram. so the "seeking validation" thing is something i save for people i actually trust and care about. attention seeking is different and it's very much true that people who don't want to play with me get left alone. you can see what happens if i percieve an attack.

this is an open forum - i can't trust and care about everyone. in reality there are those who will judge me for the wrong reasons. and if i leave it ultimately the subreddits loss and not mine.

it would be nice to go full circle and leave the subreddit with some estp hate :)So how do you feel when you use Te?interesting, thanks!that's estp as far as i'm concerned, but only because you mentioned that he doesn't seem uneasy in a crowd and can hold a conversation.

which is my bias. you'd have to know *why* he's comfortable socialising.

did you father persue your mother? i can't imagine an istp indulging in elaborate courtship. i'd love to hear an istp opinion on that.well he could very well be istp. it's quite hard to type when you aren't seeing all the aspects.

take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/4hn6o0/how_should_i_tell_the_difference_between_estp_and/) thread i posted a while back and see if you can fit one or the otherGreat read, thanks!Hmmm, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIKSe-4vI0)?

It's not always possible to separate things out distinctly into one function. A useful mental model is to consider information passing into the psyche from perception to judgement and this operates like a filter. I guess this is my experience but i filter out a lot of irrelevant stuff and then pass judgement on the remainder.

So there's quite a lot of linking in the way that we operate.I can only really speak for my own experience but ExxP seems to always filter from perception into judgement and there's maybe derivative filtering. I've been considering the arrangements of the stack in the context of the axis. And how those axis are wrapped around each other.

People talk about getting into a Ti cycle as that function seeks accuracy. But i consider that operation to work differently.

Thing is... i can't reference anything. This is just how i think it works.When peppermint last talked about my personal development (i volunteered to answer her typing questions).

In the analysis she mentioned that i was old enough for the dominant and auxilliary to be very firmly set in place. But that i still have some tertiary and inferior insecurities. I am born 1984.

I think that the stuff is there since you start cognitive development... but that you have to learn how to (usefully) operate weaker functions. That could take a variable amount of time.FWIW i don't condone this thread.

My brother requested an apology be given. None has been provided afaik. I have spoken with him to suggest dropping it. He doesn't care about reputation. This is a game to him.&gt; submitted 15 minutes ago

*And i'm stoned so the metering is off.*

Edit; SP i can tell you're still downvoting all my stuff. /r/interestingasfuck doesn't actually have the downvote button *enabled*... so it's really obvious. Did you not learn your lesson when all your alt accounts got banned?The type that i randomly get the most communication problems with seems to be INFP. This applies to situations that i describe as "taking liberties"... meaning pushing boundaries and stuff.

That type seems to openly reject my effort. Aside from that i don't get much communication issues.

Altho i have got to admit INTJ's just don't know how flirting works. This doesn't apply to ISTJ imo.Well the istj gives body clues at least. Facing toward you and stuff if they are interested. I can read them.

INTJ is like flirting with a frying pan. But this is just my experience. And i've gotten on very well with regular conversation with all types except the rare occassion whith an INFP (when i'm poking boundaries).my experience FP's make those invisible lines blatant, like glaringly so.. hey... maybe that's why i tend to be more around them... because they make it obvious where the lines are - and (of course) they can also see straight into my soul.Oh... I'm sorry... I misunderstood! You wanted me to openly declare that I redirected all the trolling through a previously established alt account with a username that *nobody* wants to type?! You'd like me to say that my brother isn't real and that it was me the whole time? Maybe you'd like me to admit that my agenda was to get troll accounts banned - and that I minimised any potential risk involved?

But that would be *lying*! Lying is naughty.I kinda thought that the OP wasn't interested in tertiary Fe when i read the thread last night.

From my perspective; disrupting the harmony irritates me but i can simply choose to not care if it will help me to tackle the issue. I think that this is actually a product of Ti rationality. I understand that the harmony will be restored and that it requires disharmony to aggressively engage.

In terms of reputation and jealousy... It's complicated. I'll try and explain with a particular situation; About 9 months ago i had a massive crush on this INFP who plays video games with us. She openly talked about *liking* another dude in the clan ... but i never felt jealous because she was still spending time with me. Our contact stopped abruptly after a bit of snap-chat. *That's* when i felt jealousy. Because she wasn't talking to me anymore.

In terms of respect... i only really care about the respect of those who have earned *my* respect. I have strong loyalties and i tend to uphold a 'treat other people just the way *they* treat other people' mentality.

I think that aspect is a product of Ti-Fe. I have  T preference and this nuances the way Fe operates.Off-topic... but /r/Solving_A858/ is really fun :)

I realize you're not a858... but i appreciate the reference ;pI think you'd be suprised what happens when an estp attaches a moral judgement to Ti. Sure it may be cold and rational... but the belief is true.

The internalisation is different. And i would say that the irrationality of Fi doesn't make it any less true... but that irrationality can sometimes be observed in the compulsion for Te to make things orderly. And *that* is where Fi can be cold where Fe is not.This is how i know i'm Se dom essentially.I have to turn the lights out before i start getting tired!

Sometimes i've been awake at 5am and like... "oh shit why am i still up?"I thought that was more to do with the Ti-Fe bit, makes you easy going and stuff. Observant of logic and peoples expressions and stuff.

I don't *really* know what i'm talking about :)Haha, yeah! That makes a lot of sense. Ti stores those value judgements in a different way to Fi and i guess i don't have words to describe how Fi does it.

I think it's equally interesting to see what each type considers irrational.Oh shit, *those are my words*! Thank you for returning them in such good condition ;p&gt; we just need to extract it

Hmmmmm......

Hey, perhaps we could [bottle it](http://i.imgur.com/osgSi18.png)?!This is very interesting, thanks.

When you were planning to move to another country do you think this built towards the time of moving? Did you go through any mental process of packing up?

&gt; I feel that everything is undecided until it's past me, like while certain thing is happening it's still undecided/doesn't have much fidelity but sometimes when I look past my shoulder I kind of can see that raw full of integrity impression.

I hadn't considered that. My perception of the world is very ridgid so it takes a lot to shake me. My expectations are usually confirmed. So perhaps my perception of a 'world changing event' is considerably more impactful.

Losing my phone down a drain *really* sucked. Those 5 stages of grief applied! That took a few hours!

&gt; Does it mean without inherent principles or w/o logic - because no human is fully logical.

I was trying to consider *why* we go through these phases and what implication this has for cognitive function. This is trying to think about the theory in a practical sense.

Trying it out i guess.Schizophrenia does not imply a split personality at all. But behavioral changes can occur.

With mbti it only means that you gave the test some different answers which changed the way you fit. But it's more important to consider that [creative minds](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10154775) mimic schizophrenia.

This would make it a challenge for the test accuracy. I wouldn't assume function changes are occuring.I guess i just *really* like travelling so i think about it alot. And i'm kinda sensitive to changes in the physical environment. Sensitive like; i observe the structure of the world around me and i take in a lot of detail (cliche) i would say that i notice a lot of detail when travelling or adapting to a new environment. It's only stagnant environment when i tend to ignore stuff.

When travelling I have an approach where i establish myself. New places are a common thing for me so i have a system. You find useful shops, find the main area of social gathering, find transport hubs. Don't care much after that actually - if we're there for a while then there are additional stages.

It used to be that i'd find a shop for smokes first. Every new place.

Your reaction is excitement at the beginning? When the decision to travel is made. You don't feel that excitement while travelling? I might be deep and lost in my own world ... but if i'm not driving i'll stare out a window. And i get bored in transit. But this is offset by music. And *staringateverythingthatexistsintheworldrightnow*.

&gt; I think my perception of the world, the first function it's just noise.

That sounds like how i disregard irrelevant detail with Ti. No it doesn't actually. But that's the closest approximation i can make... how do you survive noise?!

&gt; Since all types go through 5 stages of grief, (or maybe not? - but maybe I'm still to experience real grief - I didn't experience anger for sure) - they may be not about cognitive process?

Everyone goes throguh these. But i'm thinking that it's useful to explore any potential divergeance. I admit that the question isn't phrased so well. And it's delicate stuff so maybe people don't wanna use concrete examples.Oh dayum, that sounds painful. Interesting choice of words! The principles are more solid than the reality?

Hmm... i should finish thinkin before posting. I have this compulsion to ninja edit and ask questions.Part of the reason for posting is that i forgot what grief feels like. Maybe i should lay off the weed.

My last ... *relationship* ... ended a couple of months ago. Which upset me at the time... I could vaguely guess how long the phases took. It's not been long but i've sort of forgetten what it is like to feel sad now. And when presented with a reminder of that episode i rejected it with little concern (mild venting).

My buddy died in 2014 and it took a really long time before fully accepting it. Pretty much seeing the trombone on his coffin with a flag under it started me moving toward acceptance.

I had a few conversations after that which showed some of my friends were still at bargaining. People process things at different rates. It's useful to see perspectives when people have declared their personality type - but i'm fairly open minded here. I not expecting correlation. Just exploring.

It's a bit of a delicate topic for a open forum, right?For the mbti test to have better accuracy you should frame your answers around the healthy disposition. Which may be challenging if you are having effects.

Taking the test when experiencing illness only detracts from the usefulness of the result. It would be easy to make some assumptions that are potentially not supported under more healthy conditions.

It's a good assumption that functional change is not occuring. Because it is nt meant to happen and you revert back. But the mbti test doesn't have the scope to describe the effect of schizophrenia on your natural preference. You can use it to discover natural preference if you frame the answers around your childhood or the healthy state.

You may have gotten the wrong impression from the skewed result. I can't offer much help in explaining functional change as a result of the condition. But i would assume that the effects are better described by looking at information processing and the functional axis.

Type change would imply a change of personality but schizophrenia doesn't. Only a change of behavior. Behavior can be a result of many different things. It is inherently the problem with the mbti test.

Information is passed around different physical locations in the brain. Neuroplasticity describes the brain ability to adapt.

I'm running out of things here. Try searching for "schizophrenia jungian" and see what comes up from Jung rather than mbti.

I found [this](http://recoveryfromschizophrenia.org/2012/03/carl-jung-on-schizophrenia/)&gt; almost blaming the deceased before confronting the feelings behind it?

Good god. Yeah i had forgotten that. But i do remember spending time there. And muttering things to myself that don't seem appropriate now.

It doesn't bother me to tell people these things. That Ni grip gets softer and softer the more you achieve because you've proven to yourself that things *don't* go wrong!

Attitudes are changing regarding weed. And a lot of (currently) prohibited drugs. It's a dynamic landscape.

I have a particular attitude toward prejudice! You may have noticed. Society supports alcohol use which is significantly more dangerous than cannabis. I have argued that with police before and they basically said "fair enough" and let me walk away with my ~~joint~~ roach.Hmm. This makes me think that gap in perception is what drives my own curiosity for real factual data and detail. Building a firm perception of reality... also why it takes a while to adjust to a change in that perception.

I'm stuck here thinking of the implication for the other function axis and it paints a useful picture.There's no need. I forgot what sadness feels like! I remember being sad but that's different. I should really knock off the weed, right? :DHey it sounds like you got over it at the stage prior to partying! I mean emotionally. Okay, maybe at the rebuilding your reality after partying part. And gaining new perspectives!

ENTP buddy of mine recently had a tough time and had a really similar reaction to this. Health problem which changed work habits, he had relationship issue, went throguh some detachment and eventually he went unusually partyness and pushed himself... now i think he's reflecting and rebuilding a more comfortable reality.

Maybe a bit of a smaller scale. I know he didn't fully detach from his world at all. But he seem to me to detach from his gf of 2 years when he needed to fix his problems. Shit, i've done that and regretted it too tho, lol.

&gt; I always leave as many options and paths open.

Hey, that's familiar!

&gt; I always have contingency plans and alternate routes in my life. :3

*Plans*? What are those? The closest i get is a vague goal!I think the result can be easily interpreted. Perform a fuzzy analysis and reconcile your Ne/Ti/Fi/Si result into the closest fit of a valid mbti type; Ne/Ti/Fe/Si

ENTP

The Fi reading was not discarded. Either the test or the individual  was unable to detail the correct direction of expression. The strength of the preference in relation to the other modes of thought (meaning the position in the stack) can still be seen.

Take a [look](http://i.imgur.com/YhIMhim.png). The dominant function has a clear direction of expression. The auxiliary doesn't... But T is clearly the aux function. Similarly for F the direction of expression is wrong... and my speculation is that i haven't given the test a clear indication of the direction F is expressed and instead of seeing Fe-Ti in the result we can observe Fi-Te... But this doesn't fit a valid mbti type if there's a T preference with Se dom.

TLDR; F is not expressed as strongly as T... however it is expressed more strongly than N (S for you). There is no variability over which type this falls into. ESTP for me, ENTP for you.

Applying fuzzy logic to the results might seem incorrect... like an excuse for a bad test. Or you may have a concern that fuzzy logic is not accurate because you're ignoring the hard result... but it is actually a fuzzy interpretation in order to make a bad test fit a framework.&gt; Se - I'm bored. If you don't hurry up, I'm running in there. ~~dies~~ Wins in a hilarious 1v5 while tunnel-visioned on one enemy [at a time]

FTFYThey would be Ne/Fi/Te/Si

Function tests are bad at recording the direction of expression for functions lower in the stack. Because those functions are expressed weaker than the top two.

To answer your question discreetly... "What would someone who has Ne-Fi-Ti-Se be like?"... They simply wouldn't be.Do you think this gap (perception functions) between subjective reality and objective reality would imply a firm objective mindset (with S dom) but with a variable subjective process (the N component)?

This was a very interesting comment conceptually.Seems to be Fe higher in the stack than Ti - to the degree that analysis just doesn't consciously occur.

&gt; But primarily I work from the basis that all people are fundamentally the same

High empathy. And a Ti rationalization that we are all human and share commonalities.

&gt; and all (some less consciously than others) trying to do what's best for those we love

Fe oriented imo

&gt; It's the who we love (whether friends, family, the public, the self...) and what 'best' means to them (wealth, knowledge, happiness, God...) that is where people differ.

Rational facts provided by Ti... but it seems that T is low in the stack due to the next part;

&gt;  So that's usually where I come from if I do bother to think about it

---

&gt; we're all a bit pathetic (but in a livable way) and trying our best

and

&gt; And only show a little tiny bit of what is going on inside to the people around us, and often different tiny bits to different people.

Ni? I'm thinking this part is conclusion driven? The person seems sure of themself rather than 

Overall the sentence *feels* ENFJ to me. I wouldn't rule out ESFJ or the introverted options. There's not much info to get a full picture.

By comparison i would find xNFP more willing to pass moral judgement... and i would expect that to be noticeable in the descriptions through less of a broad acceptance of diversity. Factual accuracy is different from moral accuracy and i think the example text is divergent from Fi-Te.Let me tell you about discussing politics with an ENTP!

ENTP; presents interesting hypothesis

ESTP; shoots down hypothesis based on detail that was not considered

ENTP; the newly observed detail is questioned and explored to ascertain validity but not necessarily interested in fitting that detail into the hypothesis

ESTP; justifies the detail and relates it to the hypothesis in order to illustrate the need for accuracy and comparison for a good hypothesis

ENTP; tries to find that one example where the hypothesis is accurate despite the detail offered by the estp

ESTP; explains that one legitimate example doesn't convey accuracy, rather it is a burden of generic proof for the hypothesis

ENTP; calls the estp a dickhead

ESTP; calls the entp an idiot

*Both go and play Overwatch instead of discussing politics*Thanks this is a great contribution! It illustrates the different process between Si-Fe and Se-Ti to me.

So by comparison; When i moved away to study the first thing i wanted to do was explore (people, places, activities), and rather than adapt my lifestyle and routine i just scrapped all routine and start from the ground up.

&gt; I'm expecting this year to go much better, since I'll be able to have time to myself to figure out everything I need to do, and I won't have another person imposing their lifestyle on me and stressing me out.

It sounds like you were dealing with a constant interruption due to conflicting lifestyles. I'm also assuming that this circumstance did not challenge your understanding of reality? The irritation has been accepted into your perceived reality but would be avoided in future due to Si.

&gt; If it's smaller like my boss asking me to stay an extra 4 hours at work or something, I just need a few minutes to figure out if I can actually do that on the day they want, and then to get used to the idea and I'll usually be fine.

I think this (smaller scale example) succinctly captures the same perspective but with reduced impact compared with the living situation.Ah yeah... i've gone and put my own interpretation on the what those judgements mean i think. 

So i've just observed how to reach this position from my own functions. This is why i don't type people! I did initially get Te-Fi from teh text but changed my mind after over analysis.&gt; I just learned to accept it as a part of what living in my dorm was like, despite how much stress and anxiety it led to.

If the problem persists or became more intense i would get a bit more impulsive and that kinda means i have to control it. Your example illustrates some discomfort. It would entirely depend on how easy it is to ignore.

But if i can't ignore it you can guarantee i'll do something!

I like to maintain rationality and use a effective form of leverage. It actually helps to fix a problem if there's more stress or and a good focal point to address it. Part of the process is making sure other people acknowledge your perspective. They don't actually need to care as long as they implement some kind of action.

In your example the leverage available through official channels would seem too slow and ineffective. The action i would take is not particularly exciting. Nothing vigilante. I'd be calling the accommodation office on a daily basis, or trying to wok through my issues with the person directly.

If neither of these options produced a viable result i'd find new leverage / ramp up intensity on existing leverage / have an absolutely massive shit fit because i don't have leverage.

The caveat is that it takes a great deal of interruption to annoy me! Concrete example; A month ago the boiler broke in my flat and the landlord took 5 days to fix it. No hot water over the weekend pissed me off. I paid half rent for that week and would not accept any negotiation.*Hell yeah*... But it ain't as good value for money as Rocket League. Those mid air interceptions mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... much satisfaction, very toight.

I'm mostly playing games with a [clan](http://www.jestersnc.com/) so i've got the voice comms, joining with a premade team, discussing and analysing the meta.

Currently i'm being the "Bastion Bitch" (this character can deploy as a stationary minigun with brutal insta-gib potential at all ranges).

My buddy plays a lot of Reinhardt. This combo is devastating... a big hammer wielding guy with a shield big enough to cover a whole team... thousands hp of of damage absorption with a deployed minigun capable of wiping the enemy team in abut 5 seconds flat... Yep... it's fun!

That setup is very strong but it can be countered to varying degrees by; Tracer (close quarters), Junkrat (close to mid range), Reaper (close range), Pharah (mid to long range), Widowmaker (long range). And there are combinations of characters which have unique synergy (and also comps with fairly typical fps synergy). I'm sure there are other counters that i've not discovered yet. Oh yeah... *Genji* can reflect bullets. That insta-gib potential can be reflected!

It's not as good as Rocket League because it's 3 times the cost and similar level of playability / production value. It's got more lifetime to it tho. Can't see myself getting bored with so much variety of meta and comp to master.Did you misunderstand this bit;

&gt; The Fi reading was not discarded. Either the test or the individual was unable to detail the correct direction of expression. The strength of the preference in relation to the other modes of thought (meaning the position in the stack) can still be seen.

Either **the test** or *the person* was unable to ascertain the direction of expression. You did not acknowledge that the test isn't able to make a perfect measurement of your psyche.

You trust the test too much. In fact you trust the result more than the framework of theory which the test is built upon.

&gt; but all of them were about being original and finding my purpose and I feel like that is a big part of me

The Fi reading is not discarded in my analysis. It is interpreted as erroneous. The position of F in the functional stack fits.

It's consistent if you accept that tertiary and inferior functions are expressed much weaker in the psyche. This makes then harder to accurately measure.

Consider this... Tertiary Fe is not that distinct from Fi higher up the stack... but the test is not able to tell that. Ti can store moral judgements and that may increase the representation of Fi.

Function tests are not as dichotomous as other types of test. This is the only reason you can find these anomalies... the test is not able to dynamically adjust in order to compensate for lost accuracy in the lower portion of the stack.

This is why fuzzy logic is useful to interpret the result. The dominant function is the most clearly expressed. Auxiliary will be stronger than the rest. Tertiary and inferior will be in correct proportion but it's likely that these readings are weak enough that the test cannot accurately determine the direction of expression.That sentiment is entirely lacking from your previous reply;

&gt; I did understand the questions regarding Fi and I did agree with them

But *sure*... you **literally** asked if the test was misleading. If the word literally means something entirely different since, like, yesterday.Sounds like ISTP to me.

&gt; It's like I'm in a castle and forbidding most people from entering.

and

&gt; I listen to my hunches and instincts when in the company of people.

but

&gt; I'm terrible at small talk

So i figure you have tertiary Ni. Inferior Fe.

The Ti-Se is easier to spot. You live a world of logic and it is a defining aspect of your character - but also the nuance of disagreeableness, straightforwardness, but the desire to keep moving depicts ISTP.

A *healthy* ISTP.

&gt; I tend to retrospect on my life in an analytical way

Ti

&gt; I hate waiting. I prefer stairs to elevators because I like to move, I can't bear standing still, not doing anything.

Se.

&gt; Like, if I decide to learn a new skill or become interested in something new, I would ruthlessly find and store articles, videos, etc. pertaining to it but rarely actually get around to doing something with them.

This describes Ti preference over Se. I have a similar approach but would be more predisposed to have a go first, then analyze the result, possibly fix any problems or just wing it.

I've assumed that you collect this info due to a preference to fully understand (possibly plan the approach) before trying the new thing?

I made a thread to separate characteristics of ESTP and ISTP [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/4hn6o0/how_should_i_tell_the_difference_between_estp_and/) and it may be useful to you for discovering commonalities.

I'd also recommend the test at [keys2cognition](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm)This says INTJ to me. I'll explain it.

Totals; S = 50.3 / N = 68.4 / T= 61.2 / F = 59.5

This builds N / T / F / S

*Which means you are a hard disk [file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS)*

NTFS fits ENTP... Ne / Ti / Fe / Si

And INTJ... Ni / Te / Fi / Se

This is a fuzzy logic approach to interpreting the result. I can understand why the test would assign you INTJ but it's not definitive. That Fi result seems erroneous and this result is completely different from the analysis of function from your text.

If i was you i would go through the test very quickly - skipping questions that do not have a huge preference for you. Then i would go back over those skipped questions after the 'first pass' and decided but leave the answer close to the mid-line (so as to minimize potential disruption to the questions we're confident about).

I'd do that just to check the result. Primarily we're using it to identify the top two functions - but your result shows T and F are very close... in fact i would expect Fi auxiliary if the Fi result is not marked as anomalous.

That would produce NFTS which fits INFJ and ENFP (excluding the direction of expression).I didn't necessarily agree when you said that you understood the questions! Nor when you claimed 'literally' doing something that you didn't do.

&gt; Just please if you are going to be more of a disturbance than a help I would rather you not comment on my post.

Telling you my honest opinion *is* helping.Yeah but

Fi - 44.8 / Ni - 40.6 / Te - 32.5 / Si - 22.6

Doesn't exist. So perhaps you have a better analysis?

Perhaps Fi / Te / Ni / Se

Which also doesn't exist. I've stated the valid possibilities that have any kind of correlation to the test result. I'd say that was the best analysis available.Nah i'm alright. I stand by my initial assumption of ISTP. I gave you options because they are there and you did the test.From the [sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/48x9m8/my_analysis_of_functions/)Erm. You just told me i took something at face value and then proceeded to do a face value analysis (which kinda illustrates how mine isn't).

Do you understand the difference between fuzzy logic and binary logic?

&gt; which denotes or INTJ or ISFP with an introverted function subtype

That's interesting.. How did you derive Se in the auxiliary position here? And what do you mean by introverted function subtype.You sound mad.

And you don't know the functions for ISFP.Nah truth be told i just said that to wind you up. That's what you should expect to happen if you call an estp's logic absurd. Without even understanding the process.

I highlighted in my posts *how* that method of analysis provides a *viable* type. It's the closest fit from a fuzzy logic perspective (great that you don't care.. really useful to tell me that you don't value the way a computer makes a rational judgement when there are fuzzy variables to consider). Which hardly makes it absurd.

I see your socionics inspired point and will remind you that for this to be the case the personality would be paranoid if Te and Se were not doing it's job for an INTJ / ISFP

The person does not present as paranoid.

Edit; Also if you have processed the data into a different form... this is precisely *not* face value.Alright fine... a casual look (trusting the data and not just disregarding the Fi) says INFP. Like really really clearly. I just didn't want to say it.

I'm bored of seeing INFP in the data whilst being almost completely blind to it in a description.Mushrooms definitely do something for Ni

And i can confirm that Se users may partake in the odd splifferooniMan that's a really good point about the coffee, [sheeeeeeeet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1dnqKGuezo)Yep, the fact that the scope doesn't include commonly used legal drugs has kinda killed the article for me :(

Nicotine isn't in there. Nor things like sugar - and (i'm *really* not talking about anyone who might read this comment) some Se users i do recognise that they can have a food fascination.

So you're very correct there. *Holy shit an ENTP did it to me*... you've pointed out that it's cherry picked reasoning to fit a stylish (possibly) model.

But no srsly my brain on mushrooms. Everything in the world made sense. So i explained it. For 4 hours or so. Casually.What's your point? I have an opinion. Did you want something from me? You asked me not to disturb and now you're asking me to give you more of my opinions.

Make your mind up.Well i'll answer it then.

I would know if you understood or not based on whether you had observed that the test has error bounds. And the user taking the test. I explained these options and you decided to take offence. Meaning a delicate Fe indeedy!

That leads me to believe you are easily led with low emotional maturity - you chose to focus attention on a negative aspect. The potential for criticism. And you ignored the relevancy of the test error bound - which is very obviously my explanation. Edit; if you misinterpret my simple explanation then the test would potentially pose a challenge!

But that *is* my opinion in case you were interested :)Oh! [Not at all](http://i.imgur.com/W0R72Jm.jpg)!!!I think stereotypes can cause a problem with confirmation bias and some personalities are predisposed to fascination with novelty (rather than analytical accuracy).

If someone really likes an aspect of themselves it may be relevant or it could be an idealistic impression of 'best'.

Stereotypes cause problems for mbti because they are also suggestive of behavioural trend. In the context of mbti I believe personal experience and knowledge acts as a modifier which perverts the validity of *some* classic stereotype descriptions.[ENFP](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_per.html) personal development. Perhaps you've seen this already. I find these pages accurate and useful.Facebook feed led me to 16personalities test

The test result was intriguing because it explained the implications that connect 'how i think' with 'how i act' (sometimes) and rationally described why these things are important to me.

I was interested in psychology from a young age but dropped it as an active pursuit, over a decade ago, in favor of more physical activities.&gt; It may not be fair to say John doesn't care

[Understanding the implication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac).

"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another."

Dr. Oppenheimer, on whom had rested a very heavy burden, grew tenser as the last seconds ticked off. He scarcely breathed. He held on to a post to steady himself. For the last few seconds, he stared directly ahead and then when the announcer shouted "Now!" and there came this tremendous burst of light followed shortly thereafter by the deep growling roar of the explosion, his face relaxed into an expression of tremendous relief.

"I'll never forget his walk; I'll never forget the way he stepped out of the car ... his walk was like High Noon ... this kind of strut. He had done it."

Oppenheimer was proud of this achievement. However, he was aware of the gravity of this advancement in technology. It might not have been *as important* to him as the discovery.

Edit; the quote is often misinterpretted. I will highlight the relevancy...

&gt; Vishnu is trying to persuade **the Prince** that **he should do his duty** and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form

The statement is not about becoming the bringer of death. It is about the responsibility that comes with tremendous power.As far a i am aware the difference between Ni and Ne is the way weight is assigned (and this is a product of extra or intro version of the function in the psyche).

No descriptive words are going to be ideal... but here's a succinct division between the two modes of N.

Ne is inventive.

Ni is innovative.

For this to make sense you must consider that invention is the creation of a new thing. Innovation is to make changes that incorporate new ideas into a previously established model.

This is one way to describe the incorporation of new ideas into the operation of the psyche related to an external reality or an internal framework. Ne vs Ni.

To address the question discreetly; It depends on teh gut feeling. If this is a gut feeling that there are better options and more chance for discovery - then i would assume Ne. If the gut feeling relates to some previously established conditions but is modulated into an expectation... that's what i'd call Ni.&gt; you're getting tricked by your Fe into naive, grandiose and innocent views on the world and on people in general.

Yes. Always have been naive this way. I'm more cautious these days but that detracts from the enjoyment of Se dom!

&gt; When reality strikes it's really hard. Especially for us ESTP because we hoped for so much more.

My reason for asking the question was due to the rigidity that i find in my personal world... combined with relatively weak emotional control. I know that i have emotional maturity because i remain positive and easy disregard negative feelings (this is a cognitive definition of emotional maturity)... however i do not express keen emotional control (product of Se-Fe?). What i mean by this is that i'll happily remain positive but can also be a complete bastard while doing that!

This led me into considering the effect of the functional axis when they are further apart or closer together.

So for ESTP Se and Ni are wide, Ti and Fe are close. This makes our objective perception of reality very firm... but our thinking and feeling more changeable.

I wanted to explore this without revealing the discreet purpose. In order to evoke conversation i had to approach delicate subject matters.

This thread largely only addresses the Perception axis.

---

I also wanted to add that your advice is spot on. Absolutely. And thank you for this contribution.I think that intuition is about making connections (regardless of the direction of expression). When those connections are made - this is expressed as an idea in the psyche. I also believe that this is why creativity is linked with some forms of psychosis... because those connections are not always good for the psyche (highly speculative... pinch of salt required).

Ideas don't originate from nowhere - i assume the psyche is not aware of the subconscious instigation of a thought process for generating new ideas (new connections). This may be a biased view due to N being my inferior function and weakly expressed (stronger than *some*, lol).

&gt; Is the process of creating a new idea the part of Ne that is considered "intuition"

I would consider it a product of generating connections in the external environment.

&gt; Is the indication that something can be innovated the part of Ni that is considered "intuition"

I would consider it a product of generating connections in the internal framework.[Fe-ed me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2FMDV8yW9M)

Edit;

&gt; This message is for the FJs that keep following me around because i'm an ESTP and they see themselves as being compatible with me.

**Your account is 2 hours old**. So, like... (captain obvious strikes again) you're clearly **S**hit **P**osting.Whenever i felt anxious about something i would get lots of adrenaline. This makes me want to dive in head first. Do this often enough and you discover that it's not so bad... Then i got really good at winging it.

I'm not so sure about bypassing the auxiliary. In times of stress i can choose to wing it or choose to break the problem down via analysis. Or flip-flop between those modes. I don't seem to get anxious anymore... it's been replaced with excitement at the challenge.

&gt; Here: -Use your Ti, we need a place to eat, is this one close/cheap/related to what we usually do? ==&gt; YES==&gt; then go even if a couple of people might hate it.

This is a really good example of a "winging it" compromise.

I realized while on the train home yesterday that i have always been arrogant with Ti judgements and humble with Fe judgements. I'm still considering the implications.

&gt; in your path towards personal growth, regarding your type, what was your secret weapon to get out of this?

The single most important aspect of personal growth for me was to acknowledge when i am ignoring a problem / irritation rather than implementing a solution.

It's not lazyness. I just find it *really* easy to focus and ignore irritation. Unless that irritation is a person... because i'm apparently predisposed to fucking with people who make themselves my problem.Oh man, that reminded me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RySHDUU2juM) epic love tale :)

Mostly because i have them in the same playlist.If you find someone is struggling to type it might be a good idea to get them to analyze their childhood behavior. It only takes a few hard trends to assist in clarifying the dom and aux functions (which defines the type).

&gt; Is it because he's too 'balanced' between the functions, or is it because he doesn't know himself well enough? Or something else?

Natural preferences are there. They may be subtle or they may be modulated by the individuals experiences. Looking at childhood can help to avoid the confusion from environmental factors.

Example; An extroverted personality may be very repressive if they believe they have caused harm or have suffered abuse. This is a *very* vague example of a modification to perception and judgement as a product of life experience. And it is speculation.I love [this joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohyfNPKW16g)!I was born in 1984. My Fe is currently pushing 12 yrs old.

Edit; 

&gt; *I hate repeating this, and some probably don't like it, but MBTI, ideally, should be used for self-improvement and as a communicative bridge.*

So much agree. So much!I'm glad you asked! Fe is our tertiary so you take your age, divide by three, and add the number of times you've cried (because Fe, right?)

31 / 3 + 2 = 12 (rounded)

This is the short form. [Here's the long form](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7pZu2.png)

predictable things are empirically accurateI'm fairly sure it's the SP troll trying to evoke a discussion over how childish tertiary Fe is... because he got [absolutely rekt](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4mmght/fun_with_rmbti_trolls/) at the weekend.Cos they're wussy.So what?I really like going full tilt. Any old excuse! I operate a 3 strikes rule. If the troll is persistent enough that they continue after 3 polite dismissals then i drag them through the mud.

Huuuuge justice boner. Hnnnnnng.because i can do what i wantwhat cheesy website?Well no you can't guarantee that you won't get accused, lol

FYI I don't careThe second half of my joke;

Fe &gt; sweet 16 = Fi^c

Where c stands for crying *alone*. OP is on their last legs. It's practically an obituary.&gt; Fe wants to be weird, they tell you how weird they are, and because they've told everyone, they become normal.

Yes. (do want)where?you're wicked smart :)Should i join [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_principles)?!http://lonerwolf.com/psychological-projection/Yes :)

But i realised that i wrote this equation *really* lazily so it doesn't make a great deal of sense as it is presented.

They are arbitrary sums tho ;pYeap. The closest 2nd i usually get is ENTP, unless it was a functions test in which case it just processes it by flipping scores around and pushes ISTP or ESFP possibilities (edit; actually kinda rarely).

But the tests that don't break down a result in functional number hickypoke always say ESTP and consider ENTP.

&gt; I am stunned by some of the freakishly bizarre yet similar occurrences noted in our anecdotes and outlooks

It's kinda reassuring, right?! To discover that you're not the only person who's seeing the detail and making the most rational judgement. (tried to get through that unarrogantly)[Science](http://www.dogchannel.com/images/news/2014/science-dog.jpg)!Mature Fe my [ass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESVOF6DScKQ). Laugh, damn you. Laugh!*Yes* ;)I have a strong hunch about that user, lolWho said INFP was warm and cuddly? That's like saying a panther is warm and fuzzy. Technically true... But missing the pointy bits.Posted for comment and opinion.Nobody wants to talk about it. That's an issue for me. Analysis is necessary and not for enjoyment.Thanks.True true.This was posted for comment and opinion. I'd explain my thoughts but you know how popular that would be.

Ultimately, this is gonna happen. And an apology wouldn't kill the goit either. But yeah. I generally do what I want. It was a false assumption from somebody that I particularly care about public opinion of *my actions.

I came to this subreddit to share. And you're disrupting my thread and perverting the course of commentary. If you want me to move on **stop doing that**. Cos I'm very comfortable. I can be the bad estp. I choose not to be unless something gets in the way.

Plus... Your perspective is polarised. Surely you can acknowledge that you sit in an echo chamber? It's one of the reasons I didn't take part much.Sry I've been in a muddy field all weekend. The word cuddly isn't processing properly right now, it's been replaced with mud. Along with everything else in my backpack!The test gets confused is all... Sure, It's possible but I'm not hugely creative unless improvising!

Things like playing guitar are not creative things - if you just learn things you like to hear. But the process of training technique can be creative... In the moment.

Plus... Would an INFP break up a fight by yelling louder than the ppl fighting?! Cos I kinda did that yesterday!Thanks! Useful perspective :)I'm hoping to graduate my Fe into Fi as soon as I remember how crying works!I still doubt estp sometimes... And here's a recent happening that makes me question T vs F preference;

So at this muddy music festival I saw some people mud wrestling. One man had torn and ruined the bra of a rather top heavy lass! The guy was tackled, a little (edit) blinded by mud, kneeling to wipe his face... And the other guy kicked him square in the face.

Nope. Not allowing it. "What the fuck are you doing"... I basically marched over into the mud pit to yell in his face for dirty fighting over nothing.

And then the first guy got back up and started swinging again.

Anyway. I wonder how other types would react... it wasn't for validation or personal satisfaction. I got in the way of this fight cos ppl don't know their strength with kicking. Don't kick ppl in the face. Is that Ti? Or Fe, Fi, Te? Probably Ti.

And the adrenaline connected with a moral stance made it seem emotional. My voice was wonky after that yelling.

And I wonder how this was processed. I felt very emotional about it. And I had huge adrenaline for the next 20 mins or so. Maybe I like the adrenaline. I gotta admit that I immediately thought that interrupting them was pointless when they just grabbed each other again.

But yeah. Impulse decisions are not always well thought out!&gt; are all INFPs necessarily creative?

Well you make a good point. Nothing is guaranteed ... And considering everyone *can* communicate, and be influenced by other people or their environment, learn new tricks, or brutal lessons... then who knows. *Realistically* i'm commenting on this subreddit to discover commonalities and satisfy curiosity.

I don't really have another agenda. And I've had a blow out weekend to forget the annoying little shit that has nothing better to do than troll this sub. So i'll likely come off less emotive after that release ;p

Mud mud mud mud mudumdumdumdumdumdumudmud.

I found mbti interesting enough to read the material. I took a bunch of tests and [analyze it] after a short while before introduce myself. I like showing off and telling my stories... but ultimately i'm here to confirm type. Or splurge my bullshit over another group of people... cos that's fun too!

---

There's two (sort of confirmed i guess) INFP that i know quite well. One is female and works in design. The other is male and just finished a physics degree. My sister is enfp and studied a masters degree in art. I believe that your interests are not defined by type... but that there is a tendency for people to continue doing things they've found a niche for.

Anyway... I know them well enough to know they are quite different in some interests. But they're both competitive playing vidyah gaimz. Both social. Both have limits of how far you can poke them (which i rarely ever get near). Both tend to ignore me if i piss them off. They can have dark sense of humor. And they handle people situations differently to me.

Generally their topics are less engaged in the present context as they are focusing during intense moments. I've usually been more of a commander (but that's not to say they can't do that too).

I could easily be INFP - and perhaps the communication issue i have thought existed is just a polarised perspective from interactions on here. I like these two people and i do think that sometimes they struggle to communicate the nuance of how they feel about something.

But so do i. :)

I think i'd get on better with my sister (enfp) if i was infp. Not that we do not get on... but we frequently have to work on communicating as she gets more emotive i tend to get more rational... these things are deeply frustrating for the other person.

Walking away works!

&gt; without any of the good stuff

*Yeah right!*

It's interesting that you mention these aspects of communication.

&gt; speak louder, look people in their eyes, etc

When i was growing up I remember noticing the different ways people would respond when i talked with different people. I pick up visual ques quit well. I can tell who is interested in talking to who by position, expression, how 'into' the conversation they are... are these things not obvious to everyone else?

Realistically... can you tell when someone you just met fancies your friend? I would think that most people can tell this right away.

Anyway... maybe i trained myself to be an ESTP against my natural frerence as a Fi dom :) and training myself to evoke particular reactions or lead conversations.

Either way... i'm *really* good at shit talking!Dealmaker; enable me to do things that i want to do. keen to do things with me.A quick faq would be nice :)The estp is not subtle at all. "Come with me" lolLegendary.I appreciate your effort and i think i see what you're trying to do (in terms of organizing the data)... however there are some points we should consider;

There are 8 different expressions of function. These are raw descriptions and may or may not be as useful as interpreting that function into recognizable judgements / perceptions / behaviors / beliefs.

In the *viable* arrangements those 8 functions produce 16 types of personality. This is clearly not every possible combination of the functions but adheres to a framework of how the functional axis operate.

So we already have a framework that is based on simple definitions that expand to cover a wider diversity of type. Looking further you can define commonalities between subtypes or perform a micro analysis (this is how i would refer to a exclusive FJ analysis) on specific functional combinations.

Analyzing micro trends (this is how i would refer to an FJ analysis) is in effect a ~~higher level~~ wider scope of understanding. We're no longer interested in the raw functional expression but looking for commonalities in a wider pool of people (FJ allows us to compare ESFJ, ISFJ, ENFJ, INFJ for commonalities).

It's important to understand what FJ means. What do ESFJ, ENFJ, ISFJ, and INFJ have in common (regarding functional expression)?

ESFJ; **Fe**, Si, Ne, **Ti**

ENFJ, **Fe**, Ni, Se, **Ti**

ISFJ; Si, **Fe**, **Ti**, Ne

INFJ; Ni, **Fe**, **Ti**, Se

---

TLDR; It's useful... especially for those who are more advanced in their analysis of the theory. But i wouldn't consider it more simplistic than learning the implication of functional expression. Essentially a two letter analysis is an extension to incorporate a full functional axis (rather than the individual functional expression).I don't trust the often quoted [MBTI population data](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm).

&gt; The estimated frequency table was compiled from a variety of MBTI¬Æ results from 1972 through 2002, including data banks at the Center for Applications of Psychological Type; CPP, Inc; and Stanford Research Institute (SRI).

Here are some problems i have with the stats;

* They are old.
* Exclusively from US population.
* People have a tendency to misrepresent the facts if their income could be affected.
* Businesses that use this system for hiring and firing will likely develop preferences (thus polarizing the sample group over time).
* Does not account for self employed, less standard employment opportunities, etc.

Expected implications; (*this is all speculation*) i would assume these results are skewed. By comparison the /r/mbti community is boasting 20% INFP according to the most recent survey result i read. And has 70%+ N type.

Correlation does not equal causation. But due to the drastic difference in analysis of these results from two sample groups (mbti official frequency figures compared with the last small survey taken on /r/mbti) ... then we can assume the environment under which the test is taken is important...

Not only because of the direct implication of taking a "mental capabilities" test at work.

We also need to call into question the accuracy of the test. Most people perform "better" in a test environment if they prepare. For the interest of typology it could be polarizing to provide people with a full description of what they are being tested for prior to the test.

Yet if you do not communicate the objective than many people will answer the test "incorrectly". Not intentionally... but because many people are not predisposed to self analysis.

&gt; The ones that claim they are global have the exact same numbers

[Here](https://www.ashridge.org.uk/Media-Library/Ashridge/PDFs/Publications/MBTIResearchIntoDistribution2.pdf) are some difference stats taken by a business school over 10 years (2001-2011 it seems). *Please note that the sample group are business managers / have some connection to the business school / are not general population*.

This data shows aggregated dichotomous options for E vs I, T vs F, S vs N, and J vs P.

**For this sample group** of 22,800 or so respondents. Please note that i have rounded the figures for ease of conveying the point.

E; 65% - I; 35%

T; 86% - F; 14%

S; 52% - N; 48%

J; 67% - P; 33%

So if we were to accept this as a sample group of general population then we would believe that 86% of people are T preference. Edit; But **interesting to note that despite knowing these stats are skewed we have almost 50-50 S vs N**.

It is very important to frame statistics appropriately. Or they *literally mean nothing*. If you are analyzing statistics then it is impossible to have accurate framing unless the median value for general population is displayed for comparison.

Statistics can be used to show anything... unless they are grounded in reality. In which case they're good at illustrating reality.

Edited for minor corrections.There's actually not a great deal of data out there. People do not seem to fund research in this area at all.

So the statistical data that does get used is largely skewed due to the conditions under which the test was taken (talking big picture here).

Anecdotally; I would expect that a study *without bias* would likely reveal about 50-50 distribution for each dichotomy. I see no reason to expect anything different when aggregating the results.

Expecting anything else would need a reason.I bet we probably did the same search to find it. I specifically wanted European statistics to provide contrast with the commonly quoted US ones. And the reason for that is the diversity of work culture across Europe. In those results you can clearly see a T bias - but S vs N are 50-50 (or as close as needs be to make a point).

Interestingly the sample group is 3/4 male. This correlates with an [infographic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/71/6e/70/716e707b22eb172ccce9cf3ba6141f25.jpg) i found a while back. I particularly like this one because they have a grey line to indicate mean / median value.

I believe that a 50-50 distribution for each dichotomous pair (E vs I for example) is most likely. Otherwise we would see vast trends across humanity (maybe we do, lol).How do you feel about [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/6oqJHx6.jpg)? :DDo you remember how it started?

Edit; Actually more importantly, do you remind yourself how it started so that you hold the grudge?Meh... I was mingling at the [weekend](http://i.imgur.com/wb61Bea.jpg). Now i'm in a office with barely much to do.

&gt; My suggestion would be to lay low from reddit for a little while until the troll simmers down.

That would actually be caring! As mentioned several times i tend to do what i want and it's well known that ESTPs will sort of trample over more sensitive types.

Who would've thought an ISTP would be so incapable of using Ti and so sensitive!You should block me then. This is a really easy way for you to not see my posts anymore!

Much more effective than shit posting in my threads.It's a good answer and helps me frame it.

&gt; Which annoys the fuck outta me. Maybe I'm projecting here, but from my point of view, it's just straight disrespectful and indirectly saying "fuck you" to my face.

Do they invite your brother but not yourself? That's the implication i got here and if that's the case... then i easily understand why you don't like them!

I'm wondering if you offended them. It's likely (in my mind) that you crossed one of those lines and the whole thing got stored in somebody's Fi.

Just a suggestion :)*Where's the fun in that*?Do you remember how it started? Or is it more to do with frustration at communication issues?I'm glad to hear it. Do you mind telling us what the conflict was about?I would find it hard to work with that person as well. But equally i'd probably have a lot of fun winding them up! My recommendation in those situations is to say something along the lines of "You would know if i was trying to burn you because you'd be burnt".

Or "there's much better ways of burning you - why would i choose such a inefficient method?"

Followed by *-Deadpan look-*

Or i might try and play it off with an "Oh you" look and this would intentionally convey to them that they are being silly or childish.

It sounds like that person doesn't like you. They assume the worst despite how reality is. When people don't like me, i hate / resent them back. Not in a vindictive way... but most of their activities and input becomes trivial in my mind. They just don't matter anymore.I really enjoy this attitude!&gt; I pity them for their insecurities, for projecting it to people whose light and happiness intimidate them.

I can relate. This is how i feel about that SP character who's meant to be permanently banned from reddit.Have you ever felt jealous? (i use that as a proxy for sustained resentment).No worries, i'm glad that you posted and it is a useful data point :)

I don't really want to reveal what i'm doing with my threads about nasty things. But they have all been completely legit and part of a project.You have resilliance. That's not the same as being an asshole :)Great attitude :)This sounds like Ti-Fe axis.Hey, thanks. This is really useful.&gt; slanderously lying and misrepresenting with throwaway accounts

You should look at your clique first before criticising others.&gt; Are you a good driver?

Yes. I have learned the N√ºrburgring through video games to the degree that i know the corners and can follow videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw__fOqTlJo). I've taught myself and trained some advanced technique with a buddy. I have practiced cornering sideways on a WRC rally course (the gate was wide open, tehehe). I have crashed one car and have never received a penalty point on my license.

&gt; Do you enjoy driving?

Yep, currently don't have a car tho. So it's not the most important thing i guess.

&gt; Do you tend to daydream while driving or are you very much in the moment?

Both. I daydream but instantly snap out of that if required. There's no lag. Maybe i consider focus to be daydreaming. They feel the same to me.

I'm good at doing things automatically. Much of my road observation and maneuvering is done completely without thought. This might leave my to concentrate on something more important... like singing to myself.

&gt; Do you have to have music playing while you're driving or do you prefer to drive in silence?

Depends how much concentration is required. I would not listen to music for advanced driving. I would listen for cruising.

&gt; Do you get road rage easily?

Not really. Well... yes. But it's instantaneous rage. "Don't bother to indicate mate, i'm clairvoyant." I usually make myself feel better by calling stupid road users stupid. But that's the worst of it.

&gt; mbti type

estpHow do you embarrass an estp?

And your assertion that other people do not enjoy the drama isn't supported by the feedback i have received.

You are deluded if you think i stand to lose anything at all.This just illustrates how deluded you are. lol

I'm *completely* comfortable here. Edit; i'll tell you the same thing i told SP... saying the same thing over and over doesn't make it true. Shattering isn't it?

Echo. ^Echo. ^^Echo. ^^^Echo.Thanks for commenting. This is a great addition :)&gt; ESTPs are like ISTPs in that they sometimes turn into wailing mockeries of adult people. But ESTPs do not do it because the screams echo in the hollowness of their soul and they can pretend that the abyss is responding to them, no ‚Äì the ESTPs do it because they think it‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs what they live for. They‚Äôll carry a gun into a bank just because it‚Äôs fun to scare the poor innocents, they‚Äôll stand by the roadside and flash motorcyclists so they can watch them crash, nothing is out of limits for an ESTP.

Can confirm. I have fantasized about walking into a bank with a CO2 pistol (for fishing, but it looks real enough). Just to see what would happen :)&gt; The pain feels good though

http://i.imgur.com/EuSd1Zy.gifvOh shit, maybe i'm one of those then :DAll the ENTPs are busy helping the ESTPs break out of jail ;pThis is called yesno. It's when you like something bad.They might be wrong.Imagine you're in a crowd at a festival. They test the pyro technics before the band comes on. The Se user goes "FIYAH!". That's Se expressing itself x)The facts can be wrong! Unless they are well established... in which case i think a Ti user would find it hard to reject.

When i encounter new data it's tentative and becomes more reliable the longer it lasts before being corrected. If you get me. So i could find one mistake in the facts and disregard the source as erroneous.

Also sometimes it's useful to reject something that was previously considered fact.yeah, that's not even remotely accurate. faggot.Oh your account is 2 hours old. Get rekt, lol.Agreed. And thematically it's quite estp to make videos which are essentially commentaries of your own observations.

His arguments have the same rational bite and expressive quality as my own.&gt; Derealization? Depersonification? Take this post with a grain of salt. This feeling is really hard to explain.

It sounds like an inferior grip. This mental state and the terminology you use to describe it does seem to be a common experience for someone experiencing inferior grip.

&gt; We often call the fourth function the inferior function when it emerges without conscious intention and tries to overpower the dominant and auxiliary. This can lead to a person feeling ‚Äúin the grip‚Äù of his or her inferior function. The inferior may also manifest under stress, when resources of the dominant and auxiliary are exhausted. When the inferior function manifests in someone's life, that person may say, ‚ÄúI don't know what got into me.‚Äù It often feels like being out of control (outside the conscious ego). The inferior may manifest in negative, immature ways. 

[Source](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/understanding-mbti-type-dynamics/the-fourth-or-inferior-function.htm)

These quotes from your original post are a good indication of inferior grip;

&gt; I tend to space out absurdly frequently, and at times percieve reality, as if I am staring at the tv static screen for hours. At some these times, I am in complete and utter autopilot.

&gt; when I am out of autopilot, my mind then has to catch up with what my body was doing. I don't feel connected to reality, and my perception of time goes wack. My past feels non-existent to the point my imagination and past are hard to differentiate. I dont feel connected to reality or my own body. Sometimes hours can feel like days, sometimes days can feel like hours. I feel like I am losing sanity.

Take a look at personal development for [ENTP](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTP_per.html) and [ENFP](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENFP_per.html). Hopefully something refills you on sanity :)&gt; yooo wtf? D:&lt; 

I think that's the reaction the estp is going for! But they likely do not feel comfortable murdering people to achieve it.Whoah... the estp one isn't even slightly negative!&gt; completely different for everyone depending on your type.

This is a misconception. It is not true to say that individuals are incompatible based on their mbti. Because it doesn't accout for personal experience or knowledge.

For example; Two people who are completely incompatible would likely find solace together if surrounded by foreigners who do not speak their language.

It's all relative.&gt; xSFP tends to live in the moment and doesn't always commit to plans. They tend to just do what they feel like on the day. As an xNFP I'm sometimes hurt by this because I look forward to those plans. This makes me think of them as selfish because they don't really consider the fact that they're letting me down.

Consider the xSFP perspective;

"xNFP tends to live in the future and doesn't always commit to the moment. They tend to just make plans if they feel like it. An xSFP will sometimes feel hurt if they feel trapped or cornered into a plan. This makes them think of you as selfish for taking away their freedom in the moment."*I suggest we change intuition to* **intuiting** *instead.That would promote consistency across all the functions.*

&gt; obnoxious asymmetry to the terminology

I had not noticed and therefore didn't find it obnoxious. Perhaps this is the difference between Ti and Te use? I'm usually pretty good at spotting little details like that.

&gt; Using the proper terminology is more respectful to S-types

I would strongly recommend that you phrase this differently. Talking about "respectful" behavior is manipulation and in this context it is inherently hypocritical since you are not respecting the comfort of those who have accepted the commonly used terminology as it stands.

You have excused your hypocrisy by rationalizing that "they are wrong" and "i am right". This is not an effective strategy for effective persuasion. Criticism evokes justification but goes no further. To effect change criticism should be avoided.

You're trying to use the position and your perspective to leverage conformity. However; the sour taste here is that you haven't considered all the options... such as changing intuition to intuiting. And you haven't appreciated the reaction to such blunt leverage - most will reject it or dismiss it (if presented without adequate and compelling persuasive writing).

Calling for respect like this and not addressing the accuracy of your own solution is potentially creating problems further down the line. Such strong word choice must be backed by strong rational truth or you fail at the first hurdle.

It is risky to reference or correlate a lack of respect for one another because it is implying that you are rigid in your belief and not open to compromise.&gt; more passive nature of perception

You mean "Perceiv**ing**", right?

Grammatically this is interchangeable. And semantically 'perceiving' is accurate because we are talking about a function.

If we accept "function" as an accurate term to describe the components of cognition... then we should also accept that this usage illustrates that an operation with some data input and a product is performed.

Otherwise the word function is lacking accuracy. This is a rational way to illustrate that intuiting is not a passive process.

To illustrate; Perhaps you accept judgement as an active function. But you have ignored that a concept must first be perceived before it is judged. The process of perception is an operation as well as the process of judgement.

&gt; "Intuiting" feels untrue to the process of Ne and Ni. Intuition is "perception from the unconscious" and is almost inherently an inactive process.

I expressly disagree. Correct and incorrect should be rationalized and not decided on a whim of "feeling" correct. This is much like skipping to the conclusion without checking your facts for accuracy.

How can intuiting be inactive? Or to use better terminology... passive. I explicitly disagree that any of the mental functions *could possibly* be passive. It is different to describe conscious and subconscious function.

Using the terms passive / inactive implies something very different. Breathing is subconscious and can be described as a passive process. But to compare... i also drive a car mostly on subconscious function (because the process of learning to drive). But i would hardly call driving a passive activity.

In order to evoke justification of your assertion (without unnecessary criticism). How *do* you justify this? I do not believe any of the mental functions should be described as passive.

&gt; there is also a sincerity there that I don't currently know how to communicate better.

I would advice you to use emotionless phrasing to convey your rational point. The sincerity is redundant (when addressing empirical fact) because the point conveyed is persuasive through rationality.

Admittedly; this is what works for me and may not be useful advice for others. However i do find that public reaction toward the most compelling arguments is usually due to the rationally (regardless of the typology of the speaker) and emotive arguments evoke dissenting voices.

---

&gt; and while I agree that criticism alone won't take care of the issue it is an important element to creating change

read the first chapter of the highly popular and influential psychology book "how to win friends and influence people".

You're current methodology is a good method for evoking resentment. That is not conducive to change and would actually create a barrier to change in most cases.

&gt; If I wanted to dedicate more energy to this problem I could; I could message prominent Youtubers and forum members to share these thoughts, hope that they are convincing, and hope that they change their vocabulary as well.

While canvassing can be effective it is dependent on the efficacy of the original argument. Which i have called into question as a very effective public speaker.

I can only offer you my analysis in order to enable you to satisfy your goal.

&gt; I didn't break down my thought process step by step in the OP because I don't enjoy rambling

But equally it is necessary to provide this detail in order to quell dissenting voices. Do you appreciate that accuracy of a concept is only half the battle? The rest of the challenge is located in the hearts and minds of those who you address.&gt; Quick setup: "Perception" is a noun while "Perceiving" is a verb.

Grammatical interchange requires that. I'm not sure what your trying to prove. But that is what it means to say that something is [grammatically interchangeable](http://www.englishgrammar.org/interchange-part-speech/).

The terms *are* grammatically interchangeable because that is what it means!

&gt; the rational functions are more "verb-like" and more consciously active in the psyche

I disagree with both points. Perception can be verbalized and i find Ne dom very consciously active in those that have it.

Would you care to describe the discreet reason for not adopting "Intuiting" to promote consistency?Oh my mistake... i saw it as positive because i'm 99th percentile for logic and problem solving.

It doesn't call me a frat boy. It calls me really fucking scary :)

edited fat. hehe, hi trolls!Also RighteousRegent is really not that far removed from GQ.Oh hey! I just saw deftones at the weekend so i've been rocking white pony all week :)

edit; decided to sign off with [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04seFO6BEmw)Found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHYNaQ_BtfQ) but it's a bit short :D

Edit; and [knife party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxOr8rceGp0) (paris?) okay not the right one [change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDRkJdnsdr8)I *might* be ;pI bought a leather jacket.Answering it myself.

If there's no other use for my ears i like to plug in. Indulge. But it can sometimes be boring if i dont have something new to enjoy. I will listen for around 2 hours a day minimum but more if i don't talk to anyone. I get cranky if i don't listen to music for a fw days.

i have favourite albums

Recently i've been on [billy talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHmUjy-uRFo), [deftones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ynvK1oKTrc), but i was listening to [fatboy slim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitI8cG5eHg) when i made the thread.

I'm probably actually an estp.I guess i have to give you a cool nod... and then smoke a cigarette.

... Instead of banging out some pelvic grinding to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUPayr8H_Co)... damn...Mud! The site rained at 5pm for 90 mins on Friday and that was ok. But after doing the same all night and at the same time on Saturday it started to get sloppy!

So much god damn mud! But it was great, a true pilgrimmage. Sunday obviously rained all day. But i didn't fall over in the mud. Despite various attemps. My friend cupped me all weekend (managing to trick you into holding an empty beer cup). And we met up with some others and got trashed.

In the camspite i chatted up the neghbours... or rather their father chatted me up and so i met the family. They were from the Shetlands.

I saw a mud wrestling thing turn ugly and yelled at a guy for fighting dirty.

The stage for Pennywise was closed before their slot. And before nofx. So i didnt get to see them.

I also missed Rammstein.

Saw Milk Teeth tho. And Six AM whom i had never heard of or seen. And that hair. Wow.

Black Sabbath were on after Deftones.

And at one point i had an orange Calippo. Which was *really* nice.From the album palookaville - [put it back together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC2aH8AgqGI)

Do! do do do do do do!London :)I hit it up on rotation and found all these amazing mixes. I don't want to sound like a shill for Apple and i will probably unsub from their music service. But it is convenient to just listen to stuff (stream) instead of paying for albums (download).Oh nice, man i haven't listened to kyuss for aaages, thanks :)Have you heard [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1Kv0aV3964) one?It's unusual. For the uk to have a shooting. And i sort of feel like this whole event let the side down in that regard. Apparantly a home-made weapon?

And it was a vicious attack. Sometimes the media can have such a polarising effect on people. But i admit that i tend to steer my thoughts away from shocking events in the media - or tread carefully.

Just because i don't like it if you can't do something. I might also get anxious listening to idle speculation. Not about this particular one... just talking in general that's why i avoid things sometimes.Thanks for the recommends! I get what you mean about layers.

[Here's](https://soundcloud.com/camokrooked/camo-krooked-20-years-mix) one of my favourite mixes. It's rapid fire mixes so you get a lot of layers to warm up to :)Aw, nice - hey what album would be your 'go to' aphex twin album? If that question makes sense :)You must be a [tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A) fan, right?well i am a nut... but it's really cool that you think i care :)*Boner Alert!* Hnnnng :)I'd love to get a recommendation from you, in that case!&gt; as long as it s not rap

Interesting! Have you tried [Aesop rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sClhmDN5Fcs)

It's a bit more interesting than most :)This is perfect :)Are you familiar with [Savant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p95NzQYOADo)?Haha, fantastic i shall find me some Mountain Goats!Awww these guys are sweet, i've not heard of them before lolHey man, thanks for these recommendations! They're perfect :)I made [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVBiZI7cjxgl2rlR2Hx3XwGNmyHwLuCu) a while ago with some help from my buddy. You might enjoy it but it's a bit more pop oriented than the one you linked :)These all look really interesting, i'll have to check them out over the weekend. Thanks!

I crashed my car listening to in flames (like 10 years ago) x)&gt; I like to see bad people fail

[That smile](http://i.imgur.com/pHvpBxx.gif)Throw some Se in there and you've got Se, Ti and togethr they can emulate Te. I assume this is why i get pretty high scores for Te all the time on function test.

Trade off is inferior Ni... but it works for me. Sometimes i get strong hunches that turn out to be *close enough*.This is actually how my clan worked between me and another leader. He would Te organise and i would Ti validate accuracy.&gt; I told an ESTP once I would still like them if they were unattractive/out of shape which I thought was the "right answer" (it was true) and they actually got pretty upset about it. -shrug- 

I can explain this. You told the estp that you would still like them even if they hated themself.

Which is ... chosing my words carefully here ... depressing for the estp. And it would lead to the estp looking for a more challenging environment.

The girl i dated, the enfp also said she was happy with how i looked and that i didn't *need* to work out. My first reaction was to tell her that i do it for selfish reasons. Because if i'm not supported i just support myself. But yeah like... totally not a romantic gesture to an estp ;pI considered using this in the first place, haha :)&gt; I wonder if we're both in some crux in both our lives.

One of the things i've learned from this stuff is the difference between good use of Se and sort of *worse* use. Something that has confused me for most of my life, actually.

So i've been stable and unstable at various times in my life. And this stuff is basically like an instruction manual right?!

Plus... i've realised that one of the reasons i never really spread my wings when i was much younger was because of the negative impact it would have had on my sibling relationship. I waited until i left home before really feeling that freedom to be myself.

TL;DR i have learned how to keep myself switched on in that comfortable space where failure is not really possible. There are just attempts that didn't work. And this is a really comfortable place to be - it's applies to everything i do! :)

&gt; Am I going through a Ni loop again? I thought I had this under control.

I think this can happen when you push outside your comfort zone. It feels like anxiety for failure. But the thing i described just now kinda counters it.. It's re-affirming Se with optimism from the understanding that.

&gt; using present knowledge of the Ni loop as confirmation bias of past events

with optimism :)

---

But to other aspect of it will be depesonalization and derealisation whenever you are affected by Ni. It's a totally different perspective. It can feel uncomfortable.

I think that feeling does lead to a loss of identity in the moment. As you are using unfamiliar function and consciously observing it. Consider it to be raising the inferior into conscious understanding (but almost retrospectively due to the nature of it for us).

&gt; I'm accounting for everything retroactively, that's indicative of Se in itself, right?

I'm actually amazed how easily this fits with the context of my explanation! I think this is the way we step forwards / backwards out of Ni's grasp.

&gt; And these confines people put upon themselves knowing their types are just bizarre, and make me ever thankful that I ran into this later in life.

Yeah i definitley think people should correct mbti rather than the other way around. It's not a perfect system because it's rationally derived. Maybe at some point with improvements of neuroscanning we will have a better model. But this is okay for basics!

&gt; Oh crap! Am I ENTP because of how I'm thinking about this?

You're firmly rooted in the present context. Se can explore in a very similar way to Ne but i think it will always be mostly interested in the direction provided by Ni and the presence of Se in the moment.

I notice the contrast here all the time because i have enfp sister and entp friends that i talk to very often.

&gt; INTPs blather on about "existential crisis" like no other. What's happening?

A different interaction. Ti-Ne can't help itself but it's a comfortable experience for an INTP to ask these question. An estp may still ask existential questions and even feel comfortable. But Se-Ti explores differently, i believe. This is all kinda subjective but i'm posting my consideration to see how well it works for you!

&gt; Am I going to have to shuck those notions of "no one other than the people who interface with you actually know you" and do a "type me" thread? I know people get their rocks off on judging people, when people are so much more complex than a questionnaire.

I think Ti has a tendency to double check things and strive for absolute accuracy. But it's likely that typing on a online forum is one of the least accurate ways to do this (simply because it's a noisy environment and the consistency of opinion will be variable). Because it will always be subjective to the interpretation of a stranger, who may display bias, may misinterpret... there's loads of chance for introducing additional error.

Which is why i prefer to direct people to a test. Despite the tests being bad they boast 60-90% accuracy *for each question* on retest. And i think that *can* be possibly more accurate than forum typology.

Having said it. The most accurate way would be self assessment. But this is a risky statement to make! And it's my perspective because i am predisposed to analysis. I'm good at removing myself from the problem to a certain degree.

&gt; You're killing me right now, dude.

I'll buy ya a beer to make it up!&gt; Depending on how I was wronged, I may or may not forgive them if they were to apologize. I tend to hold grudges.

I will seek an apology to find out if the other person is a grudge holder. People who hold grudges can't apologise and so it beocmes important to me to remember their transgressions :)

Having said that it takes a while before i reject a person entirely.&gt; School and learning was never fun for me, my favorite things to do was to not have to be forced to do things and do whatever I wanted, like play, or surf social media. Also, as evidenced above, I need a real life example for something to be explained to me. I learn by doing. Also, it looks like whenever someone is questioning whether they are an intuitive or a sensor, the answer is always sensor because that's more common.

&gt; On the other hand, I believe I may be intuitive because I envision all types of possibilities within my life. If I see that my friends are doing something unsafe, I cannot help but envision the worst that could happen.

You appear to use Se-Ni.Yeah OP's asking a lot for one person to describe a concrete example of 4 different modes of dom perceiving.

But still, i'd say OP was rooted in present context with most of the description.Se is a streaming service. It's like having Si in the cloud.This noname person appears to use Si anyway. So i doubt their typing.It could be Si aux, xSTJ seems likely to me :)[This](http://i.imgur.com/twAv0Ul.jpg) is what made me consider it...

But also because of other interactions with this user on other reddit accounts.

Que *heavy implication* :)&gt; you have my IP

*?*It's not so much about *social* extra or intro version. Think about it... Low stack F is going to be less social than higher stack... **But** you might still have Te and Se without being particularly *social* as these functions are not necessarily geared toward people yet are extroverted functions.

Tldr; Te Dom doesn't imply keen sociability.&gt; Based on the abstraction going on in the previous paragraph, probably a social INTJ, right?

A point of comparison is necessary...but my initial reasoning was that social intro / extra - version isn't strictly related to E or I preference in low stack F types.

And i may be incorrect.

One of the reasons why i struggled to determine ESTP or ISTP is that i considered myself socially introverted. But upon deeper reflection i realise that this is more about *not getting enough* regardless of how social i actually am. And that implies extraversion.I think you're talkin to an infj there and the estp thing is a name-caricature trump-thing.There's different types of drama. Situation drama. People drama. Conflict drama. Passive aggressive drama.

I'm an estp... don't make me list of all the ways that you can throw a spanner in the works with drama!

Well, anyway, to counter your suggestion; i know an ISTJ who makes conversation out of fairly boring and regular stuff... they're trying to generate drama out of really boring stuff. In order to generate conversation. Does that count?

When it comes to *actual* drama i think this person tends to react inappropriately. Pressure to make a decision in the moment typically leads to a bad estimation and it seems like an obvious error to me.

Concrete example; condescension. This istj is unable to proactively recognise when they have been condescending - whilst it seems to be a "go-to" strategy for avoiding stressful conflict.&gt; The other day, he said that breaking rules and being an asshole is the only way to get to where he is. Sure, he was joking, but I think he really believes it.

Are you absolutely sure that's not an estp?Thanks this is very useful clarification![Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4og90p/music_how_long_do_you_listen_how_often_what_style/d4cifgv)&gt; Well, condescension is nearly entirely in the eye of the beholder...

Typical intp (this is a joke)

:DHot damn. I'm honestly starting to wonder how i can meet INTPs for dating.Haha :)
Hehe, thanks this is great!I have inferior Ni, *i think*. And largely i am looking at the personal development in retrospect. Because i'm 32.

How has inferior Ni affected me? I am highly adverse to detailed planning. It causes me anxiety. There are so many situations that cannot be accounted for. And planning feels like a waste of time if the potential problems could be solved in the moment. But the anxiety comes from "How can we expect to make a plan that satisfies all possible conditions?". I would be comfortable if i knew that i wouldn't have to take charge. I absolutely hate it when people make suggestions *after* i have decided what i will do. And i cannot stand it if they then do not accept my direction (or question it excessively).

Fe also. Perhaps i'm some nightmarish xSTP ambivert or something. But i've had Fe insecurities plenty of times in my life. Not really anymore... but it seems to me that letting Fe operate unrestricted did lead to some lowering of the anxiety in Ni.

&gt; I am fundamentally a big group person, but all of the groups that I've encountered suck

A really good way to operate is to acknowledge those individuals of the group that do not suck quite so much. And sort of ostracise the ones who suck the most.

You might think that was rude or inappropriate. People do this all the time. Irrationally. At least you were rational about it!

&gt; I'm compensating for something.

This is quite a heavy statement. It can be softer if you widen the scope to "we're all compensating for something". That doesn't mean everyone is broken either - but it is illustrative of the different dynamics which different types operate under.

And nothing is permanently a problem. We can train ourselves to be good at the things we feel unsure of.

&gt; half of the people in the group are just prentending to be excited to be a part of the group and that's not something that I'm going to waste time with

This is not the correct decision from my perspective. You feel unsure of "faking it"... but in reality people are faking it mosst of the time when we talk about social nicities. And it worth observing how effective those moments are.

Faking it is worth it in the long run because you have nothing to lose.

&gt; but there is so much bullshit these days

Logically you might seek purity of actions in the same way you seek purity of logic. But Se doesn't need purity and it would be good for your whole stack to experience new things!

I guess i wanted to say something about Fe and feeling connected (even pushing through a fake feeling) to convey how it is a benefit. *Now, seriously... how does Ni work?*&gt; feels so great to engage in Fe stuff when the feelings are real, and I want to stay loyal to that state of mind

i admit that i seek genuine interaction too like this too. i think it has something to do with honesty and hidden agendas. control.

so i tend to trust that most people are not malicious. the ones who aren't overwhelm the effect of the ones who are. and you generally find more genuine interactions after people have become more comfortable. so i 'over extend' a little. intentionally, and i do this to draw attention such that people feel happy to open up.

taken to the extreme this does mean i have a tendency to attract negative attention for the sake of a challenge and improving the environment.

i don't know how long i've been doing that but it's consistent as fuck. i don't do this for the people i dislike. i do it to improve the situation for genuine interactions. which please me.

so this is the nuance i mentioned about meanigful engagements. but generally i'll attempt to entertain social nicities if i can remember them appropriately. so i'm certainly no master of Fe.

Determined tho!

My dominant functions still keep me objective and cold compared with many types. When i was much younger i might have felt insecure (hard to remember). Now i tend to only care about and build the relationships that are easy or rewarding enough. I have cut some ties that were rewarding because the effort was too much. If that makes sense.

TLDR; i'll over extend for the sake of new interests and that genuine atmosphere.

---

This Ni advice is well appreciated. I've begun using a social calendar for the first time in my life. And this has substantially reduced anxiety related to "missing out" or fucking up such that it kills a day for myself or my friends. The anxiety has been replaced with a build up of excitement. So this is probably something i'll continue to do.

I feel like i could've benefitted from doing this from a younger age. And i may have attempted to keep a paper diary before... but that would never have worked. Shit... i only just started using facebook because i disliked the idea of documenting my life.

They made a nice neat google calndar app for the phone ... so this is just perfect. Organisation is tough and i already used my phone for taking important notes. And i organise many things by my work email (very poorly - i miss like 1/4 of the things i plan).

So i agree that simplification would make things simpler! I'm very happy to jump into things as they arise but i frequently miss things that are coming up just because i am lost in the moment rather than paying attention to the plan.

Perhaps with work i simply need to care more. I am frequently late but i have had *better* work ethic in the past. I think i've usually been more interested in establshing the boundaries of "what can i get away with" rahter than worrying about keeping a job. So i might consistently turn up 15 mins late. Just to see how long until it is corrected.

This seems like *bad* forward planning, right?Thought you might enjoy [this](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/120638628790/whats-a-good-example-of-an-estpintj) crappy fiction article.

I know it implies the intj is a murderer but no offence intended.Dammit. That sounds like a solid strategy for the 70's but now we have kickstarter. *So what you're saying is try and date a chick working at kick-starter*... gotcha. Thanks!I can relate to the preference for planning things in your head. I just miss so much if i do that. And things come up at me out of no-where!&gt; i seem to equate political correctness with Fe

You've not heard any dead baby jokes recently then?&gt; Honorable mention to ISTPs as they seem to serve up the highest amusment to word count ratio.

[Agreed](http://i.imgur.com/KZr65r0.png) :)

I especially enjoyed "Dog meat chest having pube hair Barney Stinson wannabe flaccid bitch"

So much funny! So few words!http://i.imgur.com/1nJSDmP.gifYou can take offence *under* my behalf any time you're in London x)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAqq11HYMskIt is, phonetically, *very* satisfying :)It's a difficult nuance to describe. I would say Te is formulaic in orientation (more about process, flow chart, using facts to obtain a goal) and Ti is logical validation (more about error checking, comparison of fact in order to ascertain accuracy, strategic detail).

Using these descriptors enables a comparison where Te can be described as less analytical (unless we're talking about analysing a flow chart process for efficiency) and Ti seems less practical (unless we're validating a fow chart process for accuracy).

I believe that Te can do the job of Ti (with effort) and Ti can do the job of Te (with effort). But this may be my perspective as a result of Se dom. From an estp (with well developed Ti) perspective they are different forms of problem solving and are both highly relevant.

I do tend to find some products of Te frustrating. Order and rules are not necessarily considered relevant by Ti.

Or it's entirely possible that i just admire Te and have taught myself to emulate it.Thanks for this. The wording is much clearer and i think it is consistent with what i was trying to convey, so i agree ofc. It seems like Ti-Ne is affected slightly differently to Se-Ti

Actually makes more sense now, good use of diagram :)You didn't put Indian food as an option ... which is (i'm assuming) the only reason why anyone would vote british food (chcken tikka masla, coronation chicken). Unless you meant Sunday roast... in which case don't put 'british food' put 'Sunday Roast'. Yum.

No greek food either. My nickname is kebab.

kbnation means kebab nation.Oh right. Man, curry has to have a separate category to kung po :D

But i agree it's probably not worth chanign anything at this point. Asian food *will* win overall. No doubt. It has all the good stuff.This might be more about dirty city air than mbti. I never needed to do this in Wales.

Mybe it's too niche to collect meaningful data. Or maybe someone else recognises that they do it.The harmony and social appropriteness does make sense... but then, i know that i provoke people. To observe their expression, and manipulate their mood, and i can control a social atmosphere if i have the attention or people are willing to allow / ignore my clowning around.

I can get attention to serve a purpose. I know what makes people curious. I'm good at telling stories. Delivering a story involves some level of harmony but really this is another way of describing a sense of the mood of your audience. And developing the story at the correct pace or with appropriate aesthetic quality is useful. I have often seen people lose themself in thought when i play guitar.

I've seen some poetry read out entirely expressionless. As if the words were all that was needed to convey total expressive meaning. And i have seen some fantastic performances where the words spoken were like an accessory to physical expression in the delivery.

I notice the difference. But i think anyone would ifnd the expressionless presentation less engaging.&gt; Mm provoking people can be a Ti thing out of curiosity and wanting to know how people work. 

Oh yeah, this makes perfect sense!It doesn't take an entire article of explanation to put forward the concept of confirmation bias (where people ignore the things that aren't relevant to them and pay attention to the things that are relevant to them). The author presents agreeable clauses and then leads into a conclusion that doesn't acknowledge a degree of self awareness.

But, also, i do not constantly diagnose myself. I reach a level of certainty fairly soon whenever there is a question compelling research. And this may be via the same confirmation bias method... except i'm filtering for associations and correlation.

I'm pretty good at analysis and it does require a certain 'disconnected' perspective where you remove yourself from the equation. So for a medical diagnosis i might consider the symptoms as if they were belonging to a 3rd party.

That makes it a little easier to remain objective.&gt; I see a lot of conflicting information on whether or not MBTI is accurate or not.

I would recommend that you break down these points into specific questions and validate the material personally.

Even if we tell you it's legit, this is no proof. It says more about us than it does about mbti.

The only way you can answer this question is for yourself.

I could provide you with a whole bunch of rhetoric if you like... [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4fipgz/17_facts_that_prove_mbti_is_rubbish_debunked/) is a thread where i debunk an article that conveys the most common criticisms of mbti.Like [this](http://i.imgur.com/DFQq9Gf.jpg)I like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/DFQq9Gf.jpg) because it places things that have similar behaviors next to each other in my opinion.

entp - estp - istp - estj - istj seems like a logical progression to me and it goes around the circle like this.Great comment, thanks for this perspective.Does that mean we should expect to see people use Ti and Fi or are you merely stating that Ti-Fe with a T preference represses Fe (but still uses it).

The axis is not a theory but it is the implication of dichotomies - perhaps you find the dichotomies a problem (and that would translate to axis)? Would you care to explain how the axis are *not* implied or how the implication is incorrect (regarding the dichotomies)?Socionics makes the relationships of qaudras, right?

I guess it depends if you stayed locked ridgidly to the inflexible paradigm. I mean... the mbti is a test. It doesn't have theory, does it?

You're talking baout [Jungian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH0mPfR-K2U) theory. Perhaps you are unaware of the way this theory has been interpretted or built upon. Perhaps you disagree with them.

But to outright insist that there is no supporting theory for axis isn't the case. Does it matter who's theory it is?

How can you say which theory is legit when talking about cognitive science?&gt; when the Tertiary and the Inferior functions rather shows the functions you ‚Äúlack‚Äù

Not at all. You're working on the assumption that repressing a function is the same as it not being present. I'm unsure where you've picked that up but it not implied by the theory. Repression, yes. Absence, no.

In concept you are implying that the more challenging areas of psyche to develop are not even present. How would you explain maturation of the psyche under these circumstances?

I think you should back-track slightly and observe what it is that a function represents. It is a *preference*. I do not find it mutually exclusive to have the function and repress it. The implication of my opinion is that you may repress something ... but it is *still* more preferential than the alternative preference.

&gt; A more intuitive approach would include investigating what the function stack means from a fundamental level

I believe the nuance you're struggling with is commonly referred to as maturity. That is not to imply that you are immature... but rather the implication of the functional stack arrangement and 'weaker' functions enables us to describe the ~~adoption~~ development of additional preferences as we mature.

The theory describes those preferences as relational. This is the implication of a descriptor; axis. I consider that your mental model of the functional stack is too rigid. It is important to consider that there will be a variation in the process of maturation.

Also... how would you explain the common observation referred to as "inferior grip" if the inferior function is absent rather than repressed.

We become significantly more capable as we mature. This is described as depth of character. And it *is* typically observed as complexity resulting from the use of a wider array of cognitive function. It makes sense that a psyche would grow in complexity in the face of adversity.

The inferior grip is a adequate explanation for the struggle.

It is very noticeable that personalities develop. If we acknowledge the different phases of physical development then it becomes sensible to assume our mental development has phases as well - especially when we observe the process of maturation.

To provide a direct example; I have not always been as pleasant to talk to. Over time i have developed softer interactions because i understood how people felt toward my intensity.

This sentiment was entirely lacking at the age of 10!

I would suggest to you that you work with a dynamic model that describes the development of the psyche over time. Maturation is a well observed trait of human psyche.

Limiting yourself to a rigid theory means you do not have a way to describe these things. It's pertinent to build upon theory and find out what works. If many people identify with cognitive axis it may be appropriate to entertain that belief and ascertain how it is useful rather than quote doctrine as if it was empirically proven.No.

&gt; Most of my comments hear are basically being against those taking the theory rigidly without enough critical thinking behind.

And i disagree there too. It's apparant to me that your comments have been the opposite of flexible.

You even describe a common misunderstanding as having a root in misinterpretation of a thoery. Which is a silly way of assuming someone's position. You assume a consistent mistake in others interpretation... it's more likely that your shoe has muck on it if you smell something everywhere you go.

I would suggest that you clarify the explicit reason for asserting that axis aren't a thing.&gt; See who's taking the typology in a rigid way? Denying that there is a spectrum between types, would mean black/white typing.

I just didn't agree with your assertion. That doesn't convey to lack of flexibility.

This is a waste of my time so you are now blocked. It's got nothing to do with you being right. It's got everything to do with you having inflexible ideas and being annoying.I recently removed and blocked someone on facebook because they said i could never understand racism ... because i'm white. It's taken me about 10 years to finally get irritated enough by that persons intolerant views before i decided they're not worth my time.I like the cut of your jib.ESTP

Support Brexit.

The decision was based on democratic rights. I feel the EU Parliament has shown itself to be anti-democratic. Through the debate i developed an understanding of the importance of devolved governance.

I have developed a conspiracy theory attitude toward pro EU arguments.&gt; so I listened to a professor on European Law talk on the topic and tried many other sources online

This is not giving details of the cognitive process you used to decide your position.

&gt; Even if the economic downsides of leaving hadn't swayed me to vote remain, the numerous lies of the leave campaign would have compelled me to vote against them anyway. (I live in the UK)

This is precisely the justification that i specified should be avoided. It is only a position of justification not explanation.

I am not commenting on your judgement but i would suggest that you did not understand the issue. Do you believe that you are affected by propaganda?

I only comment because you seem to have decided on your values but you have made an unusual statement about the leave campaign regarding lies. But you do not found this. A statement regarding a specific lie would convey much.

Edit; I do not believe that the actual campaigns lied. I believe that the media manipulates perception and it is apparant that many do not have a real understanding of the core issue. So i do not comment to offend... i am seeking clarification of the way your judgement was made. Not justification for it.

Edits; In other words. **How did you reach the conclusion that one side was lying?**Not criticising but the reasoning you gave is on things that are in the press post vote. I was more trying to find the reasons for making a judgement in which side of the debate to support (if any).

So it's specifically about how you reached the decision rather than justifying the decision you made. This is why i describe it as a question involving self analysis. I'm asking people to say which issue connected with them the most but to avoid justifying their decision.Te use doesn't prescibe that a reason cannot be provided for a judgement. I admit that the task is likely more challenging for those who are not predisposed to internal analysis. But i believe people are able to explain a decision with a reason and without justification.

Maybe the difference is whether the person is influneced by their own decision making process or has decided based on other influence. But both should be deterministic and they are judgements.

I would expect the judgement based on fact or moral value would be memorable. But i admit that some people may not remember what they decided in the moment and may not be predisposed to analyse their decisions.

The implication you are making is that Te users are heavily influenced by external facts but this does not account for decision making unless you are suggesting that these people cannot form their own opinion. I would be interested in a reflection of how this operates with Fi. And where the judgement is made. Personal values or factual basis. Either way validation of the opinion must occurr and i consider this to be a legitimate request regardless of typology.

It would be appropriate to explain why one side seemed more trustworthy. Rather than to reinforce the judgement with justification.Thank you for your perspective.I sort of wanted to ask why you alligned your views with remain when Cameron was campaigning to remain, considering the distaste for conservative politics.

But this is unrelated to the thread. Just personal interest, really.

I would note that the Labor party supported remain but Jeremy Corbyn did not particularly as it does not allign with his values.

So i am curious how people made their value based decisions considering this confusing political landscape. I admit that i may not really be asking anythig new here. You already said that you disliked the conservatives... I'm assuming you saw the leave camp as a heavily conservative view?I was hoping that people would focus on the priginal judgement and reasoning behind rather than more recent developments.Yes but these are the facts i am asking for. Rather than the opinon formed from the fact.

In order to provide justification for a decision or judgement there must have been (at least) a fleeting moment of consideration and then a direction was chosen.

I am asking about the influence for direction - not the direction. If you get me.

Describing one side as liars is a judgement and decision. Asking *why* they are considered liars is more revealing. It is entirely acceptable for these people to say i trust xxx news source and their opinion became my opinion. But it seems that Fi would prevent that admission.Noted. Thanks for contributing!You don't believe that the trade barrier between the US and the UK, imposed by the EU, dissappeariing would be beneficial for the US?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0pwXLtvt2whttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevolutionSince you were deeply skeptical of arguments made for leave... i wondered what you thought of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe#Post-rejection)

Here is the relevant text;

&gt; After the French and Dutch referendum results European leaders decided to hold a "period of reflection" on what to do next. As part of this reflection period a "group of wise men" was set up to consider possible courses of action. This group of high-level European politicians ‚Äì former prime ministers, ministers and members of the European Commission ‚Äì first met on 30 September 2006 in Rome.

&gt; On 4 June 2007, this group presented its report. They proposed to establish a new Inter-Governmental Conference with a view to writing a new treaty which would rewrite the Maastricht Treaty, amend the Treaty of Rome and give the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union a legally binding status. The new treaty would be based on the first and fourth parts of the Constitution, the rest of the Constitution's changes being achieved through amendments to the Treaty of Rome.

This is basically my one and only reason for voting to leave.

The EU made their constitution legally valid despite it being rejected (by referendum) in two countries. It took them about 9 months to achieve this. Edit; The UK was not given a chance to vote on the EU Constitution.I gotta say it... i feel a lot safer outside the [EU](http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/682541/REVEALED-EU-to-rubber-stamp-its-HUGE-1trillion-budget-NEXT-week-after-referendum-delay).

But i have no other source to coroborate that one. And i do not rate it reliable yet. And i would note that another headline on this page says "Elvis not dead".You understand that they stopped the process when it was rejected and found a way to do it that avoided public vote, right?I was trying to explore your reasoning that Brexit would be bad for the US. Instability will have to do! Thanks for contributing.Then how is the bolded part you quoted relevant at all? Because it doesn't detract from the point i made... which is that they ignored democracy.

Normally that's a bad sign, right? When the people who set the laws cannot be removed from power and they ignore what the people want.Media has a massive affect on peoples state of mind and can raise or lower tensions.

For eample [The Sun](https://www.facebook.com/LBC/videos/10154082514826558/) - which has Britains widest circulation. And they massively polarise their readers. Because their readers are fairly stupid people (sorry but its kinda true).&gt; the UK leaving the EU puts me and other immigrants at risk

When you say that it puts you at risk. Would you kindly expand? I'm not seeking to evoke argument. I just wanted to know a little more about your opinion.

Also... anecdotally; I have not heard of a UK student doing the Erasmus. I only knew what it is from European connections.I don't want to go into details but i feel for you. I know what it's like to live in foreign lands and that sometimes it can be negative.

I am sympathetic. I hope that you have not and will not expperience any discomfort. I actually had two youths have a go at intimidating me yesterday but i am really quite hard to provoke!

I wanted to provide some reasoning for why i think the Uk voted to leave. These are my personal reasons.

I am really concerned about [this](http://i.imgur.com/blk0VDB.png) man. He doesn't seem to be someone that can be removed from power.

And he is pushing for a united EU [army](http://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/uk-central-europe-frown-at-juncker-s-european-army/) - specifically to "deal with the Russians"... which seems like a strange agenda when we have NATO. I believe an EU army will answer Europes unemployment problems. And this will have huge implications for the middle east and places like Syria. Possibly creating serious international tension? Speculation. But the warning signs are clear to me.

And basically... [Farage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeO_pEP-cm0) has been talking about reform in the EU for long enough to get grey hair. Leaving seems like a last resort to me. I have a lot of good ties to europe. I can survive in 4 languages (meaning i require a reference book).

I want to offer you some peace of mind. The UK is very accepting of culture. Look at British culture! We have adopted most of it from somewhere else. Law enforcement is extremely vigilant with hate crime. The sentiment of the british people is to be civilized. And we welcome civility. I believe that the media is self interested in promoting stories that generate fear like this. But i have grown a conspiracy attitude that the EU leaders know this will egress the political debate from public opinion.

There is much liberal media influenced by EU finding.

They used a EU law specialist who is directly paid his salary by the EU to play down the constitutional and democratic argument of the debate. He did not acknowledge in his explanation that his salary is from them!

The EU Parliament smells corrupt. Which means i've drawn a line past all material benefit of the deal. It goes to my values and liberty.

Which is emotive. But it doesn't make me intolernat of Europeans. Just intolerant of faceless [Eurocrats](http://www.thecommentator.com/system/articles/inner_pictures/000/005/947/original/jean-claude-juncker.jpeg?1435581175).

I do not feel any less connected to the people of Europe. I feel that i have enabled a debate for change.But how does Fi vs Fe enter the discussion when moral judgements made as a result of propaganda usually cannot be justified.

It is the justification process that gives validity and this is not Ti vs Te or Fi vs Fe... it is not T vs F. It is the echo chamber effect that produces extreme opinion.

The vast majority settle their beliefs in the middle. THe moderate majority... so how can things even be elevated to nation press levels if the moderate majority are not racist?

Sensationalism.

And it affects everybody. But the argument... 

&gt; Wait are you trying to say that it's the [EU+media]'s fault that people are racist?

Is a loaded question and misinterpretation of the systemic issue i was pointing to. I hope that this clarifies.

People have not become more racist. People have become more sensitive to racial issues due to the media attention. I think this affect judgment through Fe or Te. But it affects everyone.&gt; People living in the free world have access to everything they need to be properly informed

That not a fair argument. Because you are attempting to invalidate the mass effect of the press which is well established.

&gt; and it's their own damn fault if they fall into media traps.

I find this a conceited and self defeating argument. You're saying that democracy is flawed! This is a collectivist direction. Collectivism is also known as authoritarianism.The inevitability of death does not imply that we should die today.

Edit; And i should point out that you have implied that it is a facet of human nature. You have also implied that value judgements cannot be explained - and are therefore unaccountable. So you're promoting the concept that (instead of admitting that peoplea re affected by proaganda) that people who make value judgements like this are essentially not able to make decision with a sound state of mind.

I'm following the natural course of your argument here.

You have said in previous comments that validating a judgement is a Ti thing. Does that make Ti users objectively less human? Since you described it as a part of huma nature to operate this way... Are you telling me that only a certain portion of the population are able to validate their beliefs rationally? And that Fi users cannot. They simply cannot do it?!

Come on man. I'm not buying it.

It makes much more sense to assume that people spouting **justification** rather than **explanation** were uninformed of the issues and their judgement was made based on a bias. They were simply brainwashed by the debate and various political spin... exploring this particular aspect of it was my genuine motivation for the thread.

And i apprecaite your effort to defend the poor people who are unable to rationalize their judgements. But now you are detracting from my purpose here with irrelevant discussion.

So when you ask me loaded question to ascertain a lack of responsibility for decision making and saying "it's just like that". I protest this. I expressly disagree because value judgements are important. Communicating them may be more difficult for some... but that doesn't mean people cannot do it. In fact every type is said to become vocal about something they strongly believe in.

Also... i illustrated how Fe-Ti can be iunfluenced by the same material as Fi-Te to invalidate your claim and you have simply ignored this aspect of my comment rather than engage it.&gt; Ti is affected by this in a similar way: why something makes logical sense to a Ti-user isn't exactly apparent

I disagree and have the ability to explicity nominate the reasoning for my disagreement. I typically suspend judgement until i have evaluated the subject fairly. This is very typical of a Ti user.

I believe that Fi would operate the same way, with morals. I expected to find that particular value would be elected. Indeed many people on both sidess of the argument were able to prmote their reason for a judgement.

&gt; It's because the introverted functions are gradual, developing over the course of the individual's life, while the extraverted ones are deliberate.

Is this meant to be an arguement for keeping the voting age higher? ;)

&gt; I was merely noticing that your line of questioning was somewhat loaded.

Obviously. I have specifically engaged people that were unable to explain their decision without post-vote justification or whose explanation for their bias was entirely unclear.

I have happily accepted many comments from all sides who explained their decision well regardless of the basis for the decision.

I consider your digressive attitude (and suggestive reasoning) to detract from my investigation. But the time is over for much more to be revealed here.

I mentioned that this was not a place for justification but explanation. I sought to clarify what (i think we can both agree) seems to be unreasoned bias.

I do not consider any specific function user to be unable to explain their judgements and requested confirmation of the reasoning behind bais while carefully avoiding criticisng the judgement.

My approach is deliberate. I am very observant of the environment. I understood your reason for voicing disagreement immediately. But it is rather digressive and cyclical unless we try to use a line of argument that supports a subconscious decision.

I do not agree that any type makes completely subconscious decision and that the structure of cognition implied by the functional axis and the possible arragements of functions would prevent someone from ever being entirely unconscious of their reason for making a decision.

Coming from an impulsive Se user.You're very kind and there's no need to feel unwelcome in your contribution here! I am glad that we resolved our conflict of interest without me impulsively posting something [offensive](http://i.imgur.com/tmbaOaO.jpg)!

Much of my humor revolves around shock value.

The whole debate over Brexit from start to finish has been fascinating to me as a direct (concrete) example of how society approaches a complex issue. This debate has evoked a great deal of judgements and perceptions.

I find it very satisfying to adopt another persons perspective and work things out from there. This was my motivation for posting the thread.

This is my hands on approach to understanding others and your contribution is more than welcome! This is the first time i've been able to relate a highly visible issue to Jungian theory (as i have discovered mbti less than 1 year ago).Because Ti thinks everything is stupid.I've been obsessed with the propaganda effect of [brexit](http://i.imgur.com/ErXzO2I.png). Can't do fun mbti things lol!This is true! I just couldn't resist the challenge of engaging with highly polarized perspectives and attempting to persuade them to consider the alternative (majority) opinion.

It's really been a very fun exercise for me! Mostly because i cannot feel guilty about this attempt to manipulate opinion (which i usually would term as social bullying).

[This](https://www.partyforfreedom.org.au/2015/05/03/the-true-meaning-of-fascism-and-why-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/) one was quite provocative and evoked a buddy from university to provide an article with similar ideological expressions (minus the provocation).

http://www.sevenoaksphilosophy.org/on-liberty/tyranny-of-majority.html

I've also realized that social media infrastructure (facebook) is naturally baised and supportive of socialist philosophies. This is the natural affect of 'having a thumbs up button'.

Popular opinion becomes group think and we see the rise of social justice warriors - and the converse nationalistic political parties gain favor.

In any case. I've been a bit obsessed with the opportunity to poke boundaries, evoke a reaction, and understand those who function differently to me.

The head vs heart debate has really illustrated to me how people make a decision on political belief. And i *did* drop a brexit thread on /r/mbti for good measure!

But largely this one has been an exercise in field work due to the over abundance of polarized perspective.

I had a Te user ask me to define propaganda after teling me that he didn't believe there was any at all coming from the remain campaign. My retort to this was that he had admitted there *was* a campaign in the same statement as asserting there was no propaganda.

I.e. he didn't understand the definition of the word. But that didn't stop this person from having an opinion on how much his side had engaged in the use of such techniques.

It's been really fascinating to observe how particular types (which i have begun to type IRL) are predisposed to confirmation bias - if their values are questioned.

And this has (to a certain degree) contributed to a new theory. I have the theory that political spectrum is the result of personality type. Cnsidering the 4 quadra and their romance styles shows the way these types would prefer intimate interactions... this directly equates to political ideology (unless the person has been polarised by their experiences).

So i was particularly interested in the younger demographic of voters. And the backlash directed toward older citizens. Comments such as "thy don't have to live with the decision as long" which essentially evoke a perspective that minimizes the value of another persons vote.

Tending toward authoritarianism and socialism.

Anyway... the opportunity for observations is drying up. So i'll be back to my regular /r/mbti fooling around fairly soon. A little wiser and a little more prepared for challenges in the art of persuasion.

It's comparatively rare that i get to challenge people core beliefs without backlash!Trolling is not informative.

Arguing typically doesn't evolve understanding.

I would say that i found it difficult to resist the opportunity for debate with those who are *polarized* by the status quo opinion on social media. Which will be a socialist status quo due to the nature of fashion and popular opinion.

This was a fantastic opportunity to examine and poke at the boundaries of personal value. Because these values were exposed.

To sum it up as trolling would incorrectly capture my motivation for discovery here.

To call it arguing for the cause would be inappropriate because the vote is over.

And to imply that i have not reached my own opinion but parroted that of others is a patent misinterpretation of how ESTP forms opinion. I mean... your comment implies that i *don't* use Ti to validate accuracy.

Regardless. When dealing with philosophical belief it would be very silly to claim that i had generated any new perspective. We all align ourselves by the beliefs of others - however some seek personal validation of those beliefs and others do not.

Confirmation bias comes into it here. Since those who are *not* predisposed to seek validation will typically be confronted with arguments intended to identify their fallacious logic or reasoning. Potentially the implication of specific fact.

Then we get on to the power of association. Fashion. Status quo and how these things are manipulated.

---

At the end of the day it's fairly reasonable to expect criticism when engaging people directly on their belief structure. But equally t is interesting to me to witness the ideological mess people get themselves into when there is dissonance between their ideologies.

Yes. I take great pleasure in exploring other people perspective.

Edit; Or you could resolve it as trolling people who have been affected by propaganda in order to defeat their delusion. Either way it's the challenge that i am interested with. But it's a great opportunity to exercise persuasion without causing unintended harm.You're cute when you're in shock ;pI think it's got everything to do with communication. So I'm sort of playing with the quadra to figure out what the hunch is at the moment.

Problem I have is typing ppl I've interacted with. So I'm also considering limiting the correlation to the observable axis in terms of the personality type.

I have 3 pools which I'm drawing from for observations. But if I don't find something compelling it will all be discarded lol!

So far the strongest correlation I've made is between Fi-Te and socialist ideology. But this is not consistent across the 3 groups I have observed.

More thought required!!&gt; I'm not very goal oriented, I don't care about grades, awards, etc. but the way to motivate me is make me compete

In other words you are competitive but not out of insecurity. This is my impression of Ti-Fe self validation.

To be fair we need to know more about your perceptions and the reason for your judgements rather than explicitly looking at judgements. It's easy to pull Ti-Fe out of your text i guess.

&gt; Bad at handling motions

Suggests Se with Fe. But this is still not really talking about the perception axis ya know!

&gt; I like to figure out how things work, whether it be an object or an idea, picking things apart is fun for me.

I have this. It is curiosity to understand the reality of things. I believe that taking stuff apart to figure out how it works is very much a curiosity thing and deconstruction, Se-Ni based. But putting components together or creating new stuff out of other stuff is more creative and constructive, Ne-Si based.

You can see the two themes here;

Se-Ni (mixed with a Ti preference) seems to me to have ideas that narrow options into a definitive solution. Problem solving.

Ne-Si (mixed with Ti preference) seems to me to have ideas that widen potentiality into a creative solutions. Solution generation.

Another way to compare would be that Se-Ni is innovation while Ne-Si is invention.

But whatever... I'm just a dumb jock.I do not agree with the terminology for "point of least resistance" because i do not acknowledge weakness in my psyche. Therefore i question the premise. I am happy to accept that my psyche is weaker at controlling certain functions... but i do not acknowledge that as a point of weakness.

Unless there is a specific exploitation that we're meant to acknowledge. However i do not consider the presence of a weakness to imply exploitation of that weakness. Therefore the terminology seems self validating rather than propositional.

&gt; highly insensitive and harsh, and inconsiderate for personal feelings. 

In other words i can switch this on if i want to. But it is not a weakness of my psyche to recognise the emotional state of others... because Fe yo! Manipulating another persons perspective requires a good understanding of their current

If you get me.

Try and make me cry ;p

&gt; In ESTP's and ESFP's, Inferior Ni manifests as a negative vision of the future, paranoia, and general uncertainty.

Agreed.

&gt; In ENTP's and ESTP's, PolR Fi manifests in the person being highly insensitive and harsh, and inconsiderate for personal feelings.

Not agreed. However i did say to a friend yesterday "boo hoo" when he said Brexit was going to affect him negatively.

&gt; In ENTP's and ESTP's, Tertiary Fe manifests as a love providing, smiley, morally obligated mode. They hate this, though. 

I don't hate it. Okay i wouldn't call myself love providing. But i will entertain people if it entertains me. The tertiary is a selfish motivation for me rather than an obligation (however i do feel obligated if invited to socialize and that is annoying).Thanks, this is certainly a sentiment that i had when younger. I considered every person born with the same cognitive equipment and therefore expected the same cognitive capabilities across the board.

Based on the "nobody is a special snowflake" concept i also dislike bullying. Since the bully doesn't have the right to do that and isn't special.

Thanks for the clarification.

I agree with the premise but find the terminology misleading since... least resistance doesn't adequately illustrate that we are potentially blind to how we use this function.&gt; They're very aggressive and pushy.

Fuck off! I'm super nice!

Also if you're going to put "Seeing through hidden meaning" for Ne then i suggest you use "firmly grounded in the present context / reality" for Se users.

It's sort of describing the Ni Si difference in my opinion.

And Ne-Si inventiveness for new concept should be contrasted with Se-Ni innovation of an existing concept.&gt; Se-Ni is like a movie projector, it looks at an object and has a million thoughts about it

Incorrect and i consider this to be the wrong way around.

Se-Ni is reductive, narrowing scope to a finite

Ne-Si is expansive, expanding context to make connectionYes exactly Ni focuses to a definite and Ne looks outward in an expansive way.

&gt; Extroverted sensing. It takes an already simple object from outside

I specifically disagree with this and illustrate it with Ne vs NiSo here's the way i consider the variation;

Se X X Ni - Much more taken with the present context and judging detail.

Ni X X Se - Much more taken with the definite and judges expectation.

X Se Ni X - Flexible understanding of situation and goal

X Ni Se X - Rigid understanding of situation and goal

This is not particularly well thought our but it's just what came to mind when writing it down. I could probably improve on this but i do tend to evaluate trends in terms of the orientation of the specific axis.

Kinda unable to make the model in my head more efficient yet.Yeah! i've been trying to design a cheat sheet because i cannot Ti analyze someone accurately during conversation!

When it comes to the Ne variation of it... i'm sort of struggling to define it without a derogatory implication (since i find wandering speculation without assigning weight, irritating)!

I'll have a stab at it;

Ne X X Si - Interested in possible connection with flexible judgement

Si X X Ne - Interested in subjective meaning with flexible judgement

X Ne Si X - Flexible in interests and comforts, inflexible judgement

X Si Ne X - Rigid in interests and comforts, inflexible judgement

This is "on the fly". I can't really back it up properly yet. I was aiming to use this method to type people IRL quickly. And i figure that it's mostly important to identify the axis and commonalities.

So it's useful to cross reference with the socionics quadra (which i haven't done at all here).Drag em back down to earth!

I find myself doing this constantly with Ne dom... but not so much with Ne aux. So this is really one of the observations that made me consider this format for a cheat sheet!

I was also trying to work out why estp gets on so well with entp but struggles when it comes to enfp and infp (can cause issues but not guaranteed).

So for the the comparison of axis is key to it. And i have a very consistent reaction from xNFP when i poke or test boundaries there.

xNTP is just too cool and doesn't always give me what i want. I can't provoke it as well due to the judgement axis.

Edit; I've been pissing lots of people off recently.I follow ya... for me the term implies a vulnerability (which i think is appropriate) however i don't consider myself to be vulnerable to Fi because i am blind there. Plus i tend to search for and observe weakness in myself and being blind to it would make me consider it not to *be* a weakness.

This probably sounds pointless. It's something about the accuracy that makes me want to clarify it better.

So for me i have a dissonant way of interpreting this label. It sort *feels* more accurate to call it a "point of least acknowledgement" but i admit it's a bit pedantic and not really worth complaining about!Okay. Yeah. Zing. All of this.

It's going to take me a few minutes to forget that i ahve a weakness. Moment...

Aaaaaaaand *fuck other people*. Okay we're back on top!Ok, coming back to this to explain my thoughts.

&gt; Extroverted sensing. It takes an already simple object from outside, Introverted Intuition takes it inside and abstracts about it. 

Might be easier to say that Se recognises change. Notices the detail and Ni understands what might happen or gives the implication of it.

When it's Se-NiESTP

I have many genres that i rotate. Dubstep, Rock, Punk, Pop genre mahses, Hip Hop, Electronic Dance Music, Rap, Metal, and sometimes i like atmospheric stuff too. I'll dig some good classical covers or something innovative with any mash up of styles. Metallica's S&amp;M comes to mind.

I recently found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws82rXrjBOI) video, It explains The Gorillaz wide appeal and why it's difficult to assign them a single genre. Or possibly widens the scope of 'pop'.

I'll give you todays favourites so far;

[Placebo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOBeubfr-xY)

[Akala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcLtFJsV-1o)

[Modestep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9NK7ue27xo)

[A Perfect Circle remixed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giaZnIr-faM)

[Daft Punk vs C2C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njb5UrkvTRM)&gt; They like to break down every tiny detail of your argument, no matter how small, in an attempt to beat you.

Pfffft. *Attempt*. Get on my level.Depends on the context ;pYeah. See ... if you isolate the essential characteristics ... you can make some wild use of that detail for correlation. But this is not always causation.

Take, for example, [this article](http://daily.jstor.org/do-you-know-fascism-when-you-see-it/). Which describes commonalities of the ideology of fascism and the way it operates effectively in society.

Is that isolating detail or good use of context? Does it matter when *holy shit the EU is kinda fascist*.Wait you want to differentiate estp from esfp *without* using vague Fe vs Fi and Te vs Ti comparisons?!!

I'm just going to straight away state that behavior is a poor indication of type *because* it's too vague without asking the subject for reasons.

---

If you want a behavioral analysis (which i think is poor practice) then here's a comparison of the stereotypes.

Both are risk takers, entertainers, here &amp; now focus. Using the same perception functions and similar style of judgement but with divergent ways of assigning value.

Both types enjoy socializing.

**ESTP**; Solid, capable / Competitive / Intensity / ~~Reserve judgement~~ / Logical / Poker face emotions / Uses language of action / Unaware of insensitivity / Straight forward /  Warning; contains nuts.

Quote; "I want to have fun doing this, let's go together?!"

**ESFP**; Warm, welcoming / Co-operative / Practicality / ~~Quick temper~~ / Emotional / Heart on sleeve / Uses language of empathy / Aware of insensitivity / Straight funny / Warning; contains bubbles.

Quote; "Lets go have fun together, how about doing this?!"

---

I should note that i have not confirmed the typing of the girl i believe to be ESFP (ain't gonna happen). I crossed out something in edit but left it in in case anyone wanted to comment.I would likely not turn them in unless turning them in solved a problem. I'd expect the sin to be justified and the collateral minimal... If I considered it unjustified I would make my decision based on the potential collateral damage of this persons previous actions and also determine the likelihood of future actions.

I would be calculating the risk vs benefit until a firm decision based on situation development or hunch.Yeah i totally agree with that comparison of Fi-Te and Ti-Fe as well.

I'm glad you mentioned the language thing - pretty much confirms the typing for my friend... Since i was commenting a little unsure of their typing ... and that's because i've known this person for 14 years or so! It was a rational idea that appears to be reasonable.

I was ... like 80% sure. Edit; hmmmm actually might have been an isfp. Still hard to tell. Still *hard* to be honest.&gt; I'm more *this is what I believe and don't argue with me lalala im never wrong*

The estp version is "this is what i *think* and don't argue with me lalala, i'm never wrong"I suggest you contrast the effectiveness of evolved vs devolved governance. I agree there is a balance... but i would also stipulate that reducing the effectiveness of democracy will always mean more people are worse off.

&gt; opening us to asset stripping

This is clearly not happening. And the pound is going up. The markets took a shock because many people bet the wrong way. But as has been stated over andover and over. **there was not even a eed for an emergency budget**.

What does that mean? The markets recovered without intervention. Brexit was a non-event, financially.

&gt; prosperity, which comes from interdependence

This is absurb. Look at Europe. Look at the Euro. Look at Spain, Italy and Greece. Your small Europe is failing and the dream would've worked with devolved governance rather than evolved governance (which enables the tyranny of the majority).

&gt; The choice is being part of a potential new super-power (the EU) or being dominated by remote super-powers (the USA, China)

Funny you should mention these in contrast. Is there any particular reason for the EU not holding public presidential elections?

I'd rather go that route than the China route.&gt; Maybe a little louder? Maybe a little more willing to annoy people?

I'd say that alcohol kinda brings judgement back to a more central place... instead of being 90% rational i'm like 60%. (and alsho horny)

You nailed it tho. A little louder (maybe) and a little more willing to be annoying (maybe)... and probably more interested in whats going on so i'd say Ti is toned down.

But Fe is tuned up.

I'd be more likely to tease people or provoke someone with loose words. And when Ti is toned down my mouth opens more often. Get me drunk and make me sing.

Edit; Waaaay more likely to invade people personal space if drunker.You can see it perfectly well in the bigger picture.

http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=MCX

Set it to 3 years. Then 5 years. Brexit was a blip. A complete non-event, financially speaking.

*Yes the pound will settle lower*. That's a good thing as it represents our trade defecit closing. This is a really good thing.

Then over a longer timeframe it'll go back to wher it was before all the instability. The strength of the pound is related to our economic position in the world. This much is obvious.

It's just common sense. It's the reason why we *don't use the Euro*!

&gt; I believe the long term projection

How long term is this long term projection?

Hahaha don't even talk to me about parity. Don;t even start. It's ridiculous and represents a complete lack of understanding about the UK economy. No. Shit, I don't know where to begin.

Basically re-read everything i've just typed again and then think about what parity would represent on a geo-economic picture.

We would need to have mass unemployment. Like spme regions of the EU! *Funny, that.*

**The markets recovered without intervention**. Don't dodge this issue. I know how things are valued. There was no effort in this restoration.

That's the key thing you need to grasp here. Normally when markets crash we need to make an effort, as a country, to fix it.

**We did nothing**.

24 hours after the vote George Osborne admits he was talking shit about an emegency budget. Then says the official projection hadn't accounted for what happened in those 24 hours.

The bounce back.

---

I can't be any more clear about this. I've given you the ftse 250 so you can see for yourself.

http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices.html?index=MCX

This was the FTSE 250 that was meant to show how the economy is tanking for *normal people*. And it simply hasn't. Set it to 5 years and look at it.

Brexit was nothing.

---

I'm getting bored of saying it now.

&gt; these countries made the same mistake we did with a credit bubble, but didn't have good industries to carry them

Are you serious bro?

&gt; we're about to get 10% rises in the prices of imported goods like electronics, and more if the pound falls further.

This is hilarious... what brand is your phone? Your TV? You computers? Everything comes from Asia already you idiot. The idea that electronic goods are going to become more expensive is ludicrous.

What are you gonna buy from Europe as a consumer? Honestly i don't think you've looked at the picture very closely.

http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/gbr/

---

&gt; Unemployment is coming everywhere with advances in robotics.

Irrelevant to brexit.

&gt; representatives sent by individual countries

You didn't look at the tyranny of the majority yet then.

http://www.sevenoaksphilosophy.org/on-liberty/tyranny-of-majority.html

&gt; I would like the process to be more transparent

Then stop letting them get away with doing it the wrong way. It's not difficult to say no. Saying no is the only thing that works.

---

I would strongly suggest you look at the way particular political beliefs are intended to promote a false cultural ideal. Driving revolution at great cost to the people. And it is for nothing. The dream is false.

http://daily.jstor.org/do-you-know-fascism-when-you-see-it/

Where does it end?

And why does the EU plan to spend 1 trillion Euros building an army instead of fixing these mediterranean countries economies?

Look at the picture in the medi for a German citizen looking at Greece or Italy.

It's time to stop making excuses for the EU. Europe is nice. Let's not let them ruin it.

I would support a reformed EEC without political union or a democratically elected president with transparency and accountability. They were foolish to use bureaucratic subterfuge on an international politics scale.

And personally i find them cowardly.

Protectionist industry. Suckling the teet of corporism. Getting people to go along with it by staying as faceless as possible. Slowly encroaching the legal authority.

Trap and financially devastate Greece.

Honestly the guy who was installed in their government and put in charge of the financial stuff was a veteran politician from Brussels. He fixed the figures and Greece joined the union illegally.

They sucked them in despite what it would do to the country.

Because they care about unity more than millions of people's actual lives. And those peoplea re suffering. Go and find out how bad things are in Greece. And for how long they've been bad.

It's inexcusable for the same administration to be in charge after that fuck up.To make this succinct; you do not appreciate the diversity of UK economy. It's one of the stongest in the world as evidenced by that bounce back.

When you say that prices are about to be raised. That is a lie.

The very first thing you would notice, as a consumer, is the price of fuel. That is not a point i'm willing to argue over.

&gt; The index declined over the period leading up to brexit

The pound has been falling since mid 2014. Don't act like it's current value below mean is entirely due to brexit.

[source](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/currency)

&gt; The GBP crashed against most world currencies.

Againt you show your ignorance. The world economy went down along with the UK. Everything bounced back because, financially, it was a non-event.

---

Don't link me an independant article and try to pretend it isn't a tabloid. Would you take it seriously if it was reported in the Sun?

Instead of reading biased opinion ... just go and look at the historical value of the pound against other currencies.

And when you do *try to remember brexit is a blip*. Things have bouced back before we even had political stability.

**Quite important to apprecaite the impact of that point**.

People were confident enough in the UK to invest despite our national politics having a complete board reset.

*Even i didn't expect that* lol.

&gt; The euro crashed with it perhaps

Facepalm. Are you asking? Or telling. Because i've looked at this as it happened. The data is out there. All of it is public. There's no need to read someone else's opinion... least of all the Guardian or the Independent.

Should we call it The Ironic-dant because they were heavily for *not actually being independent*.

&gt; the crash and price rises materialise

Except that whole thing about it being a complete non event. *Do you know how to find things out for yourself?*

&gt; Maybe those 'experts' were worth listening to after all.

Fool me once, shame on you.60% more in your personal space, the hornyness depends on % smiles recieved ;pThat reasoning doesn't stand up. Right away... why would the pound fall due to a risk of losing something we didn't, in fact, lose.

&gt; stronger together (due to greater specialisation), weaker apart

You say this without backing it up. We are stronger without EU ratchets fixing the market prices in favor of coporations and failing industries on the continent.

Are you aware that the EU retards growth in 3rd world nations, like Africa? Which is right next door to Europe.

&gt; oh apart from Dell

**Timeframe is relevant.** This will last until the pound recovers so it's actually much more important to look at the historical value of it.

In other words. This is a very narrow perspective and deliberately so. *You can't find another example* and the reality of this is that it's temporary.

I did already show you the Observatory for economics. You can see how much of the economy this single company prepresents.

And i'd also note that it's one of the biggest corporations... these are the guys who lose out in brexit. This is expected. It's *not* a downturn because these are high value imports that support service economy.

In other words our service industry GDP is indirectly linked to this. Plus we curently export lots of gold to be used in components the in China. We are very strong in the area of rare earth elements and this does mean that if the price *didn't* balance and it became worthwhile we would start to see manufacturing in the UK there.

This is how it works. And it's very much easier without the EU's thumb in everything.

You are attached to a cultural dream of unification. And i support this. But not if it come with a human cost.

&gt; facepalm you still haven't corrected it for the currency, and you never will since it doesn't back up your point. This matters for purchasing power, dividends. the companies themselves have external costs.

Sigh.

I ignored you because it doesn't mean anything. Transposing data into another scale doesn't change what the data says.

There's no such thing as "correcting for the currency" and the implication is just. Mislead.

Data is data. Changing the scale doesn't change what happened.

&gt; purchasing power

Explain then.

&gt; dividends

*gawd* you're gonna drop that completely unattached to anything?

i might as well tell you that currency is variable for all the good that point made

&gt; the companies themselves have external costs

Again... you're not actually saying anything here. You don't ahve an argument. Look at all the data i've given you. One or two news reports that are sensational but narrow in point of view do not support your woder concept that the UK is in some economic downturn.

**It was a blip**.

And the best thing... is that it already looks this good and it's barely 3 weeks since the "crash".

Like... can you please go and compare it to the financial crash in 2008 and then see why it's retarded to say this is the lowest teh pound has been for 31 years.

As if brexit was a real crash.Here.. look at this... just to show you what i can see

Your article says;

&gt; That marks a 6.5% rise on its current price of ¬£309

Here's the quote from my link...

&gt; The GBPUSD increased 0.0274 or 2.11% to 1.33 on Tuesday July 12 from 1.30 in the previous trading session. The GBPUSD changed +2.50% during the last week, -7.12% during the last month and -15.23% during the last year.

But you need to understand the context. Set the GBPUSD graph to "all" and it gives you the economic crash of 2008 in the picture.

Brexit is just... nothing. Invisibile. So you see my point?

Edit; In other words... when you say;

&gt; I've only seen electronics get more expensive once, thats when the pound crashed after 2008

This is just confirmation bias combined with the data not reaching you. It's just not been sensational news at any other point. You're completely over-reacting to a finacial non-event.&gt; Switzerland suffered a 10 year recession

http://i.imgur.com/wSY83D5.jpg

You're wrong.&gt; I don't call hitting 30 year lows "nothing" or "invisible"

But you're ignoring the context of the past 8 years.

&gt; That's one product's price rise so far

Doomsayer. That's all you're doing. I guess computer hardware hits your interests. Boo hoo. It's temporary.

The standard dipstick is fuel. You know you've got problem when fuel changes. Because it's a much larger part of the economy.

You've quoted one company, the other i don't even care baout since it's market presence is so small. *And then claimed the end is nigh*.

Look at the market data.

There's no problems.

&gt; yes, and back then the GBP crash resulted in...

**That's irrelevant if you compare the scale of that crash to brexit blip**.

It's really not hard to open the link. Set the graph to "all" and see the crash of 2008-9. How much data do you need before you understand what non-event means?

Now seriously. Take you hands. Use your fingers. Touch your face. Find your top lip. You'll find it quivering. Hold it firm.

Because you'll look stupid in the wider context.

Edit; I asked you for another example outside these companies.[By the way](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/11/germanys-siemens-embraces-project-optimism-in-brexit-u-turn/)&gt; broken those lows [being] my whole point

Facepalm. Just facepalm. *So how far was the decent in comparison?* Because we really need to frame the perspective here and you're belligerently ignoring the data right in front of you.

And then you digress instead of actually engaging my point.

You waffle.

How many times do you want me to point out the same thing? You have to tell me why i am wrong.

&gt; Are there any industries that aren't touched by computing?

Degree of stupidity confirmed. I already adressed (at some point) how the vast majority of businesses are only indirectly linked to the cost of computer hardware.

Minor issue... Meanwhile... business is improving (which counters the cost).

---

Instead of *sounding* like a doomsayer do you, maybe, wanna read over your posts beofre submitting and filling in a little more fact and little less vapid opinion?

I've cited and sourced things to support my arugments.

You don't really *have* an argument... you just have a delusion.&gt; How far was the decent?

[You said twice](http://i.imgur.com/HhE5QCp.png)

Comparing the amount he stock market fell in 2008 with brexit... you were going for "twice as much"

No.

Not even close.

*What does that mean?* It really simple. You were wrong and nothing you said about comparing the situations is relevant. Because one event was an actual market crash and the other wasn't!

&gt; It is significant that this is a 30 year low

Whoah there buddy. I didn't say it wasn't significant. I'm saying that you ignored to context of the last 8 years and have illustrated an incorrect picture.

The market fell about 400 points for brexit and went straight back up.

You can see the decent from 2008 in the image. Which i've linked to you to make absolutely sure that you have observed the data. I've only told you about 5 times now to sort the graph and observe the historical context.

**Tell me the amount it fell for 2008**

Then compare it with how much the market fell for brexit (if you can even see it properly).

---

&gt; I don't want things to get 10%+ more expensive

You're still doomsaying. Give me any other example. You can't because your entire doctrine is just parroting something written in the Guardian.

Which is a tabloid.

&gt; The next is AI, and VR

Don't be silly. I am a technology market analyst. You're attempting to make it sound like you know what will happen by throwing vague statements into the mix.

I follow both AI and VR for my career so i know you're talking utter shite.

&gt; new Computer hardware is vital

Yeah? How many machines in business are still running XP?

Hey! Let's exaggerate more!

&gt; It's going to change every industry

$191 billion trade defecit will be reduced.

But here's the funny thing. Our economy operating outside the EU has grown at double the rate of the trade inside the EU iun the last 5 years.

Another point that is reflected in the ftse 250. And the reason why brexit is a non-event in those terms is obvious in the context of economic growth over the past 5 years (and the value of the pound after 2008).

---

**You have ignored the historic context**.

But more than that you have misrepresented it so badly that i have no other course but to screen shot the graph!

&gt; thats rich coming from a brexiteer

Most people do agree with me. You have the minority view.

Explain to me why George Osborne would say that we need a emergency budget and 24 hours later he says we won't need one?

*He couldn't possibly have been lying.* Like Obama lied about "back of the que". In fact... every single statement about the economy was false.

And people are starting to see it. You're a bit slow on the uptake.

Honestly go spend 5 mins on /r/ukpolitics

And then try to tell me there's still some economic crisis happening. *It's just simply not*. You're stuck on last weeks news.&gt; Sure! but being in the majority doesn't make you right.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/4smepi/the_gbp_strengthened_against_the_eur_back_up_to/

No. Satistical analysis makes me right. It's important to understand your context when dealing with figures. Also public domain isn't going to give you valuable market ~~information~~ opinion for the cover price of a tabloid.

So i do agree with you... but most people are able to check the figures themselves and reach their own informed conclusion rather than absorb fallacious opinion from the guardian.&gt; I know narrow-AI and VR have great potential

Yes i've spoken in front of large groups of people about these technologies. Would you like to explain why it's relevant to the UK's current economic position?!

&gt; but if GBP falls, we lose global purchasing power

But that is not true.

How many times do i have to show you that the pound falling equates to market growth?

They are directly linked. I've given you the data and expected you to observe this yourself. It's not hard to see the ftse all grow drmatically in the period after the pound fell in 2008.

You simply do not understand how these two things are linkes. Inverse your concept. Flip it. Because that is the reality. Compared to the rest of the world the UK has great purchasing power... please stop ignoring the wider context of your arguments!

I'd have thought you would seek accuracy but i guess this is more aobut perception and sources. My sources are "the real world".I care.This is great. I especially enjoyed this part;

&gt; Therefore in order to control myself I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.

Followed by calm.Stock market's above the 12 month average.No it isn't inflation from weak currency. Prove that it is not growth.

The value of the currency doesn't correlate with the stock market bounceback.The difference is that I did some math to compare and these things aren't proportional. There's significant additional growth compared with the past 12 months.

The same cannot be said for the value of the pound. In actuality the growth is meant to increase with the value in stable market.

And the analyst perspective is that this is all the evidence you need of the strength and flexibility of the UK economy. Volume back was instant. Pound started to recover with political stability.

These things are easy if you look at the data - don't pretend you've done any real analysis. There is no publication that will give you reliable economic predictions for the cost of the paper. It's more profitable for the news agency to sell a story.

A perspective.

But you've decided that these journos are qualified because they give you more straws to clutch.More confidence in the UK economy. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3714890/Sterling-hits-11-day-high-dollar-drops-weak-U-S-GDP-data.htmlDid you read this bit;

&gt; The latest - figures showing British consumer morale suffered its sharpest drop for more than 26 years in July - had little impact on the currency on Friday.

Plus the entire framing is that the UK has comparable economic resiliance to the US, lol. Because it the 5th largest on the globe. This was never an uncertain thing.But where is the crisis? *Are you suggesting we'll suffer 1-2 day FTSE drops and the pound will drop out a few more times?*

Ho-le-shit there's money to be made on that reliability... *Do you get me?*

If you can plan for it then business thrive.

Edit; are you still denying that the fall in sterling stimulates the economy in the correct direction?Eh? It's the EU that's driving the working class wages down to compete with China. Look i talk to a lot of people i different social classes and professions okay!

I know chefs, ex-fishermen, landscape gardeners... and i work in an office as analyst meaning my work social is with businessmen and office workers.

Are you mad? You sound like all the other deluded people who are middle class but think they're wrking class.I cannot read due to paywall. But this isn't the real kicker in my reply to you...

My rebuttal; http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-britain-retail-brc-idUKKCN10K0Q0

I'll restate my point from before;

&gt; To make this succinct; you do not appreciate the diversity of UK economy. It's one of the stongest in the world as evidenced by that bounce back.

If consumers do not stop spending then the price changes on the high street are a non issue. You're clutching a technicality but the evidence is actually confirming my broad perspective of "things will be fine".

Edit; But here we have an interesting contradiction. Your source (which i cannot verify) states that prices have gone up... whereas my source states that purchasing has gone up as a result of bargain prices.&gt; but that can't survive outside pitted against chinese slave-labour/pollution-happy practices

ARM doesn't manufacture. They innovate on chip design and sell the rights to produce to manufacturers. This sophisticated role in the market doesn't become cheaper with relocation to areas with cheap unskilled labor.

&gt; [regarding stimulating the economy in the correct direction] like asset-stripping.. losing our prize tech company, ARM.

Since you're revisiting this debate i wanted to bring [this article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/03/softbank-makes-legally-binding-pledge-to-keep-arm-in-britain/) to your attention.&gt; Being agreeable, neurotic, conscientious (!), and altruistic is a no-no for short-term mating success. For the badasses (I don't agree with the label "asshole"), look for extroversion (E over I), low neuroticism (T over F), impulsive (P over J), a high competitive drive (T over F), open-minded adaptability (P over J), etc. So...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ESTP (probably the highest badass rating), ENTJ, ESTJ, ISTP

I am an asshole sometimes. And i do it on purpose to have a greater effect.

Example; i might flirt with another person to increase my chance of attracting the girl i want.

Sometimes i intentionally say things which people might *choose* to take offense at. This is intended to illustrate their personal bias.

For example; landlord tried to tell me that we shouldn't fight over maintenance issues... i immediately told him that i agree because he will lose every time when he is neglecting responsibility.

People are usually unprepared for such a blunt remark. But i decided to be divisive in that moment because the landlord had made a plea to emotion. "I don't like to fight" is not an acceptable response to me telling him to fix shit in the house (unless he's agreeing to fix shit)!

I have also clarified that it is a business relationship and not personal. So when i criticize he should take it professionally instead of acting like his feelings are hurt.

I'm well aware that he doesn't give a shit when not standing directly in front of me. Now this is not black and white. My housemates don't think i'm an asshole for holding the landlord responsible. Perspective is everything in the asshole vs badass equation.To support your commentary; I'm moderately neurotic and have a definite T preference.I got mediator (i.e. INFP / INFJ)

Free spirit correlates to ENFP. I don't think the test is too accurate!Yeah i analysed my result (mediator) and consider this to be INFJ (some mbti sites elect INFP as mediator).

In any case it's not a particularly accurate re-branding since it's given me a result i disagree with (have confirmed my typing repeatedly - some might say due to Ti).If you had a machine that produces 1 fuck every 1 minute... how long would it take for 10 machines to produce enough fuck for you to care?For the very first time i missed a plane last month. I arrived at the gate 9 minutes after departure... i'd have possibly made it if the bloody train doors hadn't got stuck shut for 15 mins.

This stands out because i *missed* the plane... usually i manage to hit the target regardless of a complete lack of advance planning!Great analysis, thank you!Yeah i answered 2 weeks for the paper (knowing that the calculated average was  weeks)... but if i was answering it honestly it's be 1 week... or 12 hours (as mentioned in teh question).

The premise of this question is planning ahead... which i find generates anxiety. But i also have a tendency to ignore problems and anxiety causes me to seek impulsive activities.Hehe thanks :)I got mediator too... but i also (anecdotally) recently moved into a house with a clear estp that i get on with very well. I know w whole bunch of ENFP and INFP too... these guys and girls are quite different to me.

The test seems to associate impulse and Se type stuff with intuition (looking at the analysis by /u/MetricExpansion

Of course there is also the possibility that i'm a INFP in disguise (but i would assume that i'd get on better with my ENFP sister if that was the case).Haha, thanks!

&gt; Before lunch: Journalist

&gt; After lunch: Detective

Suggests to me that someone stole your pudding! Anecdotally; i have recently noticed (in reflection) that i make really *really* unintelligent decisions sometimes due to hunger. Maybe we all do that. I should go eat.This is awesome lol :D

Wanker is a great word. Very satisfying. AND hand gestures! *Amazing*.Good point. It was weirdly low across the board for me too... i usually ace things that have rational logic in them.Shit that sounds like me! But this test gave me mediator - and i guess that's probably appropriate if the problems i'm most interested with tackling *are* people!I am capable of much better banter using T than F. Because F is just expression ... the actual clever bit or witty bit or flirty bit is the content provided by T. I can use F to get attention.

But i guess i use T to keep it.

In my opinion.My description of Ni vs Ne.

Imagine a funnel. Ni takes all the input and funnels into an option of choice or thought. Singular output. FOr me this is manifest as a hunch or anxiety.

Ne is the other way around - flip the funnel and turn it into a shower head. Pour concept or idea into the pipe and it expands through the Ne filter into many possibilities. Multiple outputs of equal weight.

Actually when there are multiple possibilities but i can't narrow them down to one option it generates anxiety for me. Ti attempts to create a test to remove the uncertainty.No such thing as a stupid question - only a stupid answer.

^^^unless ^^^your ^^^question ^^^is ^^^actually ^^^stupidI think it's kinda easy for an estp to upset the infj if they lose interest or don't want to commit (common).That devils advocate :DOh i meant the latter!

Too many feels will strangle me up a bit.Please provide an example :)Bart Simpson estp ... I don't think it's a good idea to use a partisan figure like Trump as example. I'm not saying I wouldn't vote for him. But the Estp is often portrayed as an intense character and this is not what most people will actually see if they meet an estp.

Bart Simpson is actually a much better stereotype.Accuracy.

Ti designs tests and validates truth. Problem solving when conditions are known and understood.

&gt; What are some good examples of it?

I frequently manipulate the change in a purchase such that i am carrying fewer coins. More detail; If something costs ¬£9.13 pence i would rather see if i have the 13 pence and then have ¬£1 change from a tenner than have 87 pence change added to whatever i'm carrying around.

&gt; How do you know when you spot a Ti user?

Language. Reasoning. The propensity to reference data. Perhaps OCD about accuracy. Problem solving when circumstances are known.

I recently moved into a house with another estp and have noticed that our strategy toward problem solving is practically identical.Take a look at the pages for [personal develoipment](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTJ_per.html)

The type descriptions you've read are very generic and don't cover the scope of personal growth. MBTI doesn't have a way to note an individuals personal experience and knowledge and so it counts for a lot of diverssity within a type.

People sometimes find it useful to look into Enneagram - which does account for you personal development so a certain degree. From what i have experienced so far the major differences in personality between most people can be described by mbti with enneagram.

But it is still not a predictive model (nor a particularly behavioural model).Not really. A caricature implies exaggeration. However the reference to Trump makes me consider the inverse. Mostly due to the effect of partisan politics and political spin. Trump's persona has been exaggeratted in teh media and i consider it unrepresentitive in most peoples midset of estp. That doesn't mean i think he's another type... i just think he's a particular exception to the norm for estp (his depiction is more caricature at this point than 

The IRL example is actually a poor stereotype for the average estp and Bart Simpson is a better stereotype for identifying an estp on the street.

Caricature has a divergent interpretation which doesn't enable this degree of clarity so i used the other word.

Barney Stinson would be a estp caricature.

Edit; and you are not technically wrong - but i wanted to explain what i was getting atIf you have 2 machines which (combined) bake 2 cookies in 1 minute. How long would it take to bake 150 cookies with 150 machines?you appear to use TiMeet enough people and challenge them to do a mbti test. Realise that i'm surrounded by ENFP.... then think about what that means. Everyone identifies ass a dreamer and romantic...

despite obviously NOT being dreamers or romantic. Assume media and social influence creates divergence in mbti results and accuracy based on ideals. realise that ideals are part of enfp. realise im surrounded by legit enfp's.

cry

become enfp myself.

Edit; then watch southpark and have my morals written for me.Something that doesn't make senseits a joke fuck face.It's ok I bought weed and now I don't care again!estp confidence could be a bit misunderstood - we are risk takers but also prone to anxiety and impulse

having confidence implies that you are assured... but often the estp will act before knowing the outcome (or even considering it sometimes) or take action regardless of outcome because of an agenda

I might be nervous as hell but still take that risk... that doesn't look like confidence. But it does move things forward.

/u/L7k5u8 described thinking dom as the most likely to be confident

&gt; I think sensing thinking dominates would be most confident. So ISTP and ESTJ.

So Ti dom and Te dom and i tend to agree on this becausse it makes sense that the logical reinforcement would provide the confidence.

I also acknowledge that there are many situations where an estp does not feel anxious or lose confidence (where others might) because Se is working in the moment to solve a problem. I think a good example of this kind of situation is when estp take the initiative in the moment.

So i guess it depends because there's two types of confidence in my opinion... the will to keep things moving along regardless vs the self assurance that you are correct in your judgement.It was a joke based on a standard format of question that is incredibly common.

It is based on differentiating the propensity for Te to organise numbers and for Ti to understand the principle point.

Ti users typically only pay attention to the 1 machine = 1 cookie = 1 minute principle. However if the question had been worded better (i.e. i admit that the joke was poorly formatted) then it would have implied another resolution to a Te user due to the way they acjnowledge the problem.

Here is the real version of the question;

&gt; If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how many minutes does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?

The ambiguity enables some misinterpretation of the principle or underlying solution. The answer is 5 mins but a Te user may be compelled to calculate a different result.

Ultimately i don't really care and was just making a joke.&gt; extreme rocket science

So are we not counting sarcasm as bad language? fuck face!

Also; ignore me i'm a dickI found this amusificating (despite being from CelebTypes - it's not completely fucking horrendous).Fe is the function equivalent of toffee. (Not tafee). Soft, sweet, sticky feels that are external. Too much and your stomach might get funny.

It sounds stupid to acknowledge it... I read expressions, body language, and sometimes vocal nuances that give me insight into how someone is currently feeling. But it is a guess and I am reliant on these external cues. Not telepathic. Sometimes people get accustomed to this and expect telepathy.

Spotting an Fe user; expressions during explanation of a story - visible emotion in expression.I exercise to wake myself up all the time. That is not a physical sensation... Alert and awake is a mental refresh. Believing anything else is simply ignorant of biology.

An Se user will exercise and think nothing of it. How might this manifest? I simply do not care if I have to go back upstairs to get something I forgot (assuming it's not time sensitive)... The extra effort doesn't matter to me.

But there are also plenty of Se users who satisfy their desire for sensation by eating. Or video games. Or live sports tv.

Se users might completely take stimulation from their environment without ever feeling the desire to exercise.

Fundamentally I think you have attempted to draw a rule which doesn't account for diversity. Perhaps you would like to consider ways that Ne and Se differ without falls by a confusing paradox about exercise. Exercise promotes physical and mental alertness and there's little point to distinguish motivation.

The easy way to tell Se from Ne is to look at Ne vs Ni or Se vs Si (this is my suggestion) because it is easier to ask questions and get a preference which doesn't apply to both Se and Ne.This is not accurate. I am Se Dom and I exercise first thing in the morning to wake up my brain not my body.

And I play way more video games than time spent doing sport. I skateboard maybe once a week but play video games whenever ppl ask me to play.

Also Se is grounded in reality and I read a lot. I study new developments - this doesn't fit with your description of Se avoiding theory. To be completely honest with you I probably know more scientific theory than most people. Still Se Dom.I pace when I need to think through a problem. Small example but it contradicts what you have said regarding motivation.

Fundamentally I think you have a loose grasp of Se.Thank you. I think sometimes people decide they do not like a type and then they refuse to acknowledge that anybody they appreciate (or find funny) could *be* that type. I dislike the over simplified interpretations of estp.

Anyway... i think it's silly to judge a personality based on stereotype. And now i've said that i'll use stereotypes to type bill.

On topic; i think bill is a istp because he has that certain detatched and cool uncaring thing. I have a friend who is very good at starting a bill burr-esque rant and i believe he is also istp (unconfirmed, anecdotal)

Ne vs Ni i would go with Ni... but this may be a product of the act being written beforehand. I think it would be easier to tell if he was improvising - but still he has a tendency to allude to a foregone conclusion as part of the joke. That could be Ti but the agenda to arrive at a certain destination with perspective feels like Ni to me.

It is certainly how i formulate my arguments.**Okay so i am linking the text for my own critique;**

---

&gt; *ENTPs enjoy intellectual debates while ESTPs do not.*

Fuck off. If the debate is highly relevant to me, right now, then i'll debate. The difference is an estp might not debate for fun but for taking action on a key issue.

&gt; ENTPs enjoy discussions and debates about macro issues like education systems, government, politics, and theology and so on. They enjoy giving their points of views and debating with others about theirs and often they come across as devil‚Äôs advocates.

They do. And i do tend to listen. But i am also a devils advocate because that's just how Ti works.

&gt; ESTPs have little interest in these intellectual discussions or debates; when they encounter such, they tend just to keep quiet and let others do the talking. Their conversation topics will center on daily happenings or events, and they enjoy talking and sharing with others about what‚Äôs going on with their lives.

I do not tend to keep quiet. I am analysing the evidence. I will object if something doesn't fit. And i will certainly put forward my own opinions on the matter if i feel they are valuable to the discussion. Which they frequently are (from my perspective).

---

&gt; *ENTPs enjoy abstract theory while ESTPs enjoy working with their hands.*

It depends what you would call abstract theory. I understand a lot of cutting edge scienctific developments because they are *real*. And i am attached to reality - i like to be sure of the world around me.

So i read theory to explain the concrete world.

&gt; ENTPs enjoy the classroom, especially subjects that deal with investigative or theoretical subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy and economics. They find themselves engaged when they are learning these subjects and often they have an intellectual curiosity to study more about them.

I hate classrooms. Edit; but i have an interest in these subjects. I prefer to train myself.

&gt; Most ESTPs do not enjoy the classroom, preferring to use their hands to do something or get to the outdoors for activity. However, in the classroom, they may still enjoy subjects that require them to do practical things like cooking, crafting objects and performing experiments.

Staring out of the window and daydreaming about physical ativity is kinda normal for an estp in a classroom in my opinion. That doesn't mean i wasn't paying attention for long enough to udnerstand the material. Ask me a question... i'll be fine answering it on the spot.

---

&gt; *ENTPs enjoy talking about possibilities while ESTPs just enjoy living in the moment.*

Well... i don;t like to talk about the possibilities. Because that will start to assign weight and make my Ni start making decisions that are weak for the future.

That might make me anxious.

&gt; ENTPs are inspired and energized by new ideas; they may be talking about starting new projects and businesses often. When talking about them, ENTPs often become excited and can go on at length about those ideas; however, they seldom do follow through on them as they are usually more interested in the ideas than the actual execution.

I would describe ENTP as a rational dreamer. I think that an ENTP might enjoy investigating fresh new ideas. That might be as a result of "not enough time to implement everything".

&gt; ESTPs enjoy living in the moment; they are little interest in the future possibilities or the past, they just want to live in the present. When talking about the future to them, one will find the ESTP simply just zones out. They prefer to use live it instead of talking about it. They are seekers of pleasure, whether in food, shopping or play; they want to maximize the enjoyment of the day.

And yet i am very patient. I have noticed this zone out - it's an attempt to reduce the anxiety generated by making plans that might need to be changed or adjusted.

There are plenty of effective ways around that. Like using a diary app on your phone. As long as i have stuff written down there's no need to be anxious about forgetting something.Are you familiar with the tennis hop description of an ESTP problem solving. I am also quite capable of these comparisons - in fact considering myself an ENTP briefly. I am very adept at bouncing between different persepctives. I am also very adept at pattern recognition.

In fact the pattern recognition thing really threw me off in the stereotypes. I have a veryu fast ability to recognise all the elements of a puzzle, via comparison, and figure out the solution. I am extremely good at this. Context and pattern recognition are some of my strongest qualities.

&gt; They're good at science and math because it's abstract.

No they are not abstract. They are real and handle aspects of the real world. This is documentation for reality - something an estp is very interested in. Science = RTFM for reality.

ENTP and ESTP types really are very similar. However i would illstrate to you that the propensity for ENTP to create many different options of equal weighting in speculation does not exist for an estp. We have a favourite options - and we design win-win scenarios in order to have effect. I am uncomfortable with speculation... this extends to a specific kind of theorhetical debate (lacking realistic implemntations)... however i am unrivalled in my interpretations of the real world and find myself correcting the speculations of ENTP.

&gt; Se is good at noticing smells.

This expression may be viewed superficially as a keener sense of smell - or the individual being *more* affected by smells... but that would be ignorant of the underlying motivation from an estp to explore and draw attention to the real world. The here and now. If you were talking about science here and now and i thought it was relevant and interesting then i would easily join the discussion and you might think i was an N type due to vapid stereotyping.

In other words - i may notice more smells... but at least i attribute them to a point of origin and can make a realistic case for whom it was that farted. Not only that but i have Ti and have no difficulty referencing past experience (which you attribute to ENTP). In fact the specific difference is that a ENTP will consider the options but an ESTP will create a test to determine the truth.

That makes us very good at accurate theory work - but requires an application. I would happily debate quantum physics with you if the underlying agenda was something in my interests. The problem i have with these descriptions is the specific interpretation that people give where they ignore the aspect that ESTP is easily capable... but does not do these things "for fun". Only when there is an agenda.

My agenda here is to correct the bad interpretations of estp.

Naturally this extends into theorhetical discussion and intellectual debate and is not entirely restricted to situations of who smelt it and who dealt it.ESTP, Musical, Body Movement, SelfThere you are... i was looking for estp to compare.

I got Musical (4.4 ish), Body movement (4.2 ish), Self (4)

I closed the scores too quickly. The result makes sense to me because i've always been a bit anti-social and i guess i taught myself guitar before people skills.I think i might love myself a bit too much... barely 5-6 of these questions were below a 3

With many of them i fully agreed. Also why  wanted to chaeck another estp result - it seemed like i gave it too many positive answers.&gt; I'm an N and I can usually tell when another N is in front of me vs an S.

I'm fairly sure i could make you think i was a scientist. But then i'd also beat you at Rocket League.

&gt; the kind of conversations she loves to have lately are about ideas and potential-- "Why do you think you feel that way?"

This is a question of reality. It is straightforward and not about ideas and potential at all. It's a straight forward question asking *why* you feel that way.

It suggests T preference over F.

&gt;  "What do you want out of life?"

This is forward looking and has elements of working out character. If somebody asked me these three questions i would assume they were trying to get to know me better ... or whomever they asked these questions to.

These are normal questions and often recommended in "getting to know new people" advice books or similar.

&gt;  "What are your biggest drives for wanting to achieve those goals?"

Literally read this yesterday in a paragraph that was talking about how people socially qualify themselves to promote their own value or to help others build their social value.

It was an interesting read but these questions are very common and therefore shouldn't be taken as evidence of ingrained personality traits.

&gt;  I don't even enjoy those kinds of conversations one-on-one with her because I find we are still on a different wavelength and we don't "flow" together.

Is it a difference of perception or judgment?

&gt; She's settled on being an intuitive, and now my brain is trying to incorporate this new information.

Everyone thinks they are a romantic and a dreamer. I blame Hollywood for this.

&gt; That said, help me to understand Sensors vs iNtuitives better

Se = hunches and impulse actions.

Ne = speculation and sentimentality.

Those are the easiest clues of Se vs Ne... I cannot give such a direct description for Si vs Ni (would need to think about it)

&gt; Do you think a growth-motivated S would see themselves as an N?

The differences are subtle between Ne and Se. I think that culture (and intellectualism) promotes identifying as a N type. It doesn't actually mean someone isn't a S type.

For example; I do not read fiction. I read lots of factual developments in science. But the stereotype is for ESTP to not enjoy theory... well ... i dont like *dreaming* and i find reading fiction a bit too dreamy.

I also sometimes turn films off halfway through... which some people call sacrilege (even if the movie is boring).[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/3yeeg9/my_estp_life/) is a link to my original first post on this subreddit "My ESTP Life".Such a sweetheart ;pThank you! I have wondered for a long time now why so much material associates pattern recognition with Ne... and it makes perfect sense for me to see that as a Ni thing.I'll attempt to clarify what i think this test means by "body movement"

*"Theyknowwhatiswhatbuttheydon'tknowwhatiswhat they just STRUT... what the fuck?!"*

If you surpassed me physically i'd have to congratulate you. And then have a shower and a cuddle ;)

I like bass

Good vibrations!I love you too... but you're not moving in!Thanks this is great :DDo you know any British estp personalities? That would be *more* interesting.If you give me instructions when i'm unhappy i will deliberately not follow them. This is why i yelled at someone for telling me the safe way to climb down from a roof... Because it fucking pissed me off and gave me intrusive thoughts about trying other methods.

When estp is under stress *do not tell estp what to do*! Unless you're good at handling a bull in a china shop.You should answer the mbti in terms of what you would find most preferable given your most comfortable life circumstances. Many people recommend looking at childhood preferences in order to answer more accurately. This is great for determining your mbti type and enneagram.

Acknowledge that mbti is attempting to assign a value to a spectrum. You might be leaning left or right of centre for a particular dichotomy. But it will always be a variable quality.

Ask me if i prefer logic or emotion after i've just been in a fight.

I'll probably tell you tell you i like adrenaline. But the point is that current circumstances are never appropriate for an mbti test. MBTI doesn't account for an individuals personal experience or knowledge.

So look to your childhood. And adopt the most comfortable perspective for your psyche. THen the mbti will measure your psyche in it's most preferential state. MBTI is a measure of preference.

**Why does this work?**... you only need to identify the dominant and auxilliary functions to confirm your type. The tertiary and inferior are expressed weakly anyway and may be difficult to define without maturity (literally - don't expect a fully developed stack until you're over 30 or have led a very challenging life).

But anyway... these ideas should help you to avoid perturbation in the results due to your current circumstance.

I find it easy to disassociate. I'm a Ti user. I'm naturally predisposed to analysis. So i have considered the effect of emotional upset on an mbti test.

I've tested it. I've stress tested the cognitive function tests too. Like... to give you an example... i got dumped back in March (i think) and doing an mbti at the time gave me a much higher Fi reading than normal.

Because i was being a moody asshole.

If i didn't focus on my current mood and instead concentrated on my interactions with the world around the ages 10-15 then i would get an estp result every time.I've just commented this in another thread answerig a similar question... i'll copy my response verbatim (because it seems relevant for both threads).

FTFY... And good work! Seems like you met your match :)Thanks! I actually found the information for this via searching on tumblr for mbti blogs.

Many of these thoughts have been written before but forgotten. I'm a good researcher (i tend to teach myself things instead of listening to a lesson).

If you're looking for this kind of material... one of the oldest and *best* sources of advice regarding mbti is [personal development pages](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP_per.html). They are old... but some of the best resources i've found.You help a estp by helping them decide which priority to tackle first and then letting them do it. If that's a simpler way to think about it.

Ultimately you can't really direct or instruct a rebel. So i think this should make sense.

&gt; Some kind of Ne aversion

Exactly this. I can handle it when i'm happy. But when i'mn ot happy your speculation and soft weighting of the options grinds badly with the estp urge to commit to action. Accuracy is incredibly important. But Ne dreaming will leave me anxious and unsettled. As if your definitive suggestion (no matter how difinitive) is still uncredited internally. I need Ni to move forward and that is a low stack function. But i won't trust teh suggestion if it came from outside... because i just don't like it.

If you struggle with an estp or helping them find their way... and you're good with reasoning... try to suggest a win-win situation and simply leave them alone if they start staring blankly into space.

Staring blankly into space is Ti validating accuracy. It needs to be undisturbed until a decision is made.

Then the estp should stop crying and start doing. Suggesting a win-win situation is literally "if this then you're fine... if that - then you're also fine"... the impetus is to take action and have freedom while doing it. And this will make the estp happy.

So the correct way to get an estp down from the roof is to tell him "you'll probably break your neck either way". This is a challenge and we rise to that with focus.sry i kinda super edited my reply cos i wanted to try and explain it.I think you've got it.

Freedom is paramount really. Constraints of reality generate estp creativity but human constraints are infuriating.

Mocking those constraints will do you well. Especially if the estp stands a good cahnce of performing well in this discpline. Both of you will enjoy the interaction if you tease an estp about stuff they don't care about. Or things they find easy.

For example; "are you crying becaues you only scored two goals?"

Be careful about vulnerability. It is hard to tell where an estp is vulnerable. But be sure not to tease there! Unless the estp is happy ... in which case it's fair game. Happy estp doesn't have a weakness really except long term planning ability and comittment. (and spelling)

If they're unhappy and you tease there then you don't like the estp anymore and want an enemy!

This makes sense to me when i'm high... it's probably drivel.&gt; I don' think it's a difference in perception/judgment, since that has usually not been a problem with others. It's that the conversations are linear and chit-chatty, even when they are about ideas and goals and such.

Much of the detail of my response was inspired by interactions i have with an ENTP. But i also have an ENFP sister.

So the reason i asked about a difference in judgement or perception is really for my own context - i was trying to compare with the mental model i have of ENTP (different perceptions but similar judgements style) and the model i have of ENFP (different everything)!

I just thought i'd explain FYI why i asked.I think ISTJ is the suggestion based on OPs hints (combined from other replies as well).

@ OP - It might be possible to review a persons handwriting and associate mbti type but i think it would require a very large amount of data and analysis to draw out reliable and common traits in order to usefully use this aspect of *body language*.Current type; ESTP

Extrovert; ENFJ / ENTJ - because i'm just so god damn curious what that would be like!

Introvert; ISFP or ISTJ - because i'm just so god damn curious what that would be like!Well said... altho i do kinda wish mbti had come to my workplace because i would've studied the material sooner.

I found this after turning 30.I did not know that. This is really interesting - since i have friends who work in social support (public sector) where mbti is generally not respected academically or professionally.

*However* as a market analyst i understand the different performance pressures for private vs public industry.

And so this is very interesting information for me (i.e. useful to create a debate) :)Uncompromising. This is more a positive thing than a negative from my perspective.

Devious. Same.

Can be deliberately vicious if provoked. I actually find that endearing.

I can't find a reason to dislike ISTP but many people might consider the things i mentioned negative traits... i consider them reliable and honest traits.So that describes my sisters relationship with her 10 years significant other. She is ENFP and i think he's ISTP but i've not really confirmed that at all.

It shocks *me* (an estp) sometimes when they exchange words!Oh right, my bad - I thought you had hinted. I guess I read that wrong!Glad to hear that, i did originally plan to cross post it to /r/istp however i was prevented by a spam timer on submissions and then forgot.

I'll post it now. Thanks for teh reminder!

The Ti and Fe parts are entirely generic and so they should be relevant for the quadra (if not 50% of all the types).You have to understand that it would not seem like "being an asshole" to you. Well... okay... unless you're deliberately being rude to achieve a goal.

I'll provide example... Consider the hypothetical situation where a friend has injured themselves. They might evoke a question "why did this happen"... I would likely reply something along the lines of "because you're stupid and hurt yourself".

Obviously this intended to evoke a particular level of mirth at the situation - and that is my goal.

But the comment could be taken seriously by a sensitive person (not MBTI Sensor... i mean sensitive like feely, complainy, generally easily offended). And with a personality that is very straightforward and direct it can be frequently grating against those personalities that tend to take everything you say seriously (or literally).

&gt; I've never seen myself as a mean person

Nor me! But i will happily admit that i am an asshole. [I know what's going on inside my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrgpZ0fUixs).

&gt; Maybe I'm just biased to people like myself, but I really don't think that this stereotype is accurate, and I actually don't mind stereotypes as long as they point to the truth to some degree.

I agree with you here. You are biased toward people who are direct and logical. That doesn't mean you can't appreciate other types of people too. I would say that this is a good way to illustrate how the stereotype isn't accurate for all perceptions of ISTP.

I have had some fantastic arguments with an xSTP friend - conversely i have also have some very interdasting debates. But *holy shit* don't discuss feelings.

&gt; If you could give me real life examples of instances where ISTPs have been assholes

Personally i don't find the preference for logic over feeling to be asshole-ish ... i find it reliable, loyal and endearing. Altho i generally do not grant respect for intellect until it has been shown.

See that. That's assholish arrogance. It exists inside my head and as long as i don't tell other people it's not *their* problem.

&gt; I might find that I have done similar things and I wasn't aware that I was being rude

Such is the nature of impulsive behavior. I've offended people by mistake and deliberately. If that happens it's because things have already gone past a threshold of care and my cup is empty.

Also rudeness is a really useful tool.

For example; my current landlord keeps using social tricks to placate me while he fails to repair stuff in the building. He will pander to emotion and take offense at the lightest suggestions.

So i called him a prat to his face and asked him for the details of the redress scheme to complain - because i'm tired of his incompetence.

:DThis is a good example of furthering your agenda with direct and straightforward word choice. It's a put down.

I love doing this to people who have irritated me!

It *does* unfortunately make me an asshole in some ways. But it's also very very satisfying.I'm pretty fucking sensitive and pretty fucking thinky.This should not be downvoted. It's a correct assertion and ESTP is often viewed as a typically strong psyche due to the competitiveness, loyalties, and win-win scenario fixing.

**But Se is highly affected by environment**. Literally sensitive. Impulsive to take action. The stereotype depicts estp being callous to some degree and this is entirely inaccurate.

Oh yeah... And the second function is Ti - a thinker. This is in the creative slot. Meaning ESTP is a thinker that can become irrational with feeling. The judgement axis is close "Se **Ti Fe** Ni". And the Perception axis is far "**Se** Ti Fe **Ni**". This means tendency toward more variable judgements but with solid perceptipons of reality.

If reality is disturbing the estp will make a judgement to take action.

Many types will consider that an estp may be confident because of the impulse drive... But those who would downvote the opinion that estp isn't sensitive should acknowledge the framing of this answer. I take action because i am uncomfortable or if i'm very comfortable but have an agenda. It's two sides of a coin.

And if someone wants to challenge me on depth of character i'll happily rise to... erm... whatever.You got: Interpersonal Intelligence

Those who have strong interpersonal intelligence are good at understanding and interacting with other people. These individuals are skilled at assessing the emotions, motivations, desires and intentions of those around them.

Your strengths include:

    Communicating verbally
    Nonverbal communication
    Seeing situations from different perspectives
    Fostering positive relationships with others
    Resolving conflicts in groups

I htought this was a strange result to give after i have told the test that i listen to a lot of music and enjoy dancing and am best at Sudoku.Secret estp powers apparantly. I was also surprised to get intrapersonal intelligence.I've included the whole axis.

**Misplaced and/or Misdirected Introverted Thinking (Ti)**

By misplaced and misdirected, in this context, I‚Äôm referring to ways in which the function is conducted that obstruct one and/or others‚Äô wellbeing and growth. Some instances may be within what would be considered as ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô and ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô. The following are only a few of the ways in which the Introverted Thinking (Ti) function of a person is misplaced and/or misdirected:

- *Crippling perfectionism*; having high standards and aiming to be and do well with them can be great as long as it‚Äôs not paralyzing and keeping from making the necessary ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô to change and improve where it‚Äôs needed.
- *Senseless fault-finding and nit-picking*; focusing too much on what is wrong and losing sight of what is right (or highlighting what is wrong for no good reason and more often than necessary) can be both harmful and stagnating.
- *Endless questioning*; questioning is important and recommendable to find and create solid foundations and constructs, but if it keeps going incessantly, it can needlessly break or impair the solidity of things.
- *Endless hypothesizing*; hypothesizing is important and recommendable to come up with new ways to look at things and fill the gaps, but if it keeps going incessantly, it can leave no room for the facts and how things are truly like.
- *Destructive and unproductive battle of wits*; intellectual conflict may form doorways to exploration and clarifications, but if there‚Äôs too much emphasis on proving one‚Äôs intellectual superiority and another‚Äôs intellectual inferiority, many opportunities to learn will be lost.
- *Insensitive and disrespectful prodding*; it‚Äôs one thing to take interest in another person and participate in light teasing to get them to open up about matters, and it‚Äôs another to be pervasively insistent on getting someone to share about themselves (by pushing buttons and more) when they don‚Äôt want, need nor have to.
- *Dismantling and reducing to bare minimum*; in exaggerated efforts to be ‚Äúdetached‚Äù and ‚Äúimpartial,‚Äù stripping objects and subjects to the point where they lose their meaning and significance.
- *Overvaluing intelligence and logic*; believing intelligence and logic (in self and in others) are all that count and having little to no patience or appreciation for anything else not only lacks compassion - but also leads to a distorted and incomplete worldview.
- *Severe distrust and negativity*; not that being happy-go-lucky is always that much better, but many worthwhile people and experiences can be missed (or even tainted) if there‚Äôs a strong predisposition to think the worst of them.
- *Projection*; assuming they understand others when, in reality, they‚Äôre only attributing their own motives and intentions to others.

You may recognize one or more of these in the use of Introverted Thinking (Ti), from a smaller to a larger degree. Once you become aware of these, you‚Äôre more able to replace and redirect this function in more positive and constructive ways.

**Misplaced and/or Misdirected Extraverted Feeling (Fe)**

By misplaced and misdirected, in this context, I‚Äôm referring to ways in which the function is conducted that obstruct one and/or others‚Äô wellbeing and growth. Some instances may be within what would be considered as ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô and ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô. The following are only a few of the ways in which the Extraverted Feeling (Fe) function of a person is misplaced and/or misdirected:

- *Excessive attachment*; inability to let go of others who have long ceased to be (or want to be) connected to them.
- *Excessive possessiveness*; seeing others as extensions of themselves and feeling entitled to limit and to shape them to their own will, without much or any concern for what others truly want and need.
- *Excessive protection*; keeping others from making decisions on their own and from living their own experiences by instilling worries and fear where they‚Äôre not due.
- *Lack of boundaries*; meddling, intruding, giving little to no space or privacy - no matter how uncomfortable they‚Äôre making others.
- *Overextended service*; doing too much ‚Äúfor others‚Äù when it was not asked of them, when they were clearly asked to stop (several times) - and then resenting others for it and expecting and demanding in return.
- *Overbearing pride*; believing themselves to be superior and more deserving of validation on the sole basis of having better ‚Äúsocial skills.‚Äù
- *Condescension*; believing they know better what‚Äôs best for others when, in fact, they don‚Äôt - and forcing their views onto others.
- *Projection*; assuming they understand others when, in reality, they‚Äôre only attributing their own motives and intentions to others.
- *Falsehood for unmerited inclusion*; tactically lying and delivering half-truths with the intent to persuade and convince themselves and others of someone‚Äôs ‚Äúgoodness.‚Äù
- *Falsehood for unmerited exclusion*; tactically lying and delivering half-truths with the intent to persuade and convince themselves and others of someone‚Äôs ‚Äúbadness.‚ÄùWhat do you look like?Hmmm, it's beena while since i did the thing - but i do people watch :D undeniablyI like spaghetti! But it's got shit all over it!Yeah, haha - i was going to say that with Ti i can be sure if someone is full of shit but with Ni it's a suggestion that they are wrong. Sometimes i notice that my Ni has given me an incorrect impression.

I like to suspend judgements. I don't like to pass judgement too soon. So this description works really well. Ti works things out and is concerened with accuracy.

By cmparison Ni is perception axis. And this is not a judgement - but an instant perception that pertains to a judgement. I still like to suspend judgement but Ni will color certain interactions.Sounds more like Ti vs Te to me

Ti understands the principle point and can apply the theory to other similar situations. Te can manipulate logic in real time - this person may not grasp the whole udnerlying principle but may be able to fit the solution regardless.

Ni vs Ne seems like it's in the mix here but i'd favor Ni for hunches rather than Ne for creativity in your example.

In my mind everybody is an ESTP tho.I don't look at the explosion. Wait that might be ISTP.

My anime power is probably dragonshout. That's not anime. But I can knock stuff down with words.Don't make me get glowing condoms and challenge you to a lightsaber duel.

Don't *make* me.i find that the temperaments are very similar but these types will often talk past each other - the enfp leading dialogue with Ne and Fi in the moment and the estp running Se Ti it ends up being a constant struggle to communicate.

I've known lots of enfp. Typically the immediate judgements based on how they feel about something piss me off. This is actually a sticking point because I hate premature judgement intensely. And also, in discussion, the suggestions and speculation coming from Ne make me uncomfortable. There have been times when my perspective is to simplify and the enfp wants to feel correct (with some complication). Can't really nail it better than that.

My sister and I have learned not to talk past each other and not to take pleasure in offending either Fi or Ti. I guess we've learned how to translate a bit. Can still easily trigger a full blown fallout if in disagreement on an emotive issue.welp. My Fe's broken ;pTi might ask "what are the defining characteristics of each house?" to elect the same point of contention. Names are just names.Hmmm - this is very much how i like to go about things.

&gt; if someone asks me for specifics that they have fuck all to do with I'll happily lie to get out of there quicker, I don't tolerate such bullshit manipulation

This is a great way to describe the framing. I think Se notices right away when someone is trying to pervert the perception of an argument and it's offensive. I'll quickly attempt to control that manipulation of perception in whatever way presents itself.

I'm glad that you made comment because it provides the opportunity to spot nuanced difference between Se Ti Fe Ni and Se Fi Te Ni

Very minor differences in my opinion - i think due to the perception axis being wide (and judgement axis close) may mean that our perceptions are more rigid than our judgements.

---

I did note that i withheld the information about when i withhold information in my reply. Omission of critical information is far more manipulative than lying in my opinion.

&gt; but I try very hard to not skew the presentation and misrepresent counter arguments

It seems that truth and accuracy are a core value regardless of Fi aux or Ti aux. Thank you for commenting.I usually feel guilt if i have lied to selfishly further my agenda.

For example; in my shared house someone complained about my leaving clean clothes in teh washing machine over-night. He told me that it caused mold in the machine. This person didn't know that i had put my clothes in and gone to bed to let it run over-night. I lied and said that damp clothes don't create mold... and i followed it up by saying that dirty clothes cause the mold spores to get into the machine in the first place.

I lied because i found the whole discussion pointless and irritating. Wet clothes aren't going to go moldy in a few hours and i've grown up in a house that washed clothes at night time to take advantage of cheaper electricity.

Anyway... This causes a surprising amount of internal conflict.

**Shit... i just had crazy de ja vu whilst typing** (totally unrelated)

The cognitive dissonance comes from detesting the debate but also feeling guilty for dismissing it with false clauses / straw man fallacy.

&gt; I think it would be really rare for me to do it with someone I was close to, though. I'm trying to think of an example.

Yeah, true. It's usually worth the effort to go the distance and properly explain myself to people that matter. If it makes sense then i'll come clean as well. We might as well get right down to it if we're going to be tarred as a liar.

&gt; Even when I WANT to lie, to protect myself from judgment or to get what I want, I consciously force myself not to.

I can't help but tell people the truth about stuff they don't want to know.

For example... climate change is not man made. There. I said it. It's my latest thing. And i'm fairly [convinced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkdbSxyXftc) that most people don't see it that way.

Converse to lying i feel the impulsive need to bring these things to peoples attention and show them the truth.

Partially because i am good at adapting to a new reality.

I hate the negative judgements that people assign me. An acquaintance called me extremist and fanatical when i brought up this topic for debate. He made personal attacks. Derivative comments about my private life and "how he's changed".Well i lie every time i sign the ToS agreement on software which states i need to read the terms of service before agreeing to it.Thanks, what type are you?Ahhh that explains it, for a moment i thought i was connecting with my inner Fi-ness

It's been an odd week.&gt; The moment you acknowledged your own biases it's impossible to not admit that you're withholding potentially relevant information, you might not find it relevant, but that doesn't mean it's definitively not relevant.

Nailed it. You have made me realize that the original question pertains to self assessment or self analysis of bias. Something that has been on my mind since the brexit debate. And i have actually been studying control of population indirectly.

And this thread is my action on impulse before thinking it through. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/517h2l/most_of_the_time_when_i_lie_it_is_because_the/) is the thread that sparked the question in my mind.

It's a shower thought "Most of the time when I lie, it is because the truth takes too long to explain."

And i think it has now been removed :(The temperaments are behavior based and therefore not a good descriptor of functional processes. They are a product of wider scope than mbti is intended to describe. Mbti does not seek to describe our personal experience and learned knowledge through our lives - it is far more useful to determine initial preferences.

For example; i might have a personal desire to learn the guitar but i may live in a society that frowns upon this style of music. I may be affected more by the status quo than my own personal preference. This is an example of preference vs behavior and shows how mbti related behavior study is lacking fundamental detail.

First i would tell people to answer the online test and remember how they behaved as a child - 10-12 years or 15... something around this age should be more than enough to identify the dominant and auxiliary functions.

And those are the only bits you need to discover the type.

---

The very next thing i would recommend is to confirm the typing by reading the personal development page for the assigned type.

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP_per.html

I gave absolutely no credence to mbti until i had read this page. It makes accurate predictions of my problems. And it proposes effective solution. Nothing more useful to confirm typing on the internet at large because many of the typology sites omitt negative impressions of the types.

The personal development pages highlight the parts of our personality that are a "blind spot" whilst also confirming the strengths. This is a very useful and effective resource for confirming type but also a great place to start in terms of understanding others (or your interactions with others).

I have also confirmed my type via conversation on these boards, conversation in person, and further study of mbti related concepts (such as socionics).

Despite the perfectionism i am genuinely not TI dom. Se rules my life - for better or worse. And it is important to understand your dominant function. I have fallen into inferior grip and i consider all forms of depression to be an issue of personal development and emotional maturity (that may sound critical but i would assert that i believe this from personal experience).

Confirming type is challenging. A good understanding of the functions and the structure of the psyche proposed in socionics is useful information.

Socionics elects the functions that our personalities reject - and this may be useful for many people to confirm their type as we frequently have a stronger assertion about stuff we **don't** like than stuff we **do** like.

Edited for clarity&gt; I find anything with public reception incredibly interesting

Here's my most recent "project"; apparently we (globally) spend more each year on carbon emissions than we do on eCommerce.

Except that [carbon emissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEPW_P7GVB8) don't seem to cause climate change.

And this perspective has been thoroughly criticized by my mates.

They tend to say the same thing "I've seen the data myself"... except that they *haven't* seen the data... at best they've just absorbed the status quo.

Calling CO2 pollution is in fact a misnomer. Without greenhouse gases the globe would not support life! This "pollution" is the reason why life thrives... which is counter intuitive if we use that word as a descriptor for CO2.

I've heard all the arguments at this point and i am not decided. I like to suspend judgement. But i will argue the side that is dismissed any day... because it's important to consider all the angles!If you assume that i have nefarious intentions then i'm more likely to act on a nefarious impulse. Because you assumed the worst about me... so i'll make that true for ya :DI just did this tonight wilst trying to explain Si to somebody.

Yep. I called it sentimentality.

Just too lazy / apathetic to get closer. I also skipped a lot of other shit in this crash course. But this is on the understanding that i could potentially fill the blanks in at a later point.I have always found intimidation easy. I estimate where the other person is at - it's easy for me to hold differing perspective in my head and take advantage somehow. It's based on visual signs and the content of dialogue. I understand how to push and poke in an exchange. There are various strategies that come to me in the moment for applying pressure.

I can lead a horse to water and then constantly suggest how hot and dry the weather is today. Sometimes I choose not to push people at all. Most social and friend conversations do not involve any hostility.

Most, lol. I will still tease people.

But yeah. Leading a horse to water. Good job we found fresh water.

I'm not so weird but some people will call me that if I'm not conforming to a rule they respect. Also I appear playful and maybe childish unless using Ti so all the coldness and harsh analysis can be turned on or off.

In terms of intimidation by others - I am sensitive to "turf". I don't like it if people take liberties with me unless they are amicable people or insignificant liberties.

I have developed lots of patience. I prefer to move people forward with problem solving. But I have no problem walking up to a big dude and screaming bloody murder if I think they've fucked up. And I don't enjoy fighting (but I'm not adverse).I like to grab attenion :)

Physicality builds tension. If i'm interested in someone close i've more than likely used my hips to bash their hips and nudge them. Usually delivers that challenge! Faux intimidation given a cheeky little playful bump. See if you can get me back! But i gotta admit that a hungry look or cracking a smile is thrilling.

I've definitly seen intensity turn girls on. That's kind what i mean by a hungry look. Utterly dirty but somehow private.At the moment [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0oIoR9mLwc) Dark Necessities by Chili Peppers.music tastes are diverse and you can discover new things in any community

i was interested in finding out what kind of music people would suggest and potentially relate that to their mbti type

you can't devils advocate me ;pAlso; who pissed in your conrflakes? :DThe subreddit is not *soley* for typology or ttyping. In fact many people find typing other remotely to be a terrible poor use of MBTI and prefer to evoke or elect ways that it could be used for personal development.

I suggest you take a look at that aspect of it.

Fuckface.

&gt; I guess this was the straw that broke my back more than anything else.

Not at all, you just felt like having a troll. Don't bullshit me.Here's the thing about ESTP... you can't really identify Se dom from outside. It relies far too much on the persons behavior and they may have developed a preference for certain behaviors for a variety of reasons.

Most people understand that being fun and "in the moment" leads to a good time. ESTPs will try to keep the party goind and this rubs off on people.

In fact i can usually cause people to relax. I'm fairly well versed at drawing attention to myself so that shy people do not feel so obvious and exposed in a social setting.

Many of these factors give the ESTP a "blend in" thing. **Edit; pro tip for identifying Se users at a festival... they are the ones that say FIRE or fireworks or boom when there's pyrotechnics**. But you do not see the Ti at work in this environment. It would be a little strange to see the ESTP break out a notepad and start writing down how people had behaved. Writing the rules to the ESTPs own little games of interaction.

And lots of people are trained well to be good in an emergency. So the tennis hop, win-win scenario fixing is natural to ESTP but also indistiguishable from real training.

I remember talking with an INFJ nurse and she described how her thought process worked in an emergency situation. The comparison between Ni leading and Se leading was startling to me.

---

Anyway... the long winded point i was making is that ESTP is a street sleeper if there ever was one. In terms of social dynamics is easy for an ESTP to "hide" if they want to.

&gt; I see them almost every day in packs.

Many people identify an ESTP as a pack leader. I have naturally been placed in leadership positions in sports, and video games, sometimes work environments.

People naturally assume my competence at running things because i am a confident and direct communicator. Plus i'm analytical.

But you will find that role models are important to ESTPs so they might naturally find likeminded people - or those who enjoy spending time with the ESTP forming a pack. One of the typical stereotypical things said about ESTPs is that "we look fun there with our big group of buddies".

In reality we do prefer to move around a variety of aquantances and "catch up" or practise a bit of rapport with individuals. This is also seen by other as a "building up" style of banter. You can see how this goes over the top and has created a bro culture. I do not blame ESTP for this... but it is certainly a common theme that ESTP fun mode involves shtting down Ti and doing stupid things. So i can appreciate where it comes from. And i also know that Ti being abesnt is a big indicator that the individual is not ESTP. But many ESTP will hide their Ti from everybody.

---

Not all bro's are ESTP.

I've met some ESTP fan boys who were very good at "bro-ing" but turned out to be INFP. I have no idea why but there's fairly good rapport and bromanship between ESTP and INFP (which seems weird because we easily offend each other).

&gt; I think they're the most obvious and easy to type, so I just find it surprising that they would be that rare.

How many of those traits are behavioural?

MBTI describes a preference. Our individual life experiences and knowledge can easily cause people to learn behaviors that are not stereotypical. Especially if you cherry pick your impressions from a brief 10-15 seconds glance of bros walking down the street.&gt; Also, why do you think that we are easy to type? It took me half a year to type myself correctly

This is a really key point. MBTI is not about behavior.

Se can take a fancination with sport or with food. You get fat ESTPs. But most people identify the sports jock as a typical ESTP stereotype.

I was fat once. I used to think i had an additive personality. I *do* have Se dom so i guess that's kinda true. I smoke weed now and exercise instead of eating cakes, drinking beer and playing video games.

People have these cartoon characters in their heads from reading much stereotype and doing very little actual analysis.

Spot the ESTP by seeing the [actual analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9w7jHYriFo) happen.Methinks the lady doth protest too much ;p

If anything the contribution itself shows that some people are much more inclined toward specific topics. And i imagine Se can be excused for enjoying music.

The thread in itself is a small contribution of what makes up ESTP. And i do tend to comment on these boards to provide example. I found that there was a percieved lack of example online. I am quite happy to comment and have become quite immune to criticsm (something an ESTP may be genuinely upset about).

[If you are interested](http://www.alittlebitofpersonality.com/2013/05/type-heroes-estp-spartan.html)... it's an interesting read but anecdotal.I work out for several reassons. I'll list them. I had been playing lots of videos games and was fat and lazy.

I have probably gone from the worst shape in my life to the best shape in my life in the past year because i stopped palying video games.

Not that i consider them a bad thing but for me it's too much of a distraction.

Reasons for exercising; Now i look good naked. But telling people that i think this **is** the difference between confidence and arrogance. So it's generally not a good idea to tell people that you look good naked. Or that you exercise because you enjoy the reaction from looking good naked.

But it's the truth. I am motivated by sex and self esteem.

I also work out to feel better about myself but i kinda already feel pretty good about myself most of the time. Also i would typically be high on cannabis when doing a work out. Getting outside and into a dynamic environment is refreshing if i feel cooped up. So sometimes i will go for a walk just to displace myself if i got tired with my surroundings.

Earlier today i was teased by a friend and lashed out punching him 3 times in the arm. It was a fairly brotherly exchange. Does that count as relieving stress via exercise?

&gt; While in some cases I have seen people say that they workout to focus their mind.

A full blown work out is a bit much. Especially when trying to pay attention to form or using stability / core type of exercise. Stuff where you need to concentrate on balance might not be the best for engaging mental gears and focusing the mind to solve a problem.

If my head feels couldy then i'll pace around.

But the difference is i get high for a proper workout.

At work i might get up and pace while i think thru the detail of executing my will. In high stress situations i will be a bundle of restless energy unless the solution is to remain calm.

Thinking about it ... times when i have been irrational lead to exercise hobbies that bring me back to rationality. But too much exercise (displacement) would cause me to ignore the original problem. And exercise is not the only distraction.

I have Se dom Ti aux

When you mentioned focusing the mind here and relate that to exercise i believe that i am constantly abusing the dopamine system in my brain in one form or another.

Take all my drugs away and put me in pergatory and essentially i'll masturbate in protest.Use the right words and it's all good. Conveying meaning should be accurate and not too subjective.

&gt; Sensors, do you get uncomfortable or bored by what Intuitives enjoy talking about?

Sometimes i get irritated by certain things. Generally the topic will be interesting but sometimes the Ne throws a lot of mess into the equation that i don't like.

&gt; What level of conversation would you be happy engaging in? What keeps you stimulated? What kinds of conversations are meaningful to you?

I'll talk shit about anything to anyone. I get annoyed by irrational judgements but make plenty myself.

---

Edit;

Regarding your interactions with ISFJ guy

&gt; However, he seems to be (politely) bored/ somewhat avoidant when I ask him things [contemplative examples]

There's no particular reason to explore the concept unless it has become relevant to the sensor. So like... you might try to make it relevant with conversation and let the guy think about it a bit. I'm not much into spirituality and for the most part of my life would've given you a very brief answer about what i think of death.

"It sucks but it has to happen."

When it comes to meaningful shit i don't think we really care too much about what other people speculate about. It needs to be important to my understanding of who i am. And i understand that spirituality is hocus pocus. This means i might not tell you what i believe because you would possibly be offended or treatt it like i rejected the topic with my strength of opinion.

I just don't buy into fantasy and am too analytical to really budge my posittion there.

Okay. Maybe that's too much. But you can see why i might not willingly chat about it. Also it would only irritate me if somebody started making suggestions about aspects of my philosophical belief that i have already considered and resovled. I'd make the effort for someone important or if i was frustrated about a percieved violation of one of my Ti-Fe enforced beliefs (that kinda look lots like i have dveloped a Fi set of values)

Wow. why does it take so long to explain things. i should probably not do coke again for abit.

&gt; They discuss working out, work, and vices. Vices, day in and day out. My boyfriend says they never discuss life, love, etc. ESTP would never bring it up or engage in such conversations unless it has practical relevance to him at the time.

Well. Yeah... but then this bromanship has some Vegas rules. What is exchanged between bro's stays between bros. I'm a ESTP and i bitch all the time. I'm the worst. But i also can just jive and talk about trash.

&gt; It doesn't bother my boyfriend, but he notes that they don't necessarily have a depth of understanding for each other, at least not like how he has with his other intuitive friends.

Depth of understanding is over-rated.Me and Jinny was like peas and carrots again.Definition;  Logic, Philosophy. a difficulty encountered in establishing the theoretical truth of a proposition, created by the presence of evidence both for and against it.

I don't like the word and do not consider it part of my vocabulary. I would suggest finding it used in a text to understand if your application of it is appropriate. Opinion is subjective and many people are disinterested in gramma and semantics to begin with.

Why i don't use this word to describe Ti; Evidence both for and against something can be resolved. Ti pays attention to accuracy - i would suggest that if you believe the constant cycle is never resolving then you must observe the facts and apply appropriate weighting (Ti) to your Ne speculation.

&gt; Maybe this is more of how Ti manifests itself with Ne?

Bingo. Se is compelled to resolve the isssue thru action (which may be research or testing). Ne usually has difficulty selecting an option or weighting the options or moving forward with something that is unsure due to a lack of applying Ti and doing the research or test.

This is where N types are described as having a mental block and S types are described as "do-ers". This also contributes to the concept that N types are more intellectual (as they will still be thinking it through while the S type is doing).

I find that conversation with an ENTP is aided by my Se-Ni perception of their speculations. However it can also be annoying if they needs lots of information (Ti) to validate my perspective. I typically find that the ADHD comes in halfway thru my explanation and we're back on the merrygoround of "maybe this" "maybe that"... whilst the ENTP enjoys ignoring the things i know to be true because Ne is dom, yo.Probably INFP (cos you guys suck at self analysis due to Ne-Te).

&gt; I think that I'm an INFJ who was raised by mostly sensors which explains why I felt adopted.

I don't particularly like that. It sounds pretty dumb thing to say when Se is inferior for INFJ and a subconscious function. You wouldn't feel out of place amongst sensors and splitting that hair means you're ignoring the actual reason.

Somebody in your family unit uses very different functions to you. It helps if you can identify it functionally and completely ignore behavioral stuff. DO not say "this person is an ISFJ because i find them boring" it's subjective as fuck and based on zero functional analysis... but people do this all the time here.

MBTI doesn't work with benhavior analysis becuase it doesnt seek to describe that. The stereotypical behaviors that exist on the web relating to mbti are some of the aspects of this topic which detract the most from the accuracy of the model.

Functional approach or stop MBTI-ing!! But that means you need to validate why you think your family members are each type... i wouldnt want to move forward with my analysis without that validation.

---

Edit; Judging by your function test results i would go with ENFJ. Is there any particular reason why you used these crappy tests instead of keys2cognition?

I wanted to disagree with you up until i read the content of your post.I'm not disagreeing with your analysis but these are all behavioral typings. This is important to understand.

MBTI is a ground up method of explaining the psyche and that may contain some predicted behavior.

Most other models are behavioural models and do not elect mental functions.

Why is this important to consider? Well... basically... an ISTP looks like an ISTJ look slike an ESTJ look slike an ESTP under certain conditions. Put an ESTP in a library and they'll probably read a book.

&gt; With ENFJ, I read the descriptions and I identify with a lot but I just really get burnt out by people. I DO really need the RIGHT people but not just random people. I want those I can talk big existential stuff with.

Yeah this is something i also consider.

MBTI describes me as an extravert with strong social functions. But for a good portion of my life i simply didn't like the people around me. That made me consider that i was an introverted personality.

But the reality is that i simply didn't like any of those people and prefered to cut them out.

&gt; I: This is easy. They're quiet and don't go out ever.

Here's another way to consider behavior... does the individual stand in the middle of aroom or near the sides? How does this change if the room is full of people?

also it seems like you anbalysis is based on a typing that doesn't include a functional analysis - meaning you wouldn't necessarily be able to elect Fi vs Fe for the ones you depict with a F preference.

Additionally... when i argue about current events i mightt constantly evoke argument and debate relating to how people feel - this doesn't make me a F preference (it's just that belief evokes that kind of discussion).**Check the [side bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2f9orq/socionicsmbti_descriptions_by_functions_entj/) for a good overview.**

You might also like the [personal development](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTJ_per.html) page for your type. This is an old but highly regarded source.Rebel. I could be an INTP. Sure.

&gt; Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike. They act from a sense of choice, from freedom. Rebels wake up and think, ‚ÄúWhat do I want to do today?‚Äù

&gt; They resist control, even self-control, and enjoy flouting rules and expectations. They sometimes frustrate others‚Äîand even themselves‚Äîbecause they resist any expectation, even one that‚Äôs self-imposed.

&gt; Rebels resist habits, but they can embrace habit-like behaviors by tying their actions to their choices and their identity.

I like mbti and socionics because instead of painting me as a one dimensional rebel they seek to describe what i should pay attention to instead of always rebelling.

He said rebelliously.&gt; We generally appreciate people being open and honest with us, even if it's with their feelings.

Made me giggle.

I also agree with everything you said.ESTP

Despite being fairly happy to entertain anybody and talk with anyone about most anything... i am actually very picky about the social interactions i pursue. What does that mean? Well... a certain amount of socializing is "doing the rounds" saying hello to everyone and catching up. After that part where everybody has been made welcome i'll actively seek particular interactions - i.e. talk to the people i enjoy the most. This is not always a consistent thing... Sometimes I'll ignore everyone else and just talk to my crush. Fuck small talks.

Th people i enjoy the most don't do the following things;

**I hate when people make a vapid value judgement**. For example; walking up to me when i'm eating and asking how much my food costs so you can tell me it was expensive. However if the value judgement aligns with my own then this would not be a negative. It just works this way folks!

But basically... if you've nothing positive to say about my food. Fuck off.

**Factual inaccuracy**. Don't bullshit me. I notice it right away if it's something that i've looked into. I can tell when people are muddling through (i'm much better at it than most people) and i have no regard for your story if you make obvious factual inaccuracies. I have no problem if you want to look something up halfway through talking if it also means you're going to be correct.

**Bad story telling**. If you suck at delivery i'll let you know. Timing is important and it is very easy for me to understand the perspective of others - which makes it fairly simple to present information in an easily digested form. If you suck at delivery then i'll stop listening to you. This was one of the reasons i struggled in school and i never understood it until fairly recently.

**Stupid people**. Okay... call me an asshole. This is not every stupid people... sometimes stupid people are the nicest. But stupid people who don't understand that they are stupid... well... basically anything they say will likely irritate me.

**Excuses for inaction**. Nothing pisses me off quicker.

**Disregarding logic**. Okay this pisses me off quicker.

---

Oh right.. what do i like?!

Erm. The opposite of the above. Briefly listed likes;

* People who suspend judgement until they have a solid perception of the principle points of a topic.
* Factual accuracy. Tell me facts if you want... i don't read fiction anyway.
* Good story tellers. I'll let others grab attention if they are worthy.
* Smart people. As long as you're not a complete cunt then you likely deserve the air you're breathing and can contribute.
* Active people. Just do it.

It seems redundant to elect that i enjoy people who regard logic.I prefer to have the music on. And then i listen to the music instead of studying. I'm not sure that really counts.

When i'm at work i'll only listen to music if i don't need to concentrate and think about a solution.I'm picky!Note to self... don't send dick pics to INFPsI like what socioncs has to say for it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/2s6cp5/estp_socionics_mbti_descriptions_by_functions/?sort=new

For ESTP;

&gt; Si as ignoring function

&gt; The individual is adept at evaluating physical properties, states and sensations, but in these evaluations he gives priority to external factors and indicators and tends to ignore inner qualities and states. He gets impatient with those who stubbornly focus on maintaining physical rest and harmony, when progress requires change and shuffling of resources, and those who ignore the importance of the external material world in enabling oneself to attain one's goals. These types are well in tune with the physical world that surround them; they spend most of their time interacting with it, getting involved, learning new skills for its handling and management, while ignoring its inner essence.

So it doesn't bother me if someone else uses Si. That would hardly affect me.

---

Here's the Ne part;

&gt; Ne as role function

&gt; The individual is very aware of what is concretely present in the world around him rather than devoting his time to discussing what could be and topics that are only of improbable and vague ideational value. He relies on his direct "knowledge of life" and first hand experience rather than on imaginative flexibility.

---

Ni

&gt; Ni as suggestive/inferior/dual-seeking function

&gt; The individual is attracted to people who are confident in their ability to evaluate intangible trends, patterns, and cycles, and see where they might lead, and who know which course of events and actions will be meaningful and which will not.

**Well**... ^^^without ^^^some ^^^drug ^^^abuse ^^^and ^^^a ^^^healthy ^^^dose ^^^of ^^^risk ^^^or ^^^excitement **basically**, ^^^i ^^^become ^^^a ^^^frustrated ^^^thrill ^^^seeker ^^^who ^^^fucks ^^^with **everything**.I've had deja vu rarely but when it hits it just feels so fucking weird and sort of reminds me of a dream like state that can make my stomach turn.

Yea. Good stuff. Rarely would be like one time every 5 years or so.You can back up over here! ^^^beep ^^^beeep ^^^beep (gestures to reverse)&gt; what is Se?

Hi.

I'll list a few words that might help; focus, presentness, aesthetic, interception, timing, competition. Fun.

Impulse. Hedonism. Boredom. Stagnation.

Lots of words there that seem relevant to Se use!

&gt; It seems to me, in a way I can mimic Se

Everyone has some of it. My sister is ENFP and it always struck me that she was not quite as engaged or physical with the world.

My last gf was ENFP too and i tried over and over again to get her to stand on my skateboard. For fun. She did that one time. It was fun. Lasted, like, 5 seconds.

But she liked to read books! Something i just... can't... urgh... no... please.

Here's some other comments;

&gt; Although I had doubts about Fe (like, why would anyone go out of their way to help others?)

So i have a T preference but use Fe. It's my tertiary (relief function). Basically i find it destressing to make people laugh. I have logically resolved that this is some form of ego reinforcement.

Fe is mostly like... the emotional environment is more valuable to me than my own sense of inner emotion.

Here's a good way to compare it... if an ESTP has just been dumped and is feeling really sore. Take them to a comedy night and it will cheer them up. But perhaps a different type would not appreciate that.

&gt; I don't quite understand Ti, it's so damn abstract.

Ti invesitgates the principle point. The fundamental reason.

I'll try to give you an example; Oh wait... i just found [this again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OIKSe-4vI0) and it's kinda helpful to show the various functional axis and their interactions with others.Yeah, thank you! Si dom makes so much sense with Te aux explains the type of creativity i see here.

Edit; Hmm to be fair i could also understand ISFJThis *kind* of thing is one of the reasons i asked the quesition, haha :D

But i had not actually seen this, so thanks!Thank you this is wonderful :DI found this interdasting. Posted for comment.This is a great analysis thanks!

I have got to admit that despite the persona being percieved as introverted by the media ... he still stands on a stage and screams at people. Still puts himself out there. Is not shy to perform. I can certainly see this ssearching thing in the lyrics and it is one of the primary reasons i wondered about type.

Plus there is clear logic with songs like lateralus.

This also makes so much more sense considering the personal history. Joining the army and being highly active does suggest either Ne or Se dom to me.

&gt; his songs are pretty an example of NeTi e6

I can get behind this interpretation.

Something that i have noticed as a British guy is that it tends to be ESTP or ENTP characters (not always) that have actually listened to Tool in the UK.

But this is subjective and based on a small sample size of "people i know".Awwwww dammit. I'll go sharpen my knivess.Apparantly the ESTP isn't sure if you broke up or not! And it's cold out in the bushes.Bit coin *is* really useful.

&gt; Somehow I am not surprised 

I would never sell nudes. Nope. Never. Well myself maybe.Excessively talkative people can be neutered by listening to them and asking them questions about things they haven't considered.

Make the bastards think.I'm totally clean. But others might not see it that way.

I've stolen things but not recently or anything valuable. I smoke weed most days. I am rude to people if they irritate me. Probably the worst thing i've done this weekend, morally, is very mildly flirt with a old friend from school.

But that depends on if you consider it morally worse to do that and allude to flirty naughty cheating... or to jack off to pirated pornography. Which i also did this weekend. I guess it depends on the porn.

I used to break the speed limit when i felt like it. But now i do not drive (metropolitan lifestyle).

I will never drink and drive but i think it's fine to smoke weed and drive.

Earlier in the week i tipped a bin upside down to remove food waste from the recycling trash. I did this in front of another house mate to make a point and be annoying about it. I do tend to irritate people if i feel like itt. Some might see that as morally dubious.hmmm, [not bad](https://i.imgflip.com/11ci0m.jpg)I'm fairly certain that when it comes to political philosophy ... this S type would rape the debate.

All my friends have described me as extremely anti-authoritarian. And this is true. But i am not a lefty.

[Political compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/test) in case anyone wants to take sides![FYI](http://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/science_of_cooking/about_taste.htm) there's more than a binary choice for a wider demographic (covering a larger potion of the world).

The salt vs sweet palette is a western thing (in my opinion).

By the way one of my favourite things to order in Amsterdam is pancakes with bacon and maple syrup. But they fucking fail at maple syrup over there.I have a friend who i believe is ISTP. We are very alike and work well together in video games; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctT-eNcvgnc

Discalimer; He could be another type (possible ENTP or ESTP) but it does strike me that this person has Se rather than Ne and i don't think ESTP fits. But we might just be two ESTPs.

Anyway... We have the occassional disagreement. That statement would make us both laugh... Here's the deal... We can both process logic but sometimes we have nuanced interpretations of the principle point.

A traditional argument that doesn't progress and has become an "in-joke" ... Dog's are, in fact, lactose intolerant and do not produce lactose. This is a point of disagreement.

Right... So inferior Fe... My friend tends to get extremely frustrated and begins to lecture / rant. He may also lash out with personal attacks. He may repeat the same information over and over. He is visibily agitated and often insulting when in this state. And i can relate to this but i still find it much easier to stay calm.

I consider the highly emotional parts to be inferior Fe expressing frustration. There will be some disregarded logic in our disagreement. I have also seen that the emotion vanishes immediately if an opposing view no longer cares about the debate. The ISTP returns to normal discourse almost effortlessly. Likewise i feel the same aspects of this confontation but i think i have more patience or something. I am able to stay calm in most arguments and prefer to only intimidate when i dislike the person rather than with a friend.

I consider myself to have more control over my Fe and less control over my Ni - which is the reason i believe my friend to be ISTP. Plus he's a cold hearted bastard and fairly witty, harsh language... cool... which fits the streotype.

Pinch of salt time; Inferior Fe can be hyper emotional but this person also openly acknowledges that they repress emotion. I've been through some fairly open discussions with this person too. Venting away about personal frustrations. I have echo'd a similar sentiment myself ... but not to the degree of recommending to other that they repress their feelings. I don't despise feelings and that wouldn't benefit me as much.I have often wondered if an INFJ would get into a fight if they felt like it was the correct thing to do.

I think everyone has the potential to be violent but this type seems to be the closest to a "medic" class of personality. But then again... stereotypes are often wide of the mark. I am not a car salesman.I'm not sorry.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwsOdsxDZh0

Perhaps other types don't relate to this so much?My sister (ENFP) recommended me the TV show because she thinks i'm very much like the main character (INTP).

I'm not that good at hacking but i do frequently get high and can be a bit broody if unhappy about something.

I guess my sister knows that i have *access* to hackers via the dark net and so she thinks i am the same as a hacker. Color of hat is hardly something that she would consider.

So yeah... i read that the main character was INTP. Not sure if that fits. But i think the difference is that i would black hat if i had the Mr Robot skills and he appears to be a ~~white~~ grey hat.&gt; since I'm sure that I use Fe and that I'm an introvert. 

Yeah well that's the nature of Ti. If you use Fe but have a T preference (like ESTP) then you might believe you are introverted.

Because i do / did.

And actually i might be introverted because it does make me nervous to stand in front of 200+ people and give a presentation. Sort of excited nervous. Adrenaline... yeah ... ok whatever.

&gt; Possible social anxiety.

A functional description of ssocial anxiety; people make you uncomfortable. Your psyche evaluates this as "nothing wrong with me" ... "maybe those guys feel uncomfortable because they don't like me".

It's projection. You project the uncomfortable feeling onto others such that it can be criticised and with social anxiety the psyche evaluates (usually due to low self esteem) that those people who cause you discomfort (because of your own hang ups) are hostile.

This is incredibly common in teenagers, and i think this is due to the typical social structures of educational establishments. Schoolyard politics.

&gt; My reasoning keeps going in circles when I try to type myself.

Ti seeks accuracy.

&gt; I'll think IxTP but remember how I could never tell the truth as a kid if it would be harsh because I couldn't bear hurting someone else

Have you considered ESTP? Lying for whatever reason is an example of "on-the-spot" problem solving. I used to lie for all sorts of reasons when i was growing up - but in retrospect i realise that i wass learning boundaries.

"What can i get away with?"

&gt; As I've gotten older I've kinda closed off and gotten more cynical

Sounds like ISTP / INTP but im not sure that either would care as much. So how bout that INFJ?!

&gt; I'm great with spotting out inconsistencies.

Suggests Se over Ne.

&gt; ISTP= I'm not at all an active person.

You misunderstand what Se is. It is boredom if you are in a stagnant room. It is a keen understanding of the timing required to intercept a football / shoot someone in a video game. It is the impulsive itch that needs to be scratched. Aesthetic quality pleases Se but novelty value pleases Ne.

Ne desires to explore and has trouble assigning weight to the options.

Se desires experience and has trouble considering all the options before making a decision or taking action.

&gt; I still consider it because I fucking love fashion, I love everything sensory about music, I draw very realistically &amp; with a lot of detail, and I'm honestly a hedonist. I like Se.

Oh *high* there. Yeah it may be worth considering Se dom or Se aux if you can openly acknowledge your own hedonism.

&gt; Ever since this sort of existential crisis I had at 14, my philosophy has very much been "do what you want, we're dying anyways, fuck anyone who tries to tell you to that you can't enjoy yourself just because it might be against their personal values".

ESTP as fuck. And this shift of perception happened to me at the same age. I think it has something to do with puberty... I was truley happy at 15 and i had everything i felt like i needed (girlfriend, weekend job, guitar, video game console, BMX).

&gt; INFJ= If I am an INFJ, I'm a very unhealthy one. Chronic Se grip.

Interesting possibility. Take a look at [this article](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/133090287772/accurate-typing-tertiary-temptation) and see if it helps to discern you type better.

The tertiary is something that can be identified quite easily because it is the relief function. This is especially useful (in my opinion) to identify E vs I since the tertiary will be extraverted for extraverts and introverted for introverts (hence the typical question about seeking stress relief - "do you prefer a party or a book?" ... etc).

&gt; I only consider this because if I am naturally an SP, wouldn't I be better at getting up and doing things instead of just being inactive and doing things only because they feel good? I know that being this lazy will get me nowhere good, and I see how it will affect me later in life, but for some reason I can't bring myself to care and do anything about it.

Se does what it wants to do. I've been a fat nerd who plays video games and doesn't have a six pack. I played world of warcraft for 4 years, smoked weed constantly and ordered lots of dominoes pizza. This is part of the Se thing.

I have spent a lifetime doing what i wanted to do when i wanted to do it and arguing with anyone that tries to pervert my goal. I think it is the Ni side of the axis that makes the decisions and Se *enables* you.

Having said that i've spent time gripping my inferior and during that time i was not emnabled by Se. It was taking a backseat untill my ego got back into gear. This happened as a result of people reacting to my personality in video games and basically appreciating me.

But here's the thing; i quit playing games and changed my environment. Se is very much affected by environment and this changed my habits... So now i'm skating frequently instead of playing video games and i don't look like a lazy person. (what i mean by that is i lost weight and gained muscle due to more active lifestyle). The consistent part is that Se compells me to do shit because i get bored. The shit i do doesn't necessarily have to be SPORTS... but doing physical activity does clear my mind of distracting thoughts.

I will sometimes pace around if i'm working out a solution to a problem.

When i go skating my mind is very calm and clear. That might be the objective for going skating in the first place. It certainly was the reason i buried myself in video games.

It's the same when i listen to music or play guitar. You mentioned music. Music is a huge part of my life.

&gt; But I relate to Fe, and if it's not my fourth then it's my second.

Reconsider it as tertiary. Since you are a Ti user you will be prone to the resolution that you are introverted becasue your logic is internal - thus when you're "solving" it is inside your head.

But you should observe how you tackle a situation in the environment. *How good are you in an emergency?*

I'm very good at improvisation. That doesn't make me a stand up comedian... but i can usually make the best of a bad situation and have used this extensively in video games to direct teams and provide advice on tactics or engagements.

&gt; I'm shit at improvising and I feel way more comfortable with a plan before going into things.

But are you really? Or does it just push you outside of your confort zone. There is a difference between being bad at something and being uncomfortable doing something that you're actually not bad at.

But yeah this smells of ISTP. However you're not a cold hearted hastard so i would consider this anomaly to be your own personal reinforcement of "i am introverted". Which is not necessarily accurate.

&gt; I sometimes sugarcoat the truth because I don't want to hurt anyone. If I ever feel like I have, my heart sinks. I despise anyone who makes fun of underdogs. But fuck if I ain't emotionally closed off.

&gt; I wish I were more affectionate

&gt; I feel like an asshole for never being able to reciprocate

Okay so this is what happens with Fe in the lower areas of the stack. You need other people... but you kinda resent needing other people.

Been there.

&gt; Sorry for that massive wall of text

So do you wanna go get a beer... or what? ;)I actually think ESTP and ISTP are the closest two types. But that'ss because i think i'm ISTP but people tell me i'm ESTP.Ahh you'll probably doubt it again in under an hour! I think that's a Ti users curse. Maybe just aux Ti.

Have some fancy sounding [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vluBFWv4mE) to ponder your existence :)Thanks, i did not know this!

And i stopped off at [wikiperdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path) for to better understand what you were saying.

Part of the reason i did this research was to avoid getting a satanic mark (tattoo)!&gt; Everyone has a dark side, but it's better to be cognizant of it rather than ignorant of it.

One of the themes of duality and theology that i've been stuggling with is that original depiction of knowledge gifted to us by satan. There are many situations in modern media where good and evil are confused.

It is something we repeat and the confusion isn't always deliberate... but we end up with "The Light" and "The Light Giver"... With one of those being god and the other being satan (or prometheus).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_and_Prometheus

It is interesting to reflect on what this means when considering the interpretation of a relationship between ego and shadow. The way that our psyche can trick us!

How much of our nature is repressed at this stage of evolution?

Anyway... i am looking into combining many of these elements into a [snake tatto](http://media.tumblr.com/64b50d89817160ef9a6ae88d04e3049b/tumblr_inline_mlnyzaPf1A1qz4rgp.gif)

for me this represents duality, ouroborus, and loki the tricksterErm yeah that's ESTP.

What can i say?

&gt; they stereotypically enjoy team sports

i'm good at them... don't really care that much to be honest and would rather work on my solo performance in gaming

but i almost always end up working in a team - and i am good at it

&gt; I mostly played games at home, mostly Runescape and flash games, like addictinggames, andkon, and Stepmania.

Uh huh. Let me guess... you get bored easily and these things occupy your mind.

&gt; Also, always been motivated by social status and showing off.

This is why i learnt guitar. Also because i was told i wouldn't be able to play it. But showing off is also why i sometimes lied growing up. And I would show off on a BMX since i leart how to make bikes jump on ramps pretty convincingly. I could easily clear a set of three drain covers...

I actually blew th back tire on a mountain bike earlier in the week doing that again for the first time in over a decade.

Some bus driver saw me and loved it... massive grin he had and i passed him a few times to ramp off the speed bumps.

&gt; However, I began to withdraw in high school

This might be stress related.

&gt; Thought I was for sure introverted, but realized that I recharge when around others, rather than staying alone.

Sounds familiar.

I've described it like this before... "i resent the fact that other people give me stress relief"

The nature of Ti will cause you to *think* you are introverted ... because when you are thinking it's all internal.

But how good are you at getting away with shit? Improvising, making amends, excuses, bargaining, negotiating...

One of the biggest problems with MBTI is that people focus too much on the ridgid stereotype.

ESTPs can be fat nerds.

Edited for clarity.Welcome to the club.

[Read this](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP_per.html) and it will either confirm your type and give you some good advice or make you reconsider another type.

This page may look old and shit... but it's one of the best (and oldest) resources. This page made me accept MBTI as legit.&gt; I don't "think" I'm too susceptible to Fi-explosions/emotional stonewalling (or too many value judgements) in debate, but that's definitely my own bias talking.

You sound like a complete pussy.

&gt; Help a brother out?

Do you eat dick?

...

This doesn't really work if you're expecting me to try and hurt your feelings. ^^^I ^^^do ^^^genuinely ^^^hate ^^^you ^^^now.Bullshit. Logic is subjective and a person may use Ti without ever having access to information to validate accuracy. This would cause the personality some distress and validation is important for Ti users to move forward.

&gt; Not to mention that most relationship problems stem from financial concerns which the aforementioned aptitude for business would often remedy.

Se-Ti would like to know how much the drugs you're selling cost and what they do exactly.

&gt; feelers lead with functions which are traditionally seen as less effective at putting "food on the table" or creating a provider / breadwinner

&gt; the feeling type would end up having to continuously rely on their inferior functions (and the frustrations that come with them) in order to keep their head above water. On the other hand thinkers would need only rely on their dominant or auxiliary function to reach the same destination.

I get very stressed out in educational establishments which makess it difficult to get a qualification.

&gt; This means that in theory the thinker type could go through their entire lives without ever being forced to develop their tertiary / inferior functions: a luxury a feeling type would not be able to afford.

It is true that i have not *needed* to develop my lower functions ... however they are serving a particular purpose and it's a bad mental model to assume that people would have a volition in their access to these functions.

I cannot prevent the effect Ni and Fe have on my life. These functions dictate much of my decisions without me really knowing about it. Contrary to the way i would problem solve with Se-Ti... which is very conscious.

Part of the model that the function stack describes is layers of conscious control. This is why it's quite effective to type people on the spot by looking for their tertiary (or "relief") function. You can probe this fairly quickly in conversation by asssking people what they do to relieve stress... and this question can be presented in many different ways to achieve the goal of identifying a tertiary or dominant function.

---

Overall i would say this it seems like you have made a conslusion and then tried to fit evidence to that conclusion.

I would recommend that you observe the natural cherry picking processs in your sources - people will not necessarily volunteer if they have had a bad time. Thinking types are potentially less likely to share their bad times. Why? ...

A counter proposal for your consideration; Feelers are generally better at connecting with others and they are able to solve their problems more effectively as a result of these connections. Thinkers are more likely to try and solve their problems themselves which may or may not be more effective - this is a subjective quality for both.

Anyway the problem with forum sourced evidence is that the sample is likely weighted. It may make it unrepresentitive of the average experience of a T preference compared with an F preference personality.

If we were talking about video game balance then i would point out that both are sucessful models and this is observable in society. The vast majority of people exist in the same wage pockets... meaning that it's only the very top 1% or so who are vastly more sucessful - and there's not a huge correlation between T or F types since this top 1% includes all the celebrities as well as business folk.Oh right... the wording is very leading in the principle delivery.

See... i can't help the Ni effect where i get this hunch. And i address it. Sometimes it's wrong. It modulates my interaction regardless of Se-Ti.

And if you look at the ESTP eprsonal development apge it specifically says i should observe the way other people feel and *not* ignore that. Hence why i have acknowledged that i had a bad hunch.

Okay i'm starting the get circular. Need to go outside.Can't i just send you my favourite dickpic?It's a HD camera.Take a butchers at [this 'un](http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTP_per.html)Yup, it's that guy :D

[Gardening on salvia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVllL4tNZsI)

[Driving on salvia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnwS5sPOzb0)Hah... funny fact... the action the thing that made me consider posting this thread was returning "Little Miss Sunshine" to someone in my house!

I'm fairly certain that i've never watched gone with the wind. I don't really know what it is about... But if we got drunk and went all "mystery science theatre 3000" on it then i'm sure i could into it.

&gt; Omg I'm getting pumped about this plan

London ;)&gt; If we were going to watch together, I'd say Gone With The Wind. It's super long (more time together!), and you don't really have to pay close attention to it, which opens us up for talking and making fun of the movie as we feel like it.

Hhhhmmmmmmm. I have something else that's super long ... it requires *close* attention but that doesn't exclude talking and making fun!

I actually didn't watch Little Miss Sunshine. I returned it because i've had it for a couple of months now and didn't find the time!

And i'm actually pretty terrible at sitting through a whole movie. I fell asleep in the cinema during the last James Bond film. Perhaps it's because i smoke weed all the time and cinemas are dark, warm comfortable places with couchy seats.

&gt; Careful, I've had the travel bug lately! ;)

Meanwhile i sprained my ankle last week! I'm finally immobile. Nah nto really... went out to the club on MDMA on sunday night. Boom. Fuck going to work.

\\o/&gt; My last diagnosis had me at ISTP but I immediately noped out of there when most of the people seemed boring as hell typical manly men types. Ew.

Separate the image from teh personality. Also the thing that you dislike is the ridgid stereotype not MBTI. Read about the functions and form your own understanding of what that meanss for the varous types.

Because stereotypes are subjective.

I have often considered ssome form of N type. I actually tend towards INTP and even my sister thinks my *image* is akin to INTP but she has to admit that my behaviour and ideas are more ESTP.

I dislike speculation being the primary difference... but (for me at least) thesse types seem similar enough in their general disposition that a reclusive or frequently stoned ESTP may appear fairly similar to an INTP.

But then whenever i act like an asshole i consider ISTP myself.

At the same time if i feel very emotiona about something (like relationships) then maybe i *feel* a bit INFJ or ENFJ since focusing on my feelingss pretty much disables Ti... or at least... if i'm confused and need to vent my Ti shuts down until i've finished venting.

&gt; DAE have no idea what type they are? Btw I think I figured out I prefer T over F even though thats contrary to my previous posts. I feel significantly better identifying this way.

&gt; I'm so obsessed that I cant figure it out myself and it bothers me.

I'm fairly confident of my type as ESTP. **Edit**; Why? - becasuse i've looked at the even keel... i have considerd my *normal* and average behavior... i have looked at my childhood and history of preferences... rather than my reaction to any recent circumstance.

Recent events can still be processing and this may mean that you misinterpret the effect you have had or the event has had on you. Distant events that you remeber for years and years are a better way to estimate your congitive processes. Your mind has had plenty of time to process all the information and settle on its perceptions and judgements. This should make it easier to discern what they are in comparison to other people much more easily than comparing a recent or extreme life event to someone else's experience.

I'm fairly confident that you are a Ti user and it may be worth considering it in either dominant or auxilliary position. Because you're grinding gears over accuracy.

&gt; I almost immediately back out of it after I learn how the other types "like" me are.

Is that because you don't like to be put into a category?

If you're able to find lots of reasons to disagree with the typing then you should read about personal development instead.

These pages are more useful (than a stereotype description) for confirming your type because the advice here actually engages with the functions. It is functional advice and for that reason alone i find it far more useful to me.

I have linked a couple that i feel you should compare.

https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISTP_per.html

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ENTP_per.html

You should specifically look at the purported strengths and weaknesses and look at your own level of personal development. See how far you identify with the text and you may be able to narrow down the scope of potential types that you could be.

I linkd ISTP because you declared it as you most recent diagnosis.

I linked ENTP because i think you might have the dominant Ne problem of not assigning a Ti weighting to the options you can think up.

Do you feel like ADHD or ADD has ever been a problem in your life?

Do you find it hard to focus on a task or hard to see a task through to completion... or neither.The ENTP was playing devils advocate anyway.

Stereotypes are subjective... this is a way to conflate the two perspectives using semantics and leaves the "devils advocate" less opportunity to disagree.

I frequently debate with an ENTP (it's great mental exercise).Avoiding boredom.[This is my current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DptqlP9PYXc&amp;list=PLlVBiZI7cjxgkbxFLHXUAIKE6tg9dN5aI) stress relief playlist. I have a sprained ankle at the moment so i can't go skating.

[This is my skating](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVBiZI7cjxhYcNWGNk1krZhCE1cj6yAR) playlist.

I [rip](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/) the songs off youtube and put them on my phone as mp3's

&gt; I can lash out and become destructive, even though all I need is to comprehend my own emotions and express myself properly, and I tend to focus on the faults of other before acknowledging my own.

I get you. I know another ENTP who also lashes out sometimes.

You need to share and vent. When you have a conflict inside you it will become easier to think your way through it if you have complained to someone about it. You'll feel like a bit of a bitch doing that and i recommend that you ignore any guidance that comes your way... you only need to vent it out so that you can think properly.I like Dario Nardis work and don't really buy into the criticism of him being a "conceited" snake oil salesman. I've postted on this forum about him and there was mixed reception that i didn't see as reasonable considering there is no public research on MBTI.

He is an academic primarily so i find it hard to believe he would falsify data.

I bought the guys book and flipped through it. I'm happy with the method and found the conclusions interesting albeit not surprising.I sparined my ankle by slipping whilst skating and sort of rolling the foot over. I have a distinct memory of this moment when my brain went "THAT IS NOT CORRECT" and it's because my foot was kinda too far upside down.

Meh... It's been a week and i'm very bored of it now.

The club was fun but lots of guys there ... sausage ratio was quite high ... and nobody wanted to chat much. But i didn't really care about that cos of music and pretty lights.

MDMA is great if it's clean and you stay hydrated. I didn't really have a come down since i just smoked weed and slept some. I did crash and vomit before going to bed tho but i consider that fairly light compared with drinking.

Erowid is the best resource for information regarding the use of drugs (in my opinion) - https://erowid.org/experiences/exp_list.shtml

I don't like the self help focused shite that perpetually paint drug use in a negative light because i find their recommendations potentially dangerous.

I've been told to use 5HTP after MDMA to avoid a bad come down but i didn't bother. There was no need. I barely needed sunglasses.

Edit; have chewing gum if you're gonna go rolling!It's more "wordy" like this ; stereotypes elect a subjective perception of a general class and therefore can only account for a percentage of all those who do fall into the group.

I.e. the use of stereotypes can be misleading because they are derived from functional descriptions but (like everything in mbti) do not account for personal life circumstances or an individuals knoweldge.

&gt; One isn't as likely to notice a relaxed, intelligent, pragmatic STP that isn't obnoxious/SPORTS so wouldn't they have a tougher time being factored in?

And xSTP with no legs is unlikely to be a sportsman. But they may have other discernable traits that can be attributed to stereotype. However a strict interpretation of the stereotype would be misleading.

Wrap your devils advocate around that one :)

Okay i just felt like saying that ... where i actually just agree with you.These are all behaviours without a foundation of understanding the preferences taht lead to the decision.

For that reason we cannot accurately type this person.

Plus a self-administered tesst may have between 40-100 question which evoke those preferences.

By comparison your brief single paragraph is a shot in the dark. Sorry for being blunt.&gt; If it gets too complicated I start stressing out pretty badly

Do you mean comittment?

Are you prone to feeling trapped because that smells of ESTP to me.

&gt; I usually weigh all possible options but if that doesnt work and I cant see or know the answer it bothers the ever living hell out of me.

This sounds xSTP. But i would suggest tertiary Ni rather than tertiary Fe.

Take a look [here](http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/133090287772/accurate-typing-tertiary-temptation) - this page "Accurate Typing; Tertiary Temptation" identifies the common features of tertiary function preferences. It's useful for comfirming type because this part of the stack is more subconscious and this makes it easier to match a perference and type across a diverse sample of individuals.Holy shit tthe estp one nailed it.See if this helps you to identify some functions

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/48x9m8/my_analysis_of_functions/throw some drug references i there and its fine for ESTP.The road eternal sounds like heaven.

Dominion ssounds like being a god.

Hunter sounds fun as hell!They are not considered rare in my estimation.

I suspect the statistics you looked at were the "official" ones... They are US only and the tests were taken at work - where people have a tendency to alter their responses in order to gain approval.

Looking at more modern sample groups shows that there is close to a 50-50 split between N and S types (along with the other dichotomies).

The results are only skewed if you treat that sample as if it were a good sample of general population - but it is not because it doesn't include a hole bunch of creative careers. I doubt that many musicians / politicians / celebrities / lawyers / accountants are required to take an MBTI test at any point in their work careers.Bad statistics. Those official figures depicting this weighting of S vs N are not current (they are old enough that the tests are more accurate now) and they never should have been applicable to general population. They are almost ubiquitously office workers. Which kind of explains the heavy Si weighting.

Meanwhile your average Se dom is on a football pitch / stage or in front of a video camera.

Plus... if you look at a different sample group (taken in Europe and outside work places) it comes up as a 45-55 split between N and S types.Wasn't me either.ESTP "Just because you can doesn't mean... WAIT... STOP!"I have no idea what that means. But I agree with you.I might actually get a white T-shirt made with #KingSpoop on it.

I like that :D

Oh okay the first thing i think of is getting it put on a t-shirt... i get it now. Actions louder than hashtags.

Edit; I'll take #KingsPoop tooTo be fair that is a good one. I think of things and quickly decide what i want to do... I've often told peoople "i know what i want and i know how to get it".

So to give an example... i've been hesitant to get my eyes fixed with lazer surgery. But i will do it. I've been considering it for the best part of 10 years...

But i booked an appointment the other day because i felt like it.

It was finally time to book it in. Perhaps this doesn't sound very ESTP at all... but i thought you might like to compare notes. I never changed my mind or had second thoughts or anything like that... i just didn't book it until i wanted to do it. So it's like waiting for the impuulse to take action *at the time*.

Part of my confusion over typing was that i do sometimes ignore a problem. But this is an ESTP thing. Most of the time i quickly know and do what i want to do. But there are some things that affect me quite deeply and i tend to be more restrained with those decisions.

But it's not indecision.

Edited to add more and to explain my opinion.&gt; best decision of my life

I'm quite excited about the potential because i didn't really acknowledge how much physical activity i would *like* to do but didn't always take part due to contact sports and glasses / short sight.

Part of the reason for making my mind up is that i'm currently training skateboard. And i'm starting to get fit enough for long sessions but glasses won't stay on my face if i'm sweating this much.

It's funny to think about it. I've always enjoyed swimming and sports but i got into video games because of glasses.

Growing up i resented the typical ESTP stereotype. But due to envy... and i didn't really acknowledge that my eyesight was the reason until uderstanding my personality at a much later age. Those defense mechanism are built into your psyche. And ESTP can be quite arrogant! I decided that there was nothing wrong with my eyes or glasses and it has taken a while to overcome that.

Edited to rmove waffle.Here's a description of Se.

Driving late at night on a motorway that is fairly empty but not completely. And you are playing music.

Your attention is focused forward and you start to accelerate. It's darkness either side of your focus.

Go faster because you can.

Focus because it's easy.

The music starts to count the distance marks and you're getting *better*. Moving faster forwards.

It's not about getting there faster... it's about making the journey more exciting.

Plus this is one of my all time favourite things to do. But i don't ahve a car right now.Oh i dont really have much ambition. Just lots of projects.

For example i am trying to raise awareness that climate change correlates much more closely with sun activity than CO^2 concentration in the atmosphere.

However this topic is heavily censored on Reddit so i've given up for the time being. That is why i came back to /r/MBTI

I don't really care about winning. Many times i will not follow thru with a plan ... but that doesn't mean i didn't start doing stuff. Not following thru might mean not even starting for many folk.

Semantics.I'm paying attention to the vibration in the steering wheel. The music stops me getting bored. I will go into "flow" and focus becomes very intense. Sometimes i will focus only on my breathing (such as during endurance activitty) and moving forwards.

In this flow state i feel like i can react very quickly to changing conditions. It is not a super power - but it is easier for some people to achieve. And basically i am outside myself if i need to be. Very observant.

So when i had the opportunity and itt snowed i was in this state and driving on a slushy motorway. The wind was strong enough to divert the car and it made the whole ordeal quite sketchy. Edit; there was also enough slush on the ground tto be visible even at night time. So pulling into a empty lane was enough to make the car slide out.

How fast can you drive in these conditions?

I managed 65 mph. I overtook a whole line of cars at this speed in the slush and my car definately spent some time about 5-10 degrees sideways (not much) at 60 mph. I knew while this was happening that if the wind caught my car i *could* crash. I was mostly aware of the potential for over-correcting myself if the wind blew.

But that just made me focus more.

That is Se dom.

I get the same feeling when skating and risky injury. Sometimes in video games (but that thrill is beginning to pale). Roller coaster rides can give me the same feeling of focus without the control.But my regular driving is kind like yours... with more attention i guess.And you're not so big! ^(life ^^is ^^^unfair)Thanks this was very useful perspective.The video is 17 mins long. You've posted this after 5-6 mins.

I was specifically asking aboutt how you process the information in the video and not about your impresssion of Alex Jones. **Please address teh content not the character**.That's still your impression of the character rather than addresssing the content.

Would you like me to list the talking points? Would it make it easier to address how you feel about each talking point if i prompted you that way...

Let's isolate an example... they mentioned brexit in relation to the global world order and the rhetoric in the media... how do you feel about that? For a British guy (post brexit) it is quite revealing and evident.&gt; I disliked the excessive appeals to emotion and propagandesque style. However I was entertained and hyped by the good use of music, charismatic speaker and dramatized narrative.

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYwkXqL8LX0) is way better for meme style use of hype and music.

I don't mean to provoke - i just wanted to provide some contrast for your statement.That seems like hypocritical attitude. You couldn't possibly hope to contribute in a constructive way - yet you have asked a rhetoric question.

The purpose of discovery is addressed in the title.Your reaction is that you dismiss all talking points?

Thank you for being honest.What did you think of the conversation topic that you managed to sit thru?&gt; World War 3? Where the hell did that come from? Took you long but I got what I was looking for. Ehhh... That's obviously bullshit

http://www.anonews.co/brink-of-war/

Do you think that the video caused you some cognitive dissonance?

&gt; I thought. I then spent the outro thinking about a global government? What would be the drawbacks and benefits? Besides the crying from "loss of sovereignty", why would it be a problem? A small group controls us? I can see why that would be a problem, but it happens already, and will happen regardless.

It is the difference between democracy and autocracy. Are you familiar with human history?

&gt; Either way, We aren't going to have a global government soon.

Why do you consider that inevitable considering the scale of idealogical conflict between different faith beliefs, cultural beliefs and the variance of societal norms?

How do you see that happening with such diversity on the globe... or do you think it would require the destruction of individual liberty to achieve it?

(And if so - does that not concern you?)

---

Thanks you for your honest contribution and analysis of your thought process.This was an exercise in self analysis not a critique of the content. You were meantt to describe how the video and the ttalking points made you feel or think and how you reacted

&gt; Firstly there is no big global conspiracy to bring about a world order.

Value judgement. What if you are incorrect?

&gt; There are efforts to create more supernational cooperation and institutions for several reasons differing from project to project.

So you deny that it exists and then use semantics to describe globalisation as something that is good for me?

How deep are you into this rhetoric?

&gt; when dealing with powers like China, the US or Russia

This looks like a copy paste - because of the use of semantics. WHy do you not use words like "fostering positive relations with foreign nations"... but rather *dealing with them* in a passive aggressive statement.

Ths is EU doctrine. The passive aggressive references are easily identified. However what do you think the EU intends to do about the European workforce having their labour devalued by those entities?

Do you think they might get hotile?

Perhaps operate a protectionist industry?

Creating widespread economic stagnation and youth unemployment.

Edit; funnily enough none of those things are "supernational cooperation" either so the agenda doesn't achieve it's goal.Yes [Trump is populism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvyg679bsg)... what do yout hink of this video which compares the US with Rome.

&gt; I don't really care about the talking points because they're all lies.

The part referencing brexit, racism and Farage is not a lie.

I'm interested in a contrast but you ahve not provided an example of why you believe these thigns are lies.Do you want to list them - i can assure you the brexit talking point was not bullshit.This is a judgement of the character not the content. Please address the content not the character.

&gt; I choose not to participate in these

Obviously bullshit since you commented a bunch of partisan crap that missed the point of this thread. This is a thread about self analysis - otherwise it's not mbti relevant.Pleasse address teh content (i.e. the talking points) not the character (Alex Jones).Fascism makes hollow promises in order to gain absolute control and mobilise the poluation in military conquest.

Fascism is responsible for 200,000,000 deaths.Please comment on the content not the character.&gt; because he makes me angry

You become irrational due to the way the truth makes you feel?

I can't help but promote this topic. I was unsucessful in raising a scientific debate on climate change on reddit and that has led me to believe that there are wider forces at work;

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fe/6d/6e/fe6d6efeb02ffb79f4eebd8dc4daefbd.jpg&gt; What wasn't conspiracy theory was based on lies

The part about Farage in relation to Brexit and the reaction of racist criticque is accurate - thiss is not conspiracy or lies.

If you would care to talk about public perception of a challenge to authority being labelled racist?

&gt; His points on brexit were as skewed as the rest of this video

I am British. I have specifically told you that the opponents to the EU were labelled racist despite no racist agenda.Thanks! :)I'm going by this; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism

Cherry pcking an example doesn't exclude the general trend. Also ignores that Franco went to war.Suggest one where an analysis of the reaction would be the main focus of the thread.What about controversial left wing figures?&gt; but this video is just 17 minutes of ominous claims, rhetoric, and scare tactics

Farage was labelled racist for Brexit despite the lack of a racist agenda.Kinda wanted to know how you process the information. Do you have any validation for that opinion?Naturally optimistic. Today is a bad day for me.If you're interested in politics check this out; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvyg679bsg

Power politics never changes. Only the pieces on teh board.&gt; Isn't it pretty typical in politics to attach an extreme and unsavory label to discredit a political purpose and decrease support for that individual?

It is considered unsporting to boo your opponents outside of the US. This can be observed at international sporting events. The rest of the world would consider the US status quo for competition to be distasteful.

&gt; Racist, fascist, socialist, communist, etc.

Democratic nationalists should probably be renamed national soicialists. Accuracy in labels is important!

&gt; so and so is conspiring with Russia (Clinton about Trump) or China (Trump about Clinton)

Politicians shuold be criticssed for detracting from the issue. I actually find it offensive when i watched the second presidential debate ... specifically the way that teh moderators of the debate were happy to enable distraction to occurr.

For me it sets Ni off going crazy about conceited agenda. My hunches! Those are MY hunches!

This has prompted me to promote the cause.

This is an example of the rhetoric that i find after Ni goes nuts and generates a hunch; https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fe/6d/6e/fe6d6efeb02ffb79f4eebd8dc4daefbd.jpgEw intellectual debate is not for /r/mbti

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvyg679bsgTake a look at this one; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvyg679bsg&gt; Full disclosure: I did not and will not watch this video.

Here's a different one; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvyg679bsg&gt; Jesus Christ

Allahu akbarHypocrite.

Literally everything in your comment here is hypocritical. This is not a text post thread ... there is no qualifier ... there is no "setting the scene" ... i posted the thread as a link directly to the video and asked people (in the title of he post) to contribute their self analysis of reaction to the content.

I did not make a text post to start this thread.

Personal opinion of the subject was uneccesary and discouraged from the start. **I intentionally linked a video that would evoke cognitive dissonance** and asked people to provide their self analysis of how their psyche processes the information.

Perhaps you found it very interesting *because* of the intended effect of causing cognitive dissonance or perhaps due to your psyche's (very obvious) defence mechanisms attemptig to reconcile that dissonance.&gt; I am an INTP. I have a tendency to hate authority and enjoy considering 'conspiracy theories.'

[I made this for you](http://i.imgur.com/2xx4iZv.png)!

I've recently been muted or banned / suspended for trying to raise a question about climate change on various subreddits.Check this out; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY

It's currently trending on YouTubeCheck this out; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IuJGHuIkzY

It's currently trending on YouTube at 5th place.Everyone is self aware. I would extend this to say that a Fi user is probably much more aware of how they feel than a Fe user.

You should frame or constrain the question to gain more insightful answers. Are you interested in a particular type of self awareness (emotional, physical, intellectual, ideological)?

If you were talking about self analysis then i would say xNFP is the least self aware. Buuuuuuuuut this is also why i gave the example of Fi vs Fe... i have a xNFP sister and she's a dozy woman.

But she can tell you right away how she feels about shit. I have to sit there working it out whilst i vent frustration.

However i am very good at self analysis in the moment. Like training myself to do something new. I am able to spot my mistakes and correct them quickly on the fly.**Ni as Leading Function**

As a base function, Ni generally manifests itself through a lack of direct attention to the world around oneself, and a sense of detachment or freedom from worldly affairs. This can lead to a highly developed imagination and very unique mental world, but it can also result in a great deal of laziness and apparent inactivity. Because the individual gets his or her primary information about the world through mindful simulation of events, a person with leading Ni may be able to thrive in situations where data are scarce, or where he or she lacks the usual prerequisite experience. However, this may also become a disadvantage if the person becomes overly reliant on his mental simulations while disregarding attaining actual experience in areas that interest him, turning down opportunities without trying them out which leads to boredom. The ability to transcend the axis of time and understand the cause and effect relationships that occur is also a feature, sometimes resulting in the ability to accurately predict general future trends and outcomes of certain events.

---

**Ni as creative function**

The individual likes to predict the further development of specific situations and topics that he is interested in. The individual applies his highly developed sense of vision not as an end in itself, but as a way of promoting the development of his more central interests and activities. After doing some observation the individual feels stretching and slowing down of intervals of time and receives flashes of insight into the workings of things. This allows individual to work with creatively with timing, knowing when to move forward and when to delay, however, he will mostly be perceptive of situations which need a delay and hesitate to move forward, sometimes missing opportunities which is are usually regrettable to him.

---

**Ni as Mobilizing Function**

The individual periodically needs outside advice of how a situation will develop into the future in order to know when and how to proceed. The individual takes actions without proper evaluations of their consequences which he is faced with later. As a result he becomes more cautious and attempts to slow down, but by himself he poorly sees when it's necessary to do so and when it is needed to proceed further, and thus can end up wasting his time and powers or creating undesirable result for himself. Without an outside reassurance and evaluation of his actions, encouragement when it is beneficial to proceed further (ESI) or which actions can lead to negative outcomes (LSI), the individual is inclined to either try to remain inactive and miss good opportunities or act immediately and sometimes impulsively in inopportune moments.

---

**Ni as suggestive/inferior/dual-seeking function**

The individual is attracted to people who are confident in their ability to evaluate intangible trends, patterns, and cycles, and see where they might lead, and who know which course of events and actions will be meaningful and which will not. The individual lives deeply submerged into the material aspect of his reality but has weak ability to grasp the meaning of the events in his life. He longs for a sense of greater meaning in his life beyond the immediately physical and enjoys the company of people who can shed some light on this for him and provide him with context and meaning for his actions.&gt; After finally getting to it and managing to solve it, or sometimes, it is getting near to solving it, there will be an urge to stop doing what I'm doing that will come out of nowhere. 
&gt; Anyway, I think it makes me feel like a very tiny existence that is not needed in this world, that I should just stop what I'm doing and do nothing, or something like that.

You don't want to complete the puzzle because finishing things is final? You would lose the moment.

You crave the intellectual stimulation of the puzzle and finding the solution but you also know that as soon as you have completed the puzzle you will be bored again?

This is what my empathy says based on your text. If i was in your situation it would be an attempt to extend the "flow" state on consciousness where your mind is stimulated?

This is speculation and not based on functions.When I was growing up I taught myself several things that would be useful to a spy. 

I can walk softly and control the noise of my steps. The strategy is to gradually shift weight and change footing if there is some "give" or flexibility in the floor (creakyness averted).

I can navigate my parents house in total darkness. I would actually keep my eyes shut for maximum night vision if I needed to open my eyes.

I can climb in and out of specific windows of that house without making noise. Most of that teqniquebis transferable. I have also used this to break in when accidentally locking myself out. I learned to open windows that restrict your arm reach due to the placement of handles. 

I can also pick locks with a kit or with a rake and paper clip.

I can also play poker.

However I cannot sneak downstairs as a teenager and fuck my gf on the sofa bed in the livingroom without the springs making shit loads of noise... waking my parents up. But it's waaaay too late by that point so I count that as mission accomplished.Originally it started like that! Very much this... but it kinda developed into a wide-gait thing to deal with creaky stairs... the most reliable part of the stair is either edge (avoiding the middle)... on flat ground i started using a rolling foot thing to keep momentum and speed it up and maintain contact / weight with the floor or to shift my weight forward more smoothly.

I have spent time analyzing this. It might come in handy one day - you never know when you're gonna have to silently creep through a room of dozy zombies!I don't think i actually read it... i just copypasta'd it from the side bar cos i was ~~bored~~ procrastinating at work.Actually... me dad's got the sneaky walker knack too... he's pretty good at stepping up to people and speaking before they've noticed his proximity...

Or maybe i should lock the door when i'm masturbating.ONE OF US ^ONE ^OF ^US ^^ONE ^^OF ^^US

[resistance *is* futile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A) :D

i latched onto some socionics and found it largely irrelevant i guess... most of what we do is aboveI don't really think enneagram is reliable because it's picking up on a subtle trend - esentially it's a measure of nuture. mbti is a measure of nature. and your state of mind can could easily be perturbed by the current evironment

for example at one point i scored type 1 - i was living in moms basement

i've scored type 7 fairly regularly - living by myself

but right now i score an 8 because i'm fustrated with the world for being shit - also living with someone who has issued physical threats / weak intimidationI just could not be bothered to read the article. But i wanted to comment to ask if there was anything *thrilling*.Fuzzy logic say xNFP but i'm leaning to ENFP.

The machine assinged INFP. I would assume that you took the test feeling a bit sad or stagnant... and it has the detailed specific triggers in the questions regarding your preference order.

You might be Fi dom. This area is the most mini-maxed stat. So this is suggestive of dominant or auxilliary function.

You also scored high for both Ni and Ne... My opinion is based on my own experience... I get [results with fairly strong Te and Ti](http://i.imgur.com/YhIMhim.png) - they both rate highly. This might make it suitable for the auxilliary position which supports the machine logic setting INFP.

Then we have the runner ups. Your combined score for T is higher than S. Which makes me lean toward ENFP. So i'm in two minds on your result but this is also because i don't really know if i am ESTP or ISTP.

I bought a [drum kit](https://vibbi.com/m/1343854974396701310_2692919838) last month so i'm not changing my flair yet.Oh thanks i'll find those bits!I thought i was ESTP... but i realise now that i'm an adult child. Apart from the conflict avoidance part.

&gt; how do we truly type ourselves and those around us when working with such a bias?

Your question could be rephrased "can we separate the nurture from the nature?" and i think this is tricky to do. I don't find enneagram particularly accurate because it is trying to detect a (potentially) subtle trend in nurture... but that could be easily overwritten by trends in nature or by the psyche actively compensating for one or both changeable aspects.

I think that it would be easier with some degree of neurology and empiricism - relating the physical structure of the brain to the rational model of MBTI and rational model of enneagram... this would enable a more reliable attempt at separating nature and nurture.

I do not think it's appropriate to try and separate nature and nurture using a purely rational model as i consider this the point of bias.Yeah clearly everyone's going to call Rick an ENTP because of the stereotype engineer thing and he creates things. But i'm fairly sure people haven't considered how much of a good fit xSTP is.

He's an alcoholic ... people drink for many different reasons but Rick seems to do it out of hedonism. His dialogue tends to be locked into the current context of his situation. His problem solving and improvisation sem to be core intellect. He doesn't spend much time designing or working thoughs our in the show... this naturally lends itself tto an xSTP persona (due to the medium). Much like an ESTP he doesn't care for social nicities - many of his interactions are ISTP cold and cool. Rick tends to cut through the bullshit regardless of who's feeling might get hurt. And he doesn't have someone bringing him back down to earth like an ENTP would *require*. 

Let's look at the inferior... Rick doesn't have inferior Si. He has inferior Ni. I don't feel like he would be such a good manipulator as an ENTP.

Rick is not a dreamer - the things he says *are* his reality. Therefore i do not consider him an intuitive type.

Suck it.

Also the Dad is an ENFP if i have ever seen one. Sorry... i'm not buying any other typing for Jerry. Actually feel a bit insulted that someone labelled him ESFP... Jerry is not Se dom. At all. I don't ever remember seeing him intoxicated or ... actually doing anything Se related. So fuck that shit.Thanks! I've been extremely frustrated lately... i sprained [my ankle](http://i.imgur.com/6ZXGmss.jpg) about 3 weeks ago... (warning; foot photo with added sweaty sock fluff).

It's still not good enough to skate on so i've been going out of my mind... and actually obsessing over the US election.

I haven't paid a great deal of attention to Morty in terms of personality - i guess that sounds silly... but i consider him to be the shadow of Rick. That would make him INFP (if he was INFJ their communication would be in tune and they would support each other more).

I've gone with dominant Ne and auxilliary Fi for Morty. This is as a result of knowing a few INFPs and seeing the moral streak attached to dreamy speculation. Also Morty is game for new things - a novelty seeker with an ESTP guardian actually *sounds* like a great duo for TV. The INFP must put up with the ESTP becasue of the situational comedy involved. Plus there was a part where Rick described Morty as a useful way to camouflage hiw brain waves... and i think that would require them to be proper "shadows" of each other (assuming Dario Nardi's neuroscience stuff is legit).

I've done less analysis of Summer. I would agree with Se dom Fi auxilliary. I think her and Morty share similar resolutions of Fi. Summer doesn't seem to be a N type either and she doesn't seem like a dreamy person at all (at least not compared with Morty). But this may be due to less screen time for this character. If you remember the episode where they watch their lives from another parrallel universe - it hink Summer is mostly using Se-Fi during this episode. You can also see some degree of Se-Fi in the episode where she works for Satan.

Beth... I actually think she's INFJ. But this might just be due to the interaction between her and Rick. She frequently is motivated from the position of a victim - but doesn't lack focus like Jerry. She has achieved a career that requires skill and intellect but she does it for emotional reasons.

She could also be ENFJ but i just don't see her being that warm. It's entirely possible that Beth might be ISFP. but i don't like ISTJ - her relationship with her father might make her look like an Si dom user but i don't see Si dom in much else of her interactions or preferences. Plus I want to assign Beth a type similar to Rick because i feel like it fits. ESTP father has nowhere to go and so he invades his INFJ daughters home ... and *she lets him*.

I also think that the combination of Jerry plus Beth (ENFP + INFJ) explains why they got together but are terrible as a couple. Their functions line up in a comedic shadow of each other; Ne Fi Te Si against Ni Fe Ti Se (if they used the same functions they would be more in tune and support each other but instead they tend to talk past each other and have serious communication issues).

That's all i got. Peace!

Edit - to table up the results;

Rick = ESTP

Morty = INFP

Summer = ESFP

Jerry = ENFP

Beth = INFJ&gt; while driving at night it feels like the streetlights and stoplights all take on this powerfully glowing aura ~~where all the colors tend to blur and vibrate~~

Oh hi there... i'd refer to this as being "in the zone". I also like to use night driving as a good example of this because it lends itself to the feeling. You have a focal point and everything else is peripheral.

Imagine a horse wearing blinkers... distraction goes down as focus goes up.

Driving is a tactile experience. You feel the vibration through the steering wheel - that might even lead you to imagine the environment vibrating together but i would consider a heightened attention to the tactile sensation.

&gt;  In that moment it just feels like everything is ok, and even right, and everything has to be exactly the way it is and for that moment I cannot fathom wanting it to be otherwise.

Yes.

I get this when i'm rocking out, skating, singing, playing guitar, in video games, driving... the only time i find it impossible to feel like this is when i'm at work (unlesss they've given me stuff to do and i've figured it out and finished in a fraction of the time before deadline).

&gt; It feels like actually being in the world for once, rather than outside it.

"Use the force, Luke"

&gt; Anyway, please share you experiences that might be similar

I could write a book. But i'm not that great at seeing things through.&gt; They're both really reckless.

Subjective. What is your point of comparison? I would suggest to you that there is a lot of diversity between people and you might be cherry picking an impression based on stereotype or observation of a limited sample.

&gt; Like they throw themselves at the thing they're orientated towards, with no concern for long term implications or past implications or whatever.

Would you call it reckless to have learned the guitar, bass, drums, how to sing and mix music?

I wouldn't call it reckless (i have a real job) ... but i certainly agree with your point about "throwing myself into an activity". I wanted to illustrate / reference what i think is your subjecttive judgement - it's not that i find it offensive but i can't help myself ... i can see the pretext. The assumption. It's part of my analytical approach to new information. My point is that there is not always a long term implication - or that the long term implication is the goal of my activity.

And i have noticed (so much more recently) that i usually reject new information and apply a nuace such that it fits into my Ti properly. Otherwise i'll forget it / dismiss it. This is why i sort of agree and disagree with you. But you should observe that this is a careful process of determination rather than reckless. I take information very seriously. Actions are not 

&gt; Ne entertains any and all ideas- it doesn't treat the exploration of certain ideas so seriously. It's not their ideas- it's just them wading through.

It is their ideas... and an observer might wade through them. But the Ne user doesn't necessarily assign an appropriate weight to these possibilities as this requires effort of Fi or Ti (internal judgement function).

&gt; Se does something similar but with the experience of the real world. This more exacting control, making things happen. "Who cares".

I see where you're going with this and it relates to the inferior rather than teh dominant side of the axis. Consider the effect of Ni for an Se user - this is the difference in determination.

The Ne user has Si and so they favor the novelty of things that are not the same as they have always been. An Se user is mostly preoccupied with how things are right now (Ni determination).

&gt; It encapsulates recklessness, and that's cool to me; you see lots of people being overly nervous or touchy about things. Like they need to become stronger, more assertive

I'd call it decisiveness but i get what you mean. The assertive quality is connected to Se-Ni and i have noticed that Ne-Si users will tend to explore past the point of necessity. This is why Se-Ni lends itself to action... the personality has already determined what it expects and so there is nothing left to do but dive in.

By comparison the Ne user may want to explore all the possiilities no matter how potetially irrelevant to the context. This naturally lends itself to a deeper thought process and less action taken.

This is my attempt to functionally explain the stereotypical N vs S for an extraverted type.

---

I'll give you a concrete example. Earlier in the year i witnessed a fight - it was a wet mud fight. One guy was tackled and wiping his face and his adversary took the oppotunity to *kick* him in the mouth.

This observation didn't require much thought on my behalf before i took action. I was offended by the action... It was unsporting. Cruel.

I marched up to the offender and yelled in his face... "what the fuck are you doing?" And i was ready to get physical. I would not say that Ni prevented me from being reckless here - but rather... it provided the determination to act immediately.

As i have matured... the effect of Ni to hold me back has lowered. I am more knowledgeable and less intimidated by past experience or the possibilities. I rely on my ability to discern how things are right now and move forwards from there. An Ne user might want to reference how things have been and past experiences before moving forwards. This is bad for me - if i sepnd too much time analysing how things used to be it will cause depression.

I am currently 32 years old.

Edited to include [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGnyaa5E5g) on critical thinking. Because an ENTP just linked it to me and i thought it was a pretty good way to describe how an Se user might bring an Ne user back down to earth by cutting through their speculative bullshit.My naming scheme is binary. Fuckable and Unfuckable.If those two things are guitar and bass then it's only really one thing!! :D

But stick with it... bearing in mind that our society and culture encourages the next generation to seek out their dream... and then punishes them for not choosing safe and secure jobs. (Paraphrased from some facebook post I read months ago)If you're located anywhere in the vicinity of London then you can call on me as a session guitarist! I'm not an expert tho but i've got close to 2 decades experience of messing about.

But really i would say that if you can handle a bass you probably have tthe finger strength for guitar chords (might hurt for a few months of practise). I'd say 3-6 months for being a rythym guitar and singng with a fair amount of competance.

That is based on my experience of picking it up at age 15. So it could be considered best case senario or something... i dunno

&gt; seems like a waste of effort

I learned guitar because i like sex (and drugs and rock n roll).

:)Oh yeah Beth seems INFJ to me because i've met several (that are) nurses and ... like ... i dunno she just feels INFJ to me. Logical but feely. Perceptive but not intense. She's a horse-doctor. There's a almost unspoken quality here that i've acknowledged about her personality. He interactions with Jerry can be misleading - but i'm assuming her shadow side comes out a bit when she's pissed at Jerry so she seems a little ESTPish.

I could be wrong but it fits with the rest of the picture for me.

Epic summer quote. Epic. Practicality mixed with perssonal values. Acttually those Morty rants are fucking epic too - and they are suggestive of a INFP finally speaking their mind when a boundary has been crossed.

&gt; fat finger syndrome times a thousand

In that case the only recommendation i can give ya is to make sure you're punishing your fingers by using the tips.

It might feel more natural for a bass player to use the pad of your finger tip but for the smaller strings try to use the very tip of your finger and chew those nails down first!

---

Arpeggios. love em. Fucking love the satisfaction of fingerwork... he said *suggestively*.

Hey! ... you can play guitar just fine - you perfectionist you.

That's a great song man. Gives me some Iron Maiden feels. Big time. I know that feeling when you're trying to put something down and you can hear all the mistakes.

Trust me when i say that no-one else can hear the mistakes.How old are you?And what is your phone number?Snap! Me too! That's puts you closer toward unfuckable just they mechanics. But I don't like to pass early judgement.

There are some Thai boygirls that make me feel *very* confused.

I just like to flirt.&gt; and fascism is a uniquely reactionary right-wing ideology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism

"Position in the political spectrum
Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational."

You are stereotyping based on the examples you know of fascism... rather than looking at the principle definition.

There are many example that you are not aware of that entertain lefty policies.&gt; I just believe in freedom, peace and prosperity, not shutting everyone out and either forcing them to agree with you or crucifying them.

Amen.&gt; I've heard the argument made that he's an ESTP living in an Ne universe

I really like that.&gt; I feel that it is important to clarify

Read the OPWell that's true, yeah. Tou che!No i just really like that bit. And i was reading whilst waiting for league queue. So i didn't finish yet.Yeah i know.I felt like shit posting. I literally wrote this whilst on the bog.Can you read the OP directly?

Also insults *do* have a coherent meaning behind them. A fuck wit is the same as a dickhead.Thank you.You are stereotyping based on the examples of fascism that you identify... but that doesn't have much to do with the principle and founding philosophy of this politic.

Let me use an analogy. You are very familiar with blue buckets.

But i'm trying to tell you yellow ones exist. I suggest you take a look at the political philosophy rather than just going with the assumption / status quo.Straw man fallacy.

&gt; Talking about right vs left means absolutely nothing if you also don't talk about the meaning behind the labels.

Is not a valid responce to 

&gt; Who gives a shit what he says about it?

You're appealing to an authority and misrepresenting what was said.

"nationalist authoritarian goals of creating a regulated economic structure to transform social relations within a modern, self-determined culture; and a political aesthetic of romantic symbolism, mass mobilization, a positive view of violence, and promotion of masculinity, youth and charismatic leadership."

This has nothing to do with conservative politics. **Conservative**.

It seems to me that you are unable to put authoritarian on the left. Please observe this political compass; https://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2016I'm proud of myself. If i found out i was a different type i'd carry on being me and take all my awesomeness over with me.

We should define what mbti is rather than let mbti define us.&gt; Fascism pretty much revolves around ultra-nationalism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism

**Position in the political spectrum**

Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational.

It is a centrist doctrine... hence why it's connected to SJW in the title and OP.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism

**Position in the political spectrum** 

Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational.Surely you can see that this was given as an example.

Freedom of speech only covers freedom of persecution by the government. But that doesn't mean a persson won't get offended if you assign them a label they disagree with.

I can still call you keyboard warrior if i don't apprecaite your motives for posting.

You do seem a bit ttriggered by the thread. Do you consider yourself a social justice warrior?

&gt; How do you reconcile eliminating a women's right to choose with the help of her doctor what is best to be done with a pregnancy.

I imagine that people who hold this belief simply don't reconcile that. I mean look at what you're asking... I might as well ask you if you think an unborn fetus should have rights and be protected by the state.

Or maybe it's a religious thing. But in any case your line if questioning is either terribly naive or fairly aggresive rhetorical interrogation.

&gt; Why should the state decide what she can do with an unborn child.

Because the fetus cannot make a decision and doesn't have a voice yet. Usually people investigate the opposing perspective *before* deciding which philosophy to support.

I can see that's not the case with you.

---

Also ... do you agree or disagree that BLM are violent?&gt;  The people attacking oil rigs on behalf of GreenPeace are SJWing it out, but they are not doing it to promote fascism

No you misunderstood me it hink - i was saying that SJW is a state of mind that mirrors fascism when you observe the methods of the SJW activists.

For example; hateful intolerance is commonplace with SJW rhetoric. And creating a social identity, etc... even the .... *stops writing* .... *reads post properly* ...

Oh nevermind the other shit... you actually answered the mbti part!

&gt; In typology sense, this thought process is weak Ni. It looks like a single connection based on one personal experience without a more comprehensive treatment of the issue, which is characteristic of 1-dimensional functions which for ESTP these are Ni and Fi.

Thank you. You're a legend. **This is the least boring post in the thread.**&gt; You consider fascism a combination of left and right because of what left and right mean in the US today.

No i consider it a centrist doctrine because i know what i'm talking about and have sstudied political philosophy.

Have you?

Also i'm British. I agree with the rest of your post - i just wanted to clarify that i'm not misguided in my interpretation of this political position... I'm aware that many of the common examples in western education are likely to allude that fascism is a right wing doctrine.

This is expected. Thanks you for commenting.But if you check out the bottom text - under the page break - it's actually a thread asking if this thought train is an example of S or N or ... like it's asking people to apply mbti functions to the text.

And also for shit posting.Well i can actually tell you what i did.

I mved all my shit into halls of residence (carrying stuff out of ads car) and bid my folks farewell. Others were still unpacking and i could see that people were feeling that "new" anxiety. I decided to introduce myself to people, grabbed a guitar and sat on the grass opposite the halls. I said hi to anyone who came near and asked them to sit with me.

I don't actually remeber if i was the first to sit down anymore. But i made good friends with the people who came to sit down.

6 of us lived together above a pub the next year wuthin walking distance of a few other houses with friends in.

&gt; What do you think the thought process of most personality type is like and where do they decide to sit?

I find that most people want something else to take the attention and this makes them feel more comfortable being themself - since people are paying less attention.

&gt; Who decides to sit next to the cute girl in the room and try to strike up a conversation?

Too bold. Learn guitar, be good at it, and let her come to you.

I found [this thing](http://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/08/what-each-myers-briggs-type-does-in-college/) which sort of talks about how the different types would act in class / college. But ya know.. it's **tabloid journalism at best**.

ESTP: Attends class for the sole purpose of maintaining their sports scholarship and/or fraternity presidency.

INFJ: Is consistently torn between their desire to earn straight As and their desire to lament over their latest existential crisis.

ISTP: Manages to completely flip their sleep schedule by the end of freshman year and is not seen in broad daylight again until graduation day.

INFP: Is enthralled to finally leave their small, conservative town and befriend other social justice enthusiasts whom they probably already know from tumblr.

ESTJ: Is that student at the front of the lecture hall who puts up their hand and answers a question that nobody asked, just to show that they did all the readings.

ISTJ: Borders on a heart attack every time an assignment is handed back without adequate explanation as to exactly why they didn‚Äôt achieve a higher mark.

ENFJ: Somehow gets straight 90s while also running several campus clubs and maintaining a serious relationship.

INTJ: Does all the required reading for the upcoming year over summer break and spends the remainder of the school year feeling vaguely annoyed with his or her classmates who just cannot seem to keep up.

ENTJ: Is only in school as a formality ‚Äì they‚Äôve already lined up several competitive post-graduation job offers.

INTP: Lands a job as a lab assistant in their first year and is not seen outside of said lab until fifteen years later when they graduate with a PhD or three.

ENTP: Goes to lectures for classes they‚Äôre not even in and plays devil‚Äôs advocate to everything the professor says, just for fun.

ISFJ: Spends four years taking care of their drunken roommates. Starts dating the person they‚Äôll eventually marry by the end of freshman year.

ESFJ: Sits in the front of every lecture hall, color-coding their notes using various highlighters and reminding you how much you don‚Äôt have your life together.

ISFP: Does a lot of drugs but nonetheless ends up landing a job in a creative field, earning more money than many of their high-achieving classmates.

ESFP: Probably coined the phrase, ‚ÄúWork hard, play hard‚Äù during their college years. Emphasis on the play hard.&gt; I'm just here to question your way of thinking.

Please don't presume my belief structure.

&gt; If anything it seems that you are more upset here.

I only ever post here whilst smoking weed or if i'm bored at work. Neither of those lend themself to emotion.

&gt; I wouldn't necessarily call myself a social justice warrior because I think that term is simply stupid and used more by people who like to say cuck more often than faggot back in the 2000's than people actually advocating for people who are underrepresented.

Interestingly this mirrors the way that fascism elects a specific identity to be criticised.

Are you saying that you dislike the term because it's used primarily by Jews?

This is a very intentional association. It's not to offend you but to give perspective on how i *do* actually think.

I associate the vapid ad hominem to be exactly how i described it there. Vapid (superfical) ad hominem (character attacks). And not a legitimate argument agianst.

This is actually somethign ESTPs are sensitive to (in my opinion). We don't like to accept a value judgement just because others do. It should be logically consistent.

---

&gt; advocating for people who are underrepresented.

**I wanted to draw specific attention to this**. It is an authoritarian position in terms of your political philosophy - but i do not expect you to realise that. The political spectrum has left and right but also up and down.

Up and down are opposites too. Collectivism (speaking for other people) is authoritarianism. Individualism (speaking for oneslf) is the principle of free democracy.

So essentially i'm trying to tell you that my problem with SJW's is that their value judgements (and forcing others to adopt them) are percieved as an attack on my free will and self determination. Which is counter-intuitive for anyone who believes in a social cause. Democracy doesn't need weight of numbers to achieve fair representation.

A common theme among progressive liberal movements is that they cannot elect a specifc person at fault.

And that makes change hard to achieve. So i view a lot of it as a complete waste of time / fabrication.

---

&gt; As for the rights of unborn fetuses, I have looked at both sides and determined for myself that I believe abortions at all times should be allowed.

To cut through the bullshit - because the mothers life is more important in this world at the time a decision must be made. And i agree with you. I am pro choice.

&gt; As far as BLM, I think that overall they aren't violent

Police are statistically less likely to shoot a black person for fear of being called racist. This is reflected in the satistics.

The fundamental irony of BLM is that most black peoplea re shot by other black people - it's a cultural issue and has nothing to do with instituion. The fact that it is a cultural issue leads to profiling but it's not the other way around. Profiling is a reaction not a motivator.

They are a misguided protesst and that has a harmful effect.

Did you know that they tried to build a movement in the UK? The UK statistics show that black deaths by polics forces are *under-represented* but they simply lied and skewed the numbers to try and gain support.

Problem for them is that British people check and basically our police force just errected white barriers around the protessters so they couldn't be seen anymore and waited for them to get bored before moving them out.

It was hilarious.https://www.politicalcompass.org/authleftbooks

&gt; There are nuances to different political groups and those should be discussed

Yes and if you read the OP you'll see my opinon of fascism / SJW. I think they are the same thing. But that the subject is too taboo for many to even debate.

The thing about socialism... is that *it's popular*. By definition.

If it's national socialsim.. well theat's what the Nazi's were called. So you see where i'm connecting it to social justive warriors... it's about the poluarity of the meme (the thought / attractiveness of the idea)... but i like to point out that the reality is a lie.If this thing was accurate i'm ESFP not ESTP.

Which would explain a lot.I was asking for scores! I said it wasn't for dick measuring because i thought nobody would ace that test. Or that nobody would want to reply.

I got 1 wrong. Can't remember which one. You didn't get one wrong. After 150 you need another test (a high range one). It's one reason why i'm assking for recommendations for another test. Maybe i shuld ahve specificed high range.

Do you think it's an accurate test? Would you recommend a test?Fair point. But i've always considered people bad at improvisation... and these things are a hoot for getting ma fix.

In other words... They probably invalid as a measure of general population due to diversity of ability. It's meaningless.Thanks, i was not aware of that and will look into it.Cos i'm arrogant about my ability to do stuff. But i'm also aware that 1 in 100 should beat me.

I'm also aware of the internet law of participation where roughly 1%comment.

I dunno man i'm just curious.

This is how estp works; either you like me as much as i do or i'll probably be annoying to you and also not care about that.

My life is easy.Glad that you agree. I thought it was a bad test... However i didn't think this one was accurate over 150.

Some kind of limit to the assesment. Good job. You broke it.Yeah well i know i'm a retard haha! So that's why i wanted to see what people experienced with this test.

I actually did the same as you. Which is weird. But i didn't want to bother with that detail in the OP.

Synchronicity?Hmmm. I see your point!Thanks i totally forgot about mensa. I'm obviously a powerful intellect (doh)

Honestly feel a bit silly nowThanks! Yep - i am a sself confessed retard... i completely forgot about mensa.Heh, did you find it accurate or funny or what? I got the feeling you were expressing frustrated agreement - but i wanted to check xDHaha, that comes across dejected ;p

Cheer up - everyone's jealous of your awesomeness!Check out [Mensa practice test](https://www.mensa.org.au/membership-information/practice-tests/practice-tests) and see if your ego deserves the massage?!

I had completely forgotten about them - and i do remember getting through one of these waaaay back. Long time ago. It did actually sort of confirm 99th percentile.

But that's only 1 in 100. So not super rare, right?

I don't really care about rarity. But individuality is important to me.Probably got lost in the bustle around campus.Yeah i gotta admit i was singing to myself all through the test... probably not a effective indicator.

And it's kinda short for a detailed assessment. Does it even have a timer?

I'm guessing that the nuace between like 125 and 128 is based on a timer but i didn't see one ticking. But then i do have a thing that blacks out the whitespace on most webpages.

My eyes. My delicate nerdy eyes!**Well this is the most Se dom confirming thing i've read.**

&gt; Nature intelligence types repeatedly scan their environment and are constantly updated on changes and new stimuli around them.

This is one of the primary "behavioral" things that led me to accept Se dom. I can't always describe my observations... but i notice lots of detail. People have been surprised about how much detail i notice.

I have been asked if i have a photographic memory. Which i don't. But i do tend to remember things in a visual way (so i'm kinda bad with names for example).

I don't think there's much subjectivity attached to these memories - so i resolved that my psyche uses Se over Si.

&gt; It also creates a stage wherever you go, as this function always tends to attract observers.

Yeah. If given the chance i'll be center of attention. I don't even mind being hated... it's like this... being ignored is the worst, then hated, then admired is best.

This is why i don't give a fuck when someone wants to start shit with me. I'm game. Bring it on - at least it's better than being bored and ignored.

I make an effort not to pick fights for the thrill of it (hardly telling the truth here - many people are aware of my recently provocative posting history).

&gt; Extroverted sensors spread an immersive and captivating, magnetic energy. It draws people to them.

I intentionally try to do this when i am excited. I don't really care what it takes to get your shit excited... but i'm gonna tease you if you're a grumpy fuck. Because you'll defend yourself... and then i've engaged you in a competition to make each other laugh at the ridiculousness of your grumpiness.

We're not dead yet.

&gt; And as a hedonist, you know when you are hungry, when you are tired, and when and how wounded you are.

This feels especially relevant to me.

&gt; No ‚ÄúWhat if I change my mind?‚Äù and no ‚ÄúAm I sure it‚Äôs not a trap?‚Äù It‚Äôs just going for what you want. Risks are weighed in automatically and extroverted sensing knows as it sees something if it is dangerous or if it is good.

Yeah it's hard to explain to people how i calculate risk... because it's not exactly an equation. It's just... something i know. I know what i'm capable of.

This actually means i spend a lot of time limiting myself because what i actually want to do is anarchy (sometimes).

&gt; Nature intelligence helps you remember things instinctively and associatively. If you pick up on a smell, or see something, it automatically makes you think of another familiar sense.

I was thinking about this yesterday after listening to this lyrics;

&gt; And then I catch myself

&gt; Catching your scent on someone else

&gt; In a crowded space

&gt; And it takes me somewhere I cannot quite place.

---

&gt; It‚Äôs driven by instincts, needs, craving, and hunger. As such, if the natural order is unfair, if the routine isn‚Äôt satisfying, the extroverted sensing type will discard it.

This is a fascinating way to describe it. I very much agree.

This is why Se dom can be a fast food junkie or an adrenaline junkie. I have been both. And this resonates with my life experience of "going against the grain"... i have spent a lot of time feeling that things were not fair and acting out as a result.

It is one of the reasons i am currently spending a lot of time in political conversations. Due to a sense of unfairness - which drives me to challenge the status quo.

But this really captures the essence of it. "If the routine isn't satisfying the extroverted sensing type with discard it".

That's perfect.

&gt; They always know how to draw the most satisfaction out of every situation. As such, extroverted sensors tend to be seen as full, self-satisfied and highly pleased types.

Disagree. I mean ... maybe that's what it looks like from outside.

Trust me ... beneath this optimistic and calm exterior is a raging bull with a hard-on. I can't always keep myself happy.

&gt; They describe things as they are ‚Äì in a crude, raw, and real way. This makes their stories more real and more engaging.

I like telling stories and i think i am good at it. I have written sections of a book and had fairly positive reactions to the text.

Also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/3yeeg9/my_estp_life/) ... just in case anyone here *hasn't* read my bullshit yet.

&gt; Extroverted sensors are always looking for the ‚Äúcurrent big thing.‚Äù

Yeah ... but all my friends are heathens, take it slow.Hey that just means you're picky!

So pick already :D&gt; No, he's very much Te.

Se-Ti emulates Te. I know this because it's part of that "flip-flop" tennis hop brain thing that we get told is our problem solving ability.

Gordan Ramsey 

&gt; get things done (Te) the right way (Fi)

I could point out that it makes more sense to use Se-Ti-Fe-Ni to get things done in the moment.

Fi takes time to go away and think about how it feels about things. Te is great at organizing logic in real time... but it's **not** improvisation due to that constraint of Fi.

Improvised logic is a hallmark of ESTP and i would differentiate that from the broader "organizing logic in real time".

I mean... surely you appreciate that ESTP is designed to do what Gordan Ramsey has done in his life. You are aware that he used to be a boxer? That's why his face is all wrinkly and shit.

&gt; Plus, I imagine an ESTP woud be too worried about people's perceptions of them (Fe) to build a tv career on losing their temper.

Erm. Donald Trump. HELLO?!

---

But fundamentally i think i should point out that Gordan Ramsey has based his current career path on taste and sensation, promotion, and fixing other peoples problems on tv.

This kinda lines up a better fit, at least for me, than your "he shouts to get things done = Te" concept.

I shout to get things done too. And when Ramsey is going on a rant i can literally follow his thoughts whilst he's doing it.

I know when he's going to tone it up or down - not from experience but because i'm watching the manipulation and putting myself into the perspective.

This doesn't really happen much unless the character i'm watching is quite ESTPish.

Gordan makes sense to me... therefore his functional preferences resonate with me.And stop.

\/thread

Edit; and how can an INFJ use it to survive? I guess ignore what Ni-Fe tells you and listen to Ti (relief) and Se (inferior)... but this might be challenging. People talk about "inferior grip" which is depression. It seems to be related to the dominant function shutting down.Hello Miss type, my names Mr Ree. Do you like to dance?!This also describes the tennis hop "two minds" an ESTP can be in when improvising.

Very common to see a ESTP cock a brow when they are in two minds of how to proceed. Also fairly common to see expressions on the face of an Fe user rather than a Fi user (especially inferior Fi).

However i do not disagree that it may be relevant to Te use. Since i think there's something funny about Se-Ti and straight Te anyway.

I think i find Te easy because my Se-Ti is very very fast.Only smile when you are happy... that's the secret to genuine smiles!

If you feel the social "requirement" to smile but don't actually feel happy... try using raised eyebrows. Surprised expressions are much more convincing - yet equally warm and can easily break into a smile. Also people (in friendly social environment) will tend to detract attention from someone that looks a bit surprised or try to smooth over the interaction.

A surprised face give people the impression that you're still judging the responce - they will naturally give you more time to be comfortable. This is entirely subjective opinion. I watch people. Closely. Sometimes from teh bushes.

Try not to scowl at people ;p&gt; But what if... I'm never happy

Change is good! FAiling that i'd get some brow exercise and practise my "rabbit in the headlights" look.

Another recommendation i would give you is to go for a crooked smile. Use half your mouth. I started doing this when i was quite young after feeling like my full smile was unattractive / intimidated people.

Yes i actually decided to start smiling lopsided.

Funnily enough this actually works. If you're only half amused give a half smile and let it fall off quickly. People can read that well (i can read that well) and it would encourage me to get a laugh out of you.

Ultimately tho this is an extenssion of the original principle of not smiling unless you're happy.

A half smile can convey a surprising diversity of emotion. Sadness (with eyebrows), coyness (with one eyebrow), confidence, sex, sex, sex...

Where was i.

&gt; it freaks me out since I am totally unaware of my facial expressions or body language when I talk to other people

Have you ever played poker? :)

Edit; a lopsided smile can also use some of the muscles for winking - and winking is something you can mimic... this is actually why i believe a lopsided smile is recieved as "cheeky". It uses your cheeks more that your lips. Winking is a sign of attraction. So a lopsided smile is considerably warmer than a regular smile in my book.Oh my god you've never ssseen Edward Scissorhands?!!

That film scared the living shit out of me when i was roughly 12 years old. THE LIVING SHIT. I actually didn't want to use the loo by myself after seeing that film in case i got my balls chopped off by hidden scissory hands.I woke up and had a joint right away. Now i'm going to browse reddit until i get bored and then do some work out.

Might go to the shops later or tidy up.

I don't have plans tonight. Chances are fairly high that i'll play video games, pratise drums, get high and possibly troll someone on reddit about man made climate change or the US election.

My life is a rollercoaster.&gt; Discipline has always been an issue for me. Activity of any kind, besides what I wanted in that exact moment, has always been an issue for me.

Sounds like your Se is working just fine.

*Just fine*.

&gt; I understand that I will never be able to buckle down and meticulously grind out the steps required to get what I want.

Oh right.. there's the Ni - yeah so like... Go with your gut rather than your head? I'm not sure how it would work for you but if i got with my gut i'm using Ni... if you go with your gut maybe you're using Se?

Is that how inferiors work? (open question to anyone).

&gt; and how can I grow into my bottom half in a way to thrive in a world dominated by S and Te? 

Well according to the ego development you should be aiming to avoid thinking in black and white extremes and use Ti to get more granular resolutions. Use Se to incorporate more concrete detail to your processes.

It might be useful to compare the ego development for your type and your duality (fromwhat i've read duality relationships are meant to be the more naturally fulfilling - sso i resolved that it pays to understand that functional perspective in order to recognise our unconscious).

http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/119869940302/mbti-development-estp&gt; So I have taken the test at 16personalities and it says that I'm an INFJ-T. Now I'm fine with it and can relate with everything INFJ but I've seen some people on here that criticize online tests and say we should let ourselves get typed by the community. So here I am, ready to collect my certification from the MBTI community. Type me!

I like the tests. People bitch because lots of people don't like the result that the test gave them - or they're bad as self analysis so they get variable results on the tests.

I admit that they might not be the best *for everyone*. But since your average person doesn't ahve access to neuroscanners and empirical test enivronments...

Well it's better (in my opinion) than "text typing" over a forum.

Something that i've recently been looking at (function dimensionality) can explain a lot of the mistyping that goes on. A one dimensiona function is weakly expressed int eh psyche but can cause the individual quite a lot of challenge - this means it can be over represented in text.

Or just generally over represented as the psyche struggles with a weak function that cannot handle more than one information stream.

It's a nice part of theory that supports my prejudice against forum style typology.

But then... i would have that bias, right? I would rather *observe* than read.

---

I didn't read the rest of your thing. But i'm sure you're a nice INFJ guy who probably wanted confirmation of your type. I'll read the rest now.

&gt; I feel a genuine need to help people in distress. And that's one of those few times I get to enjoy human contact. I don't expect anything from them in exchange (this is the important bit) and I do it because I feel empathy.

Theory confirmed.

&gt; These people usually look stunned and ask me how I derived that much data from something as irrelevant as art but I see the signs in their art. I can even look at my sister and tell if she's in pain and hiding something from me.

Did someone SHOUT Ni-Fe in my ear when i read that? Or what...

&gt; Rage is one hell of an anesthetic. I see red and I can't tell enemies from friends.

Inferior Se. When you get mad do you start to take action? Possibly irrational actions like not being able to tell teh difference between friend and foe. Yeah ... well - i'm just saying that i can cherry pick statements.

I still trust the test more than forum typology.Guilty is empathy?

Look i smoke a lot of weed you might need to slow it down for me with this feely talk.

I'm just spit balling. If nobody undersxtands wtf i'm talking about that's cool. Just means i'm gonna ask it a different way in a few days time.

Win-win scenarios are the best suggestions to give estps

Communication is clearly as issue so rephrasing the entire thread after some thought could be useful. But then again. I'm not sure how much i care.

Shit. It's way past gym time.You might feel reassured to know i'm not a psychopath and the conflict is a resolution of loyalty rather than morality.

Or a lack of empathy.

An example of guilt without sorrow. A guilty pleasure. It's not that challenging really. I intentionally left the text describing the mechanics devoid of concrete example.

This is actually hard for me - so let's not apply subjectivity to it in post.

TLDR; why are you riding my dick right now?I just got in a strain called blue cheese, a mix of blueberry and "cheese" (a uk hydro evolved landrace)

https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-cheese

Aaaaaaaaaaaaand i'm completely baked. Need music. Brain is slow.I'd recommend taking a look at personal development pages.

Not because i think you need it or anything... it's just that these pages are a balance of good and bad. Things to work on.

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INFJ_per.html

The site looks pretty bad but it's just old. I consider these pages very useful for confirming your type because it allows you to identify strengths and weaknesses fairly precisely.

I linked it because more people sould see these pages!aw :(Resolved after some cognitive dissonance.

I get what you're saying. And it has been on my mind independently - the fact that i was trained to respect certain rules and rebelled against those that i felt i could have control over. I've had this thought come back to me occassionally. "I know why the caged bird sings". You take the freedoms you feel that you can.

But there were plenty of things that became ingrained.

And this has caused me to feel shame inappropriately. Which is why i now disassociate guilt and shame.

I think.

I don't really nkow if that makes sense. Spit balling.

---

So here's a context. I will feel guilty for challenging someone's political belief. It is my guilty pleasure.

But i could never feel sorry for seapking about what i believe in.Thanks, this is kinda fascinating.

I'm currently injured! And in all honesty i usually am. But to give an example of my life experience - this has led family members to call my a hypercondriac. That evokes guilt... but i am not sorry about complaining and speaking my mind.

It's a very useful concrete example and really hammers home the thing i've been analysing recently.

ESTPs take criticsms quite seriously if they are reinforced by several perspectives. But it never tranferred into a thought that i should stop incurring injury. Instead i would reject the criticsm. Or resent it.

lol.

Criticism evokes justification and that can be the end of a dialogue. This happens all the time. But i got tired of justifying myself. It feels like a weak position in any debate.You like cheering people who are suffering. That's total INFJ territory.

I mean... lots of people like to do this. But you have the Ni determination rather than Ne speculation, right?

Plus if you were xNFP we would tend to talk past each other as one would address values and the otther logic.

I have a ENFP sister and i'm very *very* sure of that analysis.It's possible that you might get something out of considering ISFJ

I dunno man. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/74/3b/c6/743bc6fa8ad8d634147583ba488982fc.jpg

You dont seem like Si type. Se has bite. But forum typology. Meh. Ti compells me to suggest it for the sake of accuracy or if you ever tested as Si user?

I feel like people consider Si to be objectively the worst function. But ... like ... what the actual fuck. Jung describes it as collective memories based on subjectivity. An evolved consciousness.

I'm like... *wtf is that i just like to go fast*http://www.vitamin-ha.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Just-Accept-Me-Meme.jpgYou betcha. Hah! That Se bite.We should define whatt personality means to us. MBTI helps to understand how people can be very different from you.

If you fit into every mould that's just because you've been able to train yourself to fit that mould.

But you shouldn't fit yourself into a mould.I think it might depend on how the question is phrased but i agree with the principle method of discovery.

Having said that i also think it's quite unreliable to type people on the fly.What do you want to use it for?I am the protagonist. And when i have read books i get absorbed intto it like it were interactive entertainment.

Which can be annoying if the chapter ends or the story evolves in a direction i dislike.

I don't read much fiction anymore.

*Goes back to watching southpark*Yeah i never liked reading to being with. Not fiction. But now, in my older age, it's way too much of a chore.&gt; This theory is founded on pseudoscience, right down to the core.

Is all rational science psuedoscience?

What does that say aboout rational discovery (including modern armchair physics)?

What does that say about the doscovery of the Higgs Boson?

---

&gt; If that still has meaning to people, then it is superficial and arbitrary

Value judgement.

;p

Your determination is flawed. Since rattional discovery preceeds empirical discovery. It is only a product of modern information availability that has led the vasst majority of people to "skip to the end"... and essentially those people are only standing on the shoulders of other discoveries.

This does tend to lead to a situation where the house of cards can fall down. We can become disenchanted ... even long term partners can grow apart. Can personality study ever truely desscribe that mechanism? Or would it be more appropriate to attribute it to biology?

Without tthese questions and the rational discovery... w wouldn't have theories to empirically test.

My keyboard is a bitt fucked at the moment. The extra letters are not evidence of "too much cocaine". Altho i have had a coffee.

I'm sure you can appreciate that i threw that in there becuase it feels right for the flow. ESTPs are good at perspective. And i write this way on purpose.

I guess it's how i would ttalk if everyone talked really sslow.

&gt; I can't be the only one who thinks that is a poor trade off if the goal is to explain that people are different.

Well that depends on how much you struggle to understand the motivations of other people.

I mean... seriously i have spent most of my life arrogantly considering everyone else to be stupid. Almost everyone i met.

The difference between arrogance and cofidence is the difference between thinking it and saying itt out loud. It's arrogant to tell people you think they are stupid.

This works... right? But it doesn't account at all for how other people can be ssignificantly better at *other skills*. I have primarily used mbti to help myself. I have a lot of frustrations in my life. I vent a lot. I've been trained to do things that are bad for me. I'm unlearning a lot of stuff that was always useless to me. Hopefully i'll change from working always in an office environment to working outisde.

I might even get lots of other things i want out of it. For an impulsive character... there's lots of limitations i've put on myself that are not necessary when i have a deeper understanding of my flaws.

Having said tthat i did sprain my ankle and that set me back for a month already... so some tthings are unchanged. Still love to ttake risks.

---

&gt; This was the first thing I was told, but as usual I refuse to just take their word for it. What I wanted to find was the why part behind this; what the mold really is, whether there might be some sensibilities hidden somewhere.

Well this is your problem. The mould is not a person therefore a preson doesn't fit into it exactly.

Keep this analogy alive... what is a mould for? It's for printing copies... but we can easily observe that people are not printed copies of each other. Therefore the mould is an incomplete model.

I've been saying it for a long time now. MBTTI doesn't account for individual knowledge and experiences. If you were trained to use Fi by your family... you will use Fi and it might be very bad for you. I use this example because i have an ENFP sister and have spent a lot of time growing up challenged by Fi since it is a one dimensional function for me ... but it is a full 4 dimensional (i think) finction for my sister.

My father grew up with 3 sisters as well... so he developed good use of Fi... i was actually confused abut his typing for some time. I thought he was ENTJ. But he is not. He's ESTP trained in Fi.

---

&gt; I don't tend to accept things without a reason, instead I try them out

I understand what you have attempted. But it comes from a clear and obvious position of Ne speculation. And yo hav not assigned weightt to anything - even after trying all the profiles ouut. So i would assume you have Ne and Te in your stack.

But then perhaps you are gripping and a 1 dimensional function is over represented in your text.

There will always be a caveat.

Part of the problem of being intelligent is that you might alwaysbe able to find a caveat to disprove everything. Do we live in a simulation? How much does it really matter anyway?

---

&gt; Much like how hypnotism works, the person has to willingly lull themselves into it.

This theory ain't no snake charmer. Not any more than any other theory or meme.

Perhaps you simply got bored and disenchanted with mbti. If you can't find a use for the theory then abadon it. That's good rationality.

But you appear to be attached to it. You've tried to validate your apathy with the theory by dicrediting the foundations that initially supported your interest.

So i would ask you how useful a second hand hammer is.

It entirely depends on the reason why it's second hand. Did it break? No the theory remains the same... Did you stop finding a use for itt? Then the hammer's probably still useful to someone.

Peace.I don't know what this chart is talking about. I am a treacle tart. Sweet and seductive.. but all i got is sugar baby. I know you want it but it's bad for you.

Let's get ssticky.You're a loaded question! ;phttp://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTP_per.html

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP_per.html

They both need to grow up and learn to talk to each other without talking *past* each other or triggering each other.

However i would question the typing. I doubt an ESTP would be that inclined to bully an INTP which is the superficial interpretation i've made of your family dynamic. Plus ESTP and INTP share the same (Ti) judgement function. And it seems like they would use similar language to communicate their beliefs. The Se user will naturally want to bring the Ne user back down to earth. So the son's maturity could play into this.

The ESTP wants to bully the INTP to grow up. Or to be more like himself.

My father seemed entirely disinterested with my life until i was voting age. And then he was only particualrly interested in getting me "on side" with his perspectives.

It seems fairly consistent with my own ESTP father's concept of fathering. But i'm fairly well equipped against it.

I will tell you this... at face value when i was growing up many people would have typed my as an INTP simply because i didn't have the freedom to escape.

You might try giving your son some additional freedoms and see if this enables a less stressful situation - if so then i would tell the father that the only reason his son is weird is because he keeps bullying the boy. Tell them (reinforce it) that they are very alike and very similar. This will naturally rebuild their connection without either party requiring to concede anything.

But don't do that before granting more freedoms. Change must happen and then attribute the good stuff to the change.

Otherwise they'll just find another argument.You are doing it wrong.

First... MBTi is not about behavior... it's about your preferences. So you shouldn't be thinking "how do i feel now" you'll always give the test a biased answer based on your current actions and mindset. Which *are* dynamic ... obviously. So we should reference a static (past) frame rather than a dynamic (present) frame.

Think about your preferences when you were 10 years old or 15 years old or the youngest you can remember (older than 10). Answer the questions as if you were observing your child self.

This is a consistent way to reference your preferences and it should also give you a method for answering the test with some degree of consistency. The hypothesis is that whatever it is you remember from an early life event will likely be founded on the preferential functions that your psyche uses. Do you tend to remember aesthetics, internal emotion, external vibe, accurate facts, subjective impressions...

Etc etc.... everyone uses a combinattion of these things. This is not an empirical test. You cannot separate these parts of your brains function from each other. If you're too preoccupied with "what my answer means about me" then you're never going to get an accurate reading.

But if you think about it and reference a constant time frame (a life eventt you remember well) then you'll be able to give the test something that is based on your functional preferences rather than "this is how i felt before breakfast".

&gt; soooooo either I may be mis typed or my type actually changes depending on my circumstances?

You didn't even mention another possible type...

But you sound like an ENTP. You seem to use Ne, Ti, Fe, (and i assume Si)... those tope three functions feature in your brief text.

&gt; I took the test in a good mood on a Sunday and I got ENTP, but I realize some days before a coffee I will feel more....

This is Ne speculation.

&gt; socially awkward and hate speaking with strangers

Indicated Ti-Fe axis with a T preference

&gt; my girlfriend has described me as overly sensitive sometimes

Fi users will look at Fe users and think they have immautre or childish feelings.

In the same way that a Ti user looks at the superficial Te logic and considers it less developed... so does Fi look at Fe.

Or she might have an F preference - but i doubt she;d call you over sensitive unless she was a Fi user.

No offence to anyone reading... i just think Fe doesn't really care about how sensitive you are (in my opinion) and Fi thinks it's all grown up... but is secretly very sensitive. The difference is that Fi doesn't tell you and expects you to know.

And this is not a sexist rant because i know plenty of male Fi users.I liked the test a lot.

"You are 71% Rational, 71% Extroverted, 71% Brutal, and 71% Arrogant."

&gt; You are the Smartass! You are rational, extroverted, brutal, and arrogant. In fact, you could very well be the anti-Christ, as you are almost the exact opposite of everything Jesus was supposed to be. While Jesus says love your enemy, you say love beating the crap out of your enemy. While Jesus raises the dead, you raise hell. While Jesus walks on water, you tend to sink. You probably consider people who are emotional and gentle to be big pussies who are obviously in lesser stature than you. You have many flaws, despite your seeming intelligence and cool-headedness. For instance, you aren't very nice. In fact, you're probably an asshole. And you are conceited and self-centered. Not only that, but you are very loud and vocal about all this, seeing as how you are extroverted. There is no better way to describe you than as a "smartass", I'm afraid. Perhaps just "ass" would do, too. But that's a little less literary and descriptive. At any rate, your main personality defect is the fact that you are self-centered, mean, uncaring, and brutally logical. 

&gt; Compatibility:

&gt; Your exact opposite is the Emo Kid.

&gt; Other personalities you would probably get along with are the Capitalist Pig, the Braggart, and the Sociopath.https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/565528824289300480/wIGnl73l.jpegThe only cheek i wanna see out of you is a smacked one. Now get back in your box!!It should not be that much effort for an ESTP to operate in Ti mode.

Generally i think a lot of the time people mistype ESSTP because they have entirely ignored the fact that it uses Ti. Very well.

This is like 90% of ESTP mistypings. Hence why i mentioned it myself. They shouldn't have communication issues because they learned the same (Ti) language and that leads to many similar judgements... do you get me?Another nte; you should make sure tthat if the ESSTP startss starig into space ... make sure the INTP gives him time to let him think ... don't interrupt. 

ESTP might look like we've gone distant in this moment but that's cos Se shut down and Ti is taking over. Let it happen. Let the man think! If he never does this he isn't an ESTP.I have this hunch that /u/CrowdedHighways is actually someone who knows me IRL and they're just waiting, biding their time, in apprehension of me saying some awful shit about ... well ... everyone ... before getting the aforementioned "everyone" together in order to lynch me.

But then i remember that most people IRL think i'm a super nice guy. Honestly i get this compliment all the time i'm starting to think people are giving it out of pity. Just play with my balls if you feel sorry for me. I'm exactly like a dog in that respect. Shorter tongue.

I could continue to waffle.

I think i might ahve enough childhood trauma to do stand up comedy. But i'm an S type so i can only really tell people about the parts that cuased the trauma rather than the moral lesson or something light hearted and relatable.

I like to offend people. Can you make a living out of that? Perhaps on YouTube.

/u/CrowdedHighways is for sale if you're interested.

But i'd like to keep the box it's very useful.The subjectivity is strong in this one.&gt; and an S-type bias leads me to avoid answers in tests I know correlate with S-types, regardless of whether or not an answer applies to me

Value judgement implies use of Fi - you want things to feel that the type belongs to you.

&gt; based on type descriptions alone and seeming internet S-type-hatred consensus

You are influenced by the status quo. This points at Fi-Te.

&gt; a desire to be someone who understands people well

Possibly F preference over T.

&gt; S-types as people who are stagnant, absolute, and care little for what they can't see

Value judgement, no validation. Essentially just framing your judgement without providing perspective. This would imply to me that you're using Fi in dom or aux position.

I am familiar with this style of communication.

&gt; I'd use my interests and habits. It's not helpful. Neither was looking into people's personal examples of characters, family members and friends, etc. of certain types. I thought maybe I'd figure it out if someone has typed a character I can heavily relate to.

This is a Ne thought stream. You drive thru your thoughts like a bouncy castle in a hurricane.

It's difficult to tell if you are ENFP or INFP at this point. But it the assumption i would make. HOWEVER i could be wrong... (no i'm not wrong i just know thatt Fi doesn't like to be told how it should feel).

&gt; I suppose falling into a group that's often considered to be without makes me uncomfortable. Even despite seeing the whole picture broken down into its parts, the system they make still pushes me away.

I mean if this is a source of insecurity then it's possible you might have inferior Te - that would mean INFP.

&gt; I've also had three people who knew me personally who believed I was an INTJ. Internet strangers typed me as an S-type or just didn't know.

Why?

I mean thiss is kinda why i have typed you as an xNFP... you're clearly observant of the process but it's all external analysis. Not much internal analysis unless its about how you feel about ??? whatever the thing, person, activity.

Erm.

Yeah you might be another type. I tend to always end up typing these "help me" posts as xNFP.

That doesn't mean i'm wrong. But it also doesn't mean i'm blindly borrect.

I don't think forum style typing is effective.

**Oh one last thing... when you take hte test just answer as if youw ere observing your 10 year old self** - this makes it easier to give some consistent framing to the machine logic.

and i'm BIG MONEYFi dom.From google search;

&gt; Subjectivity refers to how someone's judgment is shaped by personal opinions and **feelings** instead of outside influences.

I was pointing out that the text contains FiFi-Te is influenced by the status quo because Te observes the mechanism and Fi may feel "oh that feels right".

This is why i typed the whole **axis** rather than a single function.

It's not about Fi as a function it is about Fi-Te as an axis.

&gt; "dance to the beat of your own drum even if there's other music playing and you're fucking it up for everyone else" function?

This is a paraphrased way of saying that Fi is selfish - it's probably phrased this way to avoid insulting the reader. But that's what it means.Yeah i actually figured that when people have Ne **and** Te  in their function stack... these people tend to struggle with typing themselves.

Hypothesis; Because the intuition and logic are external and facing outwards - it makes it hard for them to perform self analysis.

Also my sister is xNFP and i really recognise the value judgement / speculation style of cognition. (literally Fi-Ne)I was built to be single.I have significant doubt that this is your personal observation... on account of you probably not being born when your dad was dating.

Also... when i mentioned being built to be single... that was intended to imply something other than forever alone. Maybe i should've used the word bachelor instead.&gt; OP was asking for help in the context of his experiences, which pretty much automatically makes it subjective.

I wanted to give you the formula for what i've done here.

Op was asking for help in the context of his experiences. And he described his experiences. This will naturally lend itself to particular use of vernacular. The natural language we prefer to use displays our functional preferences. I have a very keen ability to recognize patterns. And i use this for all kinds of analysis.

I **think** this is true. I do not **feel** anything about the statement. And this is a small suggestion that i might have a T preference. If you observe many suggestions that point to the same conclusion then i feel confident making a guess.

The immediate guess i made here was that the user was Fi dom. I made another post for the analysis but my first thoughts were ... there's a lot of subjectivity in that post. And in the context of MBTI that means Fi

So yes... you were confused about the subjectivity of a description submitted by a human. That doesn't make much sense to me at all. Everything is subjective. Literally everything. When you open your eyes and see sunshine ... that's a subjective name for it.

It could equally be called a sea of photons. That is also a subjective name.

Here's the nuance. If OP was talking about a normal average day and they described how they had made decisions based on feeling good rather than aesthetics, compulsion or logic... then it's fairly safe to make some assumptions about the preferential functions they use.

---

And this is very typical of my interactions with any ENTP. Dragging you back down to earth and forcing you to make good use of Ti to validate the accuracy of what you're saying.

Unfortunately, for some, i enjoy doing this. I didn't mean to offend but i thought you might appreciate an explanation of the principle dynamic used for analysis here.

Fuzzy logic pattern recognition. I do this a lot.Me and /u/CrowdedHighways go way back... *supposedly*

At this point i've forgotten who was initially stalking whom.

Now we rotate.A good time that lasts longer than 5 minutes!These are eyebrows right?School uniform is cheating.Thanks this was very helpful tome!Ah it's kinda a meme on here... there's the occassional test for psycopathy or a survey and ESTP is usually reported as the closest to completely losing control.

Thought i'd have a stab at a rational and functional description. I actually wrote this on the underground on my phone in note form and missed my stop.Anytime someone misrepresents your point in order to defeat an argument that you didn't even say... you know there's nothing intelligent to follow.

It's called a straw man logical fallacy. As in "look at this distraction... isn't it silly... te he he" rather than contributing with an intelligent critique.

Do you really want to get into this? xDI think i pushed mine toward this but one parent was incredibly soft willed and the other became disinterested after i grew muscles.ok, i'll back it up a bit... nah it's something i've noticed repeated here a few times in the 9 months or so that i've been reading the subreddit (vaguely).

and i wanted to either expalin it such that it doesn't become a vapid stereotype (and people can accept some diversity and individuality to it) or to disprove it.

I fleshed out the theory after getting inspiration while sitting on the train into work.

I admit that it's not partocularly fleshed out or well presented since i basically do things on the fly.

But are you aware of what i mean when i describe a 1 dimensional function? It's spefically the weakest part of the psyche... and for several months now i've been working on discovery where i attempt to type people based on their ssubconscious influences (i.e. the influence that their weaker functions have on the psyche)...

The reason for this is that dimensionality. I think it should be easier to identify a less complex function - but typically it can be weakly expressed.

Luckily enough those functions come into use if you stress someone out.

I'm very good at that (as shown in the example preceeding this reply).

I meant nothing by it but this is how i describe what i'm doing when it's fairly complex. It is genuinely part of my self learning process. I don't learn like nomal people... i cannot just read from a book because i will doubt the content. I must test it for myself.

That's not true. I can acept it if i believe in the theory. MBTI is interesting. I have not managed to dismiss it (as a functional and useful framework) after 9 months.I really don't think that matters anymore. Have you seen the escalation of tension that could well lead to a global war?

I mean seriously. Brexit is kinda small potatoes right now.

I think i made a lot of progress today. The thing is i can't feel sorry and guilty. Ok that's a straight lie but i have this un-announced situation in my mind... It's one or the other. And i wanted to stop feeling guilty and feel sorry.

Both just... means i made a mistake!

I don't make mistakes haha! I don't know where i'm going with this at all. I kinda want to delete it.&gt; I think the anxiety/'madness' that comes from Ni in ESTPs is not necessarily because of Ni, but because of a lack of Ni, or a discomfort with the perspective.

This describes the dimensionality of the function. An inferior function should have a singular capacity in the context of other functions in the psyche.

&gt; Too much Ni-type perspective gives my ESTP friend major anxiety.

So a part of my theory is to address the possibilitity that what we describe as "gripping" is actually the inferior function taking resources away from teh dominant function to cope with a greater dimensionality.

I think this intriduces some flexibility to the model to enable a (jungian) functional dicussion about (personality) dysfunction within a framework.

It seems that some of your resolution abuot inferior Ni are consistent with this concept of function dimension / capacity.

&gt; When I think about a potential thing or future thing, I can feel it, it's real, I'm living in it, I can make decisions based on that vision or possibility; for SPs, it's like it's not real unless it's happening.

This reflects the theory for greater functional capacity in dominant Ni and Se respectfully compared with inferior. But the word choice evokes the multi-channel dimension of your Ni compared with mine... but likewise i imagine my spatial awareness would reflect greater capacity of dominant Se comapred with inferior.

&gt; When SP intuition is bad it tends to be very singularly fatalistic or singularly conspiratorial.

Can confirm. I have a singular hunch and it doesn't get replaced until proven or proven wrong. It provides some drive for "settling the matter".

&gt; Hence why ESTPs are such good smooth talkers in the moment, but the longer you know one the more it's like, "yeah, you only said the exact opposite thing last time when it was convenient for you -.-"

I tend to forget. But current circumstances change... and that includes what Ni's driving at.

Honestly Se is just a child *holding a gun* but the gun is Ni in my opinion!

I wanted to aske if, from your perspective, Ni is the child and Se is the gun?

Because that would make sense to me.wow tthat resonates but i guess i hadn't really acknowledged that my father might be insecure

it sort of makes sense why he is hesitant of change (for an ESTP) yet on the flip side pushes head long into things he's sure of

&gt; i really need to get out of this fucking house for a while. 

i went to live 300 miles away at age 18 and stayed there for 6 years

i ad to come back but ... fuck ... do what you can to get out of critical environments hah!The question you are asking does not make sense to me.

ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, and ISFJ all use **Si-Ne axis**, but two of them use Fe-Ti and the other two use Fi-Te

They are all J type so perhaps you're talking about the perception axis.... **however** ...

ENFJ, INFJ, ENTJ, and INTJ all use **Ni-Se axis** (and again 2 use Ti-Fe and 2 use Te-Fi). So you have asked a compound questtion about discerning similarities in a pool of 8 types that may not have a valid common pool.

I don't actually know, per se... I'm just saying that the question could be phrased better?

I don't like the quesstion. Sorry.MBTI doesn't work with behavioural analysis.

Behaviour analysis is a top down way into the pscyhe. You're looking at the result and trying to work out the motive.

MBTI looks at the motive and gives a variety of outcomes. This is a ground up approach. Which is why you're doing it wrong. There will always be a variety in behavior and you should go and ask the person some question. You need direct preferences.

Simple observation will only capture a snaphot - which is precisely what MBTI fails to describe.

If i told you that ESTPs like to flirt that doesn't equate to every person who flirts is an ESTP. THe logic must go the other way round. Do you get me?Awww it'ss ok (*pats head pedantically*) it's not your fault that your logic is a bit shit at analysis.

:'(((This comment required an edit? ~https://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISTP_per.html

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTP_per.html

These pages give accurate profiles that include good *and* bad traits. These pages are intended for personal development and so they challenge the reader.

You can use these to compare ISTP and INTP... I don't really tthink it makes a huge amount of difference.

ESTP and ENTP share lots of behaviors

ISTP and INTP likewise.

Also... do your research... wtf people can't google these days? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwHFjtBoxEII don't need a trademark, i am a trademark.

\~

And like... your thing *couuld* be a moustache... rightt? RIGHT?

~.~Turn the [light off](http://i.imgur.com/7oOsYpE.gif)!Fi facts don't mean anything (edit; in the context of rational theory). You haven't validated anything you've said with logic... only emotion.Behaviour is an unreliable metric. Otherwise The consensus for assessment might include some behavioural elements.

However I personally find that behavioural elements lead to vapid and superficial stereotyping. Which is high potential for mistyping... this is the observation from Se-Ti

Let's not Fi-Te about it. Perhaps it's a difference of opinion... or perhaps the contributions from other users to karma scores on our posts would give you an indication of your incorrect judgement. Why push back against it?

I cannot account for your behaviour. However I can easily extract function from your vitriol. Justifying your declaration by asking me rhetoric questions about my function use is fairly redundant when I've criticised your analytical ability.

Your reaction is projection. But it remains that Fi judgements are invalidated. You barely know anything about me and many people have complimented me for suspending judgement.

But I don't tolerate mean people. And you are conceited or insecure. I offended you... it will be difficult for you to offend me back - so how do you approach this challenge?

Edit; (the answer to my rhetoric question)... you simply tried to wound me. That's why I offended you again. Because... screw you!!

Since when did *"sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me"* stop being relevant?Makes me feel sick. Like... alternate reality sickness. This is what I equate to sentimentality and regret.

Maybe I have a lot of regrets... but that's not true if I wouldn't have changed a thing.

I don't like to feel trapped and stagnating but I've gotten used to it. Nostalgia is another trap. It doesn't build to anything.

I'd rather pine over future engagements - this is a more positive mindset for me.Well... yeah. That's what it looks like when Se sits down at a busy event. Random noise or someone talks to me I'll turn my head and look around.

Doesn't everyone do that?Your question is rhetoric. It's a leading question. They don't let you ask those types of question in criminal court because they're based on an assumed condition.

That's why it's called a leading question. You're diverting such that you can use a superficial judgement (an assumption) to achieve an irrelevant point.

So why would I answer that?!

If you were interested in a fair debate you'd state your case without applying manipulative rhetoric out of insecurity.

This is why I called your analysis shit. You just preach value judgements and they say more about you than mbti.

Which is why your contribution here is down voted. It's just subjective value judgements and they hold little value to anyone but yourself.

I have 1 dimensional Fi ... I don't think you're going to be capable of offending it.Well ... if I'm happy and focused I think Fe and Ni sort of get the bed down and we're running pure Se-Ti

Which can look like Te for what can happen... I guess Fe is not as shut down as Ni

Basically... very happy and keen ESTP looks very much like an ENTJ ... people compare ENTP and ESTP but this is not a close comparison for the individuals involved... however ESTP does have many of the skills required to emulate the high function of ENTJ.

I have a minor theory that some of the rational model could be collapsed to account for simulated function, shadow function ... or other examples of proficiency in functions we do not make a direct preference for.

A consistent problem in mbti is that people can be very good at stuff they don't like to do.

Happiness affects our behaviour and preferences.&gt; Please elaborate on this.

Ok here's one...

&gt; How am I preaching value judgements(that only apply to me) here?

**"You must be straight up trolling. Stop jumping to conclusions."**

This is literally the first thing you said to me in response to my analysis.

Here's my subjectivity translator... I will attempt to translate Fi into rational statements.

"You must be a troll" = "You have offended me" + "i dislike you"

"Stop jumping to conclusions" = defence mechanism and cognittive dissonance... "i am not like you described me"

Your statements have no validation. There is no longical process. I don't particularly care if i offend youu since you're fairly abrasive yourself. Your comments on mbti are simply subjective opinion. This is your preference  - you do not habitually seek deeper meaning other than your subjective experience (Fi-Se).

This is why you contributions say more about your internal state than they do about mbti. Because you are only expressing opinion and it's not validated by anything other than emotion.

&gt; People get to choose if their message is rhetorical or not.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. The difference between Ti and Fi is that Fi believes respectt should be granted and Ti considers respect a quality that is earned.

I have plenty of philosophical reference points to back up my perspective that you should treat people how you would expect tto be treated.

This is why i offended you... it's because youu don'tt seem to realise that you're being offensive.

Selfish.

&gt; So you not wanting to answer those questions must mean that IM RIGHT?

This is another example of a superficial value judgement. There are lots of potential reasons why i might not reply... but that's irrelevant now anyway.&gt; Honestly I don't think we are getting anywhere here

Subjective value judgement and projection... this means you don't want to get into it any deeper.

I'm really not surprised.

&gt; These were fighting/trash talk words

Exactly. And that'ss why i continued to offend you. I'm not scared of you in the slightest... and i know i can offend you because you're pretty sensitive. I mean ... did you consider that it might have been inappropraite to trash ttalk me? I was expaining my perspecttive to you - the intention was to help you understand and benefit from my observations. I'm pretty good at those.

&gt; What about my main argument?

I've already adresssed this but you chose to ignore my writing... here is a copy &amp; paste because you'll be tempted (once again) to latch onto your superficial analysis in the face of contrary information.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/59eejd/best_way_to_instantly_tell_if_someone_is_a_p_or_j/d97whyz/

You'll notice that i didn't waste time and got straight down to it.

And a bunch of people agreed with me.

&gt; Why attack a silly phrase I simply added in just for the heck of it?

Because you ignored the debate topic yourself. And attacked me... so... erm... it's fairly self explanatory. This is actually the second time i've explained my reaction to you as well...

https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/59eejd/best_way_to_instantly_tell_if_someone_is_a_p_or_j/d98gbmr/

Edit; in summary "you reap what you sow"

&gt; [regarding logical fallacy] I honestly don't understand anything you are saying here lol.

If you do not understand something that doesn't make it a logical fallacy. [Here are the logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/system/App/Settings/poster_image_highs/000/000/001/original/FallaciesPosterHigherRes.jpg) ... and it is an exhaustive list (meaning; that's all of them). So if you want to call my statement logically inconsistent ... **first you should understand it** ... and **second you should be able to explain why** it's fallacious (if that is the case)... however i tend to avoid logical fallacy.

Because i prefer to move things forward.

&gt; Would you answer it if I worded it differently?

How about you address teh point instead of asking irrelevant rhetorical questions that are so obviously conceitted that *nobody* answers them... do you honestly believe that you win arguments or that people give up on getting through to you?

Because that's just Fi.&gt; TBH you have to be trolling lol. Like if you are not then...... you are one heck of an irrational person.

I'm 99th percentile for logical reasoning.

---

So far i can identify the following logical fallacies in your comments here;

Ad hominem

Loaded question

You accused me of black-or-white ... which was itself a straw man fallacy

And also personal incredulity

You went middle ground a bit with the whole "it's doesn't needd to be 100% accurate" and this is also a straw man fallacy since i have been specific. Behavioural psychology is a different approach to mbti and jungian functions.

They are different models of study.

The field of psychology lends itself to behavioural analysis. Because it enables some degree of empirical observation. The factt that Jung made notes on interviews is not the same as empirical observation... he considered it to be equivalent because rational science was much more accepted in those days.

The reason mbtti is a ground up appraoch is due to the method of exploration. Patients would be asked why they had a preference for particular things.

This is not a behavioural analysis at all and deals with the **cause** not the **effect** of the psyches preferences.Refrence them appropriately you lazy bitch. Do the work to present your case.

It's your job to explain yourself.Hypocritical behavior just shows more depth to your insecurity and projection.

&gt; I merely brought it back up.

I merely pointed out how every time you attempt to form an argument it's so steeped in subjectivity that it cannot make rational sense.

This is also why you suck at analysis. You logic simply doesn't work this way and you should probably stop trying to make people care about how you feel about it.

You are butthuurt. You even commented several replies previously that you didn't thinkt his was going anywhere (and i agree) yet you still persist...

Why?

Do you think i'm going to change my perspective or just continue to wind you up?

Do the sensible thing. Fuck off.

(inb4 crying)&gt; His main argument was that I should look at "motives" instead of behavior

My main argument is that MBTI is a **ground up approach** to the psyche. A function describes a mechanism that produces a result that can be observed. However you are incorrect in the assumption that Jung made notes on behaviour.

Wuite the opposite. He asked questions and directly evoked a response regarding **cause** of a preference rather than the preference itself (behavior). He did this with a variety of people and compared the notes to make a rational model that would describe the *different* observations within one framework of the psyche.

The different types enable flexibility in the model and personality diversity to be expressed functionally.

Behavioural approaches bastardise the theory because they are **top down analysis** of the psyche. They introduce vapid stereotyping to mbti which don't relate to any individual and are therefore *bad practise*.

**You're doing it wrong**

&gt; "Typical behavior" that has to do more with functions than individual.

Which i expressly disagree with for the above reasons. You are trying to fit people into a mould rather than allow the flexibility for the mould to fit people.

How much would you allow to fall by the wayside in your analysis?

This is why i call it a superficial judgement.

&gt; I also mentioned that it's obviously going to not be 100%

Irrelevant since the approch is fundamentally different. Your observations will be divergent from *real* mbti that has a functional approach.

&gt; It's pretty much just a "hit or miss" shortcut to typing people.

Detracts from the validity of the model and generates criticism for the theory without actually following the theory.

&gt; Jung originally discovered the functions by observing people too.

Not a detailed understanding of the facts.

&gt; So I don't see how " behavioral analysis" can be "completely dismissed" which is what kbnation said.

Because you haven't got sufficient depth of knowledge on the process Jung employed to rationalise the functional approach. Your assumption about observation is understandable... but the interpretation is a nuance.I'm competitive. And you're a shit analyst. I also find you hypocritical.Mos def&gt; Your ground up approach is simply a preference to yourself it is not the only way to do it.

No that's literally what it means when we describe jungian psychology as a functional appraoch to cognition as opposed to a behavioural approach.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding based on a false assumption of what Jungs observations actually were. They were questions and discussion... not behaviour analysis and empirical tests.

&gt; however in most situations people do not have the time and opportunity to utilize those ways of approach

so use a different model that is intended for behavior analysis

you're using the wrong model

&gt; Which for some weird reason, offended you heavily

subjective value judgement... and projection

as if i give a fuck... there's a nuance between offence and irritation

Yeah ... you're irritating. What... do you want a medal? It's not an achievement. It's irritating that you dismiss my logic... and in return i hurt your feelings.

That's how this works because you're a bit of a cunt. Maybe next time don't open your rebuttal with trash talk. Lol... cos then you might not get someone intenttionally winding you up by poking holes in your reasoning.

&gt; Jung did ask them questions but he also did note behavior analysis of each type. And he literally describes their behavior.

And yet the consensus is to perform mbti analysis without any behavioural elements.

*I wonder why that could be...*

PONDERFACE

sarcasm

other things that make me laugh at youNo... i *literally just told you* i've been giving you advice and when you were a cunt i decided to wind you up in punishment for you being a cunt.

I don't care about what people think.

And i don't like how much you project. You have some insecurities that you should address. ~~I didn't really read the rest of your shite... Just the first line.~~ Ok i read the resst... but it's still worthless drivel.

&gt; Jung did note behavior if you read the actual book you'd know.

Oh which book would that be?

Jung did make projecttions of expected behavior. TThere's a significant differnet between the acknowledged cause and effect - i have mentioned it... but you're basically in that mindset where people instantly reject information... because you're insecure about being told.

It makes you feel stupid.

To be honest i've experienced this very often when telling people how it is... and i get a bit tired of reasoning with Fi. This strategy has evolved over a very long career. I assure you that you're not equipped to actually make progress unlesss you **actually attempt to understand what i have said**. But you're still dismissing it ... it's too much depth for the dimensionality of your logic.

&gt; ok technically you aren't wrong

I know.

&gt; I'm just irritated by your irrationality

Mmmm. Suuubjective value statement and hypocrisy. Are you able to explain what statement i have made that is irrational and why it is irrational. Because i don;t think you're using that word properly.

If you disagree with something but can't describe why... then it's not irrational... you're the one who is wrong.

If something doesn't make sense to you... that doesn't mean you dismiss it as nonsense... it means you didn't understand it properly.I expained it to you here; https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/59eejd/best_way_to_instantly_tell_if_someone_is_a_p_or_j/d97whyz/

You didn't ask for validation. And i had dlivered to your the principle logic. You could'v asked a question...

My problem is that you attacked me instead of having a discussion about it. This does mean that you dismissed it without getting into a discussion that would evolve some validation in either rational or empirical discovery. You were simply unpleasant and intolerant. And i like to rise to the challenge of fucking with people like you... becausse you're a bitch.

So it's hardly my fault. Plus... the karma kinda reflects how generally accepted this perspective is. It's a little surprising that you're struggling to get on board witth it.

In other words... if you wanted validation... why not ask a question instead of trash talking?

*Have you tried being less of a cunt?*

&gt; The burden of proof is on you

You have already admitted that behaviour analysis is not accurate in the context of MBTI

I explained to you from the outset the reason behind this inconsistency - it is in fact due to the appraoch that each model takes.

http://www.simplypsychology.org/carl-jung.html

You're asking a question about the foundation of Jungian psychology and what it attempted to provide. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design

This page describes the difference between the top down and bottom up approaches at a rational model or solution.

The following part specifically references the different cognitive approaches; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design#Neuroscience_and_psychology

&gt; In cognitive terms, two thinking approaches are distinguished. "Top-down" (or "big chunk") is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. "Bottom-up" (or "small chunk") cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression "seeing the wood for the trees" references the two styles of cognition.

Behaviour analysis is top down becuase it relies on the sensory observation. The result. It is the effect of cognition that we observe.

Funtional analysis of cognition is a detail oriented approach that relies on a framework (and that fact stands regardless of how that framework was derived).

You are trying to mix and match these appraoches and you've described it yourself as hit and miss.

All i have done it explain to you *why* you method fails.

And your first reaction was to trash talk me out of incredulity that i could possibly disagree with you.

Which is why i called you a cunt repeatedly.&gt; Wait so I was the intolerant one? See look this is what I don't understand.

Go back to the top and look at what you did. As soon as you felt challenged you attacked me with "trash talk".

When confronted about that you tried to dismiss it as "hardly serious".

You're a cunt. That doesn't mean i am offended by you... it means i want to offend you. But the greatest way to offend a cunt is to explain to them *why* they're the cuntish one.

As i mentioned... i've done this before. It's a pattern.

&gt; ou are the one who straight up said "YOU ARE WRONG" in response to my original FIRST comment.

**And then gave you an explanation**

Which i have now validated with plenty of ferences regarding the cognitive styles and i've given you good information to confirm that my perspective is valid.

In other words it's not something i just made up.

---

&gt; I said it's Less accurate but is viable.

I'll tell you again. **All i have done is explain to you why your model is bad**.

Is it too difficult to ask people questions and type them based on their *actual* rpeferences rather than their behavior?

&gt; Why are you attempting to use concepts of empirical/general psychology to back up an argument having to do with the MBTI?

That's not what i was doing...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design#Neuroscience_and_psychology

This link shows you the difference appraoches of a top down model and a bottom up model.

It's is qualifying information that enables a distinct separation between functional analysis and behavioural analysis.

I'll state it explicity;

**"In cognitive terms, two thinking approaches are distinguished. "Top-down" (or "big chunk") is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. "Bottom-up" (or "small chunk") cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression "seeing the wood for the trees" references the two styles of cognition."**

&gt; It has a chance of failing but not 100% thus it is viable to some degree.

We don't use square wheels for a reason. And you look stupid arguing the case for square wheels.

&gt; In terms of the MBTI "Gift's Differing" clearing describes behavior VERY clearly. In fact, it is one of the main components that make up the MBTI.

Burden of proof. Please explain your protest. This is not an adequate explanation and it's *your* burden of proof to support your position.Here's my thing... i've seen video of myself. And in busy spaces i might gaze around like this or fixate on a particular detail.

And specifically the part where they sit onthe bench and you see both Se users look and notice something in the same direction... then gaze around observing detail. Yeah... it's focus but they're focusing on the environment.

Yep. Basically that. I can see it in my own actions... but it's a very small and subjective quantity. They are at a busy press conference and many people would have sporadic attention. Or have their attention focused on teh environment.You are simply not capable of understanding my perspective. I suggest that you state my argument. I want to checkhthat you understand the implication I was conveying.&gt; So you'd think they are an ISTP, but for years they have said the description does not fit.

It's about time you considered ignoring protest.Can confirmIt depends on the application.

If we're talking about quantity of weed smoked then i am fairly sure that nobody here would have my staying power. I've only ever felt a bit off two times smoking weed (and have done it for half my life).

But if the context is writing an essay on impressionist era art then... well. Fuck your game mate i'm going outside for a smoke after 2 mins.

&gt; im going to say entj here

I just lived with an entj and the landlord has unlawfully evicted us... i'm still living in the house but the more responsible entj found a new room.

And this guy just signed a new contract very recently but the agent has broke contract without offering compensation. In other words nobody should move out unless the agent settles on the contracts they literally just singed a month ago.

Sure... if the entj was more *inclined* to be a pain in the ass... then he would have the will power to pursue compensation (and may do that anyway)... however i'm being **petty** instead.

My will is to disrupt the agent and force him to offer me a continuation in the house or give up his lease on the property. Immediate compensation would also be good... but simply giving back my deposit isn't going to release the agent from this contract.Oh i'm good at this hah!

High stack Ti - argue the case for something logically inconsistent and use logical fallacies in abundance to defeat their rational position.

High stack Fi - disagree with subjective value judgement and then challenge them to a rational debate (ruffle those feathers).

High stack Te - i just like this. I mean... i'll leave you be entirely unless you try to control me and then i'll offend you. But only by standing up for myself. I don't know how to trigger this one.

High stack Fe - oh... erm... well... i wanted to say "be selfish". But high stack Fe might just let you be selfish. I'm unsure.

Specific types; ENTP - Critique Ne and sloppy use of Ti. Ne-Ti vs Se-Ti can be a fun interaction... but the ESTPs Ni-Ti is far better at resolving things. Conversely the ENTP can be creative but the ESTP likely doesn't care about that. I mention this interaction because i feel like it can be one sided. But the caveat is that the ENTP i frequently chat with might just be a big wet bitch.

ISTP; Usually get on very well but if we have a disagreement of Ti then it might turn into a escalation war. Continue to escalate will cause the ISTP to vent. This looks like they hate you... but in reality they likely don't care about you... only their accuracy.

ENFP; straight up talk past each other. This is a high stack Fi user with Ne. So it's a combination of the ENTP debate but with added Fi-ness to trigger. My sister is this type. It's easy to push Fi's buttons especially when Se-Ni would consider Ne-Si to be somewhat childish in it's speculations of the here and now.

I'm sure there are other specific type interactions that i could place here but the top ones that have caused me the most intense arguments are (due to proximity) ENFP, ENTP, and ISTPI found the description accurate.

&gt; ESTP  Shadow: ISTJ.

&gt; Can become stubborn about their perception of the past and fixated on its relation to the present (Si). Can become critical, disgruntled with disorder, illogic, or inefficiency (Te). Rigidly following a belief system or what they personally think is important, with accompanying childish and/or selfish behaviour (Fi). Over-reading between the lines, often misinterpreting someone‚Äôs actions and seeing negative intentions where there are none (Ne).Well you sound like an ESTP to me.

The nuance is more noticeable in the tertiary and inferior. If you were ISTP i think you would find it challenging to back down on something you believe to be accurate (Ti) to avoid disrupting the emotional environment (Fe).

The difference between E and I here is whether the perception axis wraps around the judgement axis or whether the judgement axis wraps around the perception axis.

So ESTP; **Se** Ti Fe **Ni**

And ISTP; Ti **Se** **Ni** Fe

It can be hard to identify the difference between the complexity of the dominant and auxiliary functions. Which is why i tend to look at the tertiary.

You've used several times words that reference having a more complex understanding of Fe than Ni

Bleh. I could be wrong. But xSTP is kinda an anti-social set of functions because we understand people so well.Good job being sarcastic and pejorative over something that doesn't matter.

People might think *you're* retarded but i hold my own in a debate.

*People shouldn't judge a book by the fact that it smokes weed*... also in terms of social acceptance... like... get with the times grandad.&gt; I am not judging the fact that you smoke weed.

Yes you are... "Maybe cool in highschool, after that you just look like a manchild."

---

It's quite obvious what your sticking point is.

The question was specifically asking about will power and i used the example of smoking weed to illustrate that **context** is important. It was **an example** and not an excuse to brag. Perhaps it would have been more useful as an example to talk about the will power required to keep smoking versus the willpower required to quit.

I mean that would actually be a valid critique of my framing.

Because it's hardly something worth bragging about. But... you missed the actual point i was making regarding the context of will power in an hedonism capacity compared with the "essay on impressionist art". This was a work vs pleasure comparison and it was intentionally vapid in order to generate mirth.

What's wrong with your sense of humor?

I see that you aren't complaining about my total lack of dedication to writing essays on impressionist art. Something which could subjectively be considered bragging too. **Yeah dude i bunked all my lessons at school, brah, HIGH FIVE**

&gt; Maybe cool in highschool, after that you just look like a manchild.

Suck my dick, tbh. What's wrong with being a manchild?

You're just being a cunt about something that offended you. I suggest you learn to share your toys. Because i'm really not worried about looking childish here.You don't sound like an ESTP at all here.Well you sound like an ENTJ on account of that inferior Fi going on there. No ESTP would wish they weren't an ESTP. Change your flair please.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF6McQXWu78&gt; It is, just not to you.

What?

&gt; That only low self esteem people would suck your dick.

Takes one to know one.

&gt; I don't get offended. Just irritated.

You should probably smoke a joint and chillax.

&gt; That is my sticking point.

You're clearly Te dom no Se dom. Nice chat! Don't tell people what to do or say or believe.

And i'm [BIG MONEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShYnVEmbb4) ~Shot at what? Also i'm perfectly happy.

You're very *subjective* over there. I should assume you're that xSFP bitch who i annihilated in debate yesterday.

Blocked. Bye. I'd say well played... but it would be false.No seriously no ESTP would wish they weren't an ESTP. Give you reasoning for wishing you weren't the best type.

Oh i forgot i blocked you. Nevermind! LASTWORD (tehehehehe)Thanks for replying. I agree with your analysis and appreciate the validation you've given.

Think the thread may have been a non starter... but you've supported my bias! I guess it might have been a bit naive to think that anyone would want to support the dialogue actively being criticised (i.e. the girl).

Perhaps i should find an actual debate to do my own analysis on instead of trying to get observations on a one sided commentary.

Anyway. Thanks!I gotta admit... one of the reasons i rise to the challenge with these trolls is to get enough preferences out of htem to type them.

This one is clearly not a Ti user - and so i suggested they might be ENTJ... and this would usually evoke *something* other than a continuation of tone.

The continuation of tone is Fi's judgement from previous interactions.

TLDR; i think this is the xSFP bitch from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/59eejd/best_way_to_instantly_tell_if_someone_is_a_p_or_j/d98wmhw/?context=3) on an alt... but i don't really care if that's accurate... it could be some other xSFP bitch.Have you read "on liberty" by Mills?The troll kinda gave it away when they said they were an ESTP who doesn't want to be an ESTP.

Which just doesn't make sense at all!

I mean... maybe if i was actually in soltary confinement... yeah... maybe then i'd want to be a different type for the sake of sanity.

But being ESTP stops me being crazy... if that makes sense.

It's kinda why i'm so very keen on mbti. This shit stops me being a total nutbag.It's only been 10 minuites but i'm likely to assume you ahven't, in fact, read this piece of important political philosophy which i find highly relevant.

Another search term you could use is "the tyranny of the majority" - this section is the qualifying (validation) for individualism over collectivism.

Regardless of your (or anyone's) partisan beliefs i think it should be a priority to engage the philosophical perspective in order to encourage young minds to align with individualism - especially in the modern age where communication can divert agendas and play on social pressure (collectivist ideology) which is *proven* in history to result in mass murder.

Break the cycle.&gt; I've noticed this year I started this recurring habit when I'm alone in my house where I would voluntarily act very expressive and start rap freestyle my thoughts or talk to myself in a manic and energetic way that I never do in front of people as if I was "performing".

Flow state. That's using everything - on a nueroscanner your head would be lit. Entirely lit. Not activity zoned to small regions.. just the whole brain would be lit up with activity.

So it's everything in your head really. Whole stack.To be fair tho i spend a lot of time alone and think before i act... but i never get typed as ISTP. Not once.Ahh yeah that's true. I get lonely pretty fast.Nobody cares what you think.Nobody, on this side of the keyboard, cares what you think. And that will be accurate for *almost* all people who read it (first person).Why should I care what you think if it will not affect me? Basically your dialogue is criticism, which I reject.  And there's nothing to lose.

So how do you wanna move forwards?&gt; Since you seem to think absolutely no one does and you are wrong

No i didn't say that - that's your assumption. I said i don't care.

Nice use of straw man fallacy. It might be 1am on Friday night and i might be fucked... but you're still not gonna get a logical fallacy past me.

&gt; I just am telling you even if you do not care what I think, there are people who do care.

But i don't care. So your commentary is irrelevant. You must enjoy wasting your time! However i'll always be around to tell you how it is :)Haha, it's okay - you're tottally welcome :)

Would do it again to avoid the tyranny of the majority... and if you understood that reference i'll be amazed.Climate change is a hoax.BravoCheck back in 5 years time brah, you don't know shit. And you're a fascist (still).You don't understand the political philosophy of it. It's about where those people are.

That's what it comes down to. But you can't even google it and read the section! Probably cos you're a ignorant fascist.We will replace fossil fuels with fusion reactors.


Do some research. All the "green energy" things are horrendously bad for the environment. Well done working to destroy the planet!&gt; I really don't think that matters anymore. Have you seen the escalation of tension that could well lead to a global war?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I mean seriously. **Brexit is kinda small potatoes right now.**

&gt; the tyranny of a 500million majority is not really different to a 60million majority

http://www.sevenoaksphilosophy.org/on-liberty/tyranny-of-majority.html

"the inevitable growth of social equality and of the government of public opinion, should impose on mankind an oppressive yoke of uniformity in opinion and practice"

"not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest. The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of the most numerous or the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power."

You should probably make an effort to allign your political beliefs with individualism rather than collectivism. After all... this is the route to understanding why i would vote the same way regardless of economic conditions.

The economic argument was false - this is observable for any citizen... because my groceries cost the same now and they will cost the same in 12 months time.

And in 5 years time we'll be better off... assuming we avoid WW3.

But hey! Your vitriol is incredibly useful and informative (NOT) and you've really done LOADS to sway my personal beliefs!

If you have any logical argument that doesn't revolve around "boo hoo i lost money" then you should make it. Otherwise. Grow up and stop crying over spilled milk... there's a bigger picture you are ignorantly finger painting over.I agree!I don't understand your costumes you appear to both be dressed as hot.Oh yeah i didn't notice that stuff :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCabT_O0YSMDepends which media you tuned intoSo you're uninterested in the statements taken gradually since 1980 that indicate, not only competence, but a gifted intelligence with regard to geopolitics?

Did you even click on the Forbes article?

http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/#490284bd7187

If you‚Äôve ever expressed the least bit of skepticism about environmentalist calls for making the vast majority of fossil fuel use illegal, you‚Äôve probably heard the smug response: ‚Äú97% of climate scientists agree with climate change‚Äù ‚Äî which always carries the implication: Who are you to challenge them?

http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-euro-and-its-european-central-bank-are-murdering-europe-how-globalization-destroys-nations/5557030

BUT THAT'S NOT MY POINT.

MY POINT IS THAT SITES LIKE REDDIT SHOULD ENTERTAIN THE DEBATE OTHERWISE IS PROOVES THAT IT HAS BECOME A ZEALOUS BELIEF RATHER THAN A FACTUAL ONE.

CENSORSHIP would not detract from a real issue. So why censor a debate on climate change?

Why prevent the debate?

What do you have to lose if i'm right?You got anything to comment for part 4?Thanks, I was struggling last week with the impulse to rebel and escape my responsibilities but this has (mostly) faded. I am trying surrender for the first time in my life.No fap is a great idea... I'm fairly sure my cock counts as a extra limb after a months abstinence!Do you think you could be abstinent without cravings? I'm asking because I keep tricking myself into thinking I'm under control due to swapping out my substances for other forms of compulsion (sex, gambling, video games, exercise)I can relate, professional fapping champion hereThanks for the kind words. Cocaine is so very moreish... I would have been in deep trouble if there hadn't been an intervention!Hey! Thanks, I'm aware at this point in my treatment that my own arrogance / overconfidence often tells me things which lead to denial of the addiction situation (and it shouldn't contradict that I am an addict because it's fuckin obvious due to ... erm ... my life history)How about a month of gaming abstinence?Oh yea I find it easier to finish without latex due to the adrenaline side rather than any extra feelynessHeyoooo... I've had to consider weed a drug due to living in a dry house :(Hey! And thanks! I've got to admit that I am my own worst enemy roughly 95% of the time.

At some point I might redo the mbti test without the distorted behaviours due to addiction (although I think I will always have obsessive tendencies). I've been told to stop comparing myself to other people in every interaction I have and also to avoid taking things personally (even if they're intended).

It actually feels handicapping as I used to rely on mental obsession to churn up solutions.

And it's very boring to have a clean head without total obsessive compulsion / paranoia... eerily quiet in my head. Yeah I was pretty psychotic when I quit Reddit a few months back... I'm in a much better place now

I was curious to find out which mbti types suffer compulsive or habitual attitudes ... however it seems to be any personality with childhood trauma (early developmental stage emotional trauma).

I shouldn't really be analysing personality shit while in treatment.Yeah I didn't see the point of depriving myself of things I enjoy... buuuut at the same time I did sprain my ankle skating. That's a catch 22 for someone who was skating to "medicate" low self esteem!What do you mean by trauma... and how would a function change (in what way)...

I ask this because some of us rely on concrete examples to get the gist of things.I have never been given an introverted result in an mbti test ... however I think I'm introverted cos people piss me off.

And I tend toward a rejection loop. I reject people and they reject me leading me to crave new social interactions.

Oh and I love a good argument. ESFPYea I read some of this and it fits my personality. You pass.The way this works for me is I can meet new people and talk about shit. However I'll be hardly interested in taking the same shit the next day unless it's someone else new.

I hate small talk but I like talking with strangers.I like it when people understand what I'm sayin. I bury feelings and don't usually talk about them. Generally I'm happier to talk about something real and I get annoyed if the conversation contradicts the logic I've stored.

I find expressions of Fi can be manipulative - like if someone says they feel offended or something that comes across as domineering.

However I could just be a massive hypocrite who's emotionally repressed.Be blunt. Have breakup sex before if you fancy it.

Don't make it my fault and don't stay in touch unless you want to keep fucking.

If you're seeing someone else don't lie about that and probably warn your besties that we broke up.For accurate typing of you top two functions it's a good idea to think about your childhood - this is a time during development and before learned behaviours in adult life that might suppress the expression of your most prevalent functions.

For example Se dominance could exhibit in lots of sport - equally it could exhibit in lots of food consumption as both of these are sensation oriented.

Identifying the dominant and auxiliary function is enough to confirm a type. But it's useful to also define the tertiary and inferior if your results are still unclear.

I feel like ISTP is more accurate for me however I have trust issues and tend to not form close friendships as a result. I have always tested as ESTP and observations of people that know me put me in the extroverted function order.

I didn't use Facebook for about 10 years but people still perceive me as outgoing. I don't know why. It's probably cos I like showing off (play guitar, dance, comfortable with strangers).Aero Chord - Surface

It has been stuck in my head for months.Fucking infectious innitMy childhood was shit, I basically hated everyone. Dad is workaholic. Mother buries herself in fiction. Sister studied design. I was bored in school and never found it engaging.

I started smoking weed, got kicked out of school but went back and played guitar instead of studying, rode a bmx a lot, got a part time job, got drunk fairly regularly.

Went to uni and didn't study... got kicked out and let back in (again), dated a cheerleader, got pissed off with drug dealers being shit and unreliable.

Became a drug dealer, failed uni, became depressed

Played lots of video games while smoking weed, went on drug binges in Amsterdam 

Contributed to several gaming communities and was always placed in a position of leadership

Became unable to keep a regular job due to various crap reasons that relate to drug addiction. Am currently in a drug addiction rehab place.

That's the shortest life story I've told.If you are an ESTP you are competitive. You might compare yourself to other people in social interactions. The analysis will use Ti and it can stop you from fully living in the moment. This will make you self focussed and that can cause paranoid rationalisations.

You probably do not suffer social anxiety if there is a distraction from self analysis - loud music, sport events, and various external entertainments engage Se and allow Ti to fuck off. You will suffer anxiety if your character is insecure and there is too much focus on self (over analysis) or direct criticism of self (unwanted attention).

The solution is to avoid comparing yourself with the other person and to engage fully rather than with reservation about your character defects. Everybody has some character defects. It's not useful to focus on these elements of psyche in the moment as you will struggle to use Ti in real time.

I would advise you to love yourself and to not take everything personally. ESTP is sensitive to criticism due to our competitive nature. There are a few ways that your psyche may train itself (you may have already trained yourself to cope). Giving up and surrendering to the mundane (boredom) will result in lack of fulfilment, rejecting all criticisms will result in not growing as a person, and finally ... embracing your good qualities and bad qualities without taking your mistakes on as personal criticism provides strength of character.Ti users typically stare into the middle distance while processing thoughts. Do you find yourself having a think with a fixed look? Do people think that you're somewhere else when you're doing a little analysis?

Alternatively you might find it easier to process logic in real time - Te users typically start talking and work out their truth while speaking. However SeTi can emulate Te... which is why ESTP is the God type 

üòãESTP and ENFP generally talk past each other. The attitudes and behaviours are lost to each other and we make faulty assumptions of each other which leaves both feeling criticised.That actually means you're immature as you share Se and Ti but they are lower in your stack.

With some strength of character resulting from personal development you'd find ST types compelling ... because we have mastery of your lower stack functions.

Or you're not INFJ (probably ENFP instead). There is no go-between here... ST types complete you in the same way you complete us. It is your unwillingness to grow as a person which would cause you to have the opinion that there's no compatibility.

The caveat is that xNFP are bad at self analysis so you could be mistyped.You're probably just coping by being well spoken. It's typical for ESTP and ENFP to talk past each other (both missing the point) however with personal development and experience you can get on quite well.

My sister is ENFP.Swearing. I have always enjoyed being a cunt.Yeah this is called a duality pair and if you both have well developed character it should be a relationship that always stays fresh, rewarding and compellingly challenging. The kind of relationship where you enjoy helping each other without it ever feeling like a chore.

It's not a guaranteed situation as MBTI doesn't cover the scope of personality or character defects. There's a lot of wiggle room but there is a very good chance that a duality pair will speak the same language in many aspects of life.Nothing is set in stone but if you consider functions and shadow functions under socionics then it makes a lot of sense that a personality might become frustrated if their dominant or creative functions are the same ones that another type prefers to ignore or deconstruct.

But it's worth mentioning that well developed (mature) personalities can get on with anybody.Yeah, because your functional preferences diverge there is much to discuss. Consider how boring it would be if your bestie made identical observations... it'd be like two ESTPs talking about football.It depends on the reason for blocking a natural maturity process. In my opinion the general trend would be that immature people tend to have less sophisticated interactions as they rely on repeating the same old processes.

The knock on effect is unfulfillment in a wide range of areas of life (due to character defects). The specifics will depend on the personality.Well the things you mentioned do not require self analysis. Music or areas of creativity are an unreliable metric for judging a capability at analysis (let alone self analysis) because we are a social species.

Without 'others' we struggle to produce anything at all. It's unlikely that a musician will sit down and write a song with another person but it's highly likely that their emotional state in a previous interaction with another person could enable the creation of a song that many relate to.

xNFP are bad at internal analysis simply because N and T are both extroverted in this personality type (making it challenging to perform an internal analysis of self)... however with a group setting anybody can perform analysis of self (with the help of other).Yes this is a great way to explain what I have experienced, thanks!You disregard my experience and logical resolutions... I would assume you are Ti ignoring as is expected in xNFP. Or you simply haven't matured enough to appreciate Ti ... or it might be that you haven't studied the functions enough yet to agree.

There is nothing wrong with immaturity, being different types of personality, or having a less in depth understanding of the functions (and function interactions). Try not to take my comment as personal criticisms. I suggested reasons for your belief and challenged that belief - this naturally evokes a rebuttal or justification.

You should observe that my perspective is very much from an analytical understanding of functions. I've read all the material and have a full understanding of the implications of mbti and socionics. I also have an iq of 142. And I'm showing off.

Take a look at personal growth for your type as this may help you to appreciate a depth of knowledge in this area. My apologies if what I have said here is received as criticism.Hmmm I guess the short version is "it depends why they are immature".AccurateAhhh you've made me consider that it's entirely possible that you've only experienced immature ST types and that would lead to the same belief without any negative reflection in yourself.

And that seems likely. I have a few character flaws myself!This is spot on I push my feelings down and they only really engage if I'm socialising on drugs or listening to music. I'm a cold dead husk and for that reason considered ISTP heavily.

Buuuut the test never gives me introversion and nobody tells me I'm introverted. But I hate feelings... however I seem to hate whatever Ni is more than feelings.

I'm 100% sure that I use Se and Ti despite this. And due to an "ADHD" type of behaviour the tests always put Se as dominant 

Generally thinkers do prefer to operate on facts not feelings in my experience however Ti can store moral correctness. Facts based on feelings learned thru Fe.

Waffling a bit now ... not sure what the question wasYeah. And they are more likely to be overwhelming in my experience.

I have good control of Se and can do a lot with Ti. I can read people with Fe and get something from Ni.

If I get upset I tend to feel overwhelmed and default to Se or Ti based distractions.Se-Fi is comfortable around busy people and likes to create stable personal bonds. Prefers malleable people. Comfortable with confrontation.

Fi-Se is more deliberate in achieving things in steps and so prefers less busyness. Methodically discovers the moral truth of people around them and base interactions on this feeling. Does not seek confrontation.This is called depression and is not related to type.Sounds like Se-Ti

Don't be so selfish and you're in denial about a fear of confrontation. Admit it... you get a buzz out of doing whatever you 'feel' like.

I guess this could be Se-Fi too 

How good are you at logic puzzles?Ni - As a base function, Ni generally manifests itself through a lack of direct attention to the world around oneself, and a sense of detachment or freedom from worldly affairs. This can lead to a highly developed imagination and very unique mental world, but it can also result in a great deal of laziness and apparent inactivity.

Si - A strong ability to recognize internal physical states in themselves and others, to understand how these states are reached and how to recreate and avoid certain states. Individuals who possess Si as a base function are drawn to situations that satisfy their inner physical impressions and try to eliminate those conditions that are incongruent to their senses.In all honesty I was joking üôÉ

But I could be wrong ... I sometimes have to go check the definition of Si cos I just don't get it.

But I can see your friend has inferior Ti and the example sounds representative.Train yourself when you jack off. Get close and then stop. Lose the "I'm gonna nut" feeling and then carry on. Repeat until you can control it.

It's not gonna work every time you get laid but I could hold off by knowing I'm getting too close and just pinning deep before it's too late and havin a few kisses while I'm getting my nuts back in control.

The bonus there is that going deep and kissing is a distraction and she might cum... only for you to start building up again 30 seconds later.

The contribution you made here says a lot more about you than it does of ESTP and if you were talking about a real person you'd have told us the career instead of crying like a toddler deprived of mommys attention.

Please cry harder.Well don't contribute then. Especially if you're harbouring some silly resentment over your bullshit with a relative. You didn't read the brief properly.

Read the OP. I intentionally set questions to get useful responses regarding career stuff - this is a subtle technique based on attention manipulation and you can see it has worked well in the thread. I challenged several people who disregarded the brief and you pissed in your own cornflakes over sharing ... when nobody forced you to contribute.

I'm not your uncle - and nobody is going to benefit from hearing about your resentment... nor is anyone potentially reading this thread going to understand your contribution without more detail. The passive anger is unconstructive to the topic and also not even accurate for the vast majority of ESTP.

Most of us talk the talk and walk the walk. And that is why I went the distance to provoke a genuine reaction. I am sorry for your uncle since you are clearly not going to be of service in this persons recovery of whatever trouble they suffer. The worst thing you can do is harbour that attitude toward an ESTP.

If it's been 10 years you'd be better off finding this person a councillor.I crashed my car one time. There was a log truck broken down on the other side of the road and a queue of traffic behind it... some 4x4 hammered it around the truck and the Nissan Micra in front of me slammed on the brakes... blocking the road.

I saw the Micra's brake lights go off and made the false assumption that this person was moving forwards again... they had put the handbrake on instead.

So I've let go of my anchors assuming they would be rolling forwards and bybthe time I realise that they're not moving it's too late to stop... I aimed for the gap in between the truck and the car, ramping my car into the air, leap frogging the car in front to blow out a tire when I land in front.

Had a cool slomo moment where I looked over to see my mate suspended in mid air - lying flat. It was embarrassing cos I was high.Oh well that's it... I must be an ISTP then cos I hate peopleI'm good at fucking my ex's bestiesOh that's easy... just don't grow up! Blocked my number after saying it's over. My first thoughts were... this is just the beginning...Yes I get very over thinky when I'm unhappy which is most of the time.Can I get my Fi surgically removed... it's ruining my lifeAero Chord,
Plan B,
21 Pilots,
Ed Sheeran,
Headphone Activist...

Mmmk that's all I got right nowYes. Yes I do want a hug. And some spooning.Yeah I think it has more to do with T-F preference than N-S

I make lots of comparisons and use analogies to avoid talking about Fi feelings. Analogies are useful in this way to convey meaning without feeling vulnerable. It's like water off a ducks back.I just like the word cos it has anal in it.Homo Sapiens have existed for 200,000 yearsNot me guv. That bloke was already loopy before I arrived - didn't touch him. I've got a solid alibi.Whatever it's a junk statement and means nothing if you frame it in reality.Oooooh that's just what I need, thanks

I guess I'm in denial about being ESTP. It doesn't matter how I fill in the tests it always gives me ESTP. I just don't feel very happy or comfortable right now since I'm also a recovering addict in rehab.

Uuuuurgh, character flaws. It totally sucks. I would usually just bang up some gear when I'm unhappy. But they insist we ask for hugs instead of drugs.

I like hugs.Festivals! They're just like turning reality into drugs, we can be friends. I need more hug dealers in my life!

I have Se denial... because I think so god damn much. But this means my favourite activities are things that turn the thinking off - guitar, skating, drugs, music (plus singing and dancing), driving, gaming (mostly turns thinking off)...

But all the rest of the time I feel like there's too many thinking occurring! I think that's why I developed some habitual use of drugs - it kills boredom and overthinking.

I dunno. I get bored easy, how about you? What do you do to manage overthinking? I'm in a addiction rehabilitation centre. Thanks for your reply - I can certainly relate to the Ti + Ni PTSD head when something has bothered me.

Just so ya know I'm gonna be offline for a few weeks as I've been unable to stop looking at ex's in Facebook ... so I'm handing my phone in to the centre later today after having left it turned off the past 2 days!

Obsession is a bitch.People have put athletics and sports for ESTP. And this is a very narrow view of this personality type (essentially a sensation seeking thrill seeker).

ESTPs are also great at taking drugs. Professional level. And tend to get competitive about how fucked up we can get. This personality type is commonly found in drug addiction treatment centres (I'm currently in one myself) ... so to comment on stereotypes... ESTP is commonly forming habitual use of mind altering substances. We are good at drug abuse.

Not just playing sports 24/7

Thanks, I wanted to illustrate that an ESTP is likely to work as a "promoter-artisan" and your friend running a photography business is a great example.Been there, done that, I've accepted it. I'm fairly sure that if I wasn't an ESTP I'd be able to get a different result on a type test. I can't get a different result plus I've questioned it extensively on this forum.

Acceptance is where I'm at.Opinions are like assholes. We all have one. ESTP is likely to get irritated if their logic is challenged... it would be an irritation.

What "exactly" differentiates my mindset? I've no basis for exact comparison. To be exact would require my direct experience. Perhaps you could provide a framework with which to build upon... What's your opinion of Te vs Ti in the context of knowledge domains?

What makes a theory interesting? Curiosity. I am interested in physics and psychology because I enjoy understanding how the world works and how people work but that knowledge is part of an internal framework and communicating it would be exhausting. I use my understanding of the world and people in daily interactions with the world and people.

You don't see intellectual aesthetics because, as explained, it would irritate the ESTP to engage discussion that can ntradicts or criticised our internal framework.

Understanding what an ESTP finds intellectually stimulating will never be black and white across the type. The nature of Se is about individuality - my situation and experience will be different from another ESTP and we will have different motivations. However there are frequently commonalities, such as a desire to learn guitar.You're irritating because you didn't read what I said. I've extensively questioned my results on this forum already.

I cross examine for confirmation. Your assumption is incorrect.Your assumption was that I had a superficial exploration. I have done an extensive cross examination. I have no interest in discussing the details so jog on.I studied computer science. I can build and overclock PCs. Technical work is not beyond an ESTP at all. It's common to find ESTP electricians, in construction, chefs.

Computers are about as complex as lego. Software can be tedious but learning to use software is similar to learning the rules of a game.

I hate programming because I'm lazy.You ask too many questions. Please prioritise if you want answers. I'd rather have a conversation than interact as if I was a knowledge base. Perhaps we can work out a better understanding by addressing key issues instead of exchanging a doctorate of opinion.Don't be retarded. You asked an explicit question with narrow focus and that conveys an assumption. I'm sure you're aware of the initial rhetoric as it is obviously a premeditated line of questioning.

The initial assumption you made that led to the line of questioning was incorrect.

Here is a quote of your presumptious question...

&gt; So you think a type test is the most precise and accurate assessment of a persons type?

No I do not believe a type test is the most precise instrument. Hence why I did a fairly extensive cross examination on this forum.

You are not welcome to analyse it.

Jog on.An authority?

The content was copied from Wikipedia. And I asked you to prioritise if you wanted help to understand my perspective.

This is a simple courtesy. If you're not extending it then I'm hardly concerned with your post. I'm not here to wipe your ass.

Basically (in laymans terms)... take a chill pill. I'm not going to write you an essay nor am I going to bother reading yours. If you can't respect that then jog on.

&gt; if you want types other than ESTPs to understand or be less stereotyping of ESTPs, that means bridging gaps in understanding, and it's not going to be a one-way process.

Hence why I asked you to prioritise. I'm not going to exhaustive detail. I have better things to do in summer ... I live near a beach.That's bullshit. Jog on.

If any of that were true you would likely have apologised for the impression you gave instead of continue in the exact same framing... casting aspersions. You haven't changed anything - you attempted to excuse yourself and shift the blame to criticise my interpretation.

You sound like a one trick pony to me.

Do you think you would react positively if addressed the way you have commented here?You're still casting aspersions. Do you understand?I can relate to about 26 of those words. So ESTP An opinion is subjective. If all my experience points toward X=2 then my inner logic dictates that it be true... but it is subjective because it is based on my experience - someone else could have a different experience.

Logic is not just logic ... in the same way feelings are subjective so is logic. Subjective means personal. My subjective opinion is tied to the subject (me).

However this is my subjective opinion and someone else might have a different interpretation of the word subjective.I have no idea how to tell if someone is Si Dom and that means I currently have the opinion that Se and Si do not clash... but that's potentially just a product of my perspective.

I think Se and Si just get used to each other? I'm trying to picture what an assertive and strict Si user might be like.

But I still don't understand Si anyway.

I believe I'm more likely to clash with another Se user.I disagree with the premise. I do not think mental health disorders affect functional preferences.

If you struggle to identify which functions you use... You're probably an xNFP. No offence ... I'm only half joking about that.MBTI is a self test. External indications of cognitive preference are unreliable.

So I think the idea is fundamentally flawed. If you think this kind of thing could work then I don't think you have enough appreciation for variance produced by cultural norms that affect how our external self is presented.I think it's common for Se to ego clash with another Se user. The typical one-up-manship situation.

I still don't have an appreciation for how Se and Si collide so I could be wrong here. Se vs Se seems way more likely to collide just because both Se users are engaging externally but sensation is subjective.

Se users can equally be "on the same team" if their motivations align.You sound more like inferior Ni than inferior Fe

Have you considered Se Dom?On what basis do you assume your Se "isn't that good"?

I acknowledge that you've written the suggestion into your post. But I don't follow suggestions unless they seem appropriate. And you have given no indication of "weak" Se at all.

The function stack has a driving seat. You seem to be driven to environments with lots going on. The secondary is a creative function. You use it to do work. The dominant function is driving and looks like Se to me.

But whatever man it's your life I don't care.I'm an ESTP with 142 IQ. I have re-evaluated my type and I did that for about a year. And I'm also a drug addict.

It's true that you don't know me.

Obviously.My girlfriend is likely INFJ. She loves to socialise but says that she gets drained by being around groups of people.

At the same time I'm extrovert and I don't feel drained by people unless they are terribly boring or frustrating to be around.

On the topic of your mother being introverted or extroverted... balance is key. It's useful to avoid black and white thinking. Every extrovert will want peace and quiet sometimes and everybi trovert will crave social stimulation sometimes.

MBTI delivers some classifications which encourage categorisation however personality is a complex topic. It's not as productive to generate a strong expectation of behaviours based on purported type.

And in terms of functions the social engagement is not the key defining difference between E and I. For example... My girlfriend likely meets with her mates more regularly than I do. She has closer connections with her mates. And in fact Fe is higher in her stack than mine. So it makes sense to me.

I'm older but definitely less mature.

So my point in this reply is to convey that any framework for comparison has many variables. Social engagement is an unreliable metric. MBTI categorises people based on functional preferences in the patterns of thought.

It's fair game to have doubts about typing. My experience is that I believed I should type as an introvert... but I can never get this result... and everyone I know tells me I'm too loud to be an introvert. So I just go with the functions. Behaviours is a product of much more than just functional preference and MBTI does not seek to define behaviour as a product of personal growth or experience. The test just picks up your preferences for thinking.I'm 33 years old and have tested my IQ at various points in my life. When I was 18 i took a test as part of a aptitude testing service where you go for career advice - this is the most official result as it was a service that was paid for. I managed to score 39/40 in a sequencing and pattern recognition test which the examiner exclaimed was the highest result they had seen in the time they had worked there. That component was a standardised IQ test with spatial recognition I guess.

I've also taken a Mensa test but it was just for fun. I wanted to know if I could join a snobby intellectualist community but couldn't be bothered to pay the fees.

Standardised high IQ tests exist online and are common. I've taken a few of those quick tests (but not recently) and for various reasons. Those reasons would be... Pride. Arrogance. Insecurity. Also because I like scoring well on tests... I wouldn't want to dress this up as something it isn't.

I have not taken an IQ test as part of MBTI typology.Well I do this social camelian thing where I'm mindful of the nuanced behaviour of others, their diction (choice of words or phrasing) and their focus (intent and interest). I use this (sometimes quite poorly) in an effort to relax the other person or encourage them to interact. It's a habit.

I can usually find a way to strongly relate to anyone. The consequence of this is that people can sometimes tend to feel like I'm hiding my true nature.

Which is kinda true.Football. Tennis. Hockey. Even things like nature programs and the discovery channel.

Media is targeted at people. If there are more sensors the chances are that they will be more sensor targeted media.

You might just not acknowledge that stuff if it's not in your interests.

But, speaking as an Se Dom, sports dominates a great deal of media coverage. News itself is a realist topic and grounded in reality. This isn't a counter argument I'm merely attempting to illustrate the bias in your statement as potentially misleading yours or others judgement on the subject of "media influence".

Plus... functionally it's a perception axis. Everyone has sense and intuition. It doesn't make me less creative if my Ni is inferior - that's a misinterpretation of how the stack works - it means I have less conscious control of the function.People do not typically wear Tshirts of their favourite politicians. It's simply not comparable to the level of social acceptance as sports. Plus I would say politics is a topic which involves realists and idealists. There were many posts on here half a year ago discussing Trump as a Sensor. He's quite big in the politics game.

I disagree with your opinion that musicians tend to be intuitive. I'm a musician.

Your opinion is unrealistic and again... it's an axis. Everybody has both ends of it. I'm Se Dom. I have Ni and I use it. It's a bit like a subconscious function but I can intuitively get to an understanding very quickly.

It's a common occurrence on these discussions boards for people to take a black and white approach. It's unrealistic and leads to bad accuracy. This is what I was alluding to and I have little interest in a tit for tat argument over S vs N and opinionated debate.

Fact is that one mans inferior Ni could have far more impact on society. Like Trump.My girlfriend is a INFJ and also an addict.Not everybody here understands the functional approach and some resort to stereotyping because they do not know how else to contribute. It's like a MBTI cheat sheet.

And my advice to those stereotypists is to learn what the individual functions mean. Behaviour is a product of thinking, feeling and personal experience. Jungian typology does not attempt to describe an individuals personal experience but does attempt to discern their nature.

Nature vs nurture. ESTP telling other people to study the theory more. Classic.Honestly I do sometimes finger gun people. I just love it. It's like instant awkward for people who care too much and instant laughs for people who don't take themselves or me too seriously.

I also dad dance for the same effect.Auto correct fucked me on the title ... i don't even ... it should read "please post your type and star sign".I am stupid with feelings. And I make stupid decisions trying to control how I feel.

People have told me that I'm smart my whole life. I have an IQ of 142. But I am aware that I'm retarded about feelings. I struggle to find the words to express myself sometimes yet I can quickly learn how to win most games.

And I can give other people advice but I can't follow the same advice when it applies to me.

I usually feel disconnected from emotion or I try to disconnect from it because I do not find a feeling manageable (positive or negative).&gt; You can post an opinion but I don't particularly care to debate any potential connection between MBTI and star sign. 

Correlations?

None. It's a general enquiry. Your response was predictable hence why I made this statement in the post.

Have you heard of fuzzy logic sets? I'm actually curious about fitting MBTI quadras to astronomy elements. I do not expect to find a correlation however disregarding an idea without investigation isn't in the scientific method.Awwww, did somebody piss in your cornflakes?

I suggest you work out why you're so angry about what other people do with their time and quit being such a huffy windbag.

Failed experiments are a key part of science. If I want to investigate something because I do NOT want to find a correlation how would the test be presented differently - unless I was attempting to bias the replies it would be presented in a identical fashion.

Don't try to do my thinking for me. You'll just end up looking foolish.

Lol. God bless your little closed mind.Yup.Desiderata - Words for Life

Go placidly amid the noise and haste,
and remember what peace there may be in silence.
As far as possible without surrender
be on good terms with all persons.
Speak your truth quietly and clearly;
and listen to others,
even the dull and the ignorant;
they too have their story.

Avoid loud and aggressive persons,
they are vexations to the spirit.
If you compare yourself with others,
you may become vain and bitter;
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.

Keep interested in your own career, however humble;
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.
Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;
many persons strive for high ideals;
and everywhere life is full of heroism.

Be yourself.
Especially, do not feign affection.
Neither be cynical about love;
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment
it is as perennial as the grass.

Take kindly the counsel of the years,
gracefully surrendering the things of youth.
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.
But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.
Beyond a wholesome discipline,
be gentle with yourself.

You are a child of the universe,
no less than the trees and the stars;
you have a right to be here.
And whether or not it is clear to you,
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God,
whatever you conceive Him to be,
and whatever your labors and aspirations,
in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.

With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,
it is still a beautiful world.
Be cheerful.
Strive to be happy.
Do you believe the universe is a random creation?

I don't have any astrology beliefs. I posted the thread out of general curiosity. Maybe you should get over it?Yeah this.

Inferior grip is exactly this. I'm ESTP and a drug addict with 1 year of clean time... During the last year of my using i was in the grip and essentially drugs stopped being effective for satisfying Se.

What does that mean?

&gt; Paranoia. The uncanny feeling that something bad will happen anytime soon. The inability to trust people around you. The impending sense of doom. Cannot appreciate the real world. Cannot be in the here and now. Nonexistent Fi or Ti. Recklessness.

and 

&gt; Harassing people to see their physical and emotional reactions

Pretty much sums up my behaviour. I would spend alot of time "crippled" and unable to get into action... or obsesively exercising / trying to take drugs.MBTI does not have the scope to describe individual knowledge and experience, therefore, things like culture are not described by mbti "personality type" behaviour.Behaviour is a product of both nature and nurture however MBTI seeks to define the cognitive preferences.Weakness is a misinterpretation of what MBTI describes.

The inferior should be a lower conscious function. So the dominant function is always on, the secondary is your creative (you can switch it on), the tirtiary is the relief function (used for feeling better) and the inferior is a subconscious driving force.

So like... my inferior is Ni and that means i have a subconscious intuitive understanding - which would be difficult to put into words if i wasn't so damn smart and capable of using my secondary (Ti).

So when you say weakness try to think of it as a subconscious driving force rather than a "weak" function. Because it *does* drive you.Thank you for the kinds words of support, bless your heart. Over the past year a lot has changed and i'm in a much better place. Unfortunately... once a drug addict - always a drug addict but today i do not crave substance abuse and the sun is shininig!You're commenting on a Reddit post about Jungian psychology. Nerd.And when giving birth.There's a few bits in here i disagree with.

In my experience the personality types that are only different by E or I get along fine because they speak the same language. I can usually communicate very well with another Ti user - it may be that we have differnet internal logical structures from our differnet experiences but this is not captured by MBTI and we can communicate effectively and are therefore able to compromise.

Real offence would be when some Fi user comes along and tells me how i should feel about something... like global warming... Then we have a Fi / Ti clash or a Fi / Fe or a Ti / Te clash and it becomes much messier to find compromise because we don't speak the same language.

&gt; Dominant function is that which is perceived as inherently valuable.

My dominant is Se... I can find many ways to satisfy Se however i get bored easily. So i would change the way you have described this to say that the dominant function is a driving force.

&gt; Auxiliary is perceived as a useful tool/means to better engage the dominant function. It can either be taken for granted as what one should do, similar to the dominant, or it can be an obligation one resents.

The secondary is a creative function. I agree that it may be used to assist the dominant function and that this would work well however i do think that this function serves a means to an end regardless of it's interaction with the dominant function.

&gt; Tertiary is perceived as a fun tool for better engaging the dominant function.

The dominant function and Tertiary will always be facing the same way - this makes it hard for there to be a useful function of these two parts together without interaction from another function that has opposite direction of focus.

To explain; Se and Fe wouln't do much without my Ti and Ni because the information is not passing through a filter for judgement or perception if Se and Fe are engaged alone.

&gt; Inferior is that which one has to sacrifice in order to better engage the dominant function, and therefore can be a source of insecurity (e.g. what am I missing out on by not using this perspective).

I don't agree with the "sacrifice" interpretation of a inferior function. The placement just means it is less conscious not weak. Control of it is less congnizant - that doesn't mean it is less strong or less of a driving force.

My inferior is Ni and i use it all the time to narrow possibilities down. I just sort of "know" what's up. Because of the interaction *between* Se and Ni

I hope this is helpful for your understanding - and i acknowledge that i may be wrong with my interpretation of the functions. I am attempting to highlight that these functions do not isolate nor is the dominant function the be all and end all of a personality type.Oh you didn't realise i was making a joke at both of our expense. We're both nerds. Deal with it.

Plus you wouldn't beat me at chess.The horsy moves in a L shape! You don't sound very old so it's not a massive surprise on the chess front.

How many times have you been arrested?Do you know what type you are?Haha, it‚Äôs ok - I‚Äôm not dangerously dysfunctional... not anymore anyway. I‚Äôm curious tho... what main character traits of INFJ do you relate with?

How would you describe the personality type from the inside?That's great stuff, thank you!

Traits i identify with... attention to detail - it's not always but if i'm interested in something i'll pay very close attention, competitiveness - playing to play well... i find it hard to play a suboptimal strategy or give someone an easy ride in any type of game situation, and i only feel sore if i lose because of playing poorly. There's something deeply satisfying abut using my hands to perform a task - for example i take great pleasure in typing or playing guitar just because it feels good to use my hands. And i enjoy acting / being centre of attention and entertaining people with overt gestures and over-the-top caricature type of piss taking.

I certainly know that my emotional state can be written on my face which makes for some interesting expressions during a poker game where i'm trying to control the broadcast.

And the gut feeling. I get a feeling in my gut where i just know something is up - can't explain it but it's been very beneficial to listen to that. It happens in a variety of situations... the sneaky suspicion that i know something i cannot explain - follow it and i could be wrong but at least then i know. It's like an itch that needs to be scratched.

Oh yeah... and lying. I used to lie all the time and think i was really good at it. But you can't bullshit a bullshitter!

Hmmm the other thing i've noticed is a social chamelion thing that i do. I'll mimic the traits of people i socialise with in order to egg people on or to put people at ease... or actually sometimes to put people at unease depending on situation. I find it very easy to copy body language or accents / little ticks people have.

Annnd impulsive behaviour / total inability to feel comfortable constrained to a plan. I prefer to keep options open and improve rather than feel stiffled by routine.Try having fun and doing what you want to do. Ignore the social stigma associated with dating and instead have a goal of enjoying yourself.

Repeat until you find someone you can enjoy yourself with and they don't ruin your fun.

That's a keeper.So i've had 1 on 1 counselling and the only major difference that i can see between my experience and the tape is that i wanted help rather than being reluctant.

The rest is spot on. Utter garbage came out of my mouth for a while. Followed by the counsellor asking questions and me walking away in a weird, reflective and baffled state.INFP. If you suck at analysing yourself it's always INFP.

Why? Because your thinking and intuition is all facing outwards (Ne, Te) and you can't come to any conclusions about yourself apart from Fi (internal ethics).More research and some testing...perhaps combine neuroscience with mbti?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxP-4_FjNxg&amp;t=39sHmmm. The comparison you‚Äôve made there between YouTube videos and a job interview has a few caveats to consider... the people in videos posted to YouTube will likely be more relaxed and feel at ease - or edit the video / re-record it. The job interview situation is quite different.

I point to that as to a reason why you would notice differences in body language. Especially if the videos posted to YouTube are intended to be engaging for the viewer.

The stuff you described about faces, social queue and interests suggests Fi to me. Also the stiff body movement suggests Se is lower in the stack (socionics stack includes shadow functions).

How do you think you would fare in front of a camera with a few hours of practise and potentially micro editing (very popular on YouTube).Those are exactly what I would expect from Fi... Fe is about external ethics and Fi is internally focused.

I do not have a grasp of how behaviour may be affected by autism however my understanding of autism is that you would fine it difficult to put yourself in the perspective of another?

I don‚Äôt think jungian psychology can adequately describe the effect. I would be very interested if you have any more information in this area.Have you looked at INTJ to see if you identify with this type?Surprisingly accurate. Might use as a cheat sheet for ‚Äútype me‚Äù threads.[removed]I'd like to gather some observations, if possible.

Hypothesis; As the psyche matures we must fall into a grip. The psyches ability to manage the grip and process data coming from an inferior and weaker aspect of our personality contributes toward maturity. As we improve our ability to manage the weaker parts of our psyche we gain what is widely described as maturity or depth of character.

Depending on the function stack this maturity may be expressed in a **different mode.** *I'm particularly interested in exploring this aspect*! - What do i mean byt his? The inferior function is different for different personalities... so i am particularly interested in finding some observations from differnet types about their experiences with the grip and getting through these times. *Remember to comment your type - mobile users dont see flair*.

From my own experience; i used to feel anxiety when gripping. But after constantly challengin myself and putting myself in difficult situations i developed a more mature responce to inferior Ni? I'd love to hear comment from other estp's on the accuracy of this bit.

Disclaimer; I'm not suggesting that a personality stuck in the grip is immature. But i'd like to see observations of this as part of a natural process. Is it required for maturation of the psyche? Do we mature faster if we are constantly challenged? Do we mature faster through specific challenges for specific personalities?

Do we all fall into the grip at some stage in our lives? Is it common?

I'm also interested in hearing any observations from those who do not think the grip is a real thing.

Thankyou for entertaining [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YFK1x9ZG_A).We've all had those moments when reality comes crashing down. Not always an accident... but those situations where your understanding of the world is challenged.

How does your type adapt to a new reality? Or perhaps this is not a type thing?

Define 'new reality'; You believe the world is a certain way. But it is not. How quickly do you adapt to the new reality that has been illustrated? Do you adapt to this new reality at all?

Concrete example; For an ESTP this might be when our logic has been shown incorrect. It tends to hurt more if i think i've done something stupid. It doesn't actually matter to me if *other* people think i've done something stupid unless i also believe it. This could be something relatively minor - like losing your phone.

But then what happens? I would analyze the mistake in my logic and try to make amends between the reality i see and the belief i have/ had. So the psyche accepts fault and corrects it's judgement? But what else can happen? Does the psyche behave *irrationally*?

[Here](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/) is a reference for the 5 stages of loss and grief. I'm interested in finding out personal observations of how your type might experience these phases of accepting a new reality.

---

Now that's the dark bit out of the way!

How about surprises... By comparison... how would you accept a new reality that was full of exciting potential / activity / atmosphere?

How quickly would you adopt this new reality?

Are there any phases to this acceptance?

Concrete example; A friend suggests you buy tickets for a music festival! How quickly do you get on board with the idea? How quickly do you implement changes? How happy are you with the new reality and expectation?

*How is this relevant to mbti?*

I'm primarily interested in the differenet observtions, of the processes of adapting to changed circumstance, from different personality types.It's painfully obvious to me that the /r/mbti troll is still downvoting my comments. And after posting this it becomes *more* obvious when the clique comes around to detract from the topic.

**Please note that the trollish clique have upvoted themselves to insinuate and convey a false perspective that i am selfishly motivated by a care for downvotes ... rather than what i actually care about; free speech.. and that they stop trolling people like peppermint.**

/u/komatik you have engaged me several times to detract from the content of my threads by insinuating that i have a vindictive agenda... which seems a little silly considering the way your clique have behaved toward /u/peppermint-kiss

Would you like me to post the content of your hangout chat in relation to peppermint? It's pretty disgraceful that you would stand by as people deliberately create multiple accounts just to harass someone over their personal S vs N typing. Echo chambers are dangerous things.

Anyway... we're going to talk about obsessions again!

**Have you ever had an obsessive hatred?**

Perhaps you have despised someone so much that all you do is think about them all day everyday?

Is hatred like this self destructive?

What would the subreddit suggest as a means of dealing with hatred (from the perspective of hating someone else, rather than being hated).

Personally, i have no problems that the troll wants to waste their time. Your clique must be getting fed up of how many times you ring the bat phone for their assistance. It *really* amuses me every time i notice the activity. I will keep bringing up the topic if i feel like it.

I have become interested in projected hatred.

&gt; Psychological projection is a defense mechanism people subconsciously employ in order to cope with difficult feelings or emotions.how much time do you spend listening to music?

how often do you listen to music?

how adventurous are you in your music tastes?

how often do you listen to favourites... and what makes a favourite?

what style are you listening to most recently?

*And what type are you... or perhaps you might speculate on the differences as you see them to be.*

Do you think this article is accurate for your type?

Do you find it accurate for other types that you know in real life?

Any comment / opinion appreciated (even if detracting from the article)... I'm posting this to ascertain validity.**Please be succinct and explain, rather than justify, your opinion. This is not a political debate. I would like to gather observations on how different types form a political opinion.**

When it comes to politics justification and criticism are common. I'd like to ask your thoughts without evoking the dissonant idealogical discussion. *But* i am very interested in finding out the primary way that people judge an issue. How the issue is percieved and judged.

**Please state your type**. It's helps to promote conversation about cognitive function. Some users do not see your flair.

**What is your opinion on the UK leaving the EU?** This is really an attempt to see if people support / do not support / are ambivalent of the decision. I ask you to be succinct to avoid long descriptions explaining individual ideology.

**How did you reach your opinion?** This is a self analysis question. I'd like to encourage people to comment on your perception or judgement - but there is no requirement for validation of your belief. What do i mean? There is no need to explain *why* your belief is justified - i'm primarily interested in how you reached the conclusion.

I apprecaite that this is probably a remote issue for many on reddit. But i am still interested in the perspective of those who are very distant to Europe!What are your experiences with learning a *physical* ability or skill?

This may be a craft, hobby, sport, cooking, physical career, or changing anything from one physical state to another (digestion doesn't count), technical skill (muscle memory), or involve theory (indirectly; such as an exercise routine, or method of learning manual skills).

How do you develop your skill? What process do you work on to improve?

What impacts on your enjoyment (positive and negative)?

Looking back... what has been the most effective physical skill (or perhaps the method of learning it) that you have achieved, in life, so far?

Also what are your main areas of interest in terms of developing physical skill? How would you compare your efforts at adopting physical skill to your efforts with adopting mental skill?

And what type are you!Which type of engagement do you seek most often... a debate of differring views or do you prefer to engage discuussion with complementary views?

I.e. what is your type and how do you prefer to explore a topic... with competition or with collaboration (or a mixture of these things).

I am naturally competitive and therefore frequently seek to engage opponents. However i am also highly persuasive and enjoy complemantary view points which support my perspective.

Also... 

If you prefer contest - how do you avoid partisan or tribalism?

If you prefer collaboration - how do you avoid partisan or tribalism?

If you typically engage a mixture of complimentary and opposing views - how do you make your case for a decision?

**What stresses out an ESTP**:

* Rigidly enforced rules
* Having to plan far into the future
* Feeling out of control
* Being asked to complete tasks without detailed directions or processes
* Large amounts of book work, theory, or writing
* Being forced to make commitments or plans before they‚Äôre ready
* Being forced to make decisions or eliminate options before they‚Äôre ready
* Having to spend a lot of time following someone else‚Äôs rules or schedule
* Being in a situation where they have to use a lot of theoretical or intuitive concepts
* Being around people who are excessively serious

When faced with stress, ESTPs tend to feel empty or hollow inside. Their first impulse may be to seek revenge for whatever has caused them stress. They may do this by mocking other people‚Äôs values, or becoming increasingly anti-social and disdainful of others. If they are in a state of chronic stress, they may fall into the grip of their inferior function, introverted intuition, and become a ‚Äúdramatizer‚Äù. When this happens, they may do things that are completely out of character for them. They may lose their naturally easy going, agreeable character and begin to have fearful fantasies of the future, ideas of impending doom swirling in their minds. They may begin to assign big meaning to small occurrences, and become preoccupied with the meaning of life and the future of mankind and the universe in a way that is usually filled with gloom and disillusionment.

**How to help an ESTP that is experiencing stress**:

* Give them space initially or directly after the event.
* Listen to them. Understand that they will likely be irrational.
* Don‚Äôt tell them how to fix it. This will only make them feel more helpless.
* Give gentle affirmations or encouragement
* Help them sort out their priorities, paying careful attention to their feelings.

**Misplaced and/or Misdirected Introverted Thinking (Ti)**

By misplaced and misdirected, in this context, I‚Äôm referring to ways in which the function is conducted that obstruct one and/or others‚Äô wellbeing and growth. Some instances may be within what would be considered as ‚Äòunhealthy‚Äô and ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô. The following are only a few of the ways in which the Introverted Thinking (Ti) function of a person is misplaced and/or misdirected:

- *Crippling perfectionism*; having high standards and aiming to be and do well with them can be great as long as it‚Äôs not paralyzing and keeping from making the necessary ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô to change and improve where it‚Äôs needed.
- *Senseless fault-finding and nit-picking*; focusing too much on what is wrong and losing sight of what is right (or highlighting what is wrong for no good reason and more often than necessary) can be both harmful and stagnating.
- *Endless questioning*; questioning is important and recommendable to find and create solid foundations and constructs, but if it keeps going incessantly, it can needlessly break or impair the solidity of things.
- *Endless hypothesizing*; hypothesizing is important and recommendable to come up with new ways to look at things and fill the gaps, but if it keeps going incessantly, it can leave no room for the facts and how things are truly like.
- *Destructive and unproductive battle of wits*; intellectual conflict may form doorways to exploration and clarifications, but if there‚Äôs too much emphasis on proving one‚Äôs intellectual superiority and another‚Äôs intellectual inferiority, many opportunities to learn will be lost.
- *Insensitive and disrespectful prodding*; it‚Äôs one thing to take interest in another person and participate in light teasing to get them to open up about matters, and it‚Äôs another to be pervasively insistent on getting someone to share about themselves (by pushing buttons and more) when they don‚Äôt want, need nor have to.
- *Dismantling and reducing to bare minimum*; in exaggerated efforts to be ‚Äúdetached‚Äù and ‚Äúimpartial,‚Äù stripping objects and subjects to the point where they lose their meaning and significance.
- *Overvaluing intelligence and logic*; believing intelligence and logic (in self and in others) are all that count and having little to no patience or appreciation for anything else not only lacks compassion - but also leads to a distorted and incomplete worldview.
- *Severe distrust and negativity*; not that being happy-go-lucky is always that much better, but many worthwhile people and experiences can be missed (or even tainted) if there‚Äôs a strong predisposition to think the worst of them.
- *Projection*; assuming they understand others when, in reality, they‚Äôre only attributing their own motives and intentions to others.

You may recognize one or more of these in the use of Introverted Thinking (Ti), from a smaller to a larger degree. Once you become aware of these, you‚Äôre more able to replace and redirect this function in more positive and constructive ways.

- *Excessive possessiveness*; seeing others as extensions of themselves and feeling entitled to limit and to shape them to their own will, without much or any concern for what others truly want and need.
- *Excessive protection*; keeping others from making decisions on their own and from living their own experiences by instilling worries and fear where they‚Äôre not due.
- *Lack of boundaries*; meddling, intruding, giving little to no space or privacy - no matter how uncomfortable they‚Äôre making others.
- *Overextended service*; doing too much ‚Äúfor others‚Äù when it was not asked of them, when they were clearly asked to stop (several times) - and then resenting others for it and expecting and demanding in return.
- *Overbearing pride*; believing themselves to be superior and more deserving of validation on the sole basis of having better ‚Äúsocial skills.‚Äù
- *Condescension*; believing they know better what‚Äôs best for others when, in fact, they don‚Äôt - and forcing their views onto others.
- *Projection*; assuming they understand others when, in reality, they‚Äôre only attributing their own motives and intentions to others.
- *Falsehood for unmerited inclusion*; tactically lying and delivering half-truths with the intent to persuade and convince themselves and others of someone‚Äôs ‚Äúgoodness.‚Äù
- *Falsehood for unmerited exclusion*; tactically lying and delivering half-truths with the intent to persuade and convince themselves and others of someone‚Äôs ‚Äúbadness.‚Äù

I've copied this here for comment and to spread information that i find accurate.Do you have an example?

Explain your reason(ing)!

My response; typically i would make the effort to explain something - but that doesn't mean people will listen. Lying about details is dangerous and risks an argument appearing inconsistent. If we don't have long and i need to get you on board tthen yeah... i'll formulate a perspective that is consistent but potentially not accurate. And then convey it to you.

But if you piss me off i'll lie to serve my agenda or dismiss the irritation.

Edit; accurate truth is a core value.Do you Get intrusive thoughts? Which function do you associate with your intrusive thoughts.

Also; how emotionally mature do you consider yourself to be? For the purposes here emotional maturity is described as the ability to control ones feelings (I.e. Avoiding thinking about bad things).

And what is your type - plus how confident are you of your type assignment?

Intrusive thoughts can be positive as well as negative. To provide example of positive intrusive thoughts; having a crush on a friend.

This thread is about impulse and impulse control. I'm interested in hearing other people's perspective.Tool.

I feel a special connection to their music. I find great satisfaction in the interesting time sequences, the intense melodies and also the subject matter of the lyrics.

[The Pot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW0j0smt8fY) - this song is about hypocrisy.

[Lateralus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbxwg4rwtN0) - "ride the spiral to the edge, we may just go where no-one's been." The Fibonnaci sequence found in nature. The song also references [this religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism)

[46 &amp; 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSKEJC9WoQw) - references the shadow functions in Carl Jungs work, also depicts the understanding of our psyche as being the next evolution of humanity - 46 chromosomes plus 2 more.

I'm interested in a discussion over what type Maynard is. However i do not agree with the vague internet search that turned up INFP and then INTJ... these seem innacurate to me for various reasons but i will expand on that later.

Also a side project that is a full band "a perfect circle" - [Outsider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ROOXWxAmE0) - http://genius.com/A-perfect-circle-the-outsider-lyrics - That song is about ... Fuck ... well i equate it to depresssion. The entire album is about the 12 steps of addiction.

Don't just google the MBTI and believe that he has been typed correctly.

Tool lyrics include referencess to Carl Jung's work, the Fibonacci sequence, as well as a whole host of moral and philosophical persepctives thrown into the mix. The depth of logic and emotion make it challenging for me to decide.

&gt; "I choose to live and to,

&gt; Grow, take and give and to,

&gt; Move, learn and love and to,

&gt; Cry, kill and die and to,

&gt; Be, paranoid and to,

&gt; Lie, hate and fear and to,

&gt; Do, what it takes to move through." 

My questions; 

What functions does Keenan use? 

Is it possible to type a reclusive celeb? 

Can we separate the image from the personality?

Edit; For reference - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_James_Keenan

---

Edit 2; It is possible that typology may not work through music due to the collaborative paradigm.I like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/PluLUXJ.gifv) for ESTP. But feel free to suggest others or claim it for another type.

Some others that make me giggle;

http://i.imgur.com/VWiT1lo.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/lyNiiYP.gif

This thread is entirely about people individual tastes and might not be that MBTI relevant. But meme away guys! I found an excuse to have a meme thread. May the meme be with you.

http://i.imgur.com/TExZWnq.jpgWhilst looking at tattoo pictures today... i found [this image](http://i.imgur.com/HV18mXl.jpg) with the following quote;

&gt; No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.

&gt; C. G. Jung

Which i found surprising since this hints at a theology. Even more interesting to me is the way Jung has incorporated some wider interpretation of theology to identify abstract principles of the mind and well being.

That we can "fall into the grip" of inferior or shadow functions could be identified simply as evil. Or a person in need of prayer, meditation, comfort. "The devil is in them!"...

Footnote; i'm also aware that religious belief and good versus evil has been used to persecute... however i am more inclined to follow the wider trend across generations and the mindset that evoles in society.

Anyway.

Looking into this quote i found [this article](https://np.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1plfxl/defending_jungs_analogy_of_a_tree_with_its_roots/) on reddit with a good look at what Jung may have meant with this quote. There is an analysis of the original text in the link above... I will pull out some quotes from the reddit post to show the conclusion;

&gt; Rest assured, Jung was not a practicing christian in any form, and he was not guiding the reader on how they could go about reaching Heaven in their personal lives. Instead, in the chapter in which this appears, Jung is psycho-analyzing the symbolic and mental archetypes of Christ, within the minds of practicing Protestants. Essentially, Jung is de-constructing the psychological manner in which Christ is received by Christians as the template for their own self identity. The title of the chapter in which it appears is, "V. Christ a Symbol of the Self"

&gt; Jung was not discussing Hell and he was not talking about Heaven. He was instead making an analogy between the mental archetypes of light being opposite darkness; particularly about how those archetypes manifest in both traditional, christian symbolism, as well as theology.

---

And why is this relevant? Well ... i find it interesting. Social dynamics reflected in the social values and traditions we maintain.

So like... as a discussion point... do you think morality is tied to personal development? 

Perhaps you consider it's more about social structures like religions? 

Or perhaps morality is built into our survival mechanism and natural instinct as a social species?

Hah... take that N types. I can theory. Bored now.I love this YouTuber... [How to Apologize Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvAPVhdRaJ0)

But can we separate the image from the personality?

How would you type this person?

What functions can you tell are being used?

Do you think the YouTube personality differs from the actual person off camera in a significant way?

I have followed this guy for quite a while - his first few videos were satirical and based on the concept of trying to do an activity or review whilst stoned on Salvia. He would inevitably collapse and enter head-space on camera. I think he still does this type of video sometimes?

But that's what the Captain Salvia references are about.Rules;

1. Has to be something you actually own but i don't care how you purchased or might share it..

2. The DVD/BOOK/CD has to be one of your older favourites and one that you're recommending to someone because you want them to watch it.

3. No porn (PM only please). This includes 50 shades of grey.

4. What is it about that film that you wanted to show the person? (attention; spoiler alert)

5. Feel free to talk about BOOKs or MUSIC instead of DVDs (but i was originally thinkin of DVDs)How would you define social status? What is it a measure of?

Do you care about your status in society?

How do you see your social status? What observations do you use to confirm your status?

Please post any interesting stories or observations of personality and social status.

Or if anyone fancies having a go at a direct question; why do i have a love / hate relationship with social status? (i like the idea of social status but despise the rules and regulations most people prescribe toward building a social status).So the modern interpretation of fascism used as a perjorative would indicate a intolerance to competition.

This encapsulates the whole philosophy in essence - because national socialism is the protectionist industry and pushing a pride identity in your fellow nation and brothers. Mobilising for war is similar to the SJW approach to activism. Not exactly Ghandi, right?!

Interestingly fascism is a combination of left wing and right wing doctrine.

So it's evident when challenging a social justice warrior to observe their conflicting ideology. I woould like to make the comparisons n between fascism and social justice warriors based on the fundamental qualities.

Obviously it doesn't make sense to see a person as a nation. So there is an abstracted pattern things going on here.

So is this an intuitive thought process or a sensor - Ti user thought process? Or what do people think of the opinion?

Feel free to remove this one mods! &lt;3

I'm. Baked. This is my conclusion after going away and arguing with progressive liberals over Brexit. It's not a formal study.

Basically they're fascists. And Hillary Clinton is a progressive liberal.Please recommend an online IQ test that is comprehensive / accurate / recommended / whatever... gimmie your best.

Post your result if you want to (and your type).

I did [this one](http://www.free-iqtest.net/) at work a couple of days ago and scored 138 (yeah it's been slow at work). I kinda wanted to see if there were more comprehensive tests or what the general consensus is since i already know i ahve an advantage in pattern recognition (and i'm thinking maybe htis test awarded me unfairly).

I've scored higher on a iq test before mind... but over a decade ago and i heard that you lose IQ over time? Edit; plus i remember the test i did at age 18/19 was heavily pattern recognition related but i scored 39/40 lol. The woman who reviewed the results with me was flustered about it!

This is not massively mbti related but i'd be interested to know what results other personality types have scored on whatever tests you feel like recommending.

I think it's a good practise to report what you scored on a test you're recommending - but let's not have criticism in this thread. It's not for dick measuring (plus i already set a high bar so *come at me bro*). Ok it is for dick measuring just don't be a dick to people.

Don't be trolls in here cos MA BLOCK LIST IS LONELY

[Musical reward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnTZa4FY_7I&amp;list=PLlVBiZI7cjxiVPA4tk22NZM-mI9EOccsL)s for anybody who clicck baited in here and doesn't feel like palyingI just realised something whilst sitting here with my wake and bake (morning joint).

An ESTP might not recognise the difference between feeling sorry for something and feeling guilty. But they are different. I can feel guilty about something that i do not feel particularly sorry about. This has something to do with a conflict of loyalty.

If you feel guilty and sorry then it's regret, right?

If you feel guilty and not sorry... what *is* that? Being a dickhead? (to give an example; acting out of your interest despite loyalty to another person)

It's actually a challenge to work out how i feel about things sometimes. Since i am action oriented i would tend to get quite confused if an activity requires me to know how i feel about something.

That's tough.

I think that part leads to discomfort with commitment. It's taken me about a month to reconcile feeling guilty but not feeling sorry. But it'ss not even the first time thatt i've gone through that process this year! lol

With a fair amount of venting (bitching about my frustrations).

Yeah.

Any thoughts?

I'm not trying to suggest that ESTP are totally immoral and can't tell teh difference between tehse feelings. I'm saying tthat it might be a sstruggle and take a bit of time.

This was a result of looking into the dimensionality of functions as suggested by /u/Kalinali

http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Dimensionality_of_functions

ESTP has 1 dimensional Ni and Fi functions. So i am trying to suggest that this is why i struggled to resolve the difference between feeling sorry and feeling guilty about something.

Guilt doesn't necessarily equate to regret. Due to conflicting loyalties (in the example that i haven't explained this is consistent).

Posting for thoughts! Does this makes sense to anybody without a concrete example to back it up (i don't feel like sharing).

[Musical rewards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OyytKqYjkE&amp;list=RD7OyytKqYjkE&amp;index=1) for anyone who click baited in here and doesn't want to play with my balls.

Play with my balls.As title. Serious topic. But no massively serious. Just meme serious.

Whatever guys.

Take a seat. Right there. Now... *tell me about you mother*...What makes ESTP a good negotiator? Why is ESTP said to be the closest (functionally) to a sociopath?

I believe that the inferior is mostly responsible for providing direction... I'd certainly connect Ni to my lack of ambition. But here's the thing about mbti... intuition provides a framework which might compel action ... but most would think it's an impulsive Se thing ... but for the purposes of this theory we will describe Se as an observer. It is the sensation information reporting into the brain and forming perception. The information regarding detail is combined with the direction provided by intuition in order to take action.

There is also the judgement axis but i'm primarily interested in perception for now... so the context here for an ESTP is to discuss Se-Ni where Intuition is the boss and sensation is the agitator despite the functional preference which places Se in a slot with more dimensional reach (dominant function has the largest dimension)..

Se-Ni can act on the perception (or judgement) framework provided by Ti or Ni ... The interaction between Ti and Ni might even be problematic (observed in several theories). Ti-Ni dysfunction is identified in most problem that involve some form of delusion. These are internal frameworks and they can become divergent from reality.

So this leads me on to the speculation which gets reiterated, that ESTP are the most like a sociopath. My question started with... Why ESTP? This perspective is repeated in literature but the disposition is not validated. Creativity is connected with **intuition** but also **madness**. It's a common phrase to talk about the nuance between genius and madness. This leads me to assume that the connection for an ESTP and sociopath behavior is that an ESTP *might* be prone to going loopy trying to flesh out their 1 dimensional Ni function. And this lends itself to the stereotypical conspiracy nut job picture (in my mind).

But more than this... the fact that Ni is the inferior function explains the impulsive behavior. The recklessness ... and i think that many people would perceive the thrill seeking behavior as madness. It also explains some of the defense mechanism i have noticed in my own psyche. 

---

**Hypothesis**; madness is a product of intuition. Intuition being an ESTP's inferior function means that we can attribute many of the negative aspects of the stereotype to intuition rather than sensation. Which seems appropriate to consider. I doubt that an Ni dominant psyche would struggle to control their intuition... But if it's the inferior it could cause all kinds of bad resolutions.

**Generic hypothesis**; The one dimensional nature of inferior functions causes a whole host of personality stresses. Understanding your weaknesses can enable a better resolution from inferior functions (avoid depression).

---

Socionics describe two 1 dimensional functions for ESTP. Ni but also Fi. Which might explain the other thing that seems to resonate with many ESTP. Commitment phobia! But more than this ... i wanted to suggest that Ti can validate accuracy and detail but it's an effort to use it... Fe can enable depth of communication and relieve stress than might evolve from faulty conclusions of Fi or Ni ... this is one of the reasons that many ESTP do not display their Ti... stress relief comes from Fe and Ti requires effort.

**Any thoughts on this analysis?**

Any information welcome relating to function dumensionality! 

Edited for a correction and extension.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvaRcDvGPck

If at all possible, from this video, i would like to collect *your* observations and analysis on the functional use of the two speakers in this video. I do have some assumptions but i don't want to muddy the test.

Some other questions;

Which speaker do you prefer?

Why do you prefer that speaker?

What would it take for you to switch sides?

What type do you think each speaker is (or which functional axis do you think they use)? Any typology analysis welcome!

---

Also feel free to comment on the topic of the video (as people usually do).

This is primarily a thread asking for you to contribute with **functional analysis of the speakers**. However feel free to analyse their topical position as well. I am interested in the topic (but it's not mbti relevant).

Also if you don't care about my random question threads... don't bother to post a comment saying that you don't care. Because i don't care that you don't care. So it is redundant.

Principle stattement; Research Links Heavy Facebook And Social Media Usage To Depression

‚ÄúBecause social media has become such an integrated component of human interaction, it is important for clinicians interacting with young adults to recognize the balance to be struck in encouraging potential positive use, while redirecting from problematic use‚Äù

According to the questionnaire results, the participants used social media 61 minutes per day and visited various social media accounts 30 times per week on average. What made the study alarming was that more than a quarter of the participants were classified as having ‚Äúhigh‚Äù indicators of depression. There were significant and linear associations between social media usage and depression whether social media was measured based on total time spent or frequency of visits.

Why would heavy social media usage cause depression? The exposure to ‚Äúhighly idealized representations of peers on social media elicits feelings of envy and the distorted belief that others lead happier, more successful lives,‚Äù says the study. People that engage in activities of little meaning on social media makes them feel like they are wasting time. Spending more time on social media increases the exposure to cyber-bullying, thus causing feelings of depression. And social media fuels ‚ÄúInternet addiction,‚Äù which is considered a psychiatric condition linked to depression.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the April 1st issue of the Depression and Anxiety journal. University of Pittsburgh staff and students Jaime E. Sidani, Ariel Shensa, Ana Radovic, Elizabeth Miller, Jason B. Colditz, Beth Hoffman and Leila M. Giles also contributed to the research.

**Posted for thoughts and comments.**

Also because i'm thinking of quitting Reddit entirely. Rejoining my ESTP brothers IRL. Obviously i have internet addiction - and i am Se dom with addiction problems all over.

So don't be surprised to see me / not see me. lol

But i wanted to share this with others and collect reflections on the use of social media and how it can be good and bad. I have witnessed much negative proaganda this year, as a Britissh guy, with Brexit and the current controversy over the US election.

It reminds me of when Tony Blair took us to war with Iraq. World events have taken more and more of my interest away from MBTI anyway. But contributing on reddit in political discussion shas got to be one of the most soul destroying "losing faith in humanity" acitivities a person could ever engage in.

Oh shit i missed the first 2 levels of my leagues game typing this.A while ago i encountered censorship on reddit.

After trying to raise debate and awareness, on Reddit, that climate change is a hoax (http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/#77ef481d7187) ... all the threads were moderated away (without informing me) ... i messsage the mods and recieved a series of 72 hour mutes from /r/videos, /r/TodayILearned, /r/AskAcience and /r/ExplainLikeIm5 ... which was essentially how the conversations were closed. No discussion - simply "we do not tolerate this topic".

But now they've shut down /r/pizzagate

This is pretty serious. A cover up of high profile politician peadophile ring in national governments. USA, UK, France, Norway... it goes on. And reddit closed the sub.

The CEO admits to editing users posts.

And Julian Assange is missing. The news is completely censored - none of the mainstream channels are carrying it despite wikileaks failing to publish anything PGP signed to validate identity.

I mean they stopped using Tor to publish... which just reeks of "commandeered".

In terms of /r/mbti ... i don't think i'm gripping. Here's some news...

And so i am outta here. This is a farewell post because i've hung around here for some time. You can find me on facebook at 99PercentNews which is just some bullshit i decided to make because 90% of the media is produced by 6 corporations in the US.

The US government just admitted it covered up JFK. It's time to start seriously considering how fucked up your government is.

Peace out.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s5zIw7XtsI'm a drug addict and currently going through a treatment centre for addiction. They tried to send me to rehab and I said no, no, fuck it okay...

I want to know if there is a link between addiction and personality type. Please do not forget to post your mbti type (even if you are abstinent).

I also welcome comments if you are clean or have never abused substances. Alcohol counts as a recreational drug.

I am interested in the following;

1. What is your primary drug of choice?
2. Do you habitually use drugs? (habitual use implies that you cannot stop)
3. What mbti type do you test as?
4. What are you experienced with addiction to other activities (gambling, sex, video games, exercise, etc ...)

Extra credit - If you have been in a drug rehabilitation centre please comment on the success or failure of your rehabilitation.Photo Thread! Get your sexy ON.

Post a pic and show off your face, wearing some stylish clothes, or a favourite group photo with friends! ... (public forum so clothes ON please... but feel free to PM me naughty nudes).

This is for science reasons - remember to state your type if it's not attached to your flair.

I have recently shaved my head, lost the hobo beard and pinned a bunch of shit to the wall in the hall - http://m.imgur.com/9jqAdAdI wanna know about the ESTPs in your life... what are they like? What do they do (jobs)... And how did you learn their mbti type?

This is a serious thread for serious people. (the ESTP subreddit is less active than all your gym membership cards).I used to believe that religion was a old fashioned structure of governance... a way to keep communities moving in a Good Orderly Direction. But now I think it's a useful way to hack your brain and change moral values.

What do you think about religion?I'd like to know more about the similarities and differences of these two personality types.

If you have a good understanding of these two types please compare and contrast them in this thread. If you have used a website or tool to frame the comparison please source it.

I am interested in exploring the upper stack differences between Se-Ti and Ti-Ne and the manifested thought patterns / feelings / behaviours.

Lower stack stuff is equally relevant - don't be shy!

I would also like to know personal experiences of INTP's looking at ESTP and vice versa (ESTP's looking at INTP). Please keep observations of personality types respectful!

INTP; Ti, Ne, Si, Fe

ESTP; Se, Ti, Fe, Ni

Yes I still have Se denial. No I can't get the mbti test to give me any result other than ESTP. It's a serous discussion thread.

And feel free to PM me your tits.Hi /r/mbti... Let's talk about this stereotype.

According to Myers-Briggs, ESTPs are hands-on learners who live in the moment, seeking the best in life, wanting to share it with their friends. The ESTP is open to situations, able to improvise to bring about desired results. They are active people who want to solve their problems rather than simply discuss them.

According to Keirsey, ESTPs, or "Promoter Artisans", are the most adept among the types at influencing other people. Promoting is the art of maneuvering others to one's position. Concrete in speech and utilitarian in action, they are smooth operators. The ESTP knows everyone who matters and everything there is to do because they are very resourceful, always knowing where the fun and action is. They like to indulge themselves in the finer things in life and to bring other people with them. Their goal in life is to sell themselves and their ideas to others. Dramatic and debonair, they are gifted at earning others' confidence.

I'm an ESTP. I don't do sports. don't get me wrong... I *can* do sports ... but I don't. Instead I do things like play guitar, study scientific theory, study psychology, and I am a drug addict (currently 6 months sober).

I've posted the above as guidance about ESTP characteristics for anyone who is interested in a better profile than "ESTP is sports".

Have a nice day.[removed]Which MBTI type grinds your gears, presses all your buttons and ultimately displays to everyone else where your personal growth and personal development is lacking?!

That's an intentional catch 22 question to allude that if you frequently get rubbed up the wrong way... it's probably a you problem and not a "them" problem.

Answer with caution![removed]Quarantine got me still going to work as i work in IT at a hospital. Not the kind of IT doing remote support unfortunately.

Being quarantined inside the quarantine when i get home from work. And this is where i feel the stress. No sex. Gf treats me like i have black death.

Sleep in separate room and masturbate. Stay at home hub! Glad we have lots of toilet paper.

Slightly removed from that have been destressing by laughing at random crazy americans using the #fakepandemic as quarantine efforts directly contradict personal liberty embedded in US culture. This is hilarious.

Nearly 2 weeks into quarantine have started using reddit again after some years of not. Also downloaded hearthstone on my phone. I feel the need for a platforn to relieve stress.

Hi guys.

Go fuck yourselves.What happened to cause your PTSD?Se grip... *wink*

It‚Äôs interesting to me because I find sex relieves stress ... but my gf (believe she is INFJ) has also started cooking, cleaning excessively, exercising, eating ... and too anxious to do sexy time.

Probably because I‚Äôm still going outside (working).
ESFJ are super obsessed with protecting the people around them;
the downside is that they don't realize that sometimes they CARE way to much about non-senses.

actually a good description for them as parents is that they are that parent who ALWAYS takes care of everything because they don't want you to stress.&gt;why do you think that we are easy to type?

actually I find it pretty hard to type other ESTP especially if it's one who is good at stuff like art(chances are that i'll type him as ENFP for example). 

i feel like we are one of the hardest to type especially because we are able to adapt incredibly fast in any kind of circumstance.&gt;A quick fix mentality and strong improvisational skills cannot always compensate for the long-term disappointments resulting from shortsighted planning. 

i feel like the disappointment is far huger when you plan on a long-term, because you tend to take into consideration, as real, things that are pretty unlikely to happen


I just won't read thatI'm 21 and I really felt it happening to me over the last yearI'm a male ESTP, borderline F, my girlfriend is an INFJ, borderline T. I know my mirror match is ISFJ, but that's close enough.

We both enjoy the way we live life in different and complementary ways. I really love to be able to be more contemplative with her, and she has told me she loves how I can make an adventure out of anything. Even though I feel like I would greatly enjoy a relationship with, say, an ESFP girlfriend, it would seem a bit harder for me to consider settling with a type close from mine than it is with my current girlfriend.1. ESTP

2. Male

3. I tend to respect people who achieve great things and can make initiatives. So that's more of a ExTx thing i guess. Also, same as OP, I prefer to be told the harsh truth rather than to be lied to so I don't get hurt.

4. ESFx are so much fun, they are great people to be around

5. I'd love to date an ESFx, but I have more trouble considering settling with one. I'm currently dating an INTJ, I sometimes wish she was a bit less of an introvert (she scored 100% I when she did the test) but apart from that it's going well.

6. I imagine myself married with an IxxJ for sure. I couldn't stand an xNFx on the long term though. More about his later.

7. Turns out I've had great connections with ISTPs, ISTJ, INTPs (when they're not too much of an obnoxious nerd), ESFPs and ESFJ, more than with other types.

8. ESFP &amp; ISTP. INTP make me laugh, not because of their jokes but because of their personalities. They are fascinating people.

9. xNFx tend to get on my nerves. No, not everything is great. No, I don't want to imagine what the world would be if we all loved each other. It's never gonna happen so there's no point talking about this.

10. That's ENFJ for sure. Fuck, those people are always debating on stuff, lost in their ideas, completely out of touch with reality, and the worse is that they're actively seeking debate, because of their ENxx. You can't even tell them that you don't care or that they're annoying because then due to their xxFJ, they're gonna try to make things better so they can make sure that it's nothing personnal. Also they seem prisonerjs of their own feelings. Sorry for all ENFJ reading this. Here's what I want to tell you : I don't share your passion with debate and abstract thinking, and the fact that I disagree with you or that I don't want to take part in debate doesn't mean I don't like you as a person. If I didn't like you I wouldn't be hanging out with you in the first place.

More generally, S seem to get along well with other S. Same thing for N.ISTJ - Angela MerkelLove them. They are adventurous, with strong values, but also friendly and don't seem to seek attention. It seems that one has to "deserve" being friend with an ISTP, but once it's done I feel like I can build a strong bond with them. We'll just get each other, and won't feel the need to demonstrate affection because we don't need it to know we like each other.
My girlfriend is an INFP too, but I'm an ESTP, a bit different I guess. Anyway, the things I feel like aren't the same between us are the she isn't someone who just DOES things, she delays and moderates, and there is no such thing as delaying or moderating things in my diccionary. She is also kind of not earth-to-earth sometimes, and that isn't good too. SP are realists, you have something to say, say it, we hate bullshit, we aren't going to overthink things or theorize about them, what is, is (apologize for my language). Also, she enjoys alone time more than I do, but that's about the E, since your boyfriend is an ISTP, he probably enjoys that too. 

There are a lot of good things though aswell, I could spend hours talking about the good things, but in terms of personality, I can just say that she balances me.

Hope this helps!I eat anything that shows up in front of me. I also eat a lot to bulk up, sometimes I eat 1kg of food as an afternoon snack, like a big steak, eheh.I'm an ESTP and my girlfriend is an INFP. She isn't that much earth-to-earth, she needs alone time often and she doesn't always sign up for my craziness, and she is reserved sometimes and doesn't want to talk about personal stuff. Those are the bad parts. Good parts are basicly everything else you can imagine, really, they're awesome, go get her tiger.Oh, you have NO IDEA of how feely and lovey dovey I get sometimes. I am the NEEDIEST person on Earth and I need cute texts, cuddles, hugs, kisses, among other stuff.. All the time.. And I'm pretty much a thinker here! And I'm a guy.. Anyway, those things stimulate our minds!We're together in that bruh, but as soon as I start thinking those things I say to myself ''oh you and all that bullshit again'' and I stop thinking of it, and if it comes back you just have to use that inner shout like ''SHUT UPPPPP BRAIN''.I do care about her, I love her, and I always miss her when she goes on alone time or doesn't feel like doing something. Anyway, I have other distractions too, I love combat sports, specially MMA, and I can't wait to get in an octagon and throw out at another guy like an animal. I pretty much would risk my own life for a couple minutes of pure fun. Adrenaline, violence, fun! We have a crazy nature. Anyway, you'll love being with him, and he'll love you too, everything will be fine! Now go and surprise that fella with some love! And remember, we are people with no moral restrictions nor barriers, so, be bold! I'm not much into hardcore adrenaline aswell, but when I start to feel stuck, I have to do something crazy! We don't like having nothing to do! At least I..That's a nice one right there mate, I can say that in my case it's the complete opposite, if I don't have people to be with, I start overheating. I love combat sports, and I tell this all the time, and I have a boxing bag in my bedroom, but I barely use it, because I'm alone when I do it, it's not the same thing, I need people around me. If I start being alone too much my inferior Ni starts coming up and oh boy I hate that mf! 

Anyway, I suppose any Ixxx would want me to respect their alone time, huh? I guess I can do that, even though it kind of costs me that I know that I could be talking to her or with her doing something but she's on ''alone mode''.

ESTPs are described as bold, insensitive and impatient, so that might not help aswell I guess.Well, I guess that she does that, a lot, maybe even way too much. But INFPs are the best anyway, I love them. Except that sometimes (everytime) I'm a bit impatient and insensitive so I hate it when she takes her ''alone time'' randomly and have difficulty understanding it! Anyway, if she needs it though, I understand her point, even though I don't like it, I accept it. I guess that I really do, but since it's Summer not many people want to do ''things'', they rather have their asses settled in the couch while it's 40¬∫C around here! Anyway, sometimes I do stuff with other people yeah, but most of my friends enjoy videogames way too much and I got tired of those already to be honest, but no one signs up for crazy new stuff.We're together for 4 months and a half already, I'm guessing that isn't much. Anyway, you're right about bigger groups, I can tell that she is exhausted by parties, specially if the night becomes boring or she becomes mad for any reason. INFP are highly avoidant of criticism and conflict as you might know, and when that happens I know that she'll need the time..I need time to think too buddy! I just don't spend my entire days thinking or not talking to anyone, God I would find that impossible! I WOULD DIE! Like you said.. Anyway, I guess it's just diferent ways of getting energy from both sides!I can relate what you're saying to her, like, totally! Sometimes she even refers alone time but she never did it directly like ''I need alone time'' or something, she just vanishes. Anyway, I can understand that not everyone is like me, so I understand and I hope that she appreciates yes, because for me not having someone to talk to is.. frustrating ahahahAhhh yes, I can totally relate her to what you're saying there! Whenever she goes to parties or something, the next day she vanishes from all forms of contact, even more than a day sometimes. Anyway, I've also noticed that she avoids confrontation a lot and procastinates a lot (not only problems), which kind of annoys my impatient and confrontational personality. I like to solve things as fast as I can, I'm a doer, I do. But I guess that yes, I have to understand that part of the Ixxx!I can understand what you're trying to say there, pretty serious shit to be honest as it seems, I hope she doesn't get mad that I try to reach her in her alone time! Anyway, it's difficult for me to understand such a thing though, but I guess that I have to understand it even if I can't understand it! Sometimes even I need alone time, if I'm around people for too long I'll overcharge and go nuts. I like going nuts though, it's fun!Oh. My. God. I do the exact same thing with my girl! If she says that she isn't feeling so good, or she's cranky or whatever I say like ''Hey, why don't I grab some food and go meet you and we'll *watch some TV*'' and then she always says that she doesn't feel like right now, or can't, or whatever and I'm like, that doesn't make any sense. Well I guess that for her it makes sense now, it all makes a bit more sense now! 

She also tells me sometimes that she's grumpy/cranky and that she needs a lot of cuddles and kisses blablabla, and I'm totally okay with it too. 

She always loves to be with me though, that's the part where I fail to understand. If you love to do something, how can you MODERATE it? MODERATION is a word that has a null effect for me, I mean, why? Anyway I'm sure it has a reasonable explanaition!Thanks for explaining it with words that I can understand ahahah :)I think her alone time is pretty random, but even if it's random she knows it's happening, and yes, she should warn me. I don't see that as an xxxJ approach because she can just tell me in the moment that she doesn't feel like talking and that's it, but vanishing is just not acceptable damn it ahahahI guess that's the most simple, fair and at the same time best way of solving this thing! I'll talk to her.I like alone time too even though I'm an extrovert, but it's not that kind of alone time, that's too much, if I need alone time I'll just say ''I'm going to take a dump'', I'll go, sit on the toilet thinking for 5 minutes, flush and come back fresh! The only downside is that I waste water over nothing I guess.. Anyway, I can still totally understand your point! And nice quote by the way!That honestly just wouldn't work for me, I'm a sneaky horny machine so if I'm close to her I'll just start charming her and acting all cute and lovely among other stuff if you know what I mean, anyway, she doesn't like computer games either. We've tried it with movies but.. I guess you know where it led to.. It's a nice suggestion, but it wouldn't work for me ahahYou're welcome!

Anyway, 5 minutes alone is more than enough for me, I like having people around to keep my mind busy from things, positive people of course. I also love being alone with the girl that I love and wouldn't replace it fo rnothing. Going out at night, meh, I never liked parties much, my fun is on training to be honest.It doesn't make much sense to me, but I understand your point! When family visits me or I visit family I get bored too, I need people but I also need excitement, boring ass talk just bores me, so when they leave I'll probably go hit the gym or judo and that heals me a lot mentally, but it's because I'm around with people and have a world to play with in my mind!I guess I really will, damn it *cries*

I admire your diplomacy with your boyfriend though!I've always been nice to people no matter what, I never criticise or argue really hard with someone. If anyone tries to criticise me, I ignore the innocent fella and carry on with my life, he knows not of what he's talking. If someone tries to argue, I'll also ignore them or just give them reason, I don't mind, it doesn't change me!Desiigner - Panda.. I know, I know, it's not a big deal but I just like it ahahahI got broads in Atlanta

Twistin' dope lean and the fanta

Credit cards and the scammers

Hittin' of licks in the bando

Black X6... **YOUR TURN MAN KILL THIS THING**I really do feel that way when I'm alone for too long.. Thanks for making me understand this!Then what? [Flaired]Oh okay ahahah, I thought you meant for me to flair my question! But yeah, envrionment based energy, definitly a sensor, thinker, even though his tertiary Fe gets him sometimes and a perceiver, judging is hard on those scenarios! At least that's what it looks like to me.Hello. I'm an ESTP dating an INFP, can any of you explain why do you need alone time or that kind of stuff? I'd like to understand the why better, non-scientifically. It annoys me that sometimes she doesn't feel like doing stuff for days, or procastinates or avoids coming online to reply to messages. And then she comes back like if it's nothing, I don't get alone time, really.It's pretty much what's in the title, fellow ESTP here who think that F.W. is ESTP af. This just came to my mind so please help me while I do ESTP stuff! Which means superhero stuff!

Thanks y'all!
I usually dance, play drinking games, and talk to just about everybody.

I think I personally fit the stereotype of being the party. :)When I was getting into the theory, Se was very easy to notice. My main struggle was Ti vs Fi. But I kind of noticed when my Fe would come up sometimes.sup people! (19/M/California) 

- I really like having variety in my life. I have a wide variety of interests, but none that I'm specifically too deeply in to. I usually try everything once and I'm down for new experiences.

- I like listening to music a lot! I listen to just about every genre, but my favorite genres are Hip-Hop, EDM, and K-POP.

- I enjoy going to places where there's a lot of activity. Music festivals, concerts, the beach are all fun. 

-My main hobbies are listening to music, dancing, eating. I've recently gotten into photography as a hobby as well. 

- I have many friends and acquaintances, but I lack very close relationships. Despite having many friends and acquaintances, I consider myself as an independent person. 

- Although I consider myself independent, I feel most vulnerable when I feel like I'm by myself and alone. I don't usual open up my emotions, and I'm VERY emotionally secluded from others. 

 I'm able to see both sides of an argument very well, and because of this I find it hard to pick sides and make important decisions.  

- Whenever I'm bored, and need to go out, I always try make plans with whoever is available. I consider myself very loyal to people who I am close to, but at the same time, I sometimes flake on my friends when better opportunities arise or I'm just not feeling to hang out with them.  

- Academically, I'm currently a psychology major, but I have an interest in sociology, political science, international relations, etc. I don't really like math. I like the ideas and concepts of science, but I feel like learning it, and going very deep into science would be very tedious and boring.

- Socially, meeting people is personally difficult, but there's just an addicting adrenaline during the process. I'm very open and talk to everyone, but I can also get VERY quiet and aloof, but at the same time paying attention to the people around me. I like keeping the vibes fun and enjoyable. I've also been told multiple times that I am the life of party. idk how, but I mean I guess! 

**Se-** *"What should I do today?" "Wow I'm so bored right now." "Yo, do you hear the beats of this song tho!" "It's really hot....." "It's really cold..." "What is that obnoxious sound?" "I think this guy is gonna merge in my line without signaling...MOTHER FUCKER CUTTING ME OFF, I KNEW IT."* 


I don't know how else to describe it other than LITERALLY living in the moment and in the present. Like I'm aware of all the details around me, and if not, I'm paying attention to what I'm focusing on at the moment.




**Ti-** *"Oh..so that's the reason why this happens." "I mean I understand their argument, but at the same time...." "What's the fastest and most efficient way to do this?"*


I take a very logical approach and just about analyze everything I perceive through sensing.



**Fe-** *"Hey this person looks sad." "Do they look like they're having fun?" "I feel like she's trying to get my attention?" "This girl totally likes me." "Wow the vibe here is so tense, let's make it more fun."*


I'm able to size up the vibes and atmosphere of people. I can get a basic view of how a person is feeling based on their outward appearance but that's about it. Probably has to do with my sensing as well. 



**Ni-** ....I really don't know what this is. LOL. Even the descriptions of it are hard to comprehend. Help? **Q1: You and your friends are going on a road trip!
a.	How you feeling?**
If it‚Äôs a place that I think would be fun and exciting, then I would be definitely hyped. If it‚Äôs a place that im not particularly interested in going to, then I‚Äôd just be indifferent about it.
**b.	What are you looking forward to, if anything?**
I‚Äôm looking forward to having a good time with everybody and the experience of the road trip and fun vibes.  If we‚Äôre going to a different city, I‚Äôd be looking forward to what the city has to offer. 

**c.	What are you nervous or worried about, if anything?**
There probably would be a few ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios that would come into my mind along the trip, but im sure I‚Äôd probably brush it off and hope it doesn‚Äôt happen. If it does, then I guess we can just deal with whatever problem arises.
**d.	How do we prepare for this thing: what should we think about beforehand, and what should we leave to chance?**
I‚Äôd say the most important thing would be the main important parts, like where would be sleep and see if we can book a place to stay in advanced. I think it would also important to think about the weather in advance just to plan accordingly. Minor stuff like where to find gas, food, we can just deal with that when we have to ‚Äì I mean Yelp is a thing. LOL
**e.	What kind of problems might arise, and how should we find a solution?**
The biggest problem would probably the car breaking down. If it happened in the middle of the freeway then im sure we can call triple A to fix it. Sucks for the plans though. 
**Q2: Your friend or sibling wants you to meet their new significant other!
a.	How do you feel about that, and why?**
If it‚Äôs a really close friend, I‚Äôd be happy to meet them and anxious at the same time. I want to know what they‚Äôre like and how they are together, etc. I‚Äôd be anxious if I end up turning into a third wheel.
**b.	 What situation(s) would make you feel most comfortable, and what would make you feel most awkward?**
I‚Äôd be comfortable in a situation where we all are having a fun time ‚Äì experiencing something together while being able to talk about it at the same time. So a situation where awkward silences doesn‚Äôt occur. I‚Äôd feel most awkward if I feel I‚Äôm being ignored throughout the meeting and feeling like a third-wheel. I‚Äôd also be awkward if I don‚Äôt get along well with the SO.

**c.	What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally approve? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?**
It would probably wouldn‚Äôt take me too long to approve/disapprove if I‚Äôm able to comfortably meet SO. I would only tell my friend what I think if they ask me. And if they ask me, I‚Äôd answer honestly what I think.
**d.	What (and how long) would it take you to decide you totally disapprove? Would you tell your friend/sibling, and how?**
Although it‚Äôs ultimately up to my friend on their decision and it is their relationship, I‚Äôd probably mostly approve. However, if I feel that my friend is being taken advantage of or if the SO just doesn‚Äôt give me a good vibe; I‚Äôd tell my friend either way if they ask. However, it is ultimately their decision.


*whenever i take an only mbti test, i usually get ESTP, lately i've been getting ENTP. I'm not sure if I use intuition more or sensing, because i feel like i use both interchangeably depending on the scenario. The only think I'm confident about is my Thinking is &gt; my Feeling.
**What do you consider yourself in a religious sense?**
Atheist

**Are you Gnostic or Agnostic?**
Agnostic

**What are the reasons for you being atheist?**
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - White Space Man

**Is religion important to you?**
Religion's accompanying cultural customs such as devotional singing, festive holidays, social gatherings, etc. are a positive part of my life, so I guess that would mean by extension religion does play somewhat of a role. Being an atheist is also important not because I view it as dogma, but because it is a reflection of what I try to do with my life, that is, use logic and reason to make decisions and build my perceptions of the world in which I live. 

**Have you ever changed your belief in your life?**
Yeah, I very recently went from hoping (but still doubting), and then atheism.

**Why did you change your belief, what led to you to it?**
I had a random realization that the only reason I was still holding onto the idea of a God was because of fear. Fear that life really isn't fair, that there is nothing after death, that once your loved ones are gone you're never seeing them again, fear that we really are alone in the cosmos, fear that the control I have over my life comes from my own agency, the actions of other humans, and well, fate (probability, chance...)

**Have you ever argued for your religion or against?**
Yes (against the existence of God)

**If you do argue what arguments to you tend to stick too?**
That religion is a myth, just like Zeus, and that the 'holy books' were just a codefied collection of the laws of the land that time. That the people that wrote those books knew less about our physical world than fifth graders know today. Mind you these are common atheist arguments that I didn't come up with because I'm not smart

**How do you feel about religion?**
I think humanity would be better off moving toward normalizing secular and atheistic ideas. I can see how, on an individual or community level, religious participation offers benefits such as having something positive to hold on to, a sense of belonging, etc. 

I abandoned all of that because I'd rather swallow the 'bitter' but freeing pill of truth that remain comforted by a delusionPretty much what I can say about my older sister, who is an ESTJ. We have a lot in common in terms of thinking-type interests, like discussions about x,y,z and sharing opinions...but then we disagree and it gets ugly. 

Whatever deep relationship we had has been destroyed, mostly because of destructive and stubborn ESTP ways. Lol, I'll fix it thoIf I had to pick a type I hate the most, probably ENFP or any other type that is too harmony-centred and that fear rocking the boat. I have known too many ENFPs that have shown themselves to be extremely conflict-averse hindering any sort of relationship growth or improvement. Bury the truth, if it means everyone's smiling at the end of the day. Dislike that very much.  Interpersonal intelligence.

Not what I expected but I do read non-verbal communication well.ESTP 19Best, maybe. I personally prefer not to lie in my personal relationships, because the truth is*much* more interesting even if it's incendiary. Heh. Lol, not intimidated by any type here. But can be annoyed at some over others.Lmao.

Avoid it and go do something physical. 

If sadness persists, intellectualize the issue and address it **right away** if it can be fixed. Oh look, it got worse!

....avoid it and go do something physical.

Less creative/insightful? How so?Fite meI tend to do that faux intimidation, blindsiding thing when I first meet someone of the opposite sex that I find interesting. If they can keep up, I seriously can respect that and maybe this conversation should continue. If they can't necessarily, it's no big deal, thanks for playing and maybe I will get to know you a gentler way, but it probably won't be sexual. 
27/36 bahaha, way better at this irl and with contextI've known 3 infjs pretty well, and they were very trusting, in an almost biased way (assessing situations with a healthy dose of cognitive dissonance).They were not really open to the other side's views, dismissing them immediately as utter idiocy or evil, whereas I would learn as much as I could about the other side, understand the argumentation and see if it holds up. They were kind, giving people who enjoy reading and writing. If anything they may have thought me a bit flighty..top kekBecause we are disconnected from people's deep waters. Engaging with everyone, everywhere on a superficial level cuz thats whats fun. (Also kind of a defense mechanism i guess.)

The feeling of detachment from others to the point of examing people as systems and tools and actors and reactors means you can better rig the game in your favour. Being detached means we are less adept at understanding what others are feeling, and can have tunnel vision to only focus on your immediate goals - to get better as an individual all the time. To win. 

Doesn't make us sociopaths per se, just more focussed on realities and observable truths? Fellow ESTPs, correct me if I'm wrong. This is how i am anyway. Being quick witted. Or any intelligence, ffs. General awareness of world events. Very oriented toward self-improvement. 

I have a friend that recently shared she didnt know what ISIS was. We arent friends anymore.I relate most to SHITTERS CLOGGEDENTJ males. All of them.Right?!  ;o i would agree with you, but I haven't met any male INTJs that I know of. But I would like to. 

Nah, not just because of that. Not knowing what ISIS was just symbolic of her not knowing what ANYTHING was, beyond greys anatomy, of course. 

We had less and less in common as we aged. Unfortunately. Haha saaaamee. I feel like I'm ISTP. Is possible to be ISTP but just also be good at and enjoy mastering people/conquering my immediate environment (i.e. E stuff)?

But i also use my Ti WAY more than my Se, atleast I think so. And I'm not a very social ESTP at all, but I want to be. Idk man.Pls confirm or deny estpLmaoooo yeah sounds about right.Hurry up.R u ok:( sry m8Intelligence = 8
Attractiveness = 7
Inflation = 0I don't owe anyone shit.Even if we are very attached, our protective mechanism is to scorch the earth. Delete everything, cut and run. Its absolutely pathetic but we try to seem tough, above it all and productivity-focussed when emotional back and forths are unproductive (which they probably are)

But using emotions can be productive, as in causing a situation to be addressed to clear the air or discover truth etc.
Parents divorce. Sister and I stayed with dad. Dad is awesome cool wow super nic3. Mom...would make promises and break them. Blue jays tickets mom? Day of the game, she's no where to be found. So growing up with that experience over and over:

TRUST NO ONE

BE READY FOR WAR ALWAYS 

Lol no but seriously, Ive truly forgiven my mom for leaving us, but i dont really get along with her well. Dad on the other hand is ENFP, and despite me scaring him for some reason, he's done a great job trying to understand me. Cool dad, awesome I think I walk around with a stern/concentrated/squinty face that I'd bet can turn people off, but as soon as conversation sparks I try to keep it lively and engaging, with an offbeat joke or two.

Making people laugh makes me feel like I matter, which is why I will make a concerted effort to "put on a show" to win the favour of bosses, relatives, friends, romantic interests etc. 


Take a deep breath before you go on the offensive.

Not everything is a do or die battle, defending your honour.

Stop moving so fast. Be careful.

Tell us that you're going to disappear if you do. Atleast tell us you're leaving your phone in a shoebox.

Why is there a hole in the wall?I don't know, I think I give some of my ENTP relatives some solid competition.Lol. That happened with my uncle recently. I did get a tad frustrated because instead of debating the 'thing' that we were debating it turned into a rollercoaster of unecessarily fluff - anecdotes about how good he is at computers, theories, hypotheticals, etc.

 And yeah I do zone out because if you can't deliever on the communication side of things your message is futile to begin with. Also when i try to lead my uncle back on topic, he gets frustrated and thinks he's better and knows all because once he fixed a computer and once he got a job here and maybe if clinton did indeed have classified emails on her server...lol

Interesting though. And probably the most fun ;)Can confirm. Am socially introverted but not socially inept.

I (was) depressed not too long ago, but am doing better now. It was mostly a lot of irritability and isolation and distraction. **MAGA**Work in government as a public policy analystLearned that reality is constantly distorted and the truth is stranger than we all think. Hobby gift is cool. That's really nice of you to do that for him. I am sure he will appreciate anything as long as it seems you made a genuine effort, which quite obviously you are.What about great all year, and super great one day?Ah, gotchya. I'd agree with that.I aint your goddang diddly yang meathead, pal!Interesting. Never really liked comforting people. Any other ESTPs who don't like touching people or being touched? I enjoy my personal space being free from intruders, and I like having enough space too wind up a roundhouse upside the head if need be.Edit: Nice to see I'm not alone. Also, being called a "snugglebunny" doesn't sit right with me, lol.Lol I wanna get in on this. I'm fucking ready. Shit myself at work Shit myself at work Martial arts. Gym/outside jogging. Lift. Making music. Reddit.No one yet. Send help.Don't forget you have ti. Im estp, and work in public policy. Its not rock climbing errday but I love the analysis and every new sensational experience is just swapped out for new information. Ah, exhilerating.***P R A I S E***Lol. Implying you can't do both?Shadilay, brother!!Peace be unto those who sing the praises of KEKAlso, the "alt right " is a contrived boogeyman pushed by the lamestream media my man. Kek represents freedom, strength, glory, unity and divine providence. He empowers every human, believer or not, too reach their full potential. Peace and love through Kek folks. Pepe is his messenger.If you were really an ideological libertarian, you wouldn't be disgusted by others choosing to partake in x activity if it doesn't involve you. Because people like to make jokes and feel part of an online community, you're disgusted? KekYou weren't owned. Don't be intimidated by Se. Don't succumb to defeat so easily. Ah. I did entirely miss your point.Wish I was an ESTP on a crazy mission to save humanity due to divine providence. Like channel the donald. That's like the ESTP wetdream.

*NTJ, ISTPYeah, cause he's outing himself as a bigot, transphobe, xenophone amirite. I was being sarcastic. Should have added the obvious '/s'. But he aint "brave" for saying he likes Donald trump lmaoB urselfAnd don't screw over others.

Tell dank jokes, the people like that.

Oh and slay mad bitches


Lol joke but in all honesty, live in the moment and make yourself a priority.  Love yourself, share that love with others. Constantly self improve. You have control over your reality, even if you don't know it.NoHm thanks. Yeah you're absolutely rightI feel like if I were perfectly emotionally healthy and not worn down by the wear and tear of life, I'd be the quintessential ESTP.  Like that me is down there and motivates me but my actual actions are akin to a depressed intp or something. As ESTP as I thought I was, I'm not sure if I can relate anymore.  Granted, these are fun stereotypes but damn. Is there such a thing as a friendless ESTP?What kind of help are you looking for lad?I took the test based on what I think the "ideal human" would select, and got ESFJ. üòÖBy ideal I mean high on altruism, outgoingness, self-confidenceIt's because my mind changes, abruptly and without warning. Not committing is just easier for everyone involved. But I get what you mean, when I'm with someone who prefers to sketch the night out in advance, I do my best to engage their fantasies. But if I end up really not sticking to the plan, don't take it personally and just roll with itMy boyfriend is an INFP. 

I'm ESTP.

I like ESTJs because they plan cool shit to do, ISFJ, INTP and for romantic interests ENTJLolLol yea ESTPs can be really cringy. ENTPs can be super cringy too though. Like we get it. Ur edGy ANd CoOl bRAhWell i just retook a bunch of tests telling me I am ENTP but there's no way to know for sure. Leave me alone to die.Mines for ESTP, yours can be ENTP. ;)ELI5?Which one am I?

Thanks.Do all dad's have the same DNA? DaDNa?ESTP: I genuinely, wholly, do not care.Same with me, except I thought I was an ESTP for years... I still don't know though lolMe tooOopHow old are you now, 14?As an ENTP, I feel like I want to be adopted.Same lmaoSameWhat about girl ENTPsTook this and got ENTJ lol. Maybe I changedI didn't become an ENTP until adulthood.
Yeah I got here just to say absurdity but /u/Vatimus is already on that. Everything is just silly-stupid. Welcome to the fam. 

I think I've got a weak P; I happen to like a certain amount of order, and I found it was a pretty good fit for me. 

Definitely biased to XSTXs. Ns struggle at the lower levels but they can do alright if they tough it out. Pfft. nope.I'm always amused by the perception that we're so mercenary. It's an odd combination, because ESTPs IME are entirely genuine in presentation, simply because we're not complex creatures. Like you said, our inner world is empty--What you see is precisely what you get because we do not really live in our heads in any sense. 

I was told once in high school--the only thing predictable about me was that I was reliably unpredictable. Seems accurate enough.ESTP, F, 27. 

How YOU doin'.I hate to love ISTP men. Strong, silent, lone-wolfy types that tend to make me weak at the knees. Never ends well, though--they are better suited to being lone wolves than they are to relationships. Prone to thoughtlessness and occasionally selfishness, although they're highly capable and knowledgeable, they can be unreliable. They won't do something if they don't feel like it; it's insanely hard to win their loyalty. 

Female ISTPs I like better. More level-headed than feeler women are prone to being, just as sarcastic and cynical as I am. Willing to do crazy shit for the adrenaline rush but also more than happy to tell someone when they're being a dumbass.Agreed, but it's rare. The most dysfunctional ISTP I knew was friendly when it suited him but mercenary to friends, family, and everyone else when it didn't. 

I've also met ISTPs who could be very loyal, but it was an incredibly short list of people and it took years to develop that trust. Can confirm. Am intelligent and accepting, but also downright obnoxious if I don't keep myself in check. 

Really, though...the obnoxious bit wouldn't be so bad if everybody else just got as intelligent and accepting as me. ;)I loved it for all the wrong reasons....

I was quite bright and (thankfully) didn't have to try very hard academically but still achieved pretty high grades on tests, although I'd often half-ass projects. Got better with age. 

Although I wasn't ever popular, I had a handful of close friends in most of my classes and loved the social aspect of school and activities. ESTP. We don't get sad. 

Ok for a serious answer: Distraction or fixing the source. I suspect I've had short bouts of depression a time or two in the past, but I've been able to move around it or through it through determination when I can and turning my attention to other projects when I can't. I'm beginning to think either I'm an ESTJ in disguise or I'm just a very kind-hearted ESTP with a moral backbone. ESTP. It's pretty dead cause we're usually out doing shit.Situation, execution, evacuation, lol. 

True to my type, I work best when I can show up, perform a task, and leave. I love drill weekends with the Army cause it's a lot of "sit around and bullshit" interspersed with "get this job done." 

The most taxing thing about it is my ESFP squad-mate who's more interested in gossiping or complaining. 

My ISTP friend is great though--we go knock out some work and she laughs at all my dumb jokes and terrible stories. 

My ENTP 1SG is a spacy but fun goofball and I end up surprising or shocking my ESTJ 1LT by either a well-timed zinger or blowing his expectations out of the water. I personally hate being the center of attention, although I like being AROUND people. Sometimes (about 50/50) only from a distance. There are days I don't actively want to interact with anybody, just observe, which (although I test extreme extrovert) strikes me as much more introverted. 

So.....maybe?Some XSTPs are occasionally prone to antisocial traits, but I don't think I've ever met a depressed XSTP in my entire life. I should know. ;)#Truth.Dumb ESTP: doing rounds of the most disgusting shots conceived and goading people into fist fights. Likely getting cut off or thrown out by midnight. 

Smart ESTP: maintaining a healthy buzz, flirting shamelessly, and trying to manipulate other people to doing dumb shit that gets them cut off or thrown out by midnight. Oh yeah. Also military, but even before that, there's always the idea of good, SAFE fun (I don't drink much, personally, so I'm glad to play babysitter or DD)..... But, that's also highly dependant on personal morals and values. 

We're gonna push the buck as far as we can, WITHIN that moral framework.Get yourself an ST female friend. ;)

But really--

STs are really socially adaptable. We're great to have along at social gatherings cause we're not as fussy as NFs and SFs can be (but only on their bad days!) and we're more grounded than NTs, so we can be a great catalyst for mixing people. STs in general are very pragmatic, with STJs being more rules-and-conventions focused and STPs having a bend towards the free-wheeling-occasionally-bordering-on-adrenaline-junkie, but we're nearly always easygoing and engaging which makes us excellent for mixing up different groups of people. 

I'd say NFs are probably better long-term, close bosom buds, due to their idealism--pragmatist types and S's in general are notorious at putting the work in to maintain close friendships (if it's out of our immediate perception, we kinda forget it exists)--but it's great to have an ESTJ or ESTP in your rolodex cause we're social butterflies without as strong a tendency to turn to meaningless chit-chat like SFs are prone to, and we're unafraid to insert ourselves into new social groups. Better not be sensitive, though---STs as a rule are blunt to the point it's annoying sometimes.  

TL;DR: STPs = Awesome wingwomen, leaves something to be desired for supporting, caring friendships!I don't feel unloved. I think I'm a conservative ESTP, if that makes sense? I believe that all that most of us can hope for is a happy mediocrity because nobody is special, so I might as well have a good time while I'm here and enjoy life as it comes. 

I've got certain areas of pride-I'm a quicker thinker than most and have always scored off the charts on standardized testing (top 1-2%) but in other areas of my character I'm definitely average at best.

I'm drawn to niches in which I can try new or exciting or funny things and help others at the same time. Joined the army cause it sounded fun. Decided to try a different career several times. On Friday nights I used to pick up drunk college kids after the bars closed cause I wanted them to get home safe and I also found their stories hilarious. Just kinda whatever seemed fun or interesting at the time. 

I'm a decent friend--I've driven several hours to pick somebody up from the airport or come through when somebody is in a pinch, and I find I get a satisfaction out of both offering assistance and shaking up an otherwise monotonous or routine day. 

I have an admittedly small, boring everyday life, but I can make a good time out of anything and enjoy running errands with a friend or SO while chatting and offering advice on their problems if asked. I'm casually known to have a good, level head on my shoulders and emphasize practicality as well as honesty and personal satisfaction. I've thought I might be borderline ESTJ from time to time and it's the closest one I test to besides ESTP, but I'm *not* a planner, procrastinate like it's my second job, and tend to be pretty live and let live when it comes to people and their choices. (I believe anybody can do, date, screw, or feel however they want, but it's important to keep in mind that everything has consequences and those can't be escaped. That's something that I came upon with maturity, though).

I used to be much more impulsive as a teen but in the last 10y I've channeled it into a happy enthusiasm for whatever I've got going on, as long as I shake things up in a big way every few months or change careers every few years. Probably being stuck or trapped. I developed an immune deficiency for a while a few years back and it sapped my energy and strength for several months. I grew very depressed both from the lack of drive and inability to do my usual activities-i couldn't go to the gym without being exhausted for days and having intense pain. 

I find myself scared when faced with authority figures whom I find overly demanding and harsh. I experienced some DV as a kid and learned that my best recourse was making an exit, so if my "escape rope" is unavailable when I'm under duress it causes no small anxiety. 

I prize my freedom above many other things. I'm happy to compromise for friends, job, or family but only when it's by choice and entered into unpressured.Hmm. Some of that fits. I daydream some but I don't think more than most folks. And money has never been that much of a drive for me; as long as I have enough to cover my bills and have a little bit of fun here and there that's all I ask for. (I cover my debts but I'm not much for savings). I don't know that "whimsical" is a good description; I'm enthusiastic but grounded and have been called an odd combination of bubbly and dry.No idea, I'm still fishing around this Enneagram stuff. How would I determine it?I know more about MBTI than I do Enneagrams, so I went into my first few tests blind before I started doing some reading. I've read that women often get mistyped as 2s but it's overwhelmingly consistent and discrete regardless of the test I take. I'm just not a 7 or 8 like many ESTPs. My second score is often a 3 but it lags far, far behind 2.

I think the scores are probably accurate; I've got the bold and sometimes impulsive adventurer streak of the ESTP but I'm also tactful, tolerant, warm, and probably too patient with other people. 

I'm just sort of looking for a clearer picture, if anybody has fictional examples or resources. Again still relatively new to this Enneagram stuff, but it's intriguing. Google hasn't given me much to work with.

Edit: the more I kinda think on it, I do have a fairly strong Fe which might be the MBTI explanation for the 2w3. It still just kinda caught me by surprise.ESTP here. I appreciate your perspective on this type. I'm all for a good armchair philosophizing session every now and then, but where I see a big divergence from N types is that XSTPs are, to their core, a ridiculously practical type. While I'm happy to discuss theoretical outcomes or hypothetical methods to politics or game theory or anything, you can bet your bottom dollar the XSTP will point out the implausibilities and impracticalities with every course of action or twist in the story. 

Although we're given to moments of flightiness or adrenaline, the part that often makes us successful at some of our crazier exploits is a very acute assessment of reality and people. Even when going through imaginative exercises that doesn't disappear.Don't. Just don't. There's no more arrogant and stubborn type than an Ne dom in the heat of an argument. 

And this is probably my personal experience clouding things, but even if you can get the upper hand for a moment, they tend to get incredibly defensive and if they don't have the presence to just dismiss the argument (which you should absolutely let them), they go for an ad-hom below the belt, and it damages the relationship. 

If it's anybody you care about on a social or personal level, let them win and just keep a healthy distance. 
Oh man I wish I could have this floating above my head everywhere I go...

Thank you for posting this!Came here to say just this!Yep, I'm Catholic :)

For a non-religious answer, I think religion has been incredibly important to me, especially as an ESTP.  We have a tendency to evaluate things according to our own moral compass, which is why I've found my faith so important.  Before I really embraced it, I'd go back and forth between things, justifying what I wanted even though it probably was wrong.  My faith gives me an objective foundation, so instead of my flawed self evaluating and justifying what I do, I have my faith to guide me with objective morals that come from God, who probably knows what's right and wrong better than I do.
